<hr>


<p>Head injuries bring more than 400,000 people to hospitals every year. Approximately three-quarters are diagnosed as having 
suffered a mild to moderate injury - injuries that can be subtle, persistent, and potentially long term. </p>
<p>Demographically, three quarters of the survivors are males, one half of whom are ages 15 to 34. They are the &quot;go for the gusto,&quot; 
high speed, consumers of alcohol who are going to live forever and who dominate ERs Friday night through Sunday morning and 
the Monday morning arraignment calendars. From a public health perspective, alcohol abuse training, roll bars, air bags, and 
helmet protection for motorcyclists, bicyclists, skateboarders, and skiers are top priorities because the number of TBI survivors 
is not expected to significantly diminish over the next ten years. </p>
<p>The most challenging aspect of representing TBI survivors is that many times they suffer minimal outward physical manifestations 
of injury. These patients are told they will recover. As a result many do not receive appropriate care and treatment for the 
disabilities that follow, including physical, cognitive, psychological, and social impairments. Maximizing damages for these 
plaintiffs requires a thorough understanding of traumatic brain injury. Since the medical community generally speaking is not well 
trained in neurobehavior, physicians often fail to diagnose the short-term and potentially chronic aspects of closed head injuries in 
the regular office visit. Outside of the regional head injury treatment centers, neurologists on a day-to-day basis do not treat 
trauma victims. Neuro-surgeons see only the most severe cases of acute disorders and coma. </p>
<p>There is widespread misunderstanding concerning traumatic brain injury even in otherwise knowledgeable medical circles. 
Anecdotes do not replace scientific evidence, bur recently a well regarded neurologist, an assistant clinical professor of medicine 
at Stanford University and a respected scientist and author, concluded that a moderate head injury in a bicycle/truck collision, in 
which the plaintiff's bicycle helmet was fractured, was not responsible for chronic fatigue six months post-injury. Even after he 
reviewed well documented medical references describing fatigue as the most common complaint in two-thirds of all minimal to 
moderate head injury patients, this physician still opined that his patient s fatigue was secondary to depression and unrelated to 
injury. Such a misinformed view by a treating physician severely impacted the plaintiff s ability to achieve fair compensation in a 
strongly contested case of liability. </p>
<p>People with concussions heal over time and that many of the emotional conditions reported can be equally associated with 
psychological conditions which occur in the absence of physical trauma. In this setting, reassurance goes a long way to promote 
healing and well-being. Unfortunately, reassurance should always follow a realistic assessment and often there is not enough time, 
or insufficient skill, to conduct a proper medical evaluation. </p>
<p>To maximize damages for this plaintiff requires a grounding in the medicine of head injury and an understanding the full range of 
traumatic brain injury is a <strong>sine qua non</strong> for plaintiffs who have suffered physical injury and in evaluating plaintiffs insulted by 
contaminated drugs, toxic exposures, and silicone gel breast implant reactions. </p>
<p>Keep in mind that, unlike common orthopedic injuries, there is no bright line to identify brain injuries and even if there were a line 
it would not be a straight line. The range and severity of disabilities in one patient will vary dramatically. Some functions may be 
severely disabled and other skills intact. That is why learning the medicine and being able to identify when you need to seek a 
neuro-psychological consultation is important. As a trial lawyer you must be alert to the full range of TBI symptoms. </p>
<p>Attorneys are often the first professionals who take the time to listen carefully to the patient, who critically evaluate any lingering 
condition, or carefully observe symptoms. Families members accompanying the plaintiff are excellent resources who can describe 
changes in personality, skills and the subtle symptoms and complaints many times dismissed as the complaints of a 
hypochondriac. During the several hours you devote to meeting with a new client, conduct a review of the common symptoms of 
TBI that are discussed below and do not hesitate to have the client referred for a neuro-psychological evaluation if you suspect 
there may be brain injury. The earlier you make the referral the better because that initial evaluation may be the first objective 
evaluation for the purpose of establishing a baseline for later comparison. </p>
<p>The human brain consists of billions of microscopic fibers, suspended in cerebrospinal fluid. While the exterior skull is smooth, 
the inner surface contains ribbing and pronounced bony structures. Impact with these inner surfaces of the skull causes tearing 
and bruising that results in brain damage. </p>
<p>Injuries occur when the momentum of the brain impacts against a skull that has been decelerated. This often results in swelling 
and resulting compression that can have long term effects. Nerve fibers are sheared in rotational injuries that can leave the brain 
stem permanently altered. Respiratory obstructions and compromised lung function that cause a total cessation of oxygenation 
result in anoxic injuries. Medically these injuries are distinct from hypoxic injuries caused by reduced oxygen. </p>
<p>The severely handicapped TBI survivor presents the easier case for maximizing damages because the extent of the injury is not 
doubted. It is the patient with mild injuries with a complete medical recovery from physical symptoms that presents a major 
challenge to the skill of treating physicians, rehabilitation professionals, and to the legal team called upon to prove and explain the 
long term effect of these injuries to judges and juries. </p>
<p>Post-concussion syndrome presents with headaches, spasticity, dizziness, reduced coordination, sensory dysfunction, memory 
losses, problems in concentrating, difficulty in perceiving, sequencing, judgment and communication, fatigue, loss of empathy, 
depression, anxiety, sexual dysfunction, depressed motivation, emotional volatility, slowed thinking and impaired writing and 
reading skill. Patients complain of trouble organizing thoughts, inability to express themselves, difficulty selecting and recalling 
words, short-temper, learning new information and retaining it, getting lost, confusion and agitation. These are the same 
symptoms and complaints observed and experienced by survivors of severe injury. Studying and understanding the treatment of 
the severely injured will assist in identifying the needs of the person who has suffered mild head injury. </p>
<p>To appreciate the extent of a precipitating injury, it is helpful to understand two commonly used medical scales found in every 
medical chart involving TBI. </p>
<p>The first is the Glasgow Coma Scale which rates a patient s ability to open his/her eyes, response to verbal commands and 
verbal responses. Each level of response indicates the degree of brain injury. </p>
<pre><strong>Glasgow Coma Scale</strong>
                                                  
<strong>Eyes</strong>                    <strong>Score</strong>
Open spontaneously        4
Open to verbal command    3
Open to pain              2
No response               1

<strong>Best motor response to a verbal command</strong>
Obeys verbal command      6

<strong>Best motor response to painful stimulus</strong>
Localizes pain            5
Flexion - withdrawal      4
Flexion - abnormal        3
Extension                 2
No response               1

<strong>Best verbal response</strong>
Oriented and converses    5
Disoriented and converses 4
Inappropriate words       3
Incomprehensible sounds   2
No response               1

</pre>
<p>The lowest score is a 3 and indicates no response from the patient. A person who is alert and oriented would be rated at 15.</p>
<p>The Rancho Los Amigas Cognitive Scale describes levels of function and are used to assess the efficacy of treatment programs. 
The scale scores cover deep coma to appropriate functioning. Most survivors will demonstrate characteristics from several levels 
at once. </p>
<p>Level I: no response to pain, touch, sound or sight. </p>
<p>Level II: generalize reflex response to pain. </p>
<p>Level III: localized response to pain. Blinks to strong light, turns toward or away from sound, responds to physical discomfort, 
inconsistent response to commands. </p>
<p>Level IV: confused/agitated. Alert, very active, aggressive or bizarre behaviors, performs motor activities but behavior is 
non-purposeful, extremely short attention span. </p>
<p>Level V confused/non-agitated. Gross attention to environment, highly distractible, requires continual redirection, difficulty 
learning new tasks, agitated by too much stimulation. May engage in social conversation but with inappropriate verbalization. </p>
<p>Level VI: confused/appropriate. Inconsistent orientation to time and place, retention span/recent memory impaired, begins to 
recall past, consistently follows simple directions, goal-directed behavior with assistance. </p>
<p>Level VII: automatic/appropriate. Performs daily routine in highly familiar environment in a non- confused but automatic 
robot-like manner. Skills noticeably deteriorate in unfamiliar environment. Lacks realistic planning for own future. </p>
<p>Level VIII: purposeful/appropriate. </p>
<p>Those who suffer skull fractures, loss of consciousness and coma and typically are diagnosed as moderate to severe injuries, with 
obvious physical impairments. Because they have suffered objective physical injuries, their resulting impairments are readily 
accepted as having been caused by the initial insult. Some of the physical consequences that may occur after a brain injury 
include decreased muscle control, paralysis, weakness, seizures, sensory losses, and difficulty speaking or swallowing. </p>
<p>Lost motor control or weakness of one arm or leg or on one side of the body is known as hemiparesis. Poor balance, decreased 
endurance, loss of the ability to plan movements of arms, legs and poor coordination are evident. Survivors experience spasticity 
or abnormal tone and muscle stiffness. </p>
<p>Seizures can occur immediately or may be delayed until months or even years after the initial trauma. A seizure is a burst of 
abnormal electrical energy in the brain. In generalized seizures, or major motor seizures, the entire body stiffens. Loss of 
consciousness, irregular breathing, and loss of bowel and bladder accompany severe shaking. After regaining consciousness, the 
patient reports soreness and confusion. A second category of seizures are known as focal motor or partial seizures which present 
as jerking movements or twitching. Consciousness remains intact and often is viewed as a loss of concentration. Often the patient 
does not know that a seizure has taken place. </p>
<p>Following TBI sight, sound, taste, touch and smell can suffer decreased or increased sensitivity, or a complete loss. Loss of 
sensation to parts of the body and hypersensitivity are also common. Double vision, loss of depth perception, and an inability to 
see on one side of the body can occur. Loss of proprioception, the inability to know where arms and legs are in relationship to 
the body, also takes place. </p>
<p>Fatigue is extremely common in the early stages following injury. In many cases the fatigue is profound and staying alert and 
awake for these patients is difficult. This can easily be confused with being unmotivated because these patients have difficulty 
paying attention and are sleepy. </p>
<p>Speech disorders follow damage to the cranial nerve which enervates the face. Dysarthria, difficulty in pronouncing words, 
characterized by slurred or slow speech or loss of the ability to vocalize, results from weak muscles or reduced coordination of 
the muscles required to produce speech. A closely related condition, dysphagia, the inability to swallow and chew properly, can 
be readily observed when a patient extends his/her neck or engages in some accommodating movement when swallowing. 
Reports of choking or the need to soften food with water before swallowing are significant. </p>
<p>Sleep disorders are another area of inquiry. Total reversals of sleep patterns, the need for multiple naps and rest periods and loss 
of bowel and bladder control are reported. </p>
<p>Neurologic damage readily disrupts how a person thinks and processes information. Memory, attention, organization, planning 
and perception are functions disrupted by TBI. Attention and concentration is something most of us do well. We pay attention 
and focus on a specific task and block out distractions both internal and external. Survivors of TBI quickly change subjects and 
have difficulty following through an idea or a sequence to completion. The slightest distraction causes a complete loss of 
concentration and results in confusion. Without attention and concentration, learning cannot occur. </p>
<p>Significant confusion following a head injury is so common that the primary medical inquiry is to establish if the patient is oriented. 
Not knowing the day, week, year, where they are or what happened results in the patient asking searching questions. Coping 
with confusion is extremely frustrating and leads to more confusion. As a defense mechanism to bring rationality to their 
existence, many patients will develop their own explanation or history, integrating some accurate information, into a fabric of 
reality and fantasy. Confabulation is not coping with reality, but it is more closely associated with denial and is a defense 
mechanism. </p>
<p>Survivors have difficulty planning which is known as impaired executive function. Planning requires good memory, learning, 
judgment, attention and organizational skills. Difficulty in following a logical progression or focusing or getting stuck on one step, 
stage or activity raises frustrations. Dealing with abstract concepts as literal facts is additionally confusing. Aphorisms, such as a 
complimentary &quot;you are a tough cookie,&quot; are interpreted to mean that the listener is a piece of food that is extremely hard to 
chew. </p>
<p>The most significant hurdle to learning after injury is memory loss and impairment. The mind s capacity to receive, store and 
retrieve information is effected. Short-term memory and recalling what happened yesterday is more common than the loss of 
recall for older information. This should not be confused with retrograde amnesia, which is the inability to recall events before 
injury. Anterograde amnesia is the inability to recall events that have occurred since injury. </p>
<p>Impaired communication skills, such as aphasia, the inability to understand or recall the simplest words, is caused by brain cell 
damage, not by physical inability to speak. Survivors who have difficulty understanding are diagnosed with receptive aphasia. 
Expressive aphasia is the diagnosis for those having difficulty remembering words, naming objects or expressing ideas. </p>
<p>Impaired judgment occurs when abstract thinking is impaired. Being stimulus bound is when the brain only recognizes and reacts 
to objects and events in the immediate environment. Applying a task to a similar but different situation cannot be accomplished. 
Difficulty in interpreting the actions or inaction or others is common. Those who show concern and attention can be viewed as 
being angry toward the survivor. </p>
<p>People with impaired memory may remember and retain old skills, but learning new ones require repeated instructions and 
extended practice. Even then they can be readily forgotten, with accompanying frustration, depression, and anger. </p>
<p>Frontal lobe injuries can be interpreted as causing dullness because this area of the brain controls impulses, motivation and 
initiation. These survivors need to be reminded and prompted in simple tasks, such as daily care and living tasks. Regular 
encouragement and visual cues are helpful in prompting initiation. </p>
<p>In addition to physical consequences of TBI the ability to understand feelings and the ability to control emotions are impacted. A 
whole range of behavioral symptoms occur with TBI: agitation, depression, frustration, rapid changes in emotion and severe 
mood changes, insensitivity to others, self-centeredness, rage tantrums, poor impulse control, loss of inhibition, decreased libido, 
inappropriate sexual expression and loss of self-esteem. Pre-existing conditions may be amplified following TBI. </p>
<p>Survivors suffering moderate to severe injuries will have hospital and rehabilitation care from a wide range of professionals. 
Knowing the role of these providers is important to appreciating the significance and magnitude of TBI and in formulating a 
courtroom presentation that explains the breadth of disability a survivor must endure. </p>
<p>The <strong>neurologist</strong> specializes in the medical treatment of the nervous system: the brain, spinal cord, nerves and muscles. A 
neurologist is first called to make an initial evaluation, diagnose the injury and consult on immediate medical care the patient 
requires. </p>
<p>The <strong>physiatrist</strong> combines physical medicine and rehabilitation medicine dir ected at renewing function and these medical doctors 
are trained in both neurology and orthopedics. </p>
<p>The <strong>neuropsychologist</strong> specializes in evaluating brain function and performs sophisticated tests of brain function necessary to 
identify specific injuries and to select appropriate rehabilitation efforts. </p>
<p>Respiratory or <strong>pulmonary therapists</strong> help the patient breathe and maintain a ventilator employed to insure clear airways. </p>
<p><strong>Physical therapists</strong> focus on restoring motor function, strengthening muscles, improving coordination, balance, endurance and 
the movement of joints. </p>
<p><strong>Occupational therapists</strong> provide rehabilitation skills to help the patient perform physical tasks involving both gross and fine 
motor skills, as well as performing the six activities of daily living: bathing, dressing, toileting, transferring [getting in and out of a 
chair or bed], continence [voluntary bowel and bladder functions], and feeding. </p>
<p>Because speech deficits are the most common disability for survivors, <strong>speech pathologists</strong> are involved in evaluating and 
teaching speech, writing, reading and expression skills aimed at both comprehension and communication. </p>
<p><strong>Cognitive therapists</strong> teach survivors how to learn. The goal is to help survivors identify techniques to improve their ability to 
remember ideas. Computers are used extensively as a training tool by cognitive therapists. </p>
<p><strong>Vocational rehabilitation counsellors</strong> identify skills, aptitudes, and abilities that will help restore the patient to the world of 
work. To determine the level of vocational functioning the counsellor also evaluates the patients ability to follow instructions and 
social skills. Testing helps determine the survivors ability to learn, to make judgments and to evaluate productivity, punctuality, 
reaction time, distractibility and tolerance for frustration. Once the evaluation is completed a specialized training program is 
designed and implemented to promote a smooth transition to being able to once again be gainfully employed. Survivors of TBI 
face monumental challenges to job re-entry and having realistic expectations are important from the outset. Many times work 
adjustment training, driver s training, job seeking and interviewing skills may be insufficient and a <strong>job coach</strong> is needed to facilitate 
a smooth transition. Still, educating employers is the chief obstacle for the family and representatives of TBI survivors. </p>
<p>The <strong>educational therapist</strong> teaches the basic skills needed to return to school or work and arranges for a special educational 
environment from designing course work that will develop reading, writing or math skills to arranging for note takers or real time 
court reporters in class. </p>
<p><strong>Social workers</strong> provide the important connection between the health care staff, rehabilitation professionals, family, school, work 
and often the insurance carrier funding the rehabilitation. The chief task for the social worker is to prepare a detailed background 
study and normally includes the patient s pre-injury personality, lifestyle, emotional and financial resources, educational history, 
work and leisure interests, special relationship and previous problems. Long-term and short-term goals are usually developed 
with the social worker. Because the family will be in regular contact with the social worker, they will seek advice and will share 
confidences with the social worker. It is important for the patient s legal representatives to have a strong and responsible working 
relationship with the social worker. The social worker s background study is one of the most significant documents in the 
rehabilitation chart. </p>
<p><strong>Therapeutic recreational specialists</strong> evaluate interests and hobbies and integrate them into therapy goals that are readily 
enjoyed by the survivor. The focus is to develop physical, cognitive and social skills so leisure activities can once again be 
enjoyed. </p>
<p>The rehabilitation <strong>case manager</strong> or rehabilitation specialist coordinates the goals of the patient, family and rehabilitation staff as 
an advocate for the patient and oversees the overall treatment plan. The case manager is routinely in charge of reporting to the 
insurance carrier funding the recovery program. </p>
<p>Throughout this discussion the TBI survivor has been presumed to be an adult. By far the most challenging plaintiff is a child who 
is attractive and who will walk into the courtroom. As this child matures it is extremely common for more serious behavioral and 
learning disabilities to emerge, which further compound the development of personality, attitudes and life-coping skills. By the 
same token, developing maturity also masks the recovery process and leaves the question whether the youngster is recovering or 
developing. A <strong>pediatric neurologist</strong> is invaluable in explaining how injury interrupts growth and development and why children 
need specialized rehabilitation services now and in the future. </p>
<p>In tandem with the pediatric neurologist is the <strong>research psychologist</strong> who can educate the trier of fact concerning the long-term 
effects of head injury, the impact on the family, the need for lifecare planning, and the most common sequelae for TBI survivors. 
The attractive child with a severe impairment will generate compassion and understanding from his/her environment, but once the 
adolescent years begin the tasks of dealing with sexual drives, peers, alcohol and drugs in the TBI survivor are grossly 
complicated. Living unsupervised in the community will result in exposure to police and courts, which creates a whole additional 
range of problems that are important to understand. </p>
<p>At the criminal justice level, next to nobody, including public defenders and judges, appreciates that TBI has been closely 
associated with criminal histories and specifically with violent rages. Current research from the University of Chicago by Dr. 
Stuart Yudofsky shows that the most common cause of explosive anger is brain injury or neurological disease and that there are 
now medications available to control violent rage. Beta-blockers can be used to effectively treat not only high blood pressure, 
but also violent rages. This research is confirmed by the University of Pennsylvania study of 286 psychiatric patients who showed 
unprovoked rage; in that cohort 94% had some kind of brain damage. </p>
<p>This research correlates with studies by Dr. Dorothy Lewis of the NYU School of Medicine, and others, of 15 deat h row 
inmates in the American Journal of Psychiatry [143:7, July, 1986] and a separate study of 31 incarcerated delinquents reported 
in the Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry [1987, 26, 5:744- 752]. There is no question that 
much violent crime can be traced to brain injury, especially in criminals who are repeatedly violent. </p>
<p>At the same time, not surprisingly, a nationwide survey has ranked California 31st among the states in the delivery of mental 
health services, a further decline form its 25th place two years ago. The survey by the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill, 
which was conducted by the Public Citizen Health Research Group, rates Los Angeles as having the worst public mental health 
services of any major city in the nation. Particularly striking was the report's conclusion that 3,600 severely mentally ill inmates 
housed in Los Angeles County Jails comprise the &quot;largest <strong>de facto</strong> mental institution in the nation.&quot; </p>
<p>There is no organized long-term system of community care for the traumatically brain injured. TBI patients without families or 
financial protection are relegated to the street or incorrectly diagnosed as mentally ill. For those with families, the families do not 
simply become care providers: they suffer an outrageous burdens that destroys families, causes siblings to leave home 
prematurely, and mandates that someone give up their life to care for the injured. All of this underscores the critical need for the 
testimony of the <strong>lifecare planner</strong> that will identify the services the survivor will require for life, but in addition, the cost of 
providing on-going care and supervision for a lifetime that will prevent the survivor from suffering additional mistreatment by 
police, courts and corrections. </p>
<p>By mastering a thorough understanding of TBI the legal professional takes the first step towards providing both judge and jury 
with the knowledge necessary to understand, appreciate and provide for appropriate care for the traumatically brain injured. </p>
<p>It is hoped that by sharing the knowledge gained first hand from years of experience in representing survivors of TBI that the first 
step for others perhaps will be decidedly easier. </p>

<p><b>Introduction</b> </p>
<p>Congenital microcephaly, abnormally small head circumference, is caused by environmental or genetic factors. </p>
<p>Genetic causes of microcephaly do their damage through Mendelian patterns of inheritance of a defective or damaged gene or 
chromosome. Many cases of microcephaly are denominated &quot;idiopathic&quot; because the likely causal factor(s) are not known. 
Nonetheless the vast majority of the idiopathic cases of microcephaly are not genetic, but rather are environmental. </p>
<p>Environmental causes of microcephaly are the result of deleterious exposures which occur during pregnancy and which interfere 
with normal proliferation and migration of neural cellsthe fundamental building blocks of the central nervous system. 
Environmental factors commonly associated with microcephaly include: ethanol ingestion; inhalation of mixed solvent vapor [as in 
glue or paint sniffing]; certain pharmaceutical drugs; maternal infection, e.g. rubella; and radiation. Certain chemicals, such as 
methyl ethyl ketone [MEK], have the capacity to produce microcephaly because they target the developing fetal brain and 
interfere with proper, timely, and adequate proliferation and migration of the neural cells. </p>
<p><b>Properties of MEK</b> </p>
<p>MEK is a colorless, volatile, organic solvent with a pleasant pungent odor akin to lacquer thinner. It is commonly used as a 
cleaning solvent in industry.. </p>
<p>Chronic inhalation of MEK vapors at concentrations in the range of 100-300 PPM and higher is toxic to the adult central 
nervous system. Headache, dizziness, and mental confusion are common early signs of MEK's neurotoxic potential. MEK also 
has the peculiar property of potentiating the neurotoxicity of other organic solvents. </p>
<p>MEK's remarkable ability to enter the body through intact human skin has been known for years. For example,because the 
threshold limit value [TLV] for workplace exposure to concentrations in air of MEK does not take into account skin contact as a 
common route of exposure, one must question the reliability of the TLV concept as offering adequate protection even for adult 
workers. </p>
<p>Animal developmental toxicology studies on MEK in peerreviewed literature show it is fetotoxic; it has the capacity to interfere 
with normal fetal growth and development. </p>
<p>There are several ways that chemicals can cause harm to a fetus. This entire spectrum of harm is often referred to as 
developmental toxicity, and it comprises not only externally visible structural malformations but also fetotoxicity an endpoint often 
measured in terms of intra uterine growth retardation. </p>
<p>Thalidomide is the most famous example of how ingesting a toxin just once at a critical time in pregnancy can produce structural 
malformations [&quot;dysmorphologic&quot; effects] such as foreshortened limbs. </p>
<p>But chemicals which interfere with the normal growth and development of the fetus throughout gestation can actually cause much 
more devastating and irreparable harm, especially if the affected system is the developing central nervous system. </p>
<p>MEK's fetotoxic ability is dosedependent, with the nature and extent of fetal harm increasing as the daily dose and the duration of 
exposure increases. The animal toxicology studies on MEK are all large, welldesigned studies and all demonstrate significant 
doserelated fetotoxicity, namely intrauterine growth retardation. </p>
<p>A 1974 study by Schwetz et al, Embryo and Fetotoxicity of Inhaled Carbon Tetrachloride, 1,1Dychlorethane and Methyl Ethyl 
Ketone in Rats, Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology 28:452 (1974) [for Dow Chemical] reports significant fetotoxicity in rats 
at several doses and a significant incidence of structural malformations [imperforate anus and &quot;bird jaw&quot;] in the most 
heavilyexposed rats. </p>
<p>A followup rat study jointly commissioned by MEK manufacturers in 1978 and delivered to one manufacturer in 1979 also had 
strong positive findings of intrauterine growth retardation and other signs of fetotoxicity. Deacon et al, EmbryoFetoxicity of 
Inhaled Methyl Ethyl Ketone in Rats, Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology, 59:620 (1981). </p>
<p>In 1991 a mouse study found significant fetotoxic effects in MEKexposed offspring examined immediately after birth. Schwetz et 
al, Developmental Toxicity of Inhaled Methyl Ethyl Ketone in Swiss Mice, 16:742 (1991). </p>
<p>After reviewing these three developmental toxicity studies and making appropriate inter and intraspecies extrapolations, the U.S. 
EPA set a &quot;reference dose&quot; of .3 PPM for human inhalation exposure to MEK. The dose of MEK absorbed into the 
bloodstream of a pregnant woman is approximately the dose delivered through the placenta to her fetus. As a result, if a pregnant 
woman is routinely breathing air containing significantly more than .3 PPM of MEK, her fetus will be receiving a fetotoxic dose of 
MEK. </p>
<p>Daily doses of MEK in common industrial settings, where MEK is used as a solvent without positive ventilation or protective 
equipment, result in air concentrations several hundred times greater than the socalled &quot;safe harbor&quot; reference dose. </p>
<p><b>MEK Targets the Fetal Brain </b></p>
<p>The rodent studies described above establish, beyond any doubt, that MEK induces intrauterine growth retardation and is thus a 
developmental toxicant. </p>
<p>These findings are confirmed by a 1990 European study reported in the peerreviewed literature in which rats were exposed to 
MEK during gestation and the postnatal period, when significant brain growth and development normally occurs in rodents. 
StoltenburgDidinger et al, Neurotoxicity of Organic Solvent Mixtures and Fetotoxicity, Neurotoxicology and Teratology, 12:585 
(1990). Examination of the MEKexposed brains showed significant retardation of growth and development of the cerebellar 
cortex. The implications of this finding are profound and compelling. Damage to the cortex interferes with intellectual functioning, 
reasoning, and judgment. </p>
<p><b>Defenses Raised by Manufacturers </b></p>
<p>Although exposure to organic solvents during pregnancy poses a very severe risk to the developing human fetus and had been a 
fundamental fact known to toxicologists for decades, in litigated cases of congenital brain damage caused by MEK, 
manufacturers argue that because there are no human epidemiologic studies or case reports which explicitly identify MEK, acting 
alone, as the cause of human developmental harm, it is &quot;junk science&quot; to attribute a given child's developmental harm to MEK. 
Such arguments weak for several reasons. </p>
<p>First, nobody has, or ever will, test MEK on pregnant women. The days of Mengele are over. It is immoral and unethical to 
knowingly expose pregnant women to a potential developmental toxicant to observe outcomes. In fact, a number of studies 
where volunteers were exposed to MEK for short periods explicitly excluded pregnant women from participation. </p>
<p>Second, and equally relevant, typically workplace exposures involve mixed solvents rather than a single agent. In contrast, 
medications are prescribed and taken during pregnancy on an individualistic and closely monitored basis. In the case of 
thalidomide, for example, there were realistic opportunities for alert clinicians to observe and report adverse developmental 
effects of drugs they prescribed to pregnant patients. </p>
<p>With workplace exposures to mixed solvents, on the other hand, because physicians and their patients are often unaware of the 
potential for harmful exposure, a reliable exposure history is not obtained and thus the potential role of a specific solvent 
exposure in any subsequent adverse outcome becomes virtually untraceable. </p>
<p>Given these significant threshold, frontend limitations to full documentation of workplace exposures, the numerous retrospective 
studies which do find associations between solvent exposure and adverse effects cannot possibly fill in the data gap in the way 
defendant insinuates it must be filled before there is &quot;proof&quot; that MEK has the ability to cause developmental toxicity in humans. </p>
<p>Reputable scientists concede that the scientific method involves considerations of the weight of evidence rather than some sort of 
&quot;litmus test&quot; for whether a given chemical can cause human developmental toxicity. </p>
<p>The evidence that MEK can cause human developmental toxicity, including microcephaly and mental retardation, does not stop 
with retrospective case control epidemiologic studies which link mixed industrial solvent exposure with central nervous system 
malformations and other fetal damage, either. A solid body of scientific literature confirms the biological foundation that MEK is a 
developmental toxin. </p>
<p>By the late 1970s two independent sources of human data were accumulating which pointed to organic solvents as a major 
factor in environmentallycaused microcephaly and mental retardation. </p>
<p>The first data concerned fetal alcohol syndrome [FAS]a devastating condition associated with maternal ingestion of ethanol 
during critical phases of fetal brain growth and development. FAS children are mentally retarded because their brain growth is 
slowed during gestation; ethyl alcohol and/or its metabolites disrupts orderly proliferation and migrational of neural cells, resulting 
in a small brain, a retarded intellect, and of course, microcephaly. </p>
<p>The second data focused on what has been dubbed &quot;fetal solvent syndrome.&quot; The first case report was published in 1979 and 
involved a woman who chronically inhaled solvents during pregnancy as a form of recreational stimulus. Her child was 
microcephalic and mentally retarded. Numerous case reports since have described mentally retarded, microcephalic children 
whose mothers sniffed the vapor from all manner of solventbased paints, glues, thinners, cements during pregnancy. While these 
unfortunate children are typically described as having &quot;toluene embryopathy&quot; it is more accurate to describe them as victims of 
&quot;fetal solvent syndrome&quot; for this reason: the chemical constituents in commercially available spray paints, glues, cements, 
adhesives and thinners are mixes of solvents and a significant constituent solvent in many of these mixtures is MEK. </p>
<p><b>Proving Chemically Induced Microcephaly </b></p>
<p>To determine the cause environmental or genetic of any case of microcephaly is an iterative process of systematically narrowing 
the possible explanations by ruling out as many potential causes as possible. </p>
<p>It is necessary to determine whether microcephaly is due to </p>
<ul>
<li>a recognized genetic condition, such as Fragile (X) syndrome </li>
<li>chromosomal anomalies </li>
<li>maternal infection, e.g. rubella </li>
<li>maternal exposure to radiation </li>
<li>maternal ingestion of medication </li>
<li>recreational &quot;sniffing&quot; of solventbased paint, glue and/or paint thinner </li>
<li>maternal ingestion of alcohol during pregnancy [&quot;fetal alcohol syndrome&quot;] or </li>
<li>toxic chemical exposure. </li>
</ul>
<p>The next question in the iterative process is: Of all the potential causes of microcephaly, genetic or environmental, how likely is 
any one of them in particular to have played a role? </p>
<p>In an actual litigated case of congential microcephaly there were several reasons for concluding that that the cause was unlikely to 
have been genetic, i.e., the result of a dominant or recessive trait passed on via the rules for Mendelian inheritance. First, the child 
not have any recognized genetic syndrome. Second, there was no family history and no consanguinity between his parents and 
thus no basis to suspect that a familial syndrome might be uncovered if one searched the family tree. Third, the patient had no 
physical features that suggest that his microcephaly was autosomal recessive in origin. </p>
<p><b>Idiopathic Often Means the Cause is Environmental </b></p>
<p>Although many cases of congenital microcephaly are labelled &quot;idiopathic&quot; because no apparent environmental or genetic cause 
can be convincingly identified, about four in five cases of isolated microcephaly fall into the idiopathic category. </p>
<p>It is commonly reported that of the universe of children with socalled &quot;idiopathic&quot; microcephaly, only 57% have younger siblings 
who are affected the sine qua non evidence that in these children the original microcephaly is of autosomal recessive origin rather 
than environmental. </p>
<p>Of the universe of children born with isolated microcephaly and mental retardation for whom no cause is apparent, a very small 
percentage are likely to turn out ultimately to be of true genetic origin. The inescapable inference is that the vast majority of 
socalled &quot;idiopathic&quot; cases are in fact the result of an environmental insult in the womb. Thus, any given case of &quot;idiopathic&quot; 
microcephaly is much more likely to be environmental than genetic. </p>
<p>The final question in the iterative process becomes: Can it be established to a reasonable degree of scientific probability that 
MEK was the specific environmental factor causing microcephaly? </p>
<p><b>MEK Can and Does Cause Microcephaly</b> </p>
<p>Once all other potential causes have been ruled out, environmental exposures are often the cause and if there is a chronic, in 
utero exposure to MEK, it is most probably the cause of microcephaly or mental retardation. </p>
<p>MEK is a fetotoxic chemical that induces developmental delay, including retarded brain development in humans and in utero 
exposure to MEK can readily cause microcephaly and mental retardation. The current scientific evidence is compelling. </p>
<ul>
<li>Animal Models for MEK's capacity to Induce Microcephaly: The evidence for MEK's developmental neurotoxicity is 
consistent and positive in four animal toxicology studies in peerreviewed literature, culminating with the dramatic evidence 
that MEK actually targets the developing central nervous system, producing abnormally small brains in exposed test 
animals. </li>
<li>IntraSpecies Differences: The weight of evidence is that the human species is at least as vulnerable as the rat or mouse to 
the effects of in utero MEK exposure. In fact, because humans are a higher life form, public health officials always assume 
that we are much more vulnerable to toxic exposures than rats, mice, guinea pigs or rabbits. </li>
<li>Maximum Safe Daily Dose During Pregnancy: The EPA's derivation from these animal data of a human Reference Dose 
of .3 PPM for MEK, i.e., the maximum daily dose of MEK a pregnant woman can absorb without risking fetal harm is far 
less than the amounts of airborne MEK to which industrial workers are commonly exposed. </li>
<li>Critical Time(s) in Fetal Brain Growth: In normal fetal development in humans, the most significant brain growth occurs in 
the second half of pregnancy. A child born with microcephaly and mental retardation has to have sustained a significant 
interference with brain growth over an extended period during pregnancywith the second half of pregnancy being most 
significant. </li>
<li>Human Evidence on Solvents and Fetal Brain Damage: The human epidemiologic data on mixed organic solvent exposure 
shows associations with adverse developmental outcomes, including microcephaly and mental retardation </li>
<li>Lessons from Alcohol Ingestion, &quot;Glue Sniffing&quot; etc.: The large body of peerreviewed literature on Fetal Alcohol 
Syndrome, Fetal Solvent Syndrome, and on experimental chemical induction of microcephaly, elucidate the mechanisms 
by which microcephaly is actually produced. </li>
<li>Biologic Plausibility of the Association: The biological foundation for the existence of an association between in utero 
MEK exposure and damage to the developing fetal brain, is MEK's neurotoxic properties, its affinity for lipid rich tissue 
including the brain, its ready skin penetration, and its ability to cross the placenta, and the fetal liver's inability to detoxify it. </li>

<p>When crime strikes innocent children, women and men, in all but a handful of cases there is absolutely nothing our civil justice 
system can do to restore the devastation and destruction that has occurred. Government programs to compensate victims of 
crime, such as California's program, while proclaimed by politicians as important statements of policy and commitment, these 
programs are provide minimal immediate support and little long term assistance. </p>
<p>In a small percentage of cases, those who profit from operating businesses in locations that are known by the profiteers to be 
magnets for crime are held responsible for the emotional and financial aftermath for survivors of criminal conduct. Even where 
criminal conduct has occurred because of mental disability, insurance carriers today exclude from liability policies any damage 
caused by policyholders who lack the mental ability to govern their conduct in accordance with reason and are found guilty of 
crime. Once the criminal justices system has sentenced the wrongdoers, those who are the survivors of crime are routinely left 
to suffer their injuries, losses and emotional suffering by themselves. </p>
<p>Although the rate of crime per 100,000 citizens has not fluctuated greatly in the last 30 years, newspapers and television revel 
in reporting crisis, conflict, catastrophe, corruption and crime. Because crime news is readily available, even on slow news 
days, it is the commonly used to fill otherwise empty pages and the 17 minute news slot on the televised evening news. 
Americans routinely are barraged with crime reports from obscure hamlets in the outback that no one ever heard of or will 
hear of again, because that particular crime story will keep viewers attuned to the program and the commercial. </p>
<p>The news media has publicized crime and has made it a top concern in every poll of the American public in recent years. 
There is widespread anger over crime and the criminal justice system, but efforts to prevent crime so far have been a failure 
because while citizens and political leaders are ready to simply use &quot;common sense&quot; and be &quot;tough&quot; on crime, no one is taking 
the time to be &quot;smart&quot; about it. </p>
<p>Those who have studied crime, America's top sociologists, criminologists and experts in penology have been ignored in the 
public debate, because they do not have a public relations budget and listening to them is not as easy as listening to the 
neighbor whose answer to crime is &quot;lock them up.&quot; This is the easiest and simplest answer when looking at individual criminals 
at a micro level of analysis. But the implications of that public policy in a country of 250,000,000 people calls for an overview 
or macro understanding of crime is long overdue. </p>
<p>All the literature and our accumulated wisdom confirms that the chief causes of crime are racial discrimination and the creation 
of an underclass of non-white Americans. </p>
<p>Few are willing to discuss the race issue directly. White America has developed a special set of code words to replace the Jim 
Crow language of the past and to mask its racial antipathy. In the place of &quot;nigger&quot; American culture has substituted &quot;inner city, 
gangs, thugs, minorities, welfare recipient, fatherless families, urban, and lower socio-economic.&quot; These are the new code 
words to describe obliquely the American underclass of black and brown young men who predominate in prisons across the 
U.S. </p>
<p>Crime is in large part a function of youth. Visit any court house in a major metropolitan area on Monday morning and visit the 
courtroom where the arraignment calendar is called. The court room and hallways regularly filled with brash young men 
ranging in age from 18 to their late twenties, predominantly non-whites, who are unemployed. </p>
<p>While many believe that crime can be 'solved' by incarcerating this population, society is still left with someone without 
marketable skills who can and will return to crime to support themselves. There are breakthroughs in solving the problem of 
crime that are achieving success because they clearly address the root cause of crime in the United States: widespread racial 
discrimination. </p>
<p>Consider the evidence. </p>
<h4>Race and Crime</h4>
<p>Norwegian criminologist Nils Christie notes that the U.S. has the highest rate of incarceration in the world and that for every 
100,000 citizens, 407 are in prisons or jails. That is nearly double the rate of 230 a decade ago. By comparison, the British 
rate is 100, the French 92, and the Norwegian, 47. The U.S. out paces even the former Soviet Union locking up citizens. </p>
<p>In his novel, <i>Black Rage</i>, William H. Grier explains &quot;the root cause of prejudice is the unwillingness of white Americans to 
accept blacks as fellow human beings.&quot; It is this prejudice that results in ghettos, unemployment, substandard education, and 
poor health. That these factors cause crime is not open to doubt. So it is no surprise that in the United States 3,109 blacks are 
in prison for every 100,000 blacks, while in South Africa there are only 729. The rate of incarceration for blacks in the U.S. is 
nearly eight times the national average of 407 per 100,000 citizens. </p>
<h4>Unemployment in a Sink or Swim Society</h4>
<p>In the words of a famous sociologist, &quot;in a sink or swim society, people thrash before they go down and the thrashing is violent 
crime.&quot; </p>
<p>Violence is worst in our poorest black and brown communities, where the children of poor families are not educated by 
schools that warehouse them until they drop out. These people need basic educational skills so they can compete for jobs that 
have a future. It is the reason unemployment rates are so high in the ghetto. </p>
<p>Sixty percent of black males ages 20-24 were unemployed in l992, and half of all black men aged 16-24 had no work 
experience at all. </p>
<p>Unemployment is not due to laziness or unwillingness to work. The National Bureau of Economic Research found that young 
black men want to work, but they want fair treatment and to be paid the same as their white counterparts. Unable to compete 
for jobs because of poor education, money is made &quot;on the street&quot; selling drugs and in crime. </p>
<h4>New Proposals </h4>
<p>California's Blue Ribbon Commission On Inmate Population Management notes that &quot;the criminal justice system in California 
is out of balance and will remain so unless the entire state and local criminal justice system is addressed from prevention 
through discharge of jurisdiction&quot; and that &quot;insufficient prevention efforts . . . exist.&quot; </p>
<p>Even though drug and alcohol abuse is a major cause of imprisonment, no significant programs are available for substance 
abusers while they are confined and there is no meaningful employment training. Unemployment is a major problem among 
parolees and contributes to their likelihood to recidivate. </p>
<p>In other states programs have been successful in rehabilitating offenders. </p>
<p>The Vera Institute of Justice in New York started &quot;supported work&quot; in the 1970's to teach basic job skills to addicts. The 
result was &quot;a marked reduction in arrests and increased employment, were so encouraging that the project was repeated on a 
larger scale by other agencies.&quot; </p>
<p>The movement to &quot;smart punishment&quot; or &quot;intermediate penalties&quot; in cities like Phoenix where judges have non-prison 
sentencing options ranging from outright release to close supervision. These programs are also referred to as &quot;intensive 
probation&quot; and include constant checks of probationers with surprise drug checks and for those who fail a trip to state prison. 
The idea is catching on because while it is more expensive than regular probation, it is much less expensive than imprisonment 
and fewer probationers commit new offenses while under intense supervision. In Georgia, which pioneered the idea, only 1 in 
5 was arrested while under scrutiny, far lower than the average rate of 50 percent or more for those on traditional probation. </p>
<h4>Teaching Middle Class Skills</h4>
<p>Other programs, like the Perry Preschool Project, show that working with very young poor children will help them do better 
in school, hold jobs, not be on welfare, and be less likely to be arrested or convicted of a crime. </p>
<p>These programs are doing what families and schools have not accomplished, but even though programs like Head Start have 
proven to help young children get the most out of school, it is not in use throughout the United States. Expanding the program 
to cover all needy preschoolers would cost $8 billion and, as part of an effort to create jobs and to put the unemployed back 
to work, there might be some hope for a nationwide effort to save these children. </p>
<p>By far the most exciting programs for disadvantaged youths are those that help them cross class lines and to give them a 
chance to compete with the children of middle class families. </p>
<p>The Argus Learning for Living Center in the South Bronx provides tutoring in reading and also provides counselling to develop 
marketable skills, to build self-esteem, and teach positive attitudes. </p>
<p>The Chicago Area Project is a similar program for high-risk teenagers and gives advice about how to handle problems at 
school, work and at home. </p>
<p>One program in Los Angeles that is gaining recognition is Rites of Passage which is directed at black and brown youngsters 
and teaches them middle class skills to successfully complete educational programs and fight for jobs. </p>
<p>Originally ROP was intended to teach teenage fathers how to become men by changing values they learned on the street that 
led them to the juvenile justice system. The street teaches a young boy that if he wants to be certified as a &quot;man&quot; he must have 
money, must be violent, must be sexually active, and must survive having gone to jail. Many young blacks believe in a 
stereotype that white young men don't have problems because they live in a society that protects them. This attitude develops 
into a belief that life is hopeless and results in hatred against whites. Because young boys learn very early in life to 
communicate &quot;hurt&quot; as anger which leads to violence, ROP teaches young men to master their anger avoid acting out in rage. 
ROP is effective because it allows young blacks to acquire the educational and job skills that will later prevent them from 
being involved in drugs, alcohol, gangs, and crime. </p>
<h4>The Future</h4>
<p>In a country that is spending billions on prisons and experiencing no reduction in crime, intensive counselling provides a 
realistic, less costly, and more efficient approach that in time will be recognized as an efficient choice by a country that is facing 
a huge national debt. </p>
<p>ROP, and programs like it, must be implemented to give black and brown children the chance taken from them by a society 
that penalizes them for not being white. Rather than &quot;thrashing&quot; themselves to death the emphasis on modifying values and 
learning middle class social and economic skills is designed to provide a foundation to achieve economic freedom. </p>
<p>Prison cells cost $75,000 to build and every year it costs $25,000 to keep an inmate in custody. Spending the same amounts 
on providing job skills and teaching work values provides the chance that people who would be in prison will become 
productive and begin paying taxes instead of being supported by taxpayers. The Perry Project was estimated to save 
substantially more money than it cost, because it led to less dependency on welfare, fewer child support payments, and a 
savings in tax dollars that otherwise would have been spent on court costs and the correctional system. </p>
<p>Programs like ROP, Head Start, Perry Preschool Project, CAP, and the Argus Learning for Living should be the main 
emphasis of crime prevention efforts, in addition to new sentencing approaches like the Vera Institute of Justice program and 
intensive probation. Anti-crime programs for youngsters at risk should be made a part of preschool and school program for 
one simple reason: they are cheaper than the alternatives. </p>

</p>
<p>Wall Street investors and giant corporations have taken over our health care system by replacing 
traditional medical practices with &quot;managed care&quot; -- putting cost-cutting ahead of quality care and 
profits ahead of patients. </p>
<p>Managed care reaps billions for giant health corporations and rewards CEOs with staggering 
multi-million dollar paychecks. For example, the following is the value of stock owned by the 
CEOs of America's largest health businesses: </p>
<table>
<tr><td width=157>Leonard Abramson</td><td width=191>U.S. Healthcare </td><td width=115>$795.3 million</td></tr>
<tr><td width=157>Richard Scott</td><td width=191>Columbia/HCA </td><td width=115>$248.6 million</td></tr>
<tr><td width=157>David Jones</td><td width=191>Humana, Inc</td><td width=115>$232.6 million</td></tr>
<tr><td width=157>Richard Scrushy</td><td width=191>HealthSouth </td><td width=115>$186.7 million</td></tr>
<tr><td width=157>Malik Hasan</td><td width=191>HSI (Health Net) </td><td width=115>$141.3 million</td></tr>
<tr><td width=157>Daniel Crowley</td><td width=191>Foundation Health Corp. </td><td width=115>$40.7 million</td></tr>
<tr><td width=157>Alan Hoops</td><td width=191>PacifiCare Health Systems </td><td width=115>$35.0 million</td></tr>
<tr><td width=157>Jeffrey Barbakow</td><td width=191>Tenet</td><td width=115>$16.0 million</td></tr>
<tr><td width=157>Westcott W. Price III</td><td width=191>FHP (TakeCare) </td><td width=115>$12.8 million</td></tr>
</table>
<p>Yet, &quot;consumers are left to cope with health service cutbacks, substandard care, emergency room 
shutdowns, denial of needed treatment, and other cost management strategies designed to 
maximize profits&quot; That the conclusion reported in &quot;Wealth and Power: The U.S. Health Care 
Industry,&quot; Institute for Health &amp; Socio-Economic Policy, Feb. 1996. </p>
<p>More and more often, key medical decisions are being made by out-of-state accountants and 
bureaucrats instead of doctors and nurses. </p>
<p>How does this affect your care?</p>
<ul>
<li>Doctors and nurses are forced to sign &quot;loyalty oaths,&quot; putting their employers ahead of their 
patients. </li>
<li>&quot;Gag rules&quot; censor what doctors and nurses tell patients about treatment. </li>
<li>Access to specialists is restricted. </li>
<li>Bonuses are awarded to doctors for withholding treatment. </li>
<li>Patients are forced out of hospitals before they&#185;re fully recovered. </li>
<li>Registered nurses are replaced with less qualified, low-wage workers to care for patients. </li>
<li>Medical staffing is cut while doctors and nurses are assigned more patients. </li>
</ul>
<p>These practices are reaping lots of profits for giant health corporations. But the result for patients 
has been tragic, causing unnecessary injury and even death. </p>
<p>That's why over 800,000 California voters, led by the California Nurses Association and Prop 
103's Harvey Rosenfield, and endorsed by consumer advocate Ralph Nader, have joined 
together to pass the Patient Protection Act -- your health care bill of rights. Proposition 216 is 
your best chance to safeguard your right to quality health care, and to prevent unsafe and 
substandard medical care. </p>
<p>With the health care industry profit margins soaring by more than 300% since 1990, corporate 
opponents of Prop 216 will try to frighten voters about &quot;big government, more taxes.&quot; The 
insurers and HMOs know that their best chance to stop the Patient Protection Act is to create 
voter fear and confusion. They've already started spending millions of dollars to do exactly that -- 
and every cent they spend is subtracted from the health care you receive. </p>
<p>It's time for Californians to restore balance and accountability to an out-of-control health system 
that's risking patient lives and sacrificing quality care in greed-blinded pursuit of profits. It's time to 
put doctors, nurses, and patients back in control of our health system. It's time to put the caring 
back in health care. Vote YES on Proposition 216 this November for real patient protection.</p>
<h3><b>Proposition 216</b></h3>
<p><strong>The Patient Protection Act</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Outlaws bonuses to doctors for withholding treatment. </li>
<li>Bans &quot;Gag Rules&quot; restricting physicians and nurses from discussing treatment options with 
patients. </li>
<li>Establishes safe staffing levels for hospitals and nursing homes. Restricts the provision of 
patient care by inadequately trained personnel. </li>
<li>Ends denial of recommended medical treatment because it's &quot;too expensive&quot; or not offered 
by the HMO; requires written explanation and qualified second opinion for denial of claims. </li>
<li>Establishes a self-funded independent consumer watchdog group; requires industry 
disclosure of safety and financial data. </li>
<li>Bans the sale of your private medical records without your permission. </li>
<li>Requires detailed justification for increases in your premiums. </li>
<li>Pays for itself 100% by placing penalty fees on excessive HMO executive pay and 
multi-billion dollar mergers. This will fund all the costs for enforcing the Act, and will also 
help cover crucial community emergency and disease prevention programs. </li>
<li>Prevents industry-funded politicians from easily overriding these reforms in the Legislature 
once California voters have approved them. </li>

<h2>Gouging Patients Taking Thyroid Hormone<br>
Synthroid [Levothyroxine Sodium] by Knoll Pharmaceuticals</h2>

<hr>

<p>In 1962, amendments to the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act required that safety and efficacy data be provided for all 
pharmaceuticals, with the exception of those marketed prior to 1938. However, if the manufacturer wished to change the 
indications or dosage form of a pre-1938 drug, a full safety and efficacy application, known as a New Drug Application, 
would have to be submitted. In 1978, the last year for which data are available, the FDA estimated that 240 of the pre-1938 
pharmaceuticals are being manufactured. Of these, only 45 had submitted safety and efficacy data in New Drug Applications, 
in most instances for not all dosage forms of the medication. FDA&#146;s failure to conduct such a review has permitted these 
medicationsto remain largely unregulated.</p>
<p>Levothyroxine is a medication used to replace thyroid hormone in patients with low levels of the hormone (hypothyroidism). It 
is sold today as Synthroid, the fourth-most commonly prescribed drug in the United States with annual wholesale sales of 
$276 million. This drug has never been subject to FDA review.</p>
<p>Because there is no FDA-approved standard for bioequivalence (suitability for substitution), Synthroid has captured 85 
percent of the U.S. market for levothyroxine. Synthroid&#146;s manufacturer, Knoll Pharmaceuticals Company of Mount Olive, 
New Jersey, is using the absence of a bioequivalence standard to protect its market share by misleading doctors and 
pharmacists in glossy promotional materials that proclaim that there is &quot;No proven bioequivalent product&quot;, &quot;There is no 
substitute for Synthroid&quot; and &quot;No adequate and well-controlled studies have demonstrated bioequivalence among 
levothyroxine sodium products. &quot; E.g. see advertisement from Drug Topics, April 22, 1996. These statements are only 
possible because the FDA has not adequately regulated levothyroxine.</p>
<p>FDA&#146;s failure to regulate has also permitted the outrageous chain of events related to Synthroid outlined in the Wall Street 
Journal on April 25, 1996. In summary, in 1986, Knoll approached researchers at the University of California, San Francisco 
(UCSF) to do a study comparing the bioequivalence of four brands of levothyroxine, including Knoll&#146;s own formulation, 
Synthroid. During the course of events described here, the company was known first as Flint Laboratories, Inc., then as Boots 
Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and finally as Knoll Pharmaceutical Company. The research, completed in 1990, found the four forms 
of levothyroxine (two brand name and two generic) to be &quot;bioequivalent&quot; and a manuscript reporting this was submitted to and 
accepted for publication by the prestigious Journal of the American Medical Association in late 1994. However, fearing a 
threatened lawsuit from Knoll, which had signed a contract with UCSF preventing the researchers from publishing any data 
without Knoll&#146;s permission, UCSF pressured its own researchers to withdraw the manuscript one day prior to the journal&#146;s 
going to press. Subsequently, Knoll employees produced a new manuscript based on the UCSF data claiming that the UCSF 
study was flawed and that the four levothyroxine preparations were &quot;therapeutically inequivalent.&quot; A paper reflecting this 
perspective was published in June 1995 under the title &quot;Limitations of levothyroxine bioequivalence evaluation: analysis of an 
attempted study&quot; in the obscure American Journal of Therapeutics, whose Associate Editor is the first author on the revised 
manuscript. The publication of this latter manuscript, which did not include any of the UCSF researchers as co-authors, may 
well preclude publication of the version accepted by the Journal of the American Medical Association.</p>
<p>The cost implications of this perversion of the scientific process are staggering. While most medications that lose patent 
protection (which usually occurs 17 years after the patent is filed) rapidly lose market share, in 1993 Synthroid still retained 85 
percent or $235 million of the $276 million wholesale levothyroxine market, even though levothyroxine was initially marketed 
over half a century ago. If, as a result of these important findings being made public, Knoll&#146;s market share had fallen to 25 
percent of prescriptions -- comparable to the market share of Valium about a decade after it lost patent -- at least $258 
million (wholesale) would have been saved between 1993, by which time the results should have been published, and the 
present. However, thanks to Knoll&#146;s heavy-handed tactics and UCSF&#146;s failure to resist them, physicians and patients have 
been denied this basic information and American consumers have paid the price.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, another reason that Knoll has cornered such a disproportionate share of the market is that, except for 
standards governing Good Manufacturing Practice, the FDA has failed to regulate levothyroxine bioequivalence or on how 
studies to assess bioequivalence should be conducted, has permitted the perpetuation of myths of generic levothyroxine 
inferiority. This is not the first time levothyroxine bioequivalence has been an issue. In 1982, for example, Knoll reformulated 
Synthroid. Many patients ended up receiving inordinately high doses of Synthroid because the pre-1982 formulation of 
Synthroid had contained only about 78 percent of the expected potency. Stoffer SS, Szunar WE. Potency of levothyroxine 
products. Journal of the American Medical Association 1984; 251: 635-636. Although bioequivalence standards exist for 
most drugs marketed in the United States, levothyroxine&#146;s status as a pre-1938 drug has allowed it to evade adequate 
regulation.</p>
<p>The events described in the Wall Street Journal date back to March 1986 when Drs. Betty J. Dong and Francis S. Greenspan 
at UCSF&#146;s Schools of Pharmacy and Medicine were approached by Knoll and asked to conduct a clinical trial comparing 
Synthroid to three other forms of levothyroxine. By February 1988, the study had been designed and had the approval of 
both Knoll and UCSF&#146;s Committee on Human Research. A contract to perform the work was signed in May 1988. The 
contract stipulated the study design and methods of statistical analysis, consistent with standard methods for bioequivalence 
determination. The contract also contained the following sentence: &quot;Data obtained by the investigator while carrying out this 
study is [sic] also considered confidential and is not to be published or otherwise released without consent from Flint 
Laboratories, Inc.&quot; (later known as Knoll). The contract was so similar to other pharmaceutical company contracts being 
routinely approved by UCSF (and other institutions), that Dr. Dong was not required to pass it through UCSF&#146;s Contracts 
and Grants office prior to signing it. UCSF&#146;s legal counsel at the time, Joe Cowan, JD, reviewed the contract on several 
occasions after it had been signed but before problems arose with Knoll, and stated that it would not represent a barrier to 
publication and that the university would defend her should any problems arise. (Subsequently, in the Fall of 1995, UCSF 
issued guidelines urging researchers not to sign contracts with clauses precluding publication without the sponsor&#146;s approval. 
However, such gag clauses may still be employed at other universities.)</p>
<p>Between 1988 and June 1990, the study was conducted according to the guidelines described in the contract, whereupon the 
study blood samples were sent to the University of Chicago for analysis. These results were provided to Knoll and the UCSF 
authors in December 1990. It was only when the results of the study became available that Knoll began to raise questions 
about the conduct of the study and its interpretation, a controversy that would continue for four years. Some of Knoll&#146;s 
comments were incorporated into the manuscript being prepared by Dr. Dong and her colleagues. Apparently dissatisfied, on 
March 4, 1994 Knoll Senior Vice President for Research and Development, Neil M. Kurtz, M.D., wrote to Dr. Dong and 
several members of the UCSF faculty and staff, including the Chancellor, all the Vice-Chancellors, and the Chairpersons of 
Medicine, Family and Community Medicine, and Pharmacy, as well as the Director of UCSF&#146;s Program in Medical Ethics. 
The letter argued that the study had been flawed and should not be published. On August 5, 1994, UCSF Associate 
Vice-Chancellor for Academic Affairs Karl J. Hittleman, PhD, wrote to Knoll&#146;s Dr. Kurtz refusing to suppress the manuscript 
and saying that to do so would be a violation of academic freedom. In November 1994, the manuscript was submitted to the 
Journal of the American Medical Association.</p>
<p>Dr. Dong&#146;s manuscript, entitled &quot;Bioequivalence of generic and brand levothyroxine products in the treatment of 
hypothyroidism&quot; was randomized, four-way crossover trial comparing the bioavailability of four levothyroxine preparations: 
Synthroid (Knoll), Levoxine (Daniels), and two generic formulations manufactured by Pharmaceutical Basics and distributed 
by Geneva Generics and Rugby. Subjects received all four brands of levothyroxine for a period of at least six weeks in a 
randomly assigned sequence that ensured that potential carryover effects from the previous formulation would introduce no 
bias into the evaluation. Primary investigators were blinded were blinded as to which formulation the subjects were taking at 
any given time.</p>
<p>Three aspects of bioequivalence (area under the curve, peak serum concentration, and time to peak serum concentration) 
were measured for each of three indices of thyroid function (T4 (levothyroxine), T3, and free T4 index). For all nine 
comparisons, there was no statistically significant difference between the four formulations, indicating that they were 
bioequivalent, even using a criterion for bioequivalence considerably more stringent than that employed by the FDA for other 
compounds. The authors concluded that the four generic and brand levothyroxine preparations studied were bioquivalent and 
interchangeable for most patients taking levothyroxine hormone.</p>
<p>In the Fall of 1994, Gilbert H. Mayor, M.D., Senior Director of Medical Research at Knoll, called Dr. Greenspan and 
threatened a lawsuit against both UCSF and the authors should the manuscript be published. In December 1994, Dr. Dong&#146;s 
paper was accepted for publication in the Journal of the American Medical Association following review by five peer 
reviewers, more than usually review manuscripts for the Journal. One day prior to the date on which that issue of the journal 
was to go to print, and with her article already in galleys, Dr. Dong received a telephone call from Cynthia Lynch, J.D., 
assistant to Shelley Drake, the campus counsel who had succeeded Joe Cowan in dealing with this issue. Ms. Lynch insisted 
that Dr. Cong withdraw the article from publication, and stated that UCSF would not represent the authors should they be 
sued by Knoll. Consequently, Dr. Dong was compelled to contact the journal and ask that the article be removed.</p>
<p>The Journal stated verbally that it would accept the article if it were resubmitted. However, the threat of a lawsuit and UCSF&#146;s 
refusal to defend its own researchers against such a suit have dissuaded the researchers from resubmitting. Dr. Dong has 
sought redress within the UCSF system, but in the Fall of 1995 was denied a hearing on this issue before the university&#146;s 
Promotion and Tenure Committee.</p>
<p>In June 1995, the American Journal of Therapeutics, a journal not even listed in the medical journal computer database 
MedLine, published an article entitled &quot;Limitations of levothyroxine bioequivalence evaluation: analysis of an attempted study,&quot; 
which was based upon the data generated by Dr. Dong and her colleagues (see attached). The authors were two Knoll 
employees, Drs. Mayor and Kurtz, and Dr. Tony Orlando of Pharmaco LSR in Austin, TX, who had previously worked for 
Knoll. Dr. Mayor is one of two Associate Editors of the American Journal of Therapeutics and also has responsibility for its 
endocrinology section. None of the UCSF researchers were included as authors, nor were they included in a lengthy 
Acknowledgments section.</p>
<p>This article came to markedly different conclusions from Dr. Dong&#146;s paper. Using the same data as those used by the UCSF 
researchers, the Knoll researchers assessed thyroid function using two methods: 1) with no correction for baseline values (the 
method used by the UCSF researchers); and 2) with correction for baseline values. Correcting for baseline, although 
controversial, is not customary in assessing the bioequivalence of drugs that are natural substances produced by the human 
body. In diseases such as hypothyroidism, such substances may still be produced by the body, but at lower than normal 
levels. Indeed, thyroid hormone production by the thyroid gland is essentially turned off when replacement thyroid hormone is 
given. Due to the impossibility of distinguishing the body&#146;s own hormone from that in the drug on chemical assays, baseline 
correction can not easily be done. In addition, the complex feedback mechanisms that the body uses to regulate hormone 
levels make the uncorrected measurement the one most consistent with how the body actually functions. One result of 
inappropriate baseline correction can be negative values for the corrected variables, as occurred in the Knoll paper, a finding 
that has no biological meaning.</p>
<p>There are two major reasons for the apparent discrepancy between the two papers: 1) the issue of baseline correction; and 2) 
the Knoll paper also included data on another index of thyroid function, TSH, the measurement of which produced most of 
the differences between the formulations. TSH would probably not be included in any FDA requirement for establishing the 
bioequivalence of levothyroxine. This is because establishing bioequivalence does not require demonstrating that the drug is 
effective (this should already have been done by the brand name company); the generic company need only demonstrate that 
similar quantities of the drug are released into the blood stream. Thus T4, T3, and free T4 index would very likely be 
components of levothyroxine bioequivalence testing, but TSH, which measures levothyroxine effectiveness, would not. The 
first analysis came to similar conclusions to Dr. Dong: the formulations &quot;[appeared] to be bioequivalent.&quot; The second analysis, 
however, resulted in many findings of differences between the four products, suggesting lack of bioequivalence. The article 
went on to list in exhaustive detail various purported limitations of the study and, in a highly unusual half-page table, listed these 
&quot;major study limitations.&quot; The study, the article said, had &quot;encountered numerous and often unpredictable difficulties in 
execution&quot; and these difficulties &quot;were too numerous and substantive to consider this a definitive bioequivalence study.&quot; The 
authors concluded that &quot;the levothyroxine products studied, although appearing to be bioequivalent, were, in fact, 
therapeutically inequivalent.&quot; The net effect of these statistical manipulations was to call the UCSF paper&#146;s findings into 
question. This would not have been possible had the FDA exercised its authority to adequately regulate levothyroxine, 
including establishing clear standards for bioequivalence determination.</p>
<p>In sum, Knoll sponsored a research study and, when it found the conclusions to not be to its taste, embarked upon a 
campaign of scientific distortion and legal threats. Six years after the study&#146;s completion, and over one year since it passed 
peer review in a prestigious medical journal, the investigators&#146; manuscript has still not been published, and, due to Knoll&#146;s 
publication of its own self-serving article, may now not be publishable. These events would not have occurred had the FDA 
adequately regulated levothyroxine and provided adequate guidelines on bioequivalence determination. The FDA has 
essentially permitted the pharmaceutical industry to regulate itself in this area, with predictable consequences. However, the 
suppression of these findings, which have enormous implications for the practice of clinical medicine and cost-containment, 
would not have occurred had UCSF not failed to review the contract and then succumbed to the gag clause, thereby sounding 
a retreat from the time-honored principle of academic freedom. The public has been ill-served by both of these institutions. 
Now it is time for the FDA to prevent any further pharmaceutical company manipulation by extending the safety and efficacy 
regulations to include drugs marketed prior to 1938. Hundreds of millions of consumer dollars a year are at stake and the 
FDA has not taken any action.</p>

<h2>The Development of Consumer Rights in the United States Slowed by the Power of Corporate 
Political Contributions and Lobbying<br>
</h2>
<h4>By Richard Alexander, Esq.</h4>

<hr>


<p>Classical economic theory holds that buyers and sellers are equal in rights, responsibilities and power. To be equal means that the consumer must not only be well 
informed, but also be able to exercise and enforce legal rights, and have the benefit of laws will that protect the consumer from abuse by sellers and manufacturers. 
While it is true that consumers as a group have the potential to influence the market with their buying decisions, individual buyers have no such power and sellers in 
large part control the modern market through domination and control of the legislative process, the pace of appellate judicial decisions, executive rule-making, and 
media markets.</p>
<p>The development of consumer protection statutes in the United States clearly demonstrates the immense political power of American corporations to slow and stifle 
the advancement of consumer rights by precluding the adoption of common sense laws for decades through the legalized influence peddling that passes for the 
American political process.</p>
<p>First, through lobbying and industry political contributions, the rules of the legal game are written by industry insiders, lobbyists, and political contributors in the back 
rooms of Congress and legislatures across the U.S. Citizen groups have little political influence because they cannot compete financially with Political Action 
Committees controlled by major corporations and industry associations and only have the power of public disclosure to counter-balance the significant control that 
business has over the legislative drafting process.</p>
<p>Second, the average consumer does not have the foggiest idea of the administrative law process in the U.S. where substantial laws are written by government 
agencies which have been delegated the power to micro-manage specific subjects, such as automobile safety [National Highway Traffic Safety Administration], 
pesticides [Environmental Protection Agency] and pharmaceuticals [Food and Drug Administration]. These agencies engaged in sophisticated rule making that takes 
places over long periods of time and which requires the highest level of sophistication. The administrative law process of giving notice of proposed rule making, 
comments, hearings and later court challenges to contest the scope of governmental rules and regulations results in substantial power to those who can stay the 
course and dedicate the time and resources to the process, i.e. corporate law departments, industry associations and industry lobbyists.</p>
<p>Third, corporate America has the resources and staying power to take legal action to delay the implementation of both new rules and to contest the application of 
those rules well beyond the ability of any average person. </p>
<p>For example, when EPA challenged Dow and other major pesticide manufacturers in the early 1970s to halt the production of 2,4 D and 2,4,5 TP, pesticides 
known to have been contaminated with deadly dioxins and furans, the industry fought administrative proceedings for nearly six years before voluntarily quitting - 
once its supply of in-house product had been sold and shelves cleared by sending the goods outside of the country. This delaying action was taken even though 
DOW's own research showed that other chlorinated pesticides were so contaminated by the manufacturing process that its own workers developed signs of 
chemical toxicity in the form of chloracne and the company itself reformulated its pentachlorophenol product, Dowicide 7, and renamed it Dowicide EC-7 [extra 
clean] after the Michigan legislature had ruled the use of Dowicide 7 illegal in Dow's home state. </p>
<p>Fourth, the general negligence and product liability laws of most states do not protect consumers from defective products except in cases where, after the fact, the 
product has caused injury or death. </p>
<p>Suing a corporate manufacturer for selling defective products in the absence of injury requires proof of fraud, deception in the sale, or breach of warranties. The 
terms and conditions of warranties are set at a minimum base level by the Uniform Commercial Code which has been adopted by all states but beyond that set of 
promises all manufacturers limit any additional obligations to consumers.</p>
<p>Fifth, the economics of litigation provide corporations and large multi-national companies with overwhelming advantages in controlling the development of appellate 
decisions that influence and control the authority and power of trial courts. Because corporations have a perpetual stake in the development of the law they readily 
take appeals when it suits their business purpose. Individuals on the other hand only take appeals when they can afford to do so and when they must. The absence 
of civil public advocates for consumer interests as friends of the court is reflected in a distinct pro-corporate bias in the law. </p>
<p>Sixth, secret settlements and &quot;gag&quot; orders imposed as a condition of settlements limit the public's knowledge of what products are dangerous. Under federal law 
certain defective products that cause injuries and result in settlements must be reported to the Consumer Product Safety Commission, but this statute has limited 
application to consumer, toys and household goods.</p>
<p>On the plus side one state provides consumers with a set of valuable legal rights, namely California's Consumer Legal Remedies Act which has yet to be adopted by 
other states or by the United States government. The CLRA provides valuable consumer protections and, equally important, special legal procedures to expedite 
the court's ability to order consumer relief when there are abuses with a minimum of legal complications. </p>
<p>Consumer advocates have sought to raise the consciousness of consumers and to create a body of law to protect consumers but public advocates suffering from 
minimal funding have had a much lesser impact than the corporate lobbyists. In large part the development of law by Congress, state legislatures, administrative 
governmental offices at the federal and state level and the courts has been orchestrated and controlled by multi-national corporations, who write the rules of the 
game and the only times when consumers are successful is when the power of an idea is so overwhelming that not even the most jaded politician can vote against the 
public interest on an issue that has attained high public visibility.</p>
<p>The strongest tools employed by consumers include lobbying, publicity by consumer organizations and class action lawsuits, an extremely powerful tool for 
correcting cases of consumer abuse that is much hated by American business, in which the private bar serves as private prosecutors of corporate wrongdoing under 
the control of trial court judges.</p>
<p>On the other side of the ledger, public relations techniques are effectively used by corporations to maintain the ability of the corporation to plausibly deny reality or 
to develop &quot;science&quot; that aids and abets corporate profiteering.</p>
<p>For example, Dow Chemical Company has exploited &quot;research findings&quot; influenced, controlled or funded by breast implant manufacturers to develop a base of 
questionable data upon which to claim that silicon breast implants are safe. These studies are &quot;low powered&quot; epidemiological studies which in rigorous scientific 
circles are recognized as having limited value. They are the equivalent of using opera glasses to look for the moons of distant plants and then claim that there are no 
moons of Jupiter to be seen with such devices, which is absolutely true, but which at the same time can be readily contradicted by the use of a precision telescope 
designed and capable of spotting such distant celestial objects. </p>
<p>American tobacco companies have been grossly successful in buying time from being outlawed. Thousands of Americans die annually from tobacco-related 
illnesses, and cigarettes are the cause, which is not disputed by the federal government and medical professionals. Yet cigarettes are successfully sold at great profit 
because the companies have funded &quot;research&quot; to create a false controversy about the health implications of tobacco which gives them the &quot;cover&quot; to claim that the 
evidence against tobacco is not conclusive. Others have labeled this phenomenon as &quot;cigarette science.&quot; - clearly science in name only that advances industry profits 
at the expense of the public and consumers. </p>
<p>The U.S. consumer movement that came to blossom in the 1960s has its foundation in the development of the common law which first recognized in the 1950s a 
new and significant legal doctrine in cases of personal injury caused by defective products. </p>
<p>Product liability law, first known as strict liability in tort, was the first significant recognition that when mass produced products are used in normal fashion and failure 
to perform as expected or when they are designed in such a fashion as to be unreasonably dangerous, a injured person need not prove that the seller was negligent, 
but instead can hold the seller and manufacturer legally responsible upon a showing that the defective product caused their injury. </p>
<p>This legal development was a giant step forward for the average consumer who totally relies on manufacturers in producing a wide range of consumer products. </p>
<p>It was from this theoretical foundation that the consumer movement developed. As consumer attorney Ralph Nader noted &quot;the best way to ask society how the 
economy is doing is to measure the health, safety and economic well-being of consumers.&quot; </p>
<p>Health, safety and economic well-being became the touchstone of consumerism but it is significant to note that the concepts spring from the common law . Mr. 
Nader's training as a lawyer and his enunciation of consumerism clearly set forth the common law legal standard that marked safety and health policies underlying 
injury and death cases caused by defective products.</p>
<p>It is this expanded definition of consumerism, well beyond a strict economic value, which includes considerations of health and safety that has become the backbone 
of consumerism today.</p>
<p>In 1962 President John F. Kennedy declared four basic consumer rights which institutionalized and expanded consumer expectations in the United States to include 
the right to safety, the right to be informed, the right to choose and the right to be heard. </p>
<p>While this is clearly a benchmark in the consumer movement, it was not until consumer activists began to have an official role in government as consumer counsel 
that a public pulpit and allowed the consumer movement to have a legitimate voice and a modern identity. With the growing recognition of consumer rights, the 
American political system began moving towards developing a statutory framework to address consumer issues. But throughout the process he hallmark of 
consumer protection laws has been the role of business and industry to impede the adoption of safety standards and to delay advancement of salutary health and 
safety mandates, often times for decades.</p>
<p>As the following partial list shows the rate of adoption of new consumer protection statutes has gained momentum as the pubic has been forced by circumstances to 
recognize the need to counter-balance the runaway authority and control of large business in the marketplace over largely helpless consumers. Nonetheless, as this 
partial list shows, the political clout of business and industry has slowed the passage and adoption of safety and consumer protection laws to suit the demands of 
corporate interests. At virtually every juncture the recognition of consumers rights has been kept at a snail's pace to accommodate the interests of manufacturers and 
sellers whose political contributions far exceed those of the average voter. There is no better case for the reform of the political campaign funding laws than that 
evidenced by the controlled development of consumers' protection statutes by American business.</p>

<h2>Restitution in Criminal Cases - A Victim's Perspective</h2>
<p><strong>By Martin H. Plone, D.V.M.</strong></p>
<hr>
<p><font size=2>Dr. Plone is a practicing doctor of veterinary medicine in Livermore, California, who was a victim of fraud resulting in 
loss of virtually his entire life's savings. Representing himself he was successful in recovering a significant amount 
of his losses from third parties, i.e. sources other than the defendant, through civil actions and by enforcing a 
restitution order imposed in his favor as a civil judgment. He has studied California statutes and case law. Although 
not an attorney, this article contains a good collection of the cases and statutes that control restitution for victims of 
crime in California. This article is presented as an overview of the general law of restitution in California with Dr. 
Plone's permission. The information contained here is not legal advice, should not be relied upon for that purpose 
and is not warranted as a correct statement of California law, but rather is offered because it is a commendable effort 
by someone without legal training. Dr. Plone's article deserves publication because it shows that victims of crime can 
take full advantage of the law and that individuals can use the power of the law and courts to obtain restitution 
without the services of an attorney. Dr. Plone deserves credit for fighting back and obtaining the restitution to which 
he was entitled. We applaud his efforts, his offering to share what he has learned, and his willingness to serve as a 
role model for others.</font></p>

<p><br>
<strong>HISTORY OF RESTITUTION IN CALIFORNIA</strong><br>
<br>
In 1965, the California Legislature created a special fund to provide compensation to victims of violent 
crime. After several revisions, the statutory scheme provided among other things, for financial assistance 
from the restitution fund for medical expenses and lost wages to victims of violent crimes, with a 
maximum of $10,000 in each category (Penal Code Section 13965). A new statute, Penal Code 
Section 13967, authorized a court-ordered fine up to $10,000, to be paid into the restitution fund by 
any criminal defendant convicted of a violent crime that caused injury or death to the victim. Penal 
Code Section 13960 defined the term &quot;victim.&quot;<br>
<br>
In 1982, the voters of California passed Proposition 8, an initiative to reform the state's criminal justice 
system. The initiative included an amendment to the Constitution: &quot;It is the unequivocal intention of the 
People of the State of California that all persons who suffer losses as a result of criminal activity shall 
have the right to restitution from the persons convicted of the crimes for losses they suffer. Restitution 
shall be ordered from the convicted persons in every case, regardless of the sentence or disposition 
imposed, in which a crime victim suffers a loss, unless clear and extraordinary reasons exist to the 
contrary.&quot; California Constitution, Article 1, Section 28(b). The amendment directed the Legislation to 
adopt implementing legislation.<br>
<br>
The new legislation, enacted in 1983, included Penal Code Section 1203.4, requiring trial courts to 
order restitution from defendants convicted of crimes and placed on probation; Welfare and Institutions 
Codes Section 729.6, imposing a similar requirement in all juvenile delinquency matters; Penal Code 
Section 1202.4, requiring all persons convicted of a felony to pay a &quot;restitution fine&quot; of up to $10,000, 
payable into the restitution fund for victims of violent crime; and several laws designed to aid victims 
filing civil actions against persons convicted of crimes. (Government Code Section 26820.4(b); 
Government Code Section 72055(c); Code of Civil Procedure Sections 37, 340.3 and 1021.4; Penal 
Code Section 1191.2; former Welfare and Institution Code Section 656.2, now Penal Code Section 
679.02.<br>
<br>
The Legislature also amended Government Code Section 13967 to provide that in every criminal case, 
a person convicted of a crime must pay &quot;restitution in the form of a penalty assessment&quot; to the state and 
the county in which the offense was committed. Curiously, the Legislature did not enact legislation either 
requiring or authorizing trial courts to order defendants who were convicted of crimes but were not 
given probation to make restitution to any of the victims of their crimes. In such cases, victims of violent 
crimes had an indirect restitution remedy through the restitution fund article 1, but victims of nonviolent 
crimes had no recourse other than to sue the person who committed the crime.<br>
<br>
This legislative omission was noted in People v. Downing (1985) 174 Cal.App.3d 667, 672. In 1986, 
the Legislature responded with the passage of Government Code Section 13967(c) which provided for 
restitution when probation was denied up to a total of $10,000 in lieu of or imposing all or a portion of 
the restitution fine as dictated in subdivision (a).<br>
<br>
In 1990, the code was amended to allow for restitution for the full amount of the loss suffered by the 
victim from the criminal conduct of the defendant. Assembly Bill 3169 signed into law on September 
28, 1994, among other changes, placed Government Code Section 13967 in Penal Code Section 
1202.4. The provisions of Penal Code Section 1203.4 was amended and also moved into Penal Code 
Section 1202.4 on August 3, 1995.<br>
<br>
<strong>FORMER CODES</strong><br>
<br>
Government Code Section 13967(c), dictates that when probation is denied, restitution shall be 
imposed in the amount of the losses, as determined. Losses are defined in Government Code Section 
13960. The court shall order full restitution unless it finds clear and compelling reasons for not doing so, 
and states them on the record. A restitution order imposed pursuant to this subdivision shall identify the 
losses to which it pertains, and shall be enforceable as a civil judgment. Restitution ordered pursuant to 
this subdivision shall, to the extent possible, be of a dollar amount that is sufficient to fully reimburse the 
victim, or victims, for all determined economic losses incurred as the result of the defendant's criminal 
conduct (emphasis added). When restitution as a condition of probation is ordered, then Penal Code 
Section 1203.04 controls.<br>
<br>
<strong>CURRENT CODE</strong><br>
<br>
Restitution is addressed in Penal Code Section 1202.4(f),(g) and (h). Losses are defined in Penal Code 
1202.4(g) which also removes the court's ability to consider indemnification or subrogation rights in 
determining the total amount of the victim's losses. However, these changes only apply to crimes 
committed after the provisions of Penal Code Section 1202.4 became law. For crimes committed 
before then, the former code sections will still apply.<br>
<br>
<strong>VICTIM'S RIGHTS</strong><br>
<br>
&quot;The Legislature left no discretion or authority with the trial court or the prosecution to bargain away the 
victim's constitutional and statutory right to restitution. As such, it cannot properly be the subject of plea 
negotiations.&quot; People v. Valdez (1994) 24 Cal.App.4th 1194, 1203. Victims must be notified and be 
given the opportunity to attend all restitution hearings. Melissa J. v. Superior Court (1987) 190 
Cal.App.3rd. 476.<br>
<br>
Appellate courts have concluded that when restitution has different functions depending on if the 
defendant is granted or denied probation. &quot;When restitution is imposed as a condition of probation 
under Section 1203 et seq., rehabilitation of the criminal is the primary goal of restitution [Citation.] 
&quot;Implicit in the concept of rehabilitation is the need to first deter criminal activity. Courts have generally 
found an order requiring the defendant to compensate the victim to be a deterrent to future activity. 
[Citations.]. &quot;In contrast &quot;Government Code Section 13967 is designed to compensate crime victims 
for economic losses suffered as a direct result of a crime.&quot; [Citations.] Although rehabilitation is an 
ancillary purpose of a restitution award under this section, the primary purpose is to compensate 
California residents who suffer a loss as a result of crime.&quot; People v. Foster (1993) 939, 950.<br>
<br>
It is seriously doubted that most victims would agree with this interpretation. From the standpoint of 
victims and society, all three functions are equally important regardless of the disposition of the 
defendant. The victim has no control if the defendant is incarcerated or given probation. However, the 
appellate courts and the Legislature have overlooked a primary function of restitution; to reimburse 
victims of crime and not subject victims to the costs and rigors of the civil process to obtain an order for 
the same losses suffered for which restitution is imposed that is enforceable as a civil judgment. The 
area was visited briefly in People v. Broussard (1993) 5 Cal.4th 1067, 1073, and People v. Downing 
(1985) 174 Cal.App. 667, 674.<br>
<br>
One of the anomalies of restitution is that the term &quot;victim&quot; and &quot;losses&quot; are defined in Government 
Code Section 13960 for the purposes of restitution when probation is denied, but is not defined in any 
code when probation is granted pursuant to Penal Code Section 1203.04. The Foster court found no 
conflict with this statutory scheme and on page 953, suggested it was the result of legislative intent. If 
that is true, then the Legislature has created two classes of victims, one having an economic advantage 
over the other. The area of restitution with regards to insurance companies and interest discussed later 
exemplifies this. There is nothing in the language of Article 1, Section 28(b) to suggest that was the 
intent of the voters in passing Proposition 8.<br>
<br>
Economic losses encompass the losses for which restitution has been imposed include: past and future 
medical care, People v. Phelps (1996) 96 D.A.R. 405; loss of wages, People v. Nguyen (1994) 23 
Cal.App.4th 32, 42-45, loss of profits, People v. Tucker (1995) D.A.R. 9954, time spent in identifying 
and recovering losses, People v. Nilsen 96 D.A.R. 407. Principal; replacement or repair cost of the 
property taken or damaged, attorney's fees and costs incurred in recovering the loss, mileage and 
expenses incurred in attending interviews with prosecutors and attending hearings are losses that would 
be allowed pursuant to Government Code Section 13960 and/or Penal Code Section 1203.04. 
Restitution may be imposed on dismissed counts if the plea is freely made, all conditions are approved 
by the court and a Harvey waiver is obtained. People v. Beck 17 Cal.App.4th 209, 215. Also see 
Penal Code Section 1192.3.<br>
<br>
The loss of the use of money is a pecuniary loss for which the victim should be compensated. As a 
restitution order is enforceable as a civil judgment and civil judgments accrue post-judgment interest at 
10% pursuant to C.C.P. Section 685.010(a), it would flow that restitution orders pursuant to Penal 
Code Section 1202.4 should also. Judgment against an incarcerated defendant in a civil action would 
accrue post-judgment interest. Post-judgment interest accrues, at the discretion of the court, when the 
defendant is ordered to pay restitution as a condition of probation pursuant to Penal Code Section 
1214.5, yet there is no statutory or case authority to do so when the defendant is incarcerated, although 
some trial courts do, again crating two classes of victims with one having an economic advantage over 
the other.<br>
<br>
This would appear to be in conflict with the appellate court decisions that have held that when a 
defendant is denied probation and incarcerated, the purpose is to compensate victims for the economic 
loss caused by crime. Financial rape is often as emotionally and financially devastating as physical rape. 
For those who invest funds to earn interest to live on, especially the retired, the loss of the ability to earn 
interest is a severe economic loss that greatly impacts their lives. It would be compensated for in a civil 
action and should be in all restitution orders.<br>
<br>
Government Code Section 13960(d)(3) includes in the meaning of &quot;pecuniary loss&quot;, &quot;the loss of income 
or the loss of support that the victim or the loss that the * * * derivative victim has incurred or will incur 
as a direct result of any injury or death. The Broussard court on pages 1076-1077, rejected the 
assertion that the term &quot;victim&quot; applies only to those who suffer a physical injury. In doing so, the 
Broussard court explained, &quot;the legislative history of Section 13967, subdivision (c) did not contemplate 
that the statute would be subject to section 13960's limited definition of the term victim.&quot; The same 
rational should be applied to the term &quot;pecuniary loss.&quot; As now Penal Code Section 1202.4(g)(3) 
includes wages or profits lost due to injury incurred by the victim, it should apply to lost interest. 
However, as this code section has only been in effect for several months, it will take some time before 
the provisions are interpreted by the appellate courts.<br>
<br>
There is no reason why an incarcerated criminal defendant should receive an economic advantage not 
afforded to nonincarcerated civil defendants or incarcerated civil defendants. Without the imposition of 
post-judgment interest, there is little incentive for the defendant to make payment to the victim nor does 
it deter future criminal conduct. Just because defendants are incarcerated, does not necessarily mean 
they have no financial ability pay the restitution imposed upon them or will not in the future.<br>
<br>
An argument could be made for prejudgement interest to be imposed from the date of the loss. Victims 
have no control as to the length of time once a complaint has been made until the defendant is 
sentenced, which often is months or years, yet they are deprived of the use of their money during that 
time.<br>
<br>
<strong>DEFENDANT'S RIGHTS</strong><br>
<br>
As before 1990, restitution was limited to $10,000, regardless of the number of victims or counts 
charged, for crimes committed before 1990, restitution is limited to that maximum and it is reversible 
error to impose more than $10,000. Failure to object at the time of the hearing does not waive appeal 
as a restitution order exceeding $10,000 for crime prior to 1990 is unauthorized. People v. Zito, supra 
pp. 740-742, People v. Beck, supra, p. 222.<br>
<br>
The defendant has a right to a hearing with regards to restitution. Any objections in most instances must 
be raised at the time of the hearing or appeal is waived. The amount of restitution ordered cannot 
exceed the amount of the probation officer's recommendation and the order must specifically identify 
the losses. Failure to object at the time of the hearing does not waive appeal. People v. Rezendez 
(1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 98, 110-115.<br>
<br>
It is important to victims that the trial court preserve the rights of defendant so that the restitution order 
is not reversed on appeal, which when happens, unnecessarily adds to the grief already suffered by 
victims.<br>
<br>
<strong>RESTITUTION ORDERS AND INSURANCE COMPANIES</strong><br>
<br>
The victim can seek restitution directly from the defendant and has no duty to collect from an insurer 
first. People V. Nystrom (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1177, 1182-1183.<br>
<br>
Appellate courts have traditionally held that an insurer who reimburses the victim for the loss suffered 
by the criminal conduct of the defendant who is incarcerated is not entitled to a restitution order as the 
insurer is not a direct victim of the crime. People v. Williams (1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 1520, 1524. In 
People v. Foster (1993) supra, pp. 952-953, it was held that an insurance company is treated as a 
victim under the Penal Code provisions governing restitution to a victim who has not been reimbursed 
when probation is granted. However, in People v. Sexton (1995) 33 Cal.App.4th, 64, 70-71, 
restitution to an insurer by a defendant granted probation was not upheld reasoning that an insurer has 
incurred expenses solely by virtue of a contractual duty to indemnify the direct victim and is not itself an 
object of crime and hence not a direct victim. In People v. Nilsen (1996) 96 D.A.R. 407, the defendant 
was ordered to pay direct restitution as a condition of probation to the victim's insurance company for 
fidelity bond. The Nilsen court rejected the Sexton court's findings and followed the Foster court.<br>
<br>
That an insurer be included in a restitution order under one statutory scheme, probation granted, and 
not the other when probation is denied is without merit. It makes no sense that a defendant who 
happens to fortuitously choose a victim that has insurance receive a free economic ride where if the 
victim was not insured, restitution would be imposed. This serves no function in deterring crime or 
rehabilitating the defendant which should be just as much a purpose of incarceration as probation. 
Hopefully, this anomaly has been rectified with the language of the new Penal Code Section 1202.4(g).<br>
<br>
Although rejected by the Williams court on page 1520, on a subrogation theory, there is no reason why 
a victim who has recorded an Abstract of Judgment based on the restitution order could not assign a 
potion of it to an insurer for the amount reimbursed for the loss incurred as one could in a civil action. 
While Government Code Section 13960(d) defines &quot;pecuniary loss&quot; as &quot;any expenses for which the 
victim has not or will not be reimbursed from any other source,&quot; it would seem the Legislative intent was 
to prevent double recovery by the victim, not to give an economic advantage to a defendant who is not 
prejudiced by such action.<br>
<br>
The direction legislation and the courts have been heading in the past few years should hopefully 
remedy this anomaly. However, a recent appellate decision in which the defendant was ordered to pay 
restitution as a condition of probation to the medical insurer, provider of the victim, Kaiser Health Plan, 
was decertified for publication. People v. Correia, et al. (1995) 95 D.A.R. 9855.<br>
<br>
As the new Penal Code Section 1202.4(g) allows for the court not to consider the subrogation rights of 
third parties in determining the amount of restitution, it will also take some time before the appellate 
courts address this issue.<br>
<br>
<strong>ENFORCEMENT OF A CRIMINAL RESTITUTION ORDER</strong><br>
<br>
<em>1. Recordation of an Abstract of Judgment.</em><br>
<br>
As criminal restitution orders are enforceable as civil judgments, they support the basis for recordation 
of an Abstract of Judgment. The Criminal Division of the Superior Court will supply a certified copy of 
the sentencing order free of charge to the victim which is used as the basis for recordation of an 
Abstract of Judgment. If a restitution order is unsatisfied after probation or probation is revoked, the 
restitution order converts to a civil judgment. Penal Code Section 1214.(b).<br>
<br>
An Abstract of Judgment will attach to any real property the defendant now owns or will in the future. 
C.C.P. Section 697.340(b). The Abstract of Judgment attaches to real property owned by the debtor 
and remains a lien against the property after it is transferred by the debtor and is senior to any 
subsequent lien against the property. C.C.P. Section 697.390.<br>
<br>
It is enforceable for a period of 10 years from the date of entry of the judgment. C.C.P. Sections 
683.020, 697.310(b). The judgment can be renewed for a period of an additional ten years by filing an 
application for renewal with the court after five years following entry of judgment, but prior to the 
expiration of the ten-year period. C.C.P. Sections 683.110, 683.130(a). Current proposed legislation 
will eliminate the need for renewal of criminal restitution orders and they will have a lifetime 
enforceability. The Abstract of Judgment supports a Writ of Execution for garnishment of wages and 
attachment of personal property.<br>
<br>
<em>2. Recordation of a Judgment Lien on Personal Property (Form J-1) C. C. P. Sections 697.510, 
et seq.</em><br>
<br>
The Form J-1 can be purchased at most major stationary stores and is filed with the Secretary of State. 
It is enforceable for five years and is not renewable. C.C.P. Section 697.510(b). The filing fee is $5.00. 
The form need not be accompanied by the sentencing order nor does the Secretary of State desire it.<br>
<br>
By filing the form J-1, the victim perfects his/her interest in the personal property of the defendant over 
an unsecured creditor seeking the same property. C.C.P. Section 697.600. It does not attach to motor 
vehicles, mobilehomes or commercial coaches. C.C.P. Section 697.530(d)(2).<br>
<br>
If a victim intends to enforce a restitution order, it is extremely important that an Abstract of Judgment 
be recorded in each county that the defendant lives or may live in the future as well as the Form J-1.<br>
<br>
<strong>SOURCES OF RECOVERY FOR VICTIMS OF ECONOMIC CRIME FROM OTHER 
THAN THOSE OF THE DEFENDANT</strong><br>
<br>
<em>1. Title Insurance Companies:</em><br>
<br>
If real property is involved, title companies have exposure to protect their insured from recorded, void 
documents which if declared cancelled, would affect title of their insured. A deed that is forged, signed 
in blank and later completed without the grantor's consent, and a deed that is not legally delivered is 
void, ab initio, and does not protect a bona fide purchaser or encumbrancer. Delivery of a deed does 
not mean the physical transfer of the document, but the intent of the grantor that the document be 
immediately operative. Miller &amp; Starr, supra, Section 6:43, pp. 571-575.<br>
<br>
&quot;A deed obtained as a result of fraud committed against the grantor can be rescinded and the title 
reclaimed by the grantor. Whether or not the deed is void or merely voidable depends on the nature of 
the fraud.<br>
<br>
If the grantor is aware that the instrument is a deed and that it will convey his title, but he is induced to 
execute and deliver it by fraudulent misrepresentation, there is merely fraud in the inducement. When 
this species of fraud has been committed on the grantor, the deed is only voidable and can be relied and 
enforced by a bona fide purchaser.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, if the grantor does not realize the nature of the instrument he is executing but, 
because of a fraud committed against him, he believes it to be some type of a document other than a 
deed, there is fraud in the inception. In such cases the deed is void and the title subsequently acquired 
by a bona fide purchaser is also void and unenforceable by him. Miller &amp; Starr, supra, Section 6:60, p. 
622.<br>
<br>
The measure of damages for the loss of security of real property is the value of the property on the date 
the security was lost. Grudger v. Manton (1943) 21 C.2d 537, Steven v. Herman (1964) 225 
Cal.App.2d. 671.<br>
<br>
Title insurance companies are liable to third parties for damages caused by their negligence. Seeley v. 
Seymour (1987) 191 Cal.App.3d 844, 860-862. Title insurance companies are liable for all attorney's 
fees costs to third parties for damages caused by their negligence. Prentice v. North American Title 
(1963) 59 C.2d. 618, 620.<br>
<br>
Although Proposition 51 eliminated joint and several liability for non-economic damages, it did not 
affect economic damages. Witkins, Summary of California Law, 9th (1988) &quot;Torts&quot; Section 51, p.112. 
Therefore, a title insurance company, notary, or anyone else against whom liability was apportioned 
would be a source to recover from. They in turn would have to seek indemnity form the defendant or 
other tortfeasors.<br>
<br>
Although an earlier decision reversed joint and several liability in criminal restitution orders, People v. 
Hernandez, (1991) 226 Cal.App.3d 1374, 1378, later decision have declined to follow the Hernandez 
court and have affirmed it. People v. Zito (1992) 8 Cal.App.4th 736, People v. Arnold (1994) 27 
Cal.App.4th 1096.<br>
<br>
<em>2. The Department of Real Estate, Recovery Account: (B &amp; P Code Section 10470-10481).</em><br>
<br>
If the defendant was functioning within the capacity of a licensed real estate broker, committed fraud, 
deceit and/or conversion of funds and is not able to respond to the judgment, the Recovery Account 
allows for recovery of $20,000 for each transaction and a maximum of $100,000 per broker. For most 
victims of real estate fraud, this could be an excellent source of recovery. However, attorney's fees are 
not recoverable, Rogers v. Edmonds (1988) 200 Cal.App.3d 1237, only principal, interest at the legal 
rate, costs. Temple v. Kerwin (1989) 209 Cal.App.3d 1087.<br>
<br>
The Department of Real Estate does not recognize criminal restitution orders as civil judgments for their 
purposes and requires a final judgment from a civil court although there is not statutory or case authority 
that allows them to do so. There is no reason why a victim must go to the expense of obtaining a civil 
judgment for the same loss for which restitution was imposed unless punitive damages are desired.<br>
<br>
The Department of Real Estate requires that the final order must be protected from bankruptcy. 
Restitution orders are not dischargeable in Chapter Seven bankruptcy. In Re Steiger, (1993) 159 B.R. 
907 (9th Cir.). Therefore, it is important the restitution order identify the losses.<br>
<br>
<em>3. Notaries:</em><br>
<br>
Notaries are liable for all damages caused by their negligence and malfeasance. Government Code 
Section 8214, Miller &amp; Starr, supra, Sections 6:38-6:40.<br>
<br>
<em>4. Income Tax Considerations:</em><br>
<br>
If the loss was from theft, embezzlement, conversions of funds, fraud, etc., those loses are detectable 
and carry over from year to year. The tax savings alone will be of great economic benefit. However, it 
is important the restitution order identify the losses specifically to survive an audit successfully.<br>
<br>
<strong>CIVIL CODES RELATING TO ACTIONS AGAINST CRIMINAL DEFENDANTS</strong><br>
<br>
<em>1. Code of Civil Procedure Section 340.3</em><br>
<br>
Unless a longer period is prescribed for a specific action, in any action for damages against a defendant 
based upon such person's commission of a felony offense for which the defendant has been convicted, 
the time for commencement of the action shall be within one year after judgment is pronounced...<br>
<br>
<em>2. Code of Civil Procedure Section 352.5</em><br>
<br>
If, after a cause of action accrues against a person, that person comes under an order for restitution as 
a condition of probation with respect to the specific act or omission giving rise such person's liability, 
the time during which the order is in effect is not part of the time limited for commencement of such an 
action.<br>
<br>
The two above code sections would appear to toll the statute of limitations for civil actions.<br>
<br>
<em>3. Code of Civil Procedure Section 1021.4</em><br>
<br>
In an action for damages against a defendant based upon that defendant's commission of a felony 
offense for which the defendant has been convicted, the court may, upon motion, award reasonable 
attorney's fees to a prevailing plaintiff against the defendant who has been convicted of the felony.<br>
<br>
<strong>SUMMARY</strong><br>
<br>
Restitution serves many functions; to make the victim whole for the economic losses suffered from the 
criminal acts of the defendant without having to endure the civil process; to rehabilitate the defendant by 
making him/her aware of the damage caused to the victims and society; and to deter future criminal 
activity by those who contemplate similar conduct by bringing to their attention the economic 
consequences of criminal conduct can be as severe and longer lasting than the penal consequences.<br>
<br>
This paper only touches upon restitution. Appellate court interpretation of restitution and Legislative 
amendments are an ongoing and variable process that changes daily. It is important to attorneys who 
represent criminal defendants to be aware of those changes so that trial courts do not exceed their 
authority and for attorneys who represent victims to insure full restitution for all economic losses are 
imposed upon the defendant.<br>

<h2><a name="title">Consumer Advocacy Demands National Coordination: A Call to the 
American Council on Consumer Interests</a></h2>
<h4>By Richard Alexander, Esq.</h4>
<hr><p><font size=-1>
San Jose, California attorney Richard Alexander, a National Honor Scholar at The Law School, University of Chicago, was certified as a civil trial advocate by the National Board of Trial Advocacy in 1980, has been specially recognized as a Trial Lawyer by the California Trial Lawyers Association, is a former member of the Board of Governors of The State Bar of California, currently serves as Vice President of Consumer Attorneys of California and is a founding member of the National Association of Consumer Advocates. He is the founder of <a href="http://www.alexanderlaw.com">The Alexander Law Firm</a> [http://www.alexanderlaw.com], a medium size law firm specializing in individual and class action litigation arising from negligence, toxic chemical, defective product, mass accident, environmental and fraud cases on behalf of consumers and small businesses. The firm holds Martindale-Hubbell's highest rating and is recognized in the List of Preeminent Law Firms in the United States. The firm sponsors <a href=http://consumerlawpage.com>The Consumer Law Page</a> [http://consumerlawpage.com] on the World Wide Web. Copyright Richard Alexander 1996.</font></p>
<hr>


<p><font size=2>The American Council on Consumer Interests was formed in 1953 to serve professionals working in the consumer field, primarily educators, 
researchers, extension specialists, consumer specialists in government and lawyers. This article was originally published in Advancing the 
Consumer Interest, Vol. 7, No. 2, Fall 1995, page 5.</font></p>
<hr>
<p>After having attended American Council on Consumer Interest's annual conference in March, 1995, I believe that ACCI is in an 
excellent position to bring together several groups that so far have not enjoyed a meaningful dialogue. </p>
<p>First, the people in the trenches dealing with consumers on a first hand basis, namely the legal services offices throughout the 
United States and the city and county consumer agency administrators, many of whom belong to the National Association of 
Consumer Agency Administrators (NACAA). </p>
<p>NACAA is closely affiliated with the National Association of Attorneys General, which is the second group that needs to be 
joined. All AG offices have consumer protection units, and knowing what the enforcers are doing and thinking is valuable. I 
would also include the Federal Trade Commission, Consumer Product Safety Commission, Food and Drug Administration, and 
other federal consumer organizations in this second group of top level government anti-fraud pro-consumer enforcers. </p>
<p>Government officials find it difficult to share the enforcement stage with the third group, namely the private enforcers in the form 
of consumer class action attorneys, but that is all the more reason for bringing them all together. In a world of fewer assets, 
government cannot do it all and in many cases the private bar through class actions can impose substantial discipline on the 
market place for the benefit of many consumers, freeing up government to prosecute and obtain injunctions against companies 
and individuals who cannot reimburse consumers for the damage they have caused. </p>
<p>There is also a need for a dialogue between legal service attorneys and the consumer class action bar, which is one of the 
reasons we recently initiated the National Association of Consumer Advocates to bring the legal services providers and class 
action attorneys into the same room, because we are fighting the same enemy, on the same issues, and with virtually the same 
tools, with the only major difference being the size of the units being engaged. This issue is one that will present itself whenever 
and wherever private consumer attorneys are participating, and it will happen here as well, so it is good to get it out on the table 
promptly. </p>
<p>Fourth, state and national consumer advocacy and grass roots organizations are also on the cutting edge of the latest scams and 
consumer needs. They play an enormously valuable role in reporting what is happening in he field and where government is not 
serving, or incapable of serving, consumers. </p>
<p>Finally, the expert theorists and researchers represented by ACCI are critical players in providing litigation support services as 
behind-the-scene consultants and as expert witnesses in court and in addition as researchers capable of documenting the nature 
and extent of consumer frauds reported by the field. It is one thing for a group of aggrieved citizens to complain. It is an 
extremely more potent weapon to have those grievances further documented, validated, and well articulated by rigorous 
academic researchers. </p>
<p>Beginning with the proposition that nobody has a monopoly on the truth and wisdom, I am proposing that at ACCI's next annual 
meeting the organization spotlight a special forum to stimulate everyone's thinking in response to Richard Feinberg's article &quot;Some 
Thoughts On Our Struggle To Survive&quot; in the Consumer Interests Annual of last year. His concern that the academic arena has 
had little impact on the real world and the desire of ACCI members to be relevant, to have an impact, and to make a difference 
could be addressed in several ways. </p>
<p>First, members of the National Association of Consumer Advocates could explain what are the main issues of concern for those 
providing legal services at the community level and what the private bar is attempting to accomplish in the class action arena. 
They could offer an overview on the role of class actions, the deterrence value of tort law, and the most recent scholarship from 
the field of game theory on this point, the type of cases most amenable to class treatment, the role of private enforcement in a 
period of deregulation and government funding cutbacks, and the various ways in which consumer class actions have benefited 
consumers with regard to banking services, credit cards, defective products, fraudulent sales (from light bulbs, to hearing aids, to 
contact lenses), auto leases, rent to own, and second mortgage fraud, among others. Class actions are playing an increasingly 
significant role, with breast implant and auto defect actions in cases not covered by the National Highway Traffic Safety 
Administration. </p>
<p>The point is that equal justice under law is no longer a platitude that loses its meaning in the hard reality of the economics of 
micro-level litigation when individuals try to take on America's biggest companies and find out what death-by-litigation means. 
Macro-level litigation is having an impact on millions of Americans and scores of businesses. It demonstrates the power that 
citizens can have in class actions. ACCI members need to appreciate, understand, and hopefully contribute to this national 
dialogue. </p>
<p>That leads me to my second idea. As long as we may be making the effort to bring the legal services, NACAA, and class action 
bar together, if everyone in the consumer movement (the front line dealing with consumer complaints, consumer advocacy 
groups, the government enforcers, the private bar, and the intellectual/intelligence arm) simply had an &quot;open forum&quot; in which to 
exchange ideas, that alone would make such a meeting worthwhile. But in addition I am hopeful that a real cross-fertilization, 
discussion of current issues, suggestions for research and study, and the development of new strategies would benefit everyone in 
ways that I cannot fully imagine. For creativity to take place you need critical mass. Once you achieve critical mass, watch out. 
So, imagine a special &quot;open forum&quot; in which participants from every group could have five to ten minutes just to say what's on 
their mind in terms of research, what are they working on or thinking about, current problems, and the like. We would generate 
both great ideas and the beginning of solutions that would work. </p>
<p>The potential here is exciting and ACCI is in the position to make it happen. </p>

<h3>FOOD LABELING CAMPAIGN.</h3>
<p>The National Consumer League, along with Public Voice for Food and Health Policy, has launched the &quot;Truth in Food Labeling 
Campaign.&quot; The program is designed to require identification of &quot;mechanically separated&quot; poultry. At present, products that are 
mechanically separated are labeled only as &quot;chicken&quot; or &quot;turkey,&quot; even though they may contain organs, bone, bone marrow, and 
skin. About 700 million pounds of mechanically separated poultry are used each year in foods such as hot dogs, bologna, salami, 
and some chicken nuggets. The campaign is also supported by Citizen Action and the Consumer Federation of America. For 
information, National Consumer League, 1701 K St., NW (#1200), Washington, DC 20006, 202-825-3323. </p>
<h3>LEMON ADS.</h3>
<p>The Center for Science in the Public Interest awarded its 11th annual Harlan Page Hubbard Lemon Awards for 1995 to 
companies with misleading, unfair, and irresponsible advertisements. The &quot;winners&quot; included promotion of excessive drinking, 
obscuring the true cost of an auto lease, and sample cigarettes received by people who don't smoke. For more information: 
Center for Science in the Public Interest, 1875 Connecticut Ave., NW, #300, Washington, DC 20009 (202-332-9110; e-mail: 
<a href="mailto:nah@essential.org">nah@essential.org</a>). </p>
<h3>CREDIT CARD RATES.</h3>
<p>Bankcard Holders of America reports the doubling of some credit card interest rates. Some consumers note seeing higher rates if 
they charge &quot;too much,&quot; while a bank may terminate a card if they think a consumer has not charged &quot; enough.&quot; Some consumers 
report their interest rate increased from 12.9 percent to 24.9 percent. For information: Bankcard Holders of America, 524 
Branch Dr., Salem , VA 24153; 703-389-5445. </p>
<h3>AUTO INSURANCE COSTS.</h3>
<p>The Pennsylvania Insurance Department has issued its annual Insurance Facts for Pennsylvania Consumer: Your Guide to Auto 
Insurance Premiums in Central Pennsylvania. This guide provides typical costs for various companies in selected counties. Also 
includes a question-and-answer format about various auto insurance concerns. For information: Insurance Dept., Room 1321 
Strawberry Square, Harrisburg, PA 17129, (717-787-2317). </p>
<h3>AUTO REPAIR CHANGES PROPOSED.</h3>
<p>Attorneys general from 43 states have called for reforms in the auto repair industry. The proposal calls for (1) elimination of 
contests, bonus programs, and sales quotas at repair shops; (2) disclosure when a &quot;flat-rate-manual&quot; instead of actual time is 
used to calculate the labor charge; and (3) increased disclosure to distinguish between recommended repairs and those that are 
necessary to correct the malfunction. </p>
<h3>COMMON CONSUMER COMPLAINTS.</h3>
<p>The Tennessee Division of Consumer Affairs reported the following as the most common sources of consumer complaints in 
1995; mail order, consumer credit, auto repair, home improvements, used car sales, contests, business opportunities, and lemon 
law. The efforts of this office resulted in more than one million dollars being returned to consumers last year. For information: 
Tennessee Division of Consumer Affairs, 500 James Robertson Parkway, 5th Floor, Nashville, TN 37240-0600 
(615-741-4737). </p>
<h3>INSURANCE GUIDE.</h3>
<p>The Office of Attorney General in Missouri has issued &quot;Insurance Coverage: Detecting Fraud, Long-Term Care Insurance, 
Medicare Supplemental Insurance Fraud.&quot; This brooklet offers suggestions when buying various insurance products and cautions 
consumers about potential deceptions. For information: Office of Attorney General, Box 899, Jefferson City, MO 65102 
(314-751-3321). </p>
<h3>FINANCIAL COUNSELING AND PLANNING.</h3>
<p>The 17 research-based articles in this annual journal include coverage of life cycle savings, retirement planning, homebuyers 
programs, personal economic stress, the financial well-being of older-women, financial asset ownership patters, and households 
with rent burdens. (Financial Counseling and Planning, Vol. 6, 1995, Association for Financial Counseling and Planning 
Education, 3900 East Camelback Rd., #200, Phoenix, AZ 85018; 602-912-5331; fax: 602-957-4828.) </p>
<h3>ALTERNATIVE FINANCIAL SECTOR.</h3>
<p>&quot;Lower-income consumers use a growing number of financial services including pawn shops, rent-to-own programs, 
check-cashing outlets, and rapid-refund tax services as alternatives to traditional financial services. These services constitute the 
Alternative Financial Sector (AFS). Compared to the traditional financial sector, AFS services are very expensive.&quot; The authors 
conclude that offers of &quot;quick cash&quot; and &quot;low payments&quot; make it difficult for counselors to steer clients to the &quot;slow and often 
difficult repair of financial management practices.&quot; (&quot;The Operations, Appeals and Costs of the Alternative Financial Sector: 
Implications for Financial Counselors,&quot; by Roger Swagler, John Burton, &amp; Joan Koonce Lewis, Financial Counseling and 
Planning, Vol. 6, 1995, pp. 93-98, Association for Financial Counseling and Planning Education, 3900 East Camelback Rd., 
#200, Phoenix, AZ 85018; 602-912-5331; fax: 602-957-4828.) </p>
<h3>FEE-ONLY FINANCIAL PLANNERS.</h3>
<p>A Money magazine investigation concluded that some financial planners who designate themselves as &quot;fee-only&quot; actually take 
commissions for selling securities or insurance. The study also revealed that 13 percent of the planning firms examined have had 
&quot;brushes with the law.&quot; While many fee-only planners provide solid advice and carefully avoid conflicts of interest, careful 
checking of an advisor's training, compensation method, and disciplinary record is vital. (&quot;The Big Bad News about Fee-Only 
Financial Planners,&quot; by Ruth Simon, Money, Dec., 1995, pp. 110-111, 113-114, 116, 118.) </p>
<h3>LOW-INCOME HOME BUYERS.</h3>
<p>Credit risks associated with a mortgage are accommodated through a variety of financial arrangements and institutions. The 
authors conclude that nondepository private-sector mortgage purchasers provide a method for investors to serve the mortgage 
needs of lower-income and of black and Hispanic borrowers, although accounting for a relatively small share of mortgages in 
1994. (&quot;Credit Risk and the Provision of Mortgages to Lower-Income and Minority Homebuyers,&quot; Federal Reserve Bulletin, 
Nov., 1995, pp. 989-1016.) </p>
<h3>PRIVACY.</h3>
<p>&quot;The typical consumer is on at least 25 marketing data bases. Some land on upwards of 100. There are more than 15,000 
specialized lists containing 2 billion consumer names--each representing a potential sale.&quot; This feature offers information on a 
variety of privacy-related concerns. (&quot;Marketers Tap Data We Once Called Our Own,&quot; by Bruce Horovitz, USA Today, Dec. 
19, 1995, pp. 1A-2A, 4B.) </p>
<h3>REVERSE MORTGAGES.</h3>
<p>The &quot;reverse&quot; mortgage allows older home owners to draw against the equity in their homes to receive a monthly income. This 
book offers a clear explanation and easy-to-follow calculations of the details and implications of a reverse mortgage. (Your New 
Retirement Nest Egg: A Consumer Guide to the New Reverse Mortgages, by Ken Scholen, 1995, 332 pp., paper, $24.95 plus 
$4.50 shipping, quantity discounts available, National Center for Home Equity Conversion, 7373 147th St., West Apple Valley, 
MN 55124; 612-953-4474.) </p>
<h3>AUTO GUIDE.</h3>
<p>Jack Gillis is back for the 16th year with his guide to the best and worst automobiles. This comprehensive resource guide covers 
buying strategies, safety features, fuel economy, maintenance, warranties, insurance, tires, and consumer protection assistance. 
More than 100 models are rated with easy-to-read, visually-oriented reviews covering safety, performance, comparative 
models, price, and operating costs. (Source: The Car Book 1996, by Jack Gillis, 224 pp., paper, $12.95, HarperCollins, 10 
East 53 Street, New York, NY 10022.) </p>
<h3>PERSONAL FINANCIAL PLANNING.</h3>
<p>This college textbook takes a life-situation and opportunity cost approach to budgeting, spending, career planning, taxes, 
insurance, investing, and retirement and estate planning. The &quot;Financial Planning in Action&quot; feature allows students to apply text 
concepts. The Personal Financial Planner (and Windows-version software) allows students to create and implement a personal 
financial plan. Instructional supplements include an instructor's manual (also on disk), study guide-readings book, a casebook, 
videos, a computerized testing program, and a Spanish glossary. (Personal Finance, 4th ed., by J. Kapoor. L. Dlabay, &amp; R. 
Hughes, 1996, 665 pages, Richard D. Irwin, Inc., 1333 Burr Ridge Parkway, Burr Ridge, IL 60521, 1-800-634-3961.) </p>
<h3>BUYING BONDS.</h3>
<p>The author takes the reader from bond basics to details about safety and investing in Treasury, municipal, corporate, and 
zero-coupon bonds. A major portion of the book covers mutual funds that specialize in bonds. A glossary provides details about 
key concepts related to bonds. (How to Buy Bonds The Smart Way, by Stephen Littauer, 1996, 243 pp., paper, $19.95, 
Dearborn Financial Publishing, 155 N. Wacker Dr., Chicago, IL 60606-1719; 1-800-829-7934.) </p>
<h3>MUTUAL FUND PORTFOLIO.</h3>
<p>&quot;Don't waste time searching for elusive risk-free investments&quot; is one of the 101 tips offered for a safe and profitable journey when 
building a mutual fund portfolio. Starting with mutual fund basics, the authors provide valuable assistance related to establishing 
goals, selecting funds, evaluating risk, and taxes. Most investors will find this a useful resource. (Building Your Mutual Fund 
Portfolio, by Albert J, Fredman &amp; Russ Wiles, 1996, 246 pp., cloth, $19.95, Dearborn Financial Publishing, 155 N. Wacker 
Dr., Chicago, IL 60606-1719; 1-800-829-7934.) </p>
<h3>CONSUMER MOVEMENT VIDEO.</h3>
<p>Over 20 pioneers and leaders were interviewed to provide viewers with excellent insight into the roots and accomplishments of 
the consumer movement. The video is organized to allow teachers to stop and discuss the material. A very useful teacher's guide 
includes key concepts, quotes, discussion questions, activities, and a glossary, along with a timeline of the consumer movement 
and an extensive resource list. (Change Makers: The Struggle for Consumer Rights, 1995, 56 min., VHS-format, $35 plus $5 
shipping, limited time introductory price, Consumer Research Foundation, 249 Perry St., Mill Valley, CA 94941; 
415-381-0825; fax: 415-381-3712.) </p>
<h3>TELEPHONE SCAMS.</h3>
<p>Telemarketing fraud and common telephone scams include prize offers, travel packages, vitamins, investments, charities, and 
recovery swindles. This brochure offers &quot;tip-offs to fraud&quot; as well as suggestions for protection from frauds and where to get 
additional help. (Telephone Scams and Older Consumers, free, Federal Trade Commission, Bureau of Consumer Protection, 
Washington, DC 20580.) </p>
<h3>CHANGE FOOD SAFETY LAWS?</h3>
<p>This publication is likely to expand the debate about methods for monitoring food safety. The introduction states that the 
&quot;Delaney clause was an inappropriate regulatory standard from the moment of its enactment.&quot; (Source: Modernize Our Food 
Safety Laws: Delete the Delaney Clause, 1995, 24 pp., $3.85, American Council on Science and Health, 1995 Broadway, 2nd

<h3>CONSUMER CREDIT QUESTIONS.</h3>
<p>This booklet provides clear information on various concerns related to credit reports, credit bureaus, credit &quot;repair clinics,&quot; and 
opting out of mailing lists. (Source: 12 Common Questions about Consumer Credit and Direct Marketing, 1995, free, 20 pp., 
TRW Information, ATTN: Consumer Education, 701 TRW Parkway, Allen, TX 75013.) </p>
<h3>RETIREMENT SAVINGS.</h3>
<p>Proposed legislation to expand individual retirement accounts has been introduced in Congress. While proponents argue that 
these accounts can encourage a higher personal savings rate, recent economic research suggests that the effect of IRAs is 
minimal. (Source: &quot;The Impact of Individual Retirement Accounts on Savings,&quot; by Jonathan McCarthy &amp; Han N. Pham, Current 
Issues in Economics and Finance, Sept., 1995, free, Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Public Information Dept., 33 Liberty 
St., New York, NY 10045-0001; 212-720-6134.) </p>
<h3>DISASTER RIP-OFFS.</h3>
<p>A distinctive type of con-artist surfaces in the face of earthquakes, hurricanes, and other natural disasters. This newsletter 
provides detailed background information and warnings related to home repair contractors, charitable solicitations, advance fee 
loan scams, and con-artists posing as officials. (&quot;No Calm After the Storm: Rip-Off Artists Target Victims of Disaster,&quot; Senior 
Consumer Alert, Fall, 1995, 12 pp., free, American Association of Retired Persons, ATTN: Public Policy Institute, Rm. 
B6-340, 601 E St., NW, Washington, DC 20049.) </p>
<h3>LIFE INSURANCE INFORMATION.</h3>
<p>Life insurance industry representatives contend that &quot;consumers are much more informed today because state regulations require 
agents and companies to provide buyers with more and better information.&quot; In contrast, however, consumer professionals believe 
that &quot;it is cash value policies that Americans understand less about than virtually anything else they buy.&quot; (&quot;Are Consumers 
Adequately Informed About the Life Insurance Products They Purchase?,&quot; At Home With Consumers, Dec., 1995, 12 pp., free, 
Direct Selling Education Foundation, 1666 K St., NW, #1010, Washington, DC 20006; 202-293-5760; fax: 202-293-7483.) </p>
<h3>MENTAL POLLUTION.</h3>
<p>&quot;North Americans are drowning in a media-fed fantasy. We are the first culture in human history in which lives are shaped--not 
by nature--but by the beguiling images of mass media. We spend more hours watching nature shows than experiencing the real 
thing; more time laughing at TV jokes than joking around ourselves; more evenings experiencing TV sex than actually touching 
another human body. If we forego the role of participant in the real world, we become spectators in the flickering world of make 
believe.&quot; (Adbusters: The Journal of the Mental Environment, inside front cover, Issue 14, Winter, 1996, The Media Foundation, 
1243 West 7th Ave., Vancouver, BC V6H 1B7 Canada; 604-736-9401; fax: 604-737-6021.) </p>
<h3>SCANNER SCAMS.</h3>
<p>A six-month investigation by the Chicago Department of Consumer Services found that 55 percent of 208 stores checked 
allegedly overcharged customers due to errors in their scanner systems. Overcharges ranged from one cent to more than $23 for 
a single item. (NCAA News, Oct., 1995, p. 4, National Association of Consumer Agency Administrators, 1010 Vermont Ave., 
NW, Washington, DC 20005; 202-347-7395.) </p>
<h3>CREDIT UNION SATISFACTION.</h3>
<p>For the 12th straight year, credit unions ranked highest in consumer satisfaction among financial institutions. A survey conducted 
by the American Banker reports that 77 percent of credit union members are &quot;very satisfied&quot; with the quality of service they 
receive. That compares with 59 percent among bank and thrift customers. </p>
<h3>TIERED LENDING.</h3>
<p>&quot;Tiered loan pricing&quot; means that less-than-perfect borrowers may be able to get loans. However, they will pay more. Critics 
believe these punitive interest rates may be used to discriminate against women and minorities. (&quot;Tiered Lending Adjusts Rates to 
Each Customer,&quot; by Christine Dugas, USA Today, Nov. 16, 1995, pp. 1A, 2A.) </p>
<h3>TOP TELEVISION ADVERTISERS.</h3>
<p>McDonald's aired 2,829 commercials on network television during 1995. Other top television advertisers include AT&amp;T, MCI, 
Burger King, Sears, KFC, J.C. Penney, Wendy's, Red Lobster, and Tylenol. </p>

<p>On June 8, 1994 the San Francisco Bay area was shocked to learn of the explosion of a 65 pound smoke bomb on the campus 
of Palo Alto's Gunn High School which resulted in ambulances being called to the school, treatment for 18 students and serious 
injuries for two high school women. This sounds like an open and shut case of liablity, but because of decisions by the California 
Supreme Court which have denied insurance coverage when intentional conduct accidentally results in unintended injury, 
collecting damages for the injured in this case was a legal challenge. </p>
<p>For the past decade the California Supreme Court has demonstrated a clear commitment to insurance carriers and a drastic 
reduction of personal rights previously enjoyed by Californians. One of the most serious rollbacks of California law has been to 
deny insurance coverage for criminal acts and thereby make it impossible for victims of crime to collect against the insurance 
coverage of those who engaged in criminal acts that were either not intended to cause injury or caused as a result of mental 
incapacity. </p>
<p>While regaled by the insurance industry, the policies of the California Supreme Court are a travesty for victims of crime as this 
case almost proved. Because of our substantial experience in representing victims of crime we were able to provide a just result 
for two innocent victims of mindless misconduct, but as this case shows, for all the talk about recognizing the rights of victims of 
crime, California's public policy is intended to treat them as second class citizens. Ask any victim of crime and they will confirm 
this fact. </p>
<p>In this case the smoke bomb, which had been constructed by three senior men as their graduation signature prank, was a mixture 
of sugar and fertilizer which had been packed into a concrete container that had formerly housed a water fountain on the Gunn 
High School Campus. The device failed to function as planned and when it was ignited, instead of smoking, it spewed molten 
sugar across the high school quad. The culprits had failed to appreciate the lessons of endothermic chemical reactions taught in 
chemistry classes and did not realize that the proportions for a &quot;small&quot; smoke bomb could not be replicated for a &quot;giant&quot; smoke 
device because the heat generated by the larger quantity altered the combustion process. </p>
<p>Unfortunately at the time the mixture was ignited, graduating seniors, who had gathered in the quad to autograph yearbooks, 
were sprayed with hot, burning sugar and fertilizer. Two senior women suffered burns that required significant medical care, 
Catherine Meyer and Eleanor Lin. Sixteen others were treated and released. </p>
<p>The three seniors responsible for the malfunctioning smoke bomb, Robbie Roberts, Brendan Wheatley and David Chin, were 
arrested and charged with felonies. </p>
<p>Under California's court drafted law, willful criminal conduct precludes the availability of general liability insurance coverage to 
satisfy claims for personal injuries. The charged felonies would increase the probability of a final verdict for the burned women, 
but unless a judgment is collectible the victory is meaningless. To avoid such an unjust result required a careful legal strategy, 
which required the victims to do everything in their power to minimize the wrongdoers' criminal responsibility for their misconduct 
in the hope of obtaining fair compensation for their injuries. </p>
<p>This was not always the situation under California law. Although virtually every state precludes insurance companies from insuring 
willful or intentional conduct, many have special legal exceptions designed to avoid the harsh application of such a rule in certain 
circumstances. For example, prior to the advent of the Malcolm Lucas Court in the early 1980s, California's law held that when 
a person lacked the capacity to govern his/her conduct in accordance with reason, the resulting misconduct was not willful and 
therefore &quot;insured&quot; misconduct. Other states achieve the same result by special rules designed to provide coverage for 
&quot;accidental&quot; injuries, which in fact are caused by willful conduct, through provisions that a carrier cannot deny coverage for willful 
acts when a willful act results in an unintended or unexpected injury. The bottom line under these approaches is to honor the 
rights of innocent people who have been injured, make available coverage that is in place, spread the risk across society and 
keep victims off welfare. </p>
<p>The conservative majority on California Supreme Court, changed those rules in 1988 by agreeing with insurance industry lawyers 
and holding that willful criminal conduct, whether or not injury was expected or intended, precluded such acts from being insured. 
The opinion was written as a &quot;we're tough on criminals&quot; but the result was to penalize victims, whose injuries often continue for 
years after a crime. The real winner was the insurance industry. Some might claim the decision helped lower rates, but there was 
no such empirical evidence presented to this appellate court and the change in law was not tied to reducing premiums or 
providing rebates. </p>
<p>Representing victims of crime in California and seeking to obtain a recovery, except in cases of crimes committed by the truly 
wealthy, such as famous sports celebrities or heirs of substantial fortunes, requires pursuing a strategy of reduced cooperation 
with the police and prosecutor and increased cooperation with the criminal wrongdoers. </p>
<p>The victim's dilemma is this. The victim can seek maximum criminal sentences, make statements that the criminal deserves 
substantial imprisonment for heinous misconduct, expect to recover nothing in a civil action for personal injuries and end up on 
welfare with a lifetime injury or disability. </p>
<p>In the alternative a victim can minimize the financial disaster of such a personal catastrophe by doing everything she/he can to 
obtain a financial recovery. Either way their memories, wounds, and resulting injuries are unaffected. The choice is being injured 
and without funds or injured and with funds. With rare exceptions, rational people opt for the latter. </p>
<p>This sad case demonstrates how California case law drafted and imposed on 35,000,000 Californians by conservatives on the 
California Supreme Court has perverted the rights of victims and how two victims were successful in overcoming impediments to 
fair and reasonable compensation for their injuries. Most victims are not so fortunate. </p>
<p>Catherine Meyer and Eleanor Lin were successful because they retained a private attorney with experience representing victims 
of crime immediately following their injuries and obtained much needed advice at theoutset. In large part when victims of crime 
follow their intuition and do what they think is right they cause themselves financial injury. Most of the legal positioning in this case 
was counter-intuitive. </p>
<p>First, the District Attorney's Office was contacted and urged to pursue the lowest level charges, for example, causing a fire in a 
public place [as opposed to arson or any number of explosive offenses] which even though charged as a felonies eventually could 
be reduced to a misdemeanors once a sentence had been served. </p>
<p>This was the first step in defusing the liability issues so that an insurance carrier would be more likely to be required to defend the 
wrongdoers under their homeowner's insurance coverage and provide indemnity for the losses to the innocent victims. </p>
<p>Homeowners' insurance coverage combines a number of insurance policies: fire, storm, and general liability for all members of 
the household, excluding liability coverage for automobiles and boats and liability for injuries caused by an insured through his/her 
work. A general liability policy provides coverage for negligent acts by members of a household that cause injury no matter 
where the wrongful act occurs: on a playground, at a neighbor's home, in a public or at school. It is an all encompassing policy of 
protection for its owners, protects their assets from judgments for wrongdoing and is a valuable component of homeowner's 
coverage. </p>
<p>Our goal in this case was to mold our claims and our case so that the homeowner's insurance carriers would be legally obligated 
to pay for the damages caused by their insureds and not be provided with a history of facts which would support a lawful denial 
of coverage. This action was taken from the outset, even before knowing whether or not the three young men lived in homes that 
were insured and was based on two assumptions: 1) overwhelming majority of homes are mortgaged and insured under 
homeowner policies and 2) any inadvertent statement which could be construed by a carrier as denying coverage would be used 
against the victims. If there was coverage we were not going to take any action or make any statement that might accidentally 
result in the loss of that coverage for these two young women. </p>
<p>Under California law claim notices must be served on public entities before filing suit. In this case the school district had to be 
served with a claim to put it on notice of why it should be held responsible before a lawsuit could be filed. In this case, making 
that claim was easy. </p>
<p>For years Gunn High School's administrators had promoted an atmosphere where pranks by graduating seniors were allowed to 
escalate and at no time did school administrator ever hold the senior class responsible collectively for wide ranging senior pranks. 
Holding the whole class responsible as a group for such misconduct would have discouraged it. The one thing all teenagers 
understand is peer pressure. Gunn's administration never cracked down on pranks, even dangerous one, and gave the impression 
that such behavior was condoned. Several employees of the district who provided information anonymously were more colorful 
in their assessment of the situation. In their view the &quot;inmates were running the asylum.&quot; School officials had tolerated student 
pranks for so long that such conduct was common. While pranks resulted in warnings and rebukes by administrators, little other 
action was taken. </p>
<p>For example, within a month before the explosion, a smoke bomb had been ignited in the school library causing its closure. 
Smoke bombs had been ignited in other parts of the campus on other occasions. On the morning of the explosion, in the 
presence of school administrators in the quad, eggs were thrown and no disciplinary action was taken. As it turned out the 
reports that the principal was ineffectual in dealing with these issues were later confirmed by his public statements during the 
sentencing of the criminal defendants. </p>
<p>Amazingly everyone, including school administrators, had been forewarned of a potential explosion by Robbie Roberts. In 
Roberts's personal yearbook entry, in lieu of a photograph he displayed a cartoon showing a mushroom cloud over the high 
school, which was dated June 8, 1994. </p>
<p>Roberts had a reputation of being enthralled by pyrotechnics and his yearbook entry was clear evidence that something big was 
planned on June 8th. The fact that something was planned was clearly announced and recorded in the school yearbook, but 
nevertheless school administrators failed to discover that 65 pounds of combustible material had been smuggled into the school 
and planted inside a defunct water fountain. Nobody ever suspected that something would happen on June 8th, despite the 
announcement that June 8th was the date. </p>
<p>With this rich history of extremely &quot;laid back&quot; school supervision, claims against the school district stressed the absence of any 
discipline, control or common sense and the &quot;lasting arrogance, stupidity and moral culpability&quot; of the three errant teenagers who 
caused the blast and the injuries that had been suffered. The responsibility of the school district and its failure to provide a safe 
school was in fact abdicated by allowing a tradition of smoke bombs and fireworks on campus with little resultant punishment as 
a result of a pervasive attitude of tolerance toward such misconduct. Any reference to criminal misconduct was carefully avoided 
to preclude insurance carriers from using this document as a shield to defend their treasury. It was anticipated that the claims 
would generate substantial press coverage which would begin the process of resolving the criminal cases in a manner that would 
favor the interests of the burn victims as well as the defendants. What was interesting was the public response. </p>
<p>Surprisingly, not one person recognized that under a statewide initiative, Proposition 51, adopted in 1988, victims of personal 
injuries inflicted by others must sue everyone who in any possible way caused or contributed to bringing about an injury. Even if 
these victims had not wanted to take action against the school, all competent attorneys would have counseled naming the school 
district as a defendant light of the mandates of Proposition 51. In fact Proposition 51 was strongly supported by cities, counties 
and all governmental entities when it was on the ballot in 1988. The failure to include every potentially responsible party in a 
lawsuit today leaves an empty chair at trial and gives the other defendants a chance to lay all blame on the absentee. It is far 
better to have all parties in court defending their own interests since under Proposition 51 the jury must place a percentage of 
liability on each and every potential party, whether or not they are a defendant in a case and wether or not they are present in 
court. </p>
<p>Suing a school, even one that has a history of questionable responses to dangerous pranks, is akin to attacking motherhood. 
Schools are sacred cows in America, places that are supposed to be inherently good and institutions that clearly most believe 
would never do anything to cause injury, even when school administrators are oblivious to clear warning signs. Parents of school 
children reacted to the news of legal action against the school by statements of concern that Palo Alto schools had again had 
children injured by explosives at school. In an earlier case in which we had been the attorneys for plaintiff, Vagshenian v. Palo 
Alto Unified School District, the school district was responsible for burns caused to a young boy when a model rocket motor 
was ignited during an elementary school science fair, notwithstanding the unenforced written policy against fireworks on school 
property. The Gunn explosion was a reminder that once again the school district's policies on explosives had not prevented 
serious injuries. </p>
<p>Others, notably the lawyer haters who have never read all of Shakespeare's Henry VI, Act 4, Scene 2 except the plan of 
deranged rebels to kill anyone who could write their name [&quot;Let's kill all the lawyers&quot;] and who blame lawyers for everything, 
complained that the actions we had taken were due to lawyer greed, as if the attorneys for Meyer and Lin had somehow created 
the conflagration on campus. These people complain when anyone forces others to be legally responsible for wrongful acts, 
except when they, or a member of their family, is injured. </p>
<p>From years of experience and many visits to burn wards, there truly is no more painful injury than a burn. Anyone who could not 
sympathize with two young women, who lost the enjoyment of their graduation from high school and summer before college, is 
socially maladjusted, mean and depraved. The standing policies of the State of California demand that whenever it is foreseeable 
that someone's action &quot;might&quot; cause an injury, the failure to act responsibly is negligent conduct for which they will be held 
responsible. Naysayers who oppose this policy of holding individuals civilly responsible for their wrongful acts are a decided 
minority, but nonetheless vocal. </p>
<p>As part of the litigation plan in this case, the attorneys for the criminal defendants immediately were advised that the victims 
would be seeking a favorable resolution of the criminal cases for the wrongdoers in order to maximize the opportunity to obtain 
the available insurance coverage. This advice was obviously welcomed by the criminal defendants. </p>
<p>The Superior Court complaint that was filed for Catherine Meyer and Eleanor Lin stressed &quot;tragically stupid&quot; and &quot;drastically 
wrong&quot; conduct by the three senior men, not the defendants' criminal acts and avoided any reference to willful misconduct, 
realizing that any claim for willfully caused injuries would defeat efforts to secure coverage. </p>
<p>After &quot;no contest&quot; pleas by the three defendants to the criminal charges, letters to the Court commenting on the sentence to be 
imposed were requested by the county's department of adult probation, which normally prepares the pre-sentencing report. In 
many cases where victims hire lawyers well after the criminal proceedings, insurance company lawyers will conduct a detailed 
investigation of testimony in a criminal trial and from sentencing requests to the court. Any statement made by a victim that hints 
at the wrongdoer's malevolent intent will be used against the victim in any later civil proceeding to deny insurance coverage. This 
is a trap to be avoided. In this case letters were carefully drafted for both Catherine Meyer and Eleanor Lin which urged the 
judge not to send the defendants to prison &quot;for a foolish prank that did not go as planned&quot; and instead urged that they be required 
to speak at the school and explain why schools should be kept safe for everyone, how dangerous pranks can ruin many lives, 
and &quot;why no one should ever risk causing injuries to anyone.&quot; </p>
<p>The plan in asking for the criminal defendants to speak to a student assembly was to keep the focus on the fact that both the 
three young men and school administrators had acted stupidly. While the stupidity of the three young men far exceeded that of 
the school, this school's administrators were striking in their refusal to heed bona fide advance notice of the smoke bomb in the 
school year book as a credible threat. Any school administrator who underestimates the zeal of a high school senior needs 
re-assignment to less challenging work. </p>
<p>Both letters received substantial press coverage, as anticipated, and were reported verbatim in the San Jose Mercury News. The 
sentencing judge, Superior Court Judge Charles Gordon, agreed with our recommendations. In his wisdom he took the 
recommendations one step further. The Court ordered the defendants to each speak at six separate high schools, including Gunn 
High School. In addition Judge Gordon withheld final sentencing until all public service requirements had been met by the three, 
indicating at that time he would dismiss the felonies and treat the offenses as misdemeanors. </p>
<p>Clearly this judge recognized that these three young men had been ultimately stupid in what they had done and concluded they 
did not deserve to be labeled as felons for life. By structuring the punishment in this fashion the actual findings on the public 
record would only show misdemeanor convictions. By this decision, Judge Gordon demonstrated why he is held in high regard 
all. </p>
<p>Incredibly, the Palo Alto Unified School District and Gunn Principal Chris Rich objected to the public speaking component of the 
sentences and wrote the Court asking for the ordered speaking engagements at Gunn High School to be vacated. Rich was of 
the view that by having the three young men speak to a school assembly they would become heroes. It is hard to believe that 
three men who caused so much damage to others and to themselves, with resulting felony prosecutions, would be lionized by 
Gunn High School students when ordered by a judge to explain how stupid they had been, but by this one act, Mr. Rich proved 
that a college education does not confer common sense. Additionally, he gave credence to the doubts raised by others 
concerning his administrative style. This was the most surprising and unexpected event in a truly unusual case. </p>
<p>As lawyers for Catherine and Eleanor, we argued that not only should the three defendants speak, but the school should have 
discussion groups afterwards to assure a positive experience for the student body. Judge Gordon agreed in seconds and sent the 
principal and the school district packing. He did not alter his order and the three defendants eventually spoke before Gunn High 
School students, with extensive newspaper coverage of the event. According to news reports, student comments after the 
speeches indicated that the speakers were taken seriously and that their presentations had provoked responsible thinking about 
the dangers and long-term aftermath of pranks. </p>
<p>To prepare for trial, we retained a plastic surgeon previously hired as a consultant for the School District in the Vagshenian burn 
injury case. The goal was to strengthen our proof at trial by having the testimony of a plastic surgeon and burn specialist who had 
the &quot;imprimatur&quot; of the District. Whatever medical testimony was provided by this expert witness, the District could not refute his 
qualifications or conclusions since it had previously selected him itself. Surprisingly the attorneys representing the District in this 
second case had not moved to retain their earlier used expert and we capitalized on this mistake. </p>
<p>The personal injury suit against the three defendants and the school district was prosecuted and simultaneously we defended a 
declaratory relief action [DRA] brough by one homeowner's insurance carrier to avoid its financial responsibility for the injuries 
the smoke bomb had caused. </p>
<p>A DRA is a lawsuit in which a party can have its rights or obligations clarified, or declared, by a court. Such actions are often 
brought by insurance companies when they wish to be discharged from their duty to defend and indemnify under a policy. Many 
victims are insulted to learn that because they take legal action against a wrongdoer they can be named as a defendant in a civil 
suit by an insurance company that does not want to defend or pay. In this case, one homeowner's insurance carrier claimed it 
had no responsibility for the injuries caused by the malfunctioning smoke bomb because the acts involving in making and igniting 
the device were willful and the resulting injury was therefore a result of willful, criminal acts and was not accidental. </p>
<p>After depositions of the three young men, police and others were completed, when it was clear that the record supported our 
claim of stupid, negligent misconduct by these three young men, as opposed to willful criminal activity, the Superior Court refused 
to grant the insurance company's motion for an immediate judgment in its favor and cleared the way for the declaratory relief 
action to go to trial. </p>
<p>At this point eighteen months after this sad event, we arranged a day long mediation/settlement conference which was attended 
by all parties, including school district officials. Two insurance carriers [one of the three young men was uninsured] agreed to 
contribute $137,500 and the school district reluctantly accepting its partial responsiblity for what happened, but still denying all 
legal liability any suggestions that it was at fault, paid $12,500 towards final settlements of $100,000 for Catherine Meyer and 
$50,000 for Eleanor Lin. </p>
<p>In light of their injuries and all the circumstances in this case, this settlement was a fair, reasonable and just result, especially in 
light of California's hostile legal climate towards innocent victims of crime and the risk of losing the DRA at trial. But if these high 
school seniors and their parents had followed their instincts and had not obtained experienced legal advice, this civil action could 
well have been resulted in an uncollectible verdict against three teenagers. $150,000 will never fully compensate these young 
women for the fear, pain, memories and injuries they have suffered, but it is far better that they should enjoy this recovery as 
opposed to suffering this terrible insult and have nothing. </p>

<p><font size=5>F</font>inding the &quot;right lawyer&quot; to represent you is a challenging process describe in the companion to this article, <a href="howhire.shtml">How to Hire the 
&quot;Right Lawyer&quot;: Consumers' Rights in the Legal Marketplace</a>. Once you have found the&quot;right lawyer,&quot; you will want a written 
fee agreement explaining what you want the lawyer to do, what the lawyer has promised to do for you, and what it is going to 
cost. </p>
<p><font size=5>U</font>nless you sign a written fee agreement at the outset, the probability of having an amicable conclusion to your case and to 
your relationship with your lawyer is very close to zero. If someone wants to do business on a handshake, expect the other 
hand will be in your pocket. </p>
<p><font size=5>O</font>nly a fool hires a lawyer without a written fee agreement. Good lawyers know this and always explain your obligations and 
theirs in a document you can read and understand. Only after you understand the agreement will you be asked to sign and 
along with your lawyer confirm your understanding. So, always ask for a copy of the attorney's fee agreement at your first 
meeting. As with all documents, make sure that you understand it fully before you sign it. No reputable attorney will pressure 
you to accept a fee agreement on the spot. If he/she does, find another lawyer. </p>
<p><font size=5>A</font>nd, do not fail to understand that every attorney's fee agreement is different. There is no such thing as a &quot;standard 
agreement.&quot; You will be signing a document that binds you and the lawyer. Make sure you understand every word, what it 
says, and what it does not say. Before you sign any contract, make sure you understand the following general advice which is 
intended to provide you with a general background of what you can expect when you hire a lawyer. </p>
<p><font size=5>T</font>he important operative words in this case are &quot;you&quot; and &quot;hire.&quot; The lawyer is a professional, but you are the boss and the fee 
agreement is the contract of employment explaining the duties of both sides. Remember, you are hiring the lawyer and the 
lawyer is deciding both what kind of work you need performed and what kind of boss you will be. </p>
<h3><a name="hourly">Hourly Fees</a></h3>
<p><font size=5>F</font>irst, determine if your legal work is best accomplished by a fixed fee, hourly rate, or contingency fee. If the work is to be on 
an hourly basis ask for the attorney's hourly rate, and the rates of any other attorneys at the firm who are expected to 
participate. Ask for a copy of the firm's fee schedule. Check the fee agreement to confirm fees for the firm's support staff. Is 
time billed in minimums of one-quarter of an hour or in tenths? Be cautious about paying for the work of law clerks or new 
lawyers who are being trained at your expense. </p>
<p><font size=5>L</font>egal research may sometimes be called for, but you should not have to pay an attorney, or a new associate, to learn the 
basics about the law concerning a common legal issue. Ask whether there are any specific areas of the law that should be 
researched in your case and how long that would take. If the attorney explains they will &quot;have to look into,&quot; &quot;give the matter 
some thought,&quot; or &quot;check the case law on a question&quot; that is a red flag: watch out for being billed for research that another 
professional with more experience may not need to do. Obviously there is no hard and fast rule here, but nobody wants to 
pay for waiting time in a cab while the driver is trying to figure out how to read a map. </p>
<p><font size=5>I</font>n addition to controlling time devoted to research, if you expect litigation, insist that you not be charged for your attorney to 
make a motion for summary judgment without your permission. A motion for summary judgment asks the court to dismiss a 
lawsuit on the assertion that the opposition's case is unsupported by any facts. Only in the rarest of cases are these motions 
successful, because no matter how strongly you believe that the case brought against you is without merit, there is always 
some question of fact that must be determined by a jury. </p>
<p><font size=5>A</font> lawyer's hourly rate will give you only part of the total financial picture. Many cases require sizable expenditures in order to 
obtain the best recoveries. Always ask what kinds of expenses the attorney considers essential to prepare your case and 
maximize your recovery, as well as what costs could be minimized. Get an estimate of what those costs will be and two 
budgets: 1) a rock bottom minimum and 2) the most probable. Determine exactly what will be chargeable to you as costs. </p>
<p><font size=5>C</font>ases costs routinely include all out of pocket expenses paid for the purpose of carrying forward the client's case. Common 
expenses include charges for filing fees, process servers, facsimile charges, couriers, express mail, federal express, UPS; 
copying of medical, employment, court and other records; deposition reporters' fees and transcripts, experts' and consultants' 
fees, telephone toll charges, in-office copying, postage, attorneys' travel by car, parking, overnight hotel and meals, focus 
groups, trial exhibits, computer research, mediation fees, jury fees, pro- judges, and investigators, among others. It is always 
expected that your attorney will do everything to minimize case expenditures, but do not minimize case costs at the expense of 
not hiring important experts or failing to take the deposition of a critical witness. </p>
<p><font size=5>I</font>t may be possible to arrange a flat fee for certain services, such as a will or a divorce. Many large corporations are 
negotiating with law firms to undertake, for example, all the company's defective product litigation on a fixed fee basis. Fixed 
fees are becoming more and more popular with sophisticated purchasers of legal services. It is worthwhile asking about a 
fixed fee in your case. You might be able to arrange a sliding scale of attorney's fees, with separate rates for different tasks 
ranging from correspondence to court appearances. Some lawyers work on a sliding scale of fees that depends on when a 
case is resolved, such as prior to filing, at pre-trial, at the settlement conference, after trial begins, or after an appeal. </p>
<p><font size=5>I</font>f the attorney bills by the hour, she or he will request a retainer to secure payment. A retainer functions like a deposit. Clients 
are expected to keep a certain minimum level of funds in the attorneys trust account and to replenish as charges are made. The 
days of the non-refundable fee to assure the lawyer will always be available for a particular client's cases, or avoid working for 
the client's competitors, are gone. Do not agree to pay a totally non-refundable retained unless your last name is Rockefeller, 
Carnegie or Perot. Always require that you approve a bill before funds are withdrawn from a trust account. Give no one a 
free hand with your money. </p>
<h3><a name="contingency">Contingency Fees</a></h3>
<p><font size=5>C</font>ontingency fees, or percentage fees, are paid at the conclusion of a case, and only if there is a recovery. Lawyers who 
work on a contingency expect to be paid well for expending time and effort, paying for their office overhead during the 
pendency of their cases, and either advancing or paying the case costs normally paid by a client that have been explained 
above. The client has the benefit of securing the services of the &quot;right lawyer&quot; and in the event the case is without, or with less, 
merit than expected at the outset, the burden is carried by the lawyer and not by the client. </p>
<p><font size=5>T</font>he contingency fee is the average person's only way to hire a lawyer and for that reason major corporations and insurance 
companies have worked hard to limit contingency fees in order to limit the ability of the public to assert its legal rights. </p>
<p><font size=5>U</font>nder a contingency fee contract, the attorney's fee is a percentage of the recovery, generally between 33% and 40%, but 
there is nothing sacred about these numbers, although many people are so familiar with these percentages that they are 
accepted as gospel. In more complicated and difficult cases, the percentages will be higher. For any punitive damages 
awarded, this percentage may be as high as 50%. This type of fee agreement is used commonly, though not exclusively, by 
those who have suffered personal injury, property loss or serious damage to their business and by families who have suffered 
the death of a family member. </p>
<p><font size=5>E</font>stablish and consider a sliding scale of percentages of compensation and tie the increased percentage to financial decisions 
that will impact you and your lawyer. For example: </p>
<ul>
<li>25% to negotiate a final resolution before the defendant answers the complaint;<br>
</li>
<li>33% after service of the complaint but before retention of experts, and<br>
</li>
<li>40% after experts have been given work assignments or upon disclosure of experts for pre-trial depositions. </li>
</ul>
<p><font size=5>N</font>ormally an attorney will try to settle a case before serving a complaint and then having to deal with the defendants' lawyer in 
a litigation setting. Once the complaint is filed and served, a defendant has an interest in minimizing both the cost of settlement 
and the cost of defense. This is an excellent time for both sides to consider settlement. Once litigation is underway and 
witnesses deposed [interviewed under oath by an attorney at a deposition before a court reporter] the factual picture should 
be clearer. In anticipation of trial both sides will have to have experts, provide them with factual information and pay for them 
to render opinions, conduct studies or the like. This is another excellent time to pursue settlement. Clearly the attorney's 
workload increases then and at the time when trial experts are disclosed and deposed. This is another logical point for both 
sides to &quot;talk turkey.&quot; In all cases, you want to encourage your lawyer to invest the time needed to obtain the best result. </p>
<p><font size=5>T</font>here are many types of contingency fee agreements available and there is no such thing as a standard contract. Many clients 
focus on the percentages to be charged without considering carefully how it is applied to the recovery and how the fees are 
calculated. Contingency fee agreements fall into three major categories which reflect the basic methods followed to calculate 
the attorney's fee. </p>
<h3><a name="calculated">How Fees Are Calculated</a></h3>
<p><font size=5>U</font>nder a gross fee contract, the agreed percentage is applied to the gross amount of the recovery, and the case costs incurred 
in prosecuting the case, if advanced by the lawyer, are repaid to the attorney our of the client's portion of the recovery. Under 
this type of agreement, there is no incentive for the lawyer to be economical in spending because the client bears the full brunt 
of such expenditures and the fees are unaffected. </p>
<p><font size=5>U</font>nder a net fee agreement, the lawyer is reimbursed for case costs from the gross recovery. If the client has paid the costs of 
litigation then it is common to reimburse the client before calculating fees. The agreed percentage is applied to the net recovery 
or the final, total net sum recovered from the defendants after deducting any disbursements or case costs incurred in 
connection with prosecution or settlement of the claim. This approach provides some incentive for the lawyer to contain costs 
and spend effectively, since her or his fee grows smaller as the costs grow larger. If the agreed attorney's fee is one third, then 
every time the lawyer spends one hundred dollars in case costs he or she knows that the attorney's fee is reduced by $33. </p>
<h3><a name="attorney">Does The Attorney Advance Or Pay Case Costs?</a></h3>
<p><font size=5>A</font>s a result of a 1995 appellate decision, some lawyers are offering a single charge contingency contract under which the 
attorneys agree to pay all costs associated with the case. If the case is successful, out of any recovery the attorney receives as 
total compensation for all services an agreed upon percentage of the gross recovery. Because the payment of preparation and 
trial costs are the sole responsibility of attorneys, the client always receives a known percentage of the recovery and can 
readily calculate his/her share. This approach places the full burden of the costs of the case on the attorney who is spending his 
or her own money to prepare for trial. </p>
<p><font size=5>J</font>ust as in selecting a percentage fee that provides incentives, both a net fee and single charge fee agreement contain hidden 
incentives. These are important to understand to make sure your lawyer has the incentive to maximize a recovery for you at 
the earliest possible moment. </p>
<p><font size=5>W</font>hen an attorney &quot;advances&quot; case costs the IRS treats these expenditures as non-interest loans from personal capital. A 
lawyer who advances case costs uses after tax dollars. For example, for a lawyer to advance $10,000 to pay an expert's bill 
requires gross income of $60,000. The lawyer's office overhead expenses in operating a law firm can range from 60% to 80% 
of gross income. Assuming an overhead of 66% for salaries, rent, insurance, phones, etc., on an income of $60,000 the 
lawyer has net earnings of $20,000. Subtract federal and state income taxes [38% federal 11% California] and the attorney 
has net after tax income of $10,200 to loan or advance to the client. The attorney's cash flow after paying the expert's bill is 
$200. </p>
<p><font size=5>S</font>ingle charge fee agreements are growing in popularity because lawyers who agree to &quot;pay&quot; the cost of a contingency fee 
case are now entitled to deduct the cost as a business expense. If $10,000 is needed to pay an expert's bill, it is paid from the 
attorney's net pre-tax income, reducing $20,000 to $10,000 with resulting taxes of $4,900 and leaving a net income of 
$5,100. </p>
<p><font size=5>I</font>n many states a single charge agreement is not available. In those states bar rules prohibit a lawyer from paying a client's 
business expenses or personal expenses and include in that definition the costs of litigation. States which allow single charge 
contracts draw a distinction between litigation expenses and business or personal expenses that a client would incur whether 
or not there was a lawsuit and which are the personal client's responsibility. In virtually all cases, a client is personally 
responsible for his or her medical bills or the payment of medical liens imposed by private insurance agreements, state health 
care insurance programs, Medicare, medical benefits paid by a worker's compensation carrier, county hospitals, self-insured 
employers, or liens by private physicians rendering direct care. </p>
<h3><a name="pays">Who Pays the Costs If You Lose?</a></h3>
<p><font size=5>T</font>he best aspect of a contingency fee agreement is that in the event there is no recovery, the attorneys are not paid for their 
time, make sure this term is set forth in any contingency fee agreement your sign, but be careful about who is responsible for 
paying case costs in the event of a loss. In many states case costs are always the client's responsibility and even in states such 
as California, in which an attorney can agree to pay litigation costs without recourse to the client in the event of a loss, in a 
losing case the client could still be obligated to pay defense costs. Make sure the fee agreement you sign explains how any 
potential defense costs are going to be paid in the event your case turns sour. </p>
<p><font size=5>D</font>efense costs usually are limited to specified categories of costs which include filing fees, court reporter fees and the like, as 
opposed to the full range of actual costs incurred by litigants in most cases. Exposure for defense case costs can occur if there 
is a dismissal of your case before trial or a defense verdict after trial. </p>
<p><font size=5>S</font>ome attorneys agree to pay defense costs if their advice to their clients turns out to be incorrect and others let the client 
make the call whether or not to reject a defense settlement offer and to take a case to trial. In the latter case, if the client 
chooses to try a case against the advice of attorneys, and it is won by the defendants, in that case the client agrees to pay the 
defendants' court costs. </p>
<p><font size=5>A</font> losing client could be responsible to pay defense costs, defense expert fees, and defense attorneys fees. The rules vary 
from state to state, but many states require that if a settlement offer made in writing prior to trial, is rejected, and the client 
does not do as well at trial, then the client must pay a penalty, which can range from paying the defendants' court costs, 
defendant's expert fees or defense attorneys fees. Find out what the rule is in your state and how it could be applied in your 
case. Include in your fee agreement an understanding how a defense verdict and defense case costs will be handled. </p>
<h3><a name="common">Common Terms in Contingency Fee Agreements</a></h3>
<p><font size=5>O</font>ccasionally a fee agreement will ask for a power of attorney. Be careful not to agree that your lawyer has complete 
authority to settle your case. Demand that no settlement will be made without your authority and never approve settlement 
authority without obtain an understanding of the implications of a given settlement proposal and how your net recovery will be 
calculated. </p>
<p><font size=5>A</font> power of attorney to the lawyer to negotiate a final settlement check can be given, but it should only be effective only after 
a settlement has been approved by you, a release has been executed by you forever ending your case or a final judgment is 
issued in your favor of the client. Once that occurs it is appropriate to give your lawyer a power of attorney to execute 
settlement drafts or checks to be deposited into his/her trust account to facilitate the prompt clearing of the settlement drafts or 
checks. </p>
<p><font size=5>A</font>lthough no attorney can guarantee what the outcome of a given case will be, that does no prevent the lawyer from 
promising to use his/her best efforts on your behalf. A contract which merely agrees to represent you means the lawyer will 
provide the level of service common to your community. The &quot;right lawyer&quot; is never unwilling to make this commitment to 
his/her clients and to put it in writing. </p>
<p><font size=5>S</font>ome health care providers, HMOs, or insurers will demand client sign a lien or reimbursement agreement which may grant 
the lienor rights greater than those allowed by law. Never sign legal documents giving anyone a lien unless your attorneys have 
approved the lien beforehand. Ask your potential lawyer if he/she charges separately to negotiate a reduction of medical liens 
for your benefit. Many lawyers provide this service at no extra charge. </p>
<p><font size=5>I</font>n case you were injured while &quot;on the job&quot; and will be or have been receiving workers' compensation benefits, the 
compensation insurance carrier will assert a lien against your recovery. The resolution of workers' compensation liens also 
results in granting the carrier a credit against further benefits and can end benefits depending upon the amount of the recovery 
in a third party case. These rules vary greatly from state to state. Include in the fee agreement an explanation of how the 
workers' compensation insurance lien will be repaid and how this will affect the calculation of the lawyers' fees and your share. </p>
<p><font size=5>I</font>n the event of a judgment lien imposed by a court of law against your case, attorneys fees are always based upon the full 
recovery and the benefit conferred by the full recovery before deducting the amount of any judgment that has been taken 
against you. If as a result of this new litigation you attorneys are ordered to pay outstanding bills from your portion of the 
recovery, understand that the final cash you may receive will be less than what you may have realized had you not had 
outstanding bills and that the attorney's fees will be calculated based on the gross recovery including the benefit of any reduced 
debt. In such cases, the compensation paid to your attorneys may exceed what you receive in cash, but it should be the stated 
percentage of the recovery and your portion may consist of cash and paid judgment liens that have been imposed upon your 
case. </p>
<p><font size=5>M</font>any times cases are settled by having a separate insurance company issue an annuity contract to make regular monthly or 
annual payments in the future. Should the payment of a settlement or judgment be carried out by periodic payments or on an 
annuity basis [often referred to as a structured settlement], your fee agreement should cover this possibility. In most cases, 
attorneys' fees are computed and collected as a percentage of the cost of an annuity and are paid from any initial cash 
payment made as part of the settlement. </p>
<p><font size=5>T</font>oday, fewer attorneys are recommending structured settlements and will only participate in such a financial investment as 
part of a settlement if you specifically make such a request. Structured settlements or annuities are sold by insurance 
companies such as Baldwin, First Executive, First Capital and Bankers' Mutual Life, all of which are bankrupt or have been 
under the control of the insurance commissioner and have not paid their agreed obligations. Only in the rarest of cases does a 
structured recovery make good sense. </p>
<p><font size=5>A</font>ttorneys will often ask for written authority to associate as co-counsel other attorneys or firms necessary to successfully 
prosecute your claims. Many lawyers will agree that any such association will result in no additional expense to the client. But 
make sure you are not being charged an inflated percentage so that your lawyer can &quot;refer&quot; you to someone else who will do 
all the work in exchange for a &quot;referral fee.&quot; Demand that you must know and approve beforehand what agreements are being 
made concerning your case. You want to know who is being paid and how much to make sure you are receiving the 
representation you deserve. </p>
<p><font size=5>I</font>t is not unusual for attorneys to explain to clients in fee agreements that the lawyer may withdraw at any time if the client 
refuses to cooperate, does not follow attorneys' advice, or in the event the prosecution of this case is not economically 
feasible. If such terms are provided to you make sure that they are qualified to protect you from undue prejudice to your case 
and make sure that you will be given reasonable notice so you can hire other counsel. Require also in your contract that you 
can change attorneys at any time and that any sums due to your lawyer will not be paid until and unless there is a recovery. </p>
<p><font size=5>T</font>o avoid any doubts about who controls your case and to assure joint decision-making have your lawyer agree in writing to 
schedule regular office or telephone working sessions every 30 days, or as often as you agree, to meet with you to assure 
good attorney-client communication, joint case management and to participate in important decisions being made with regard 
to your claim. Remember, this is your case. </p>
<p><font size=5>I</font>n the event of an emergency you will need to be able to contact your lawyer and speak with him/her, not merely leave a 
message on a message recording machine. Your expectation on this issue needs to be communciated from the outset. An 
emergency exists whenever you determine that you need immediate advice. Findout at the beginning who you will be able to 
contact and what service you can expect. Once a promise is made to you about emergency services, put it in writing. </p>
<h3><a name="conclusion">Conclusion</a></h3>
<p><font size=5>L</font>ike anything else, &quot;the devil is in the details.&quot; This article has not been intended to provide an exhaustive list of the terms and 
conditions that will fit all lawyers, all clients, and all cases, but it is a starting point to expand your understanding of what you 
can and should expect before you are asked to sign. If an explanation given to you &quot;sounds different&quot; from what you have read 
in a fee agreement, ask for the agreement to be amended and initialed before your sign. </p>
<p><font size=5>L</font>astly, before you sign any fee agreement, take time to consider whether you would be comfortable in working with this 
person as your lawyer. Ask yourself whether or not she or he gave you clear and direct information. Will they be available in 
an emergency? Consider if the attorney spoke knowledgeably and with a minimum of legal terms. Think about whether this 
lawyer understood and shared your goals. As a client will you be a co-participant or will the lawyer be making all the 
decisions? Did the attorney give you his/her home phone number if you have an emergency? </p>
<p><font size=5>T</font>he importance of creating a comfortable working relationship with your lawyer cannot be underestimated. The road to 
obtaining the legal services you are seeking may be long, and it will take a considerable amount of teamwork to get there. If 
you make the commitment to find an experienced lawyer with whom you can work jointly under a clearly understandable 
written fee agreement you will be well on your way to the best possible result. </p>

<p><b>Hazard:</b> A child secured in a child safety seat may still be injured or killed in a crash if the car seat has not been installed 
properly. One of the most common installation errors is failure to use a special locking clip when it is required for your vehicle. </p>
<p><b>Precaution:</b> Follow all child seat installation instructions in both the vehicle owner's manual and the child seat directions. Read 
the safety belt information in your vehicle manual to find out if you need to install the locking clip that comes with each child seat. 
If the clip is needed, follow the child seat instructions for attaching it to the car's safety belt. If the clip is missing, call the seat's 
manufacturer to order one. For more information on child seats, call 2028844993, the National SAFE KIDS Campaign. For 
seat recall information, find the make and model number usually listed on the back of the child seat, and call the Auto Safety 
Hotline of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 18004249393. </p>
<h3>Guns in the Home </h3>
<p><b>Hazard:</b> Approximately 230 children aged 14 and under die from unintentional shootings each year. Many more, an estimated 
3,600 children, were hospitalized and an additional 15,000 received medical treatment for unintentional gun injuries in 1992. 
Guns are used in approximately 60% of all teenage suicides. Suicide is 4.8 times more likely to occur and homicide 2.7 times 
more likely to be committed when there is a gun in the home. In fact a gun in the home is 43 times more likely to kill a family 
member or a friend than to kill an intruder in selfdefense. In a recent National SAFE KIDS Campaign survey, 59% of parents 
who have guns in their homes admitted that their guns are not locked away form their children. </p>
<p><b>Precaution:</b> If you keep guns in the home, lock them up and store ammunition in a separate locked area. Teach children never 
to touch a gun and to tell an adult if they find a gun. Also check to see if your child is playing in a home where guns are present. </p>
<h3>Alcohol and Medications </h3>
<p><b>Hazard:</b> Alcohol interacts with many common medications leading to increased risk of illness, injury or death. Even small 
amounts of alcohol may have adverse effects when combined with prescription and overthecounter medicines such as: antibiotics, 
antidepressants, pain relievers, anesthetics, antihistamines, antiulcer drugs, heart pills, sleep aids and anticoagulants. Alcohol may 
reduce the effectiveness of medicines or make some more toxic. Some medicines may increase blood alcohol levels or alcohol's 
adverse effect on the brain. Chronic drinkers may experience these negative effects even when they have not recently had a 
drink. The elderly, who may take more medications than others, should be aware that the effects of mixing alcohol and 
medication tend to be more severe with advancing age. </p>
<p><b>Precaution:</b> Avoid alcohol while taking medication, even overthecounter medicines such as aspirin and acetaminophen. Heavy 
drinkers, the elderly and those with chronic illnesses should be particularly cautious and discuss the potential dangers with a 
doctor or pharmacist. For more information call the National Clearinghouse on Alcohol and Drug Information 18007296686. </p>
<h3>Falls and the Elderly </h3>
<p><b>Hazard:</b> Falls are the leading cause of unintentional death in the home 7,000 deaths each year. Injuries associated with stairs, 
steps, rugs or floors account for nearly 2 million hospital emergency visits per year many due to falls. Rugs and runners account 
for 6,800 hospitaltreated injuries to people 65 and older. Wet, soapy tile or porcelain surfaces in the bath are especially slippery 
and dangerous. Standing on chairs, boxes and other makeshift items to reach high shelves also results in falls. When older people 
fall, they are more likely to sustain serious injuries that often lead to death. </p>
<p><b>Precaution:</b> Retrofit staircase areas with light switches at the top and bottom, and handrails on both sides. Improve tread to 
prevent slips and falls on stairs and steps. Remove all objects from stairways to prevent tripping, particularly in an emergency or 
fire. Apply doublefaced adhesive carpet tape or rubber matting to the backs of rugs. Grab bars, textured strips and nonskid mats 
all can help reduce falls in the tub and shower. Use a step stool with a handrail to reach high shelves. Install a night light. For a 
copy of Safety for Older Consumers: Home Safety Checklist from the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, call 
1800638CPSC. </p>
<h3>Low or NonFat Desserts </h3>
<p><b>Hazard:</b> Although lowfat desserts are lower in fat than cakes, cookies and frozen desserts lacking a &quot;lowfat&quot; label, they are not 
always lower in calories. Many are tempted to eat extra servings which add up to extra calories under the mistaken impression 
that &quot;non fat&quot; means &quot;not fattening.&quot; Unfortunately, this misconception contributes to the increasing numbers of Americans who 
are overweight and therefore at greater risk of heart attack, high blood pressure, stroke, diabetes and cancer. </p>
<p><b>Precaution:</b> Check the serving size and calories as well as fat content listed on the label for desserts and other foods you buy. 
For more information call the American Heart Association at 1800AHAUSA1. </p>
<h3>Chewing Tobacco and Snuff </h3>
<p><b>Hazard:</b> One of the most harmful of all the tobacco products is smokeless tobacco. Many are unaware that smokeless tobacco 
continues to be a leading cause of oral cancer, gum disease, tooth loss and nicotine addiction. There are 12 million smokeless 
tobacco users in the United States 3 million under the age of 21. Smokeless tobacco use by teenagers 1619 years old has 
increased 10 fold in the last 15 years. In 1991 20% of high school boys were users. During the same year 30,000 new cases of 
oral and throat cancers were diagnosed. </p>
<p><b>Precaution:</b> Ten (10) is the average age children first use smokeless tobacco. Teach children at a young age that any kind of 
tobacco is extremely dangerous and that chewing tobacco is not a &quot;safe alternative&quot; to smoking. For more information send a 
stamped selfaddressed envelope to Spit Tobacco, American Academy of Otolaryngology, 1 Prince St., Alexandria, VA 22314. </p>
<h3>New Strains of HIV Increase AIDS Risk </h3>
<p><b>Hazard:</b> Researchers at the Harvard AIDS Institute have warned that at least 4 highly infectious strains of HIV are now on their 
way to the U.S. and may have already arrived. These new strains are much more easily transmitted through heterosexual sex than 
were prior strains of the HIV virus. Remember, people can have HIV or AIDS yet feel and look perfectly healthy. Moreover, it 
takes only one unprotected sex act to become HIV infected! Unless someone has been in a longterm monogamous relationship 
with an uninfected person, unprotected sex is like playing Russian roulette. </p>
<p><b>Precaution:</b> For those who are sexually active, effective protection against HIV is provided by a good quality latex condom 
used with a waterbased lubricant. No other means of contraception, except abstinence, protects against HIV or any other 
sexually transmitted disease. For more information call the National AIDS Hotline, 180034202437 (English) or 18003447432 
(Spanish); or write, How to Talk About AIDS, P.O. Box 303, Hartford, CT 06141. </p>
<h3>Carbon Monoxide </h3>
<p><b>Hazard:</b> Carbon monoxide (CO) is a colorless, odorless, toxic gas that kills approximately 300 Americans each year. It is 
produced by the incomplete combustion of solid, liquid and gaseous fuels. Heating appliances fueled with gas, oil, kerosene or 
weed may produce CO. If such appliances are not installed, maintained and used properly, CO may accumulate to dangerous 
levels. Cars, motorcycles and lawnmowers also produce CO. Blocked chimneys and flues also can cause buildup of CO in the 
home, as can use of a charcoal grill or hibachi in the house or in a car, RV or camper. </p>
<p><b>Precautions:</b> Know the signs of CO poisoning: dizziness, fatigue, headache, confusion, nausea, irregular breathing or vomiting. 
Never keep a car, motorcycle or lawnmower running in a closed or attached garage. Have a qualified service technician check 
your home's central and room heating appliances (including water heaters and gas dryers). Open doors and windows when using 
unvented kerosene and gas space heaters. Have your chimney and flue checked for blockages. Never use a range or oven to 
heat a room. Install a CO detector. For more CO tips send a selfaddressed stamped envelope to, CO Check, CFA, P.O. Box 
12099, Washington, DC 200050999. </p>
<h3>Used Cribs </h3>
<p><b>Hazard:</b> Some used cribs pose a threat to your baby. Every year, about 50 babies suffocate or strangle when trapped between 
broken crib parts or in cribs with older, unsafe designs. </p>
<p><b>Precaution:</b> Some typical used crib hazards include: missing, loose or broken screws and other crib parts; crib slat spacing 
more than 23/8&quot;; corner posts higher than the end panels; easily dislodged mattress supports; and peeling paint. For complete 
crib safety information write, Is Your Crib Safe?, The Danny Foundation, 3158 Danville Blvd., P.O. Box 680, Alamo, CA 
94507 or call 18008332669. When purchasing a new crib, be sure it has been certified to meet national safety standards by an 
independent laboratory. </p>
<h3>Drinking Water and Cryptosporidium </h3>
<p><b>Hazard:</b> A tiny parasite called cryptosporidium (crypto), commonly found in lakes and rivers, makes drinking tap water treated 
according to current standards unsafe for people with severely weakened immune systems. Crypto is able to pass through water 
treatment filtration and resists chlorine that kills other germs. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates 
that up to 6 million vulnerable Americans (cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy, transplant patients taking 
immunosuppressive drugs, and people with HIV/AIDS) are at risk of serious illness or death from crypto infections. In 1993 
some 400,000 people contracted crypto and over 100 died in the Milwaukee outbreak. </p>
<p><b>Precaution:</b> The CDC recommends that people with severely suppressed immune systems consult their healthcare providers 
about whether their drinking water should be boiled (1 minute), filtered (Absolute 1 micron), or bottled. Not all bottled water is 
safe. An inexpensive and safe water is sold in jugs labeled &quot;distilled.&quot; For more information ask for Drinking Water &amp; AIDS at 
the National Association of People with AIDS: 2028980414 or write them at 1413 K St., NW, 7th Fl., Washington, DC 
20005; or call the EPA's Safe Drinking Water Hotline, 18004264791 </p>

<p><strong>Introduction</strong> </p>
<p>This past year marked the first known substantial recovery in California against a county adoption agency for its failure to 
disclose to adopting parents their adopted child's medical and psychological history. <i>Forter v. San Mateo County </i>is the first 
known successful adoption fraud case in the United States, but it is not unique. There are many equally tragic cases that await the 
discovery of mental health professionals and the efforts of trial lawyers to help these families obtain the funding necessary for 
lifetime psychiatric care. </p>
<p><strong>The Adoption Agency's Duty to Disclose </strong></p>
<p>The essence of an adoption fraud case is contained in <i>Michael J. </i>v.<i> L.A. City Department of Adoptions</i> (1988) 201 C. A. 3d 
859, 876, which in recognizing an action for misrepresentation and fraudulent concealment of an adopted child's pre-adoption 
history, held that in an adoption <i>&quot;there must be a good faith full disclosure of material facts concerning existing or past 
conditions of the child's health.&quot; </i>[Emphasis added.] </p>
<p>Full disclosure is important because under Civil Code Section 206 parents are under a lifetime obligation to support their 
adopted child and California law mandates that &quot;it is the duty of the father, the mother, and the children of any person in need 
who is unable to maintain himself by work, to maintain such person to the extent of their ability.&quot; </p>
<p>Case law going back to the 1930s confirms that the term &quot;person in need&quot; includes a physically or mentally handicapped or 
disabled person who is unable to be self-maintaining by work. <i>Chun</i> v. <i>Chun</i> (1987) 190 C. A. 3d 589 reiterates this 
longstanding public policy in its holding that an emotionally disabled adult was a &quot;person in need&quot; under the statute and imposed 
on the father the duty to support to prevent the adult child from becoming a public charge.</p>
<p>Adoptions occurring between January 1, 1979 and January 1, 1981 are governed by California Civil Code Section 224s, 
amended Statutes 1978, Chapter 429, page 1339, which provides in part: </p>
<ul>
<li>No agency shall place a child for adoption unless the agency has submitted a written medical report on the child's medical 
background, if available, and, so far as ascertainable, the medical background of the child's natural parents, conforming to 
requirements which shall be specified by the State Department of Social Services, to the prospective adopting parents and 
such prospective adopting parents have acknowledged in writing the receipt of such a report. </li>
</ul>
<p>Civil Code Section 224s was amended effective January 1, 1981, Statutes 1980, Chapter 1229, page 4153, as follows: </p>
<ul>
<li>No agency shall place a child for adoption unless a written report on the child's background, if available, and, so far as 
ascertainable, the medical background of the child's birth parents, has been submitted to the prospective adopting parents 
and the prospective adopting parents have acknowledged in writing the receipt of such report. The written report on the 
child's background shall contain all diagnostic information which is known, including current medical reports on the child, 
psychological evaluation, and scholastic information, as well as all known information regarding the child's developmental 
history and family life. </li>
</ul>
<p>Both statutory duties are for the benefit of prospective adoptive parents and children. Further disclosure obligations have been 
imposed as described below. </p>
<p>While vigorous advocacy for the victims of adoption fraud can provide valuable remedies, these cases are extremely challenging 
from both a legal and factual perspective. Here are some of the pitfalls to be avoided. </p>
<p><strong>Timely File a Claim </strong></p>
<p><i>As soon as the child's parent suspects fraud by a public adoption agency, a claim must be filed within six months to 
preserve the parents' claims for damages for lifetime support and within one year to preserve the child's cause of action. </i></p>
<p>The time for filing a claim against the public agency begins to run <i>as soon as a reasonable person should have been on notice 
</i>of governmental misconduct. This defense is not summarily avoided because the issue is factual and each new fact uncovered 
concerning the child's history becomes a further piece of defense ammunition to be advanced against the plaintiff in light of all the 
surrounding facts. </p>
<p>The pitfall to be avoided is inadvertently proving the defense in efforts to establish the parents' and child's claim for damages for 
emotional harm. While it may be true that the parents and child have suffered over the years as a result of the agency's 
misconduct, proving the parents' damage case by emphasizing the bizarre conduct of the child and the length of time it continued 
also helps to establish the defense that &quot;anybody would have suspected&quot; pre-natal injury, pre-adoption abuse, and the like. In 
short, because hindsight is perfect there is a natural tendency to assume that the adopting parents should have concluded that 
they have been defrauded long before they learned the truth. So keep in mind that while proving damages these same facts will 
be argued by the defense in support of its statute of limitations defense. </p>
<p>In <i>Forter</i> the County repeatedly raised its limitations defense throughout discovery hoping to be able to develope enough facts to 
prove at trial that the parents <i>should</i> have suspected something was awry when their son's conduct began to become 
unacceptable, which was long before they filed their claim. It is reasonable to expect that this will occur in every case. Since 
hindsight is perfect, as the child's history of acting out comes forward it is important to keep it in perspective and within the 
context of the challenges of helping an adopted child adjust, often a lifetime process. Parents of adopted children must always 
struggle with making adjustments, and childhood conduct by itself without the benefit of knowing the child's history, medical 
background, and parental health care history does not lead to any meaningful action by parents. In addition, even with early 
referral to a child psychologist, without an accurate history the professional efforts of the therapist are dramatically less effective. 
Nonetheless, once the concealed history is revealed the etiology becomes so clear and compelling that it is easy for a lay person 
to mistakenly conclude that Mom and Dad should have suspected pre-adoption abuse, pre-natal alcohol or drug abuse by the 
natural mother, or the birth parents history of mental illness, and thereby provide the adoption agency with a good defense. An 
early claim disposes of this hazard. </p>
<p>As soon as a parent suspects fraud by the placing agency, a claim should be filed immediately. As a practical matter, the real 
basis of the action will not be provable until counsel examines in deal the voluminous records created in every public adoption. 
These documents are only available with a court order once an action is filed, so do not delay in filing a claim at the very earliest 
moment because it is only after suit that plaintiffs' counsel will be able to verify the facts initially reported by the adopting parents. </p>
<p><strong>Plan for Substantial Case Costs </strong></p>
<p>Preparing an adoption fraud case, like any case involving damages in excess of a million dollars, is expensive because of the need 
for expert witness testimony. Knowing what resources you will need will help you prepare and assure a complete investigation 
before unnecessarily committing funds to a case where a recovery is problematic. </p>
<p><i>Forter v. County of San Mateo </i>required the testimony of the original treating psychologist who first saw the plaintiff when he 
was age three, the current child psychiatrist to testify concerning his current condition, prognosis, and the impact of the 
concealment of his psychiatric history and delayed treatment, a professor of social work on the failure to meet the standard of 
care in the original placement of the child, the treating pediatrician who had not been provided with the child's psychiatric 
records, a pediatric neurologist concerning the importance of a complete history in diagnosing childhood disorders, an adult 
psychiatrist concerning the plaintiff's prognosis in the absence of immediate special care, a psychologist/educational specialist 
who prepared a treatment lifeplan and presented the cost of services for the balance of this teenager's life expectancy, and an 
economist. There were several thousand pages of records to read from psychologists, several mental hospitals, Child Protective 
Services, AFDC files, adoption files and criminal records on the natural mother and total discovery came to twenty lengthy 
depositions. Pre-trial case costs advanced in <i>Forter, </i>exclusive of attorney's time, totaled $47,000. But for accepting the 
responsibility to pay these expenses and the anticipation that contingency fee would be approved by the court, this child's future 
psychiatric needs would remain unpaid. </p>
<p><strong>Contest the $250 Limit on Recoveries for Post-1983 Adoptions </strong></p>
<p>Placements after January 1, 1984 are subject to a peculiar limitation on recovery of $250 under <i>The Adoption Information Act 
of 1983</i>, codified in Civil Code Section 204t(14). Adoptions that are finalized before December 31, 1983 are not subject to this 
limitation, although the adoption agency will argue the contrary. In <i>Forter </i>this defense was raised by summary judgment and 
again at the time of trial. </p>
<p>Since the damage caused by failing to disclose a child's history can have a devastating impact in appropriate cases occurring after 
1984 this statute must be challenged. </p>
<p>Many conduct disorders do not blossom until early puberty and are not fully appreciated until teenage years. As a practical 
matter, parents who report an incorrigible 13 or 14 year old, born in 1979 or 1980 most probably completed the adoption 
before 1984 and can bring suit unimpeded by the necessity to challenge Section 204t(14). </p>
<p>If the adoption was finalized after January 1, 1984, before challenging the legitimacy of the limitations on damages, carefully 
scrutinize the underlying facts to determine if this is the optimum case before delving into the legislative history behind Section 
t(14). There is no current case law on this statute. </p>
<p>The legislative history behind the statutory scheme requiring full disclosure was intended to also allow for an adopted child to be 
able to find out about his/her natural parents. In order to avoid potential damages as a result of this disclosure process the 
Legislature limited damages under the new statute to $250. Obviously, there was no intention to limit the lifetime damages of a 
child who has been irreparably injured by the willful misconduct of a social workers or other actions of employees of a 
Department of Social Services that have caused a child's life to be permanently warped. </p>
<p>Defendants will argue that <i>The Adoption Information Act of 1983</i>, specifically Section 14 of chapter 1162 of the Statutes of 
1983, limits their liability exposure to $250.00 in all cases, even adoptions occurring before its effective date, January 1, 1984. </p>
<p>For the argument to prevail, with regard to adoptions prior to December 31, 1983, a court would have to <i>retroactively</i> apply 
<i>The Adoption Information Act</i>. Courts routinely do not take such action. </p>
<ul>
<li>Retroactive laws are generally disfavored because the parties affected have no notice of the new law affecting past 
conduct... (citation omitted). Consequently, new enacted statutes are presumed to apply prospectively only unless a clear 
intent to the contrary is expressed by the Legislature. <i>Russell v. Superior Court</i> (1986) 185 CA3d 810, 814. </li>
</ul>
<p>There is absolutely no indication of any intent, let alone a clear intent, by the Legislature to apply <i>The Adoption Information Act 
of 1983</i> retroactively. In fact, the only specific references to when <i>The Adoption Information Act of 1983</i> would apply, other 
than the presumed normal prospective application, is the delayed prospective application referenced in Section 10 which states: 
&quot;Sections 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7 of this act shall be operative January 1, 1986.&quot; </p>
<ul>
<li>Other cases have refused to apply new damage provisions retroactively in the absence of clear legislative intent, on the 
ground that the new statutes reduced the amount of available damages and thus worked a &quot;modification of liability,&quot; 
changing the legal effect of past transactions, rights and obligations. <i>Russell, supra, </i>at 816. </li>
</ul>
<p>Even if there were a clear legislative intent to apply the 1983 statute retroactively, which there is not, such retroactive application 
would not effect a plaintiff's independent common law tort causes of action for fraud, intentional misrepresentation and 
concealment, negligent misrepre-sentation and concealment, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and negligent infliction of 
emotional distress. These common law tort causes of action exist independently from any statutory violation of Civil Code 
Section 224s. </p>
<p>Lastly, <i>and conclusively</i>, in <i>Michael J.,</i> footnote 9, the Court stated: </p>
<ul>
<li>The limitation of liability . . . &quot;with regard to the programs authorized by this act&quot; to two hundred and fifty ($250.00) for 
each such act or omission (citation omitted) would not apply to misrepresentations in the adoptive process outside of 
<i>these particular programs. </i>[Emphasis added.] </li>
</ul>
<p>These &quot;particular programs&quot; enacted in <i>1983</i> did not exist beforehand and making liability for any act or omission with regard to 
programs authorized by this act an <i>impossibility</i> prior to December 31, 1983. </p>
<p>A plaintiff's delayed discovery of the adoption agency's fraud, which tolled the commencement of the statute of limitations, has no 
bearing on a defendant's attempt to accomplish a logical impossibility. While a plaintiff's causes of action will have accrued 
following delayed discovery prior to the filing of the claim and complaint, the law which effectively applies to a defendant are 
those which were in effect at the time of defendant's misrepresentations and concealment. </p>
<p>The Legislature's intent in passing <i>The Adoption Information Act of 1983 </i>was to facilitate efforts by adopted children to find 
their natural parents. In order to promote that goal and anticipating complaints by both children and natural parents of poor 
record keeping or wrongful disclosure, the Legislature adopted a $250 limit on damage claims against adoption agencies. The 
unfortunate outcome is that the Act now can be used by both negligent and willful wrongdoers to shield themselves from 
responsibility for failure to disclose a child's medical history and the devastating damage caused by such concealment. This 
resulting injustice must be corrected by our Courts or Legislature. </p>
<p><strong>Inquiries at the Initial Client Meeting </strong></p>
<p>First determine if the the initial placement or the adoption occurred before January 1, 1984, for the reasons explained above. 
Once that hurdle is crossed, plan to devote several hours to working with your client to review all records and to begin writing a 
cogent history of every contact between the adoption agency and the family before and after placement. Your goal is to begin 
piecing together the history so that a detailed chronology will be readily available for reporting to your experts, for motions, 
settlement conference statement, and trial brief. In large part this history will not be finished until after the agency's adoption 
records have been produced. </p>
<p>At the initial meeting find out what type of child the adopting parents initially requested from the adoption agency when they filed 
their application. What were they were told about the child's and his/her natural parents' medical and social history <i>at the time of 
placement or adoption </i>as required by Civil Code Section 224s? </p>
<p>Is the child's condition today consistent with undisclosed prenatal abuse, fetal alcohol syndrome, pre-adoption physical, 
emotional abuse or neglect, or inherited mental illness? Has there been a failure to bond? Is the child abusive, rebellious, out-of- 
control, sexually active, or violent? </p>
<p>Has the adoption agency admitted at any time that it failed to fully disclose or at any time after the adoption made any additional 
disclosure? Has the client demanded from the agency all records which may indicate the cause of the child's current condition? If 
so, when? How long has the client's statute of limitations time clock been ticking? </p>
<p>Has the failure to disclose aggravated the child's condition or delayed securing appropriate treatment? </p>
<p><strong>Content of the Claim and the Complaint </strong></p>
<p><i>Under current law, a claim is treated as a pleading and must set forth, each party, each legal theory upon which a 
recovery will be sought and each item of damage. </i></p>
<p>It is important to include as claimants both the child, the adopting parents, and any siblings who have also suffered as a result of 
the disruption to the family home caused by the adopted child's psychiatric condition. </p>
<p>A claim must include each theory of liability and the supporting facts. In short, say more rather than less in explaining the basis of 
liability and the damages claimed. Since the essence of the action is delayed discovery, be especially careful to plead the date 
your client first suspected they had a cause of action against the adoption agency. </p>
<p>The Government Code Section 818.8 and 822.2 grants public entities immunity from liability for negligent misrepresentation. The 
immunities apply only to interferences with financial or commercial interests, including issuances of permits or licenses. <i>Johnson 
v. State</i> (1968) 69 Cal.2d 782, 800. These immunities do not shield defendants from liability for misrepresentation or deceit in 
adoptions. <i>Michael J.</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 872. So while the claim must include as grounds for liability willful misrepresentation and 
concealment, in order to secure the resources and participation of the agency's insurance carriers in any eventual settlement, the 
claim and the complaint to follow must plead the defendants' negligent conduct, negligent infliction of emotion harm and 
negligence <i>per se</i> for violating statutory duties. </p>
<p>Claimed economic damages should include: past and future mental health care for life, including residential care; supervising 
advocate for life; life time home care and supervision; and lifetime lost wages for the child. </p>
<p>Do not forget to include non-economic, general damages for every claimant. </p>
<p>Although public entities as a matter of law are not subject to punitive damages for oppression and despicable misconduct, public 
employees can be held for punitive damages. So while punitive damages need not be listed in the claim, be sure to include a 
punitive damage claim against the individual tortfeasors in the final complaint. </p>
<p><strong>Relinquishment is Not the Exclusive Remedy </strong></p>
<p>The defendants will claim that the parents exclusive remedy is to relinquish their child under Civil Code Section 228.10 which 
provides that a petition to relinquish &quot; shall be filed within five years after the entering of the decree or order of adoption.&quot; In most 
cases, the five year statute will have run years ago and the agency will claim it is insulated from suit. </p>
<p>This argument is flatly contradicted by the express language of Section 228.10 itself. There is no mention nor hint in Section 
228.10, nor in any case, that it was intended to be an exclusive remedy. </p>
<p>The plain wording of the statute is that relinquishment is one option. The word used is &quot;may:&quot; &quot;a petition setting forth those facts 
<i>may</i> be filed by the adoptive parents&quot; and &quot;If those facts are proved to the satisfaction of the court, it <i>may</i> make an order setting 
aside the decree or order of adoption.&quot; There is no mandatory language used in Section 228.10, and be sure to explain to the 
court when the defendant's motion is heard that the word is &quot;may&quot; not &quot;must.&quot; </p>
<p>The fact is that Section 228.10 (formerly Section 227(b)) dates back approximately fifty years. Yet claims for <i>monetary 
damages</i> have been approved for concealment and misrepresentation in the area of social services. In reversing Summary 
Judgment, the <i>Michael J. </i>Court specifically <i>held</i> at 875: </p>
<ul>
<li>Under these circumstances, and <i>recognizing deliberate concealment and misrepresentation would be actionable</i>, we 
hold that Summary Judgment is improper. (emphasis added) </li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, case law approves of claims for damages and this statute offers no support for a wishful exclusive remedy defense. If the 
adoption statutes are to be liberally construed to promote justice and the welfare of the children, the statutes cannot be tortuously 
construed to insulate wrongdoers who conceal and misrepresent all to the harm of the child and their adopting parents. </p>
<p>Defendants will also claim in support of an exclusive remedy claim that money damages awards will cause more children to be 
deemed &quot;unadoptable&quot; because they might later develop mental illness. </p>
<p>The effect of exposure to money damages awards is to force full disclosure of information to the adopting parents in compliance 
with the law, and discourage the reprehensible concealment and misrepresentation seen in the instant case. After all, &quot;just as 
couples must weigh the risks of becoming natural parents, taking into consideration a host of factors, so too should adoptive 
parents be allowed to make their decision in an intelligent manner.&quot; <i>Michael J., supra,</i> footnote 10. Adoptive parents should not 
be left to make the life-long decision of adoption with anything less than all the available information on the child. </p>
<p>If the exclusive remedy argument were the law, adoption agencies could routinely withhold vital information from adoptive 
parents with impunity. Civil Code Section 224s would be rendered meaningless. Defendants could withhold information to 
facilitate the adoptive parents' agreement to adopt, and if the situation did not work out or the concealed information became 
known, the adoptive parents could only petition to vacate the order of adoption, but only if the adoptive parents petitioned within 
five years. Beyond five years the adoptive parents and the child would have no remedy for what will inevitably become a life-long 
tragedy for both. That is the true social cost of the concealment and misrepresentation that adoption agencies seek to protect 
from liability with their absurd exclusive remedy argument. </p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Adoption fraud cases couple claims for psychiatric injuries to a child, with the claims of parents who have been emotionally and 
financially brutalized by an adoption that was expected to bring happiness to their home and family. Losing the expectation of a 
happy child and a wholesome home life and having it replaced with wholesale grief is an especially tragic injury to be inflicted on 
parents who opened their homes, families, financial resources, and their hearts to a needy child. The lifetime damage inflicted on 
children, leaving them only with the prospect of being anti-social and unemployable due to emotional injuries and damaged 
personalities, obviously leaves them as prime candidates for criminal activity, prosecution and imprisonment. </p>
<p>The strength of the tort law is that it provides the jury a public forum to express the community's standard of accountability. In the 
wrongful placement of children for adoption, there are no emotional or psychological impediments to the jury's unleashing a roar 
of disapproval, once the legal hurdles have been overcome. Obtaining a recovery for a wrongfully adoption placement is requires 
informed and extremely vigorous advocacy. </p>
<p>Current legal impediments to assure these victims full and complete psychiatric care should be removed. Our least protected 
citizens, orphaned children, deserve the best possible care by county adoption agencies and when that does not occur our 
Courts and Legislature should provide full and complete remedies to hold perpetrators of adoption fraud fully accountable. </p>

<p>The advent of the computer has impacted and entered all arenas of every American profession. 
The court is no exception. Computers have already been used in court to provide visual 
simulations of car crashes,[1] three dimensional visual simulations of passenger aircraft crashes,[2] 
and to match the DNA structure of an accused with the perpetrator of a crime.[3] As computers 
capabilities increase with technology, courts are being forced to consider the extent to which 
computer illustrations and program based simulations will be allowed into the courtroom. 
Traditionally, courts have determined the admissibility of computer modeling through application of 
the &quot;<i>Frye</i> test,&quot;[4] which asks if proposed evidence has been &quot;sufficiently established to have 
gained general acceptance in the particular field in which it belongs.&quot;[5] This past summer the 
United States Supreme Court unanimously directed federal courts to abandon the <i>Frye</i> test in 
favor of a more liberal standard for admitting novel scientific evidence.[6] This more liberal 
standard, as set out in <i>Daubert,</i> will guide and advance the use of computer modeling in 
courtroom testimony. </p>
<p><strong>COMPUTER MODELING -- CAPABILITIES AND CATEGORIES </strong></p>
<p>All computer models can be stored on laser video discs. Among other things, these video discs 
require no rewinding or fast forwarding, can instantly bring up any desired frame of a presentation, 
can show an event from several possible vantage points, can condense display of deterioration of 
an object to a few minutes, and can highlight important focus points of a presentation. Computer 
models are powerful tools, capable of leaving a powerful, indelible impression on the trier of fact. </p>
<p>Different types of computer models serve different functions, and the admissibility of each type of 
model is dependent upon the model's function and the process through which the function is 
performed. For our purposes, computer modeling programs will be divided into four parts.[7] </p>
<p>In the first category the computer is used to arrive at solutions to standard, often used equations, 
such as those used for determining velocity, force of impact, or path of trajectory. The computer s 
usefulness in category 1 lies only in its ability to quickly and accurately determine solutions to 
otherwise complex and tedious equations. The data put into the computer and the computer s 
output can be easily verified. </p>
<p>The second category involves computer-generated graphics used to illustrate a proposed sequence 
of events as testified by an expert. The computer model in this category is similar to an artist's paint 
brush; the model is simply a tool which is controlled by the user. The quality and accuracy of the 
generated illustration is entirely dependent upon the knowledge and skill of the artist. The computer 
is not used to create events, it is only used to simplify an expert's testimony by the use of 
illustration. The expert's opinion is arrived at independently of the computer and the evidence is 
considered demonstrative rather than substantive. This computer model category has not been 
subject to the rigorous standards of the <i>Frye</i> test.[8] Category 2 illustrations will be admitted as 
evidence if they fairly and accurately reflect the oral testimony they supplement and do not unfairly 
bias the jury. </p>
<p>In contrast to category 2, the computer model in category 3 helps to formulate a theory to an 
event. Known variables are given to the computer, and from these variables, a computer is able to 
construct an illustration based upon standard equations programmed into the computer. For 
instance, in a case concerning an automobile collision, variables such as speed, mass of vehicle, 
and angle of impact, may be known. From the known variables, the computer estimates unknown 
variables and creates a simulation of the collision. The simulation program used by the computer as 
well as the computer's output can be examined and tested, but the output cannot feasibly be 
obtained without computer assistance. Because the computer model in category 3 is used as 
probative rather than demonstrative evidence, higher standards govern its admissibility as evidence. </p>
<p>Like category 3 computer models, category 4 models manipulate known variables to create an 
output and are used as probative evidence. Unlike category 3 models, however, the manner in 
which category 4 models manipulate data to achieve their output is too complex to be verified for 
accuracy. A simulation of a car crash using a category 4 model would be highly sophisticated, but, 
as a byproduct of this sophistication, the process used to derive the simulation would be too 
complex for examination. Thus, while category 4 models allow us to gain output that cannot 
otherwise be obtained, the model's usefulness is restricted by our inability to verify, by 
examination, an output. </p>
<p>While each category of computer modeling will be affected differently by the standards of 
<i>Daubert,</i> this step forward in recognizing new developments in science will liberalize admissibility 
of all categories. </p>
<p><strong>OVERVIEW AND EXTENT OF</strong><strong><i> DAUBERT </i></strong></p>
<p>The Supreme Court's tone in <i>Daubert</i> is guided by the liberal premise of Federal Rule of Evidence 
402 which states, &quot;[a]ll relevant evidence is admissible.&quot;[9] In <i>Daubert</i>, two minor children and 
their parents sued Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc. claiming that the children's birth defects were 
caused by the mother's ingestion of Benedectin during pregnancy. Undisputed testimony 
established that in more than 30 published studies involving over 130,000 patients, maternal use of 
Bendectin during the first trimester of pregnancy was not shown to be a risk factor for human birth 
defects. In spite of these studies, plaintiffs used expert witness testimony to support their claim that 
Benedectin caused the childrens' birth defects. The experts based their testimony on one 
unpublished study which found a link between Benedectin and birth defects. The United State 
Court of Appeals dismissed the case, finding that because the study was unpublished, it was not 
subject to peer review and could not meet the Frye test of &quot;general acceptance.&quot; The Supreme 
Court, however, vacated the ruling of the Court of Appeals and unanimously held (Parts I and IIA 
of the Court's opinion) that Federal Rule of Evidence 7 02 superceded the <i>Frye</i> test, and that the 
<i>Frye</i> test was therefore inappropriate. Rule 702 states, &quot;If scientific, technical, or other specialized 
knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue, a 
witness qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education, may testify 
thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise.&quot; Nothing in Rule 702 requires &quot;general acceptance&quot; 
of the &quot;scientific, technical, or specialized knowledge&quot; sought to be admitted as evidence, so the 
Court reasoned, &quot;general acceptance&quot; is an inappropriate requirement to admission under Rule 
702. The Court stated, &quot;general acceptance is not a necessary precondition to the admission of 
scientific evidence.&quot; </p>
<p>While not binding on State courts, it is likely that <i>Daubert</i>, combined with modern criticism of the 
<i>Frye</i> test,[10] will soon extinguish use of <i>Frye</i> throughout the United States. The trier of fact, 
rather than the relevant expert community, will ultimately decide the place of novel scientific or 
technical knowledge in the court. </p>
<p>In Parts IIB, III and IV of <i>Daubert</i>, Justice Blackmun, joined by six other justices, attempts to 
provide guidelines for determining admissibility of scientific evidence under Rule 702. Although the 
Court's opinion specifically applies to scientific evidence,[11] state and lower federal courts will 
probably adopt Justice Blackmun's general language as the standard for determining admissibility 
of all technical and specialized evidence, including computer modeling.[12] Given an abandonment 
of the <i>Frye</i> test, Justice Blackmun's opinion in <i>Daubert</i> provides the only available standard for 
state and lower federal courts. </p>
<p><strong>GENERAL ADMISSIBILITY OF COMPUTER MODELING AS EVIDENCE </strong></p>
<p>The Court's majority describes trial judges as gatekeepers who have a duty to ensure that all 
evidence is reliable and relevant. The Court points out, however, that to be reliable, evidence does 
not have to be certain -- it is enough that &quot;good grounds&quot; for the evidence exists based upon what 
is known. Given this reasoning, computer models which construct a viable hypothesis based upon 
known facts can be reliable and should be admitted as evidence, even if the hypothesis cannot 
absolutely be proven as true. </p>
<p>The Court tests relevancy by asking if evidence has a &quot;valid scientific connection to the pertinent 
inquiry&quot; -- if a model addresses a significant issue in a case. In a further effort to guide lower courts 
in their determination of &quot;reliability and relevancy,&quot; the Supreme Court lists several factors 
important in determining whether novel scientific evidence can be admitted into the court. </p>
<p>First, the Court asked if evidence can be, or has been, tested to ensure that proposed evidence 
will yield true results and have a strong resistance to falsification. Second, the Court considered if 
evidence has been subject to &quot;peer review and publication.&quot; The Court reasons that flaws in a 
novel theory are best discovered and exposed by review from peers in the field. Third, the Court 
considered the &quot;standards controlling the technique's operation&quot; and the level of a known or 
potential rate of error resulting from the technique's operation. If a theory cannot, or is not, applied 
efficiently, or yields a high rate of error in application, it cannot be considered reliable. Fourth, the 
court maintained that while not dispositive, &quot;general acceptance&quot; has some bearing on evidence 
reliability. </p>
<p>Thus, even though the <i>Frye</i> test is no longer the single standard determining the admissibility of 
novel scientific or technical evidence, &quot;general acceptance&quot; is still one consideration in determining 
admissibility of evidence under Rule 702. </p>
<p>Finally, pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 403, the Court considers whether the &quot;probative 
value [of the evidence] is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of 
the issues, or misleading the jury . . . .&quot;[13] So even though a computer model is determined to be 
relevant and reliable, a court can bar the model from introduction as evidence if the model will 
prejudice the jury. For example, a category 2 illustration of a vehicle accident involving a 
decapitation may yield the most accurate illustration of the accid ent possible, but if too graphic, 
the illustration may be barred as evidence. </p>
<p>None of the tests suggested by the Supreme Court, however, are individually required. The tests 
are to be considered in the aggregate along with other relevant factors. The Court takes the 
position that the trier of fact, not a specialized community, should determine evidence validity. The 
Court reasoned, &quot;[v]igorous cross-examination, presentation of contrary evidence, and careful 
instruction on the burden of proof are the traditional and appropriate means of attacking shaky but 
admissible evidence.&quot; Under the Court's liberal view &quot;pertinent evidence based upon scientifically 
valid principles&quot; meets the admissibility standards of Rule 702 and should be admitted, even if the 
evidence has not been generally accepted. </p>
<p><strong>ADMISSIBILITY OF VARIOUS COMPUTER MODELS AS EVIDENCE </strong></p>
<p>Under the new &quot;<i>Dauber</i>t test&quot; it is likely that computer modeling categories 1-3 will be allowed 
into evidence, while the future of category 4 computer models remains uncertain. </p>
<p>Category 1 involves formulas which meet all of the admissibility tests under <i>Daubert</i>. These 
formulas have been reviewed and accepted by experts in the field, and computers are able to 
apply these formulas with a lower rate of error than can be done without the use of a computer. 
Courts should freely allow the use of category 1 computer models as an aid to evidence gathering. </p>
<p>Category 2 models, computer illustrations, will also be liberally admitted into evidence. An 
illustration must fairly and accurately reflect the oral testimony it supplements without unfairly 
biasing the jury, but whether an illustration was created by computer or hand is irrelevant to is 
admissibility. </p>
<p>The output from category 3 computer models cannot generally be obtained without a computer, 
but the model's data, formula, and output can be verified. Based on the Supreme Court's language 
in <i>Daubert</i>, the fact that a computer was needed to obtain a given output does not preclude that 
output from being admitted as evidence. The Court stated, &quot;[t]he focus of course must be solely on 
principles and methodology, not on the conclusions that they generate.&quot; DNA matching techniques 
provide one example of controversial category 3 evidence which is gaining acceptance in the 
courts. In allowing computer aided DNA matching, the Hawaii Supreme Court found a model to 
be admissible as evidence when the model's underlying data and the procedure used to obtain the 
model were found valid.[14] As long as the program and data used in a category 3 computer 
model are reviewable and meet the criteria of <i>Daubert</i>, the output generated should be admissible 
as evidence. Furthermore, as substantive evidence, category 3 computer models can be replayed 
by the jury during deliberation.[15] </p>
<p>Category 4, often referred to as the &quot;black box,&quot; involves computer programs that cannot be 
thoroughly analyzed or tested. Thus, while the underlying principle of the proposed evidence can 
be subject to peer review and verified, the validity of the technique applying this principle cannot 
be examined. Because it is difficult to test the model for &quot;falsability&quot; or accuracy, because the 
model's operational techniques cannot be examined, and because the model may have trouble 
gaining general acceptance, category 4 computer models will often be precluded from admission 
into evidence under the Daubert test. Courts are reluctant to admit computer evidence when the 
program, output, or underlying data cannot be examined by the opposing party.[16] However, if a 
complex computer model's accuracy, security, low error rate, and general acceptance can be 
verified through empirical use and testing of the model, the model should be admitted into evidence 
under the new <i>Daubert</i> test. Moreover, the Court's statement that &quot;traditional barriers to opinion 
testimony&quot; should be relaxed so that &quot;traditional but appropriate means of attacking shaky but 
admissible evidence&quot; can be implemented, sends a strong message that even marginally supported 
evidence should be presented for consideration by the trier of fact. </p>
<p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong> </p>
<p>By abolishing the outdated <i>Frye</i> test and liberalizing admittance of evidence under Rule 702, the 
Supreme Court has allowed courts to keep pace with advancing technology and to achieve a more 
efficient and just legal system. Today, even specialized communities are inundated with advancing 
technologies, and new technology is able to achieve reliability and validity long before it can 
achieve &quot;general acceptance.&quot; In allowing the trier of fact to be exposed to controversial evidence, 
the Court has not taken reviewability of a novel theory out of the hands of those most capable of 
judging the theory; the validity of scientific or technical evidence will still be based on and 
determined by testimony from the appropriate expert community. The Court has simply allowed 
the trier of facts an opportunity to hear evidence offered, and to reconcile conflicting opinions 
among the expert community. Liberally allowing evidence to be presented before the jury is 
consistent with the idea that only a judge or jury may make factual conclusions in a given case. 
Whether a theory or model provides an accurate account of reality is a factual determination. The 
Court's decision in <i>Daubert</i> will preserve powers constitutionally vested to the trier of fact and 
enable the courts to keep pace with rising technology of computer models. </p>

apply to an expert seeking to testify on the basis of 'technical or other specialized knowledge' -- 
the other types of expert knowledge to which Rule 702 applies -- or are the 'general observations' 
limited only to 'scientific knowledge'? What is the difference between scientific knowledge and 
technical knowledge; does Rule 702 actually contemplate that the phrase 'scientific, technical, or

authors simply pick general descriptive language covering the sort of expert testimony which courts

<h4>INTRODUCTION</h4>
<p>In <i>Singh v. ERA </i>(Santa Clara County) two pedestrians were struck by a vehicle operated by a real estate agent in the course of 
business. The agent's broker was a franchisee of a nationwide real estate firm. The broker had insufficient coverage to satisfy the 
plaintiffs' damages and absent a recovery against the nationally known franchisor, the plaintiffs would have been substantially 
penalized. Clearly, the franchisor was not an employer of the tortfeasor and initially appeared to be primarily in charge of a 
national advertising campaign from its headquarters in Kansas City with no actual control over day-to-day operations in 
California. </p>
<p>Suit was filed against the franchisor under a theory of joint venture liability for the negligent acts of its franchisee's employees, 
since the liability of one joint venturer or his agents/employees, incurred in connection with the venture, is imputed to all others. 
(<i>Hupfield v. Wadley</i> (1948) 89 Cal.App.2d 171, 175-176; <i>Knight v. Cook </i>(1963) 212 Cal.App.2d 613, 616.) Under 
California law, existence of a joint venture is a triable question of material fact (<i>April Enterprises, Inc. v. KTTV</i> (1983) 147 
Cal.App.3d 805), even though the franchise agreement recites the franchisee is an independent contractor. Such a recital does 
not foreclose a finding of joint venture because the conduct of the parties may create a joint venture despite an express 
declaration to the contrary. (<i>Ibid.; Universal Sales Corp. v. California Press Manufacturing</i> (1942) 20 Cal.2d 751, 764, 
765.)</p>
<h4>JOINT VENTURES</h4>
<p>California, restating the common law of most states, defines a joint venture as</p>
<ul>
<li>a relationship which arises from an agreement between two or more persons to undertake some common objective for the 
benefit of all in pursuit of which each is authorized to act for the other[s]. Such an agreement may be expressed in words 
or may reasonably be implied from the circumstances. Book of Approved Jury Instructions, No. 13.40. </li>
</ul>
<p>A joint venture by definition is an undertaking by two or more persons jointly to carry out a single business enterprise for profit. 
(<i>Nelson v. Abraham</i> (1947) 29 Cal.2d 745, 749.) Joint venturers combine their property, money, efforts, skills or knowledge in 
some common undertaking, have a community of interest in the venture to jointly participate in the conduct of the business, share 
profits and losses, and have the right to exert mutual control. (40 Cal.Jur.3d, Joint Ventures, Sections 2-3, pp. 181-182.) </p>
<p>Franchisees and franchisors have the common objective of profiting from the sale of their products and/or services. Satisfying this 
objective creates profits for both and together they combine their property, money, efforts, skills and knowledge to maximize 
their sales. Thus, franchisors and franchisees have a community of interest in maximizing sales of their product or service. The 
franchisor might share in the profits by requiring the franchisee to pay a fee based on gross sales volume. More importantly, when 
a franchisee increases its sales, the franchisor profits from the strengthening of its own name recognition which directly enhances 
the value of the franchise system as a whole and gives value to every franchise it sells. (Frew and Jud, <i>The Value of a Real 
Estate Franchise</i>, 14 A.R.E.U.E.A. Journal 2 (1986).) Sharing of losses is inferred if one member of the venture provides the 
capital and the other the services. <i>Kovacik v. Reed</i> (1957) 49 Cal.2d 166, 169 states:</p>
<ul>
<li>Moreover, where a joint venture involves the contribution of capital by one party and services by the other, neither party is 
required to reimburse the other for losses sustained. In the event of a loss, the party contributing the capital loses the 
capital and the one contributing labor loses the value of his efforts. </li>
</ul>
<p>In the franchise context, a joint venture analysis is advised where the franchisor and franchisee have divided responsibilities and 
maintained categorical control over different aspects of the venture. Under California law, mutual control exists so long as 
members of the joint venture participate in the management and operation of the venture even if their respective activities are 
limited to different aspects of the business. (<i>Universal Sales Corp. v. California Press Manufacturing, supra, </i>20 Cal.2d at p. 
764.) In <i>Universal Sales, </i>the plaintiff contributed advertising and promotional efforts to create a market for a pellet press while 
the defendant contributed a manufacturing facility. The <i>Universal Sales</i> court found that a joint venture arose from this 
cooperation which was promotive of the common enterprise and combined the skill and efforts of both the plaintiff and the 
defendant. </p>
<p>In a franchise relationship, each of the parties has the right to control in some measure the conduct of the other. Our law wisely 
recognizes division of labor and will find a joint venture exists even '...where the parties have unequal control of operations.' (40 
Cal.Jur.3d, Joint Ventures, Sections 2-3, pp. 181-182, citing <i>Banks v. Puma</i> (1951) 37 Cal.2d 838.) </p>
<h4>PROVING FRANCHISE CONTROL</h4>
<p>Because a persuasive case can be made that a franchisor which seeks to maximize profits via numerous incentives is exercising 
control over its franchisees, discovery was designed by analyze the complete working relationship between the franchisor and its 
franchisees. </p>
<p>In the instant case, all franchisees had agreed to abide by the franchisor's operations manual which described in detail the 
franchise system's operational methods. The franchisor required the franchisee to pay fees mandated and unilaterally determined 
by the franchisor, to follow record keeping and reporting rules, and to submit for franchisor approval all public uses of its 
trademarks, service marks, designs, logos, colors, color patterns and business methods. The franchisee agreed not to challenge 
the validity of franchisor's ownership of these fundamental and necessary components of a real estate company's image. Under 
the franchise agreement, the franchisor could unilaterally cancel the franchise if the franchisee failed to comply with its operating 
manual and could use this right to control its franchisees. </p>
<p>The franchisor could mandate changes or modifications to the franchise's marketing system, and members agreed not only to 
accept those changes but to finance them. As a result the franchisor controlled the fund which drove the system from which both 
venturers earned revenues. Franchisees agreed to provide funding for a national advertising fund solely managed by the 
franchisor and to cooperate with other joint venturers in marketing plans governed by the by-laws of the franchise's regional 
council. The franchisor could unilaterally amend these by-laws and thus control marketing efforts and priorities. Franchisees were 
bound by franchisor rules regarding advertising and advertising policy and had to submit to the franchisor for approval its signs, 
logos, charts and other items relating to 'image.' The franchisee also needed franchisor approval to open a new office or to 
change the home office location, and the franchisor influenced and controlled by veto power the broker's selection of a name and 
to some degree the clothing worn by the agents. In this way the franchisor, the senior of the venturers, controlled the junior 
venturers' 'image.' </p>
<p>In addition to being controlled in the vital areas of marketing and image, the franchisee submitted to the control of the franchisor 
in other areas fundamental to the operation of a business. The franchisee agreed to transmit referrals exclusively through the 
franchisor's system. This mandated exclusivity effectively controlled a component of current revenue and a component of 
client-base expansion. The franchisee also agreed to comply with franchisor rules governing referral follow-up and reporting to 
the franchisor. Franchisees agreed to share listing inventories with the franchisor and to allow the franchisor to transmit listing data 
at its discretion. The franchisor thus exercised a measure of control over an important asset of the brokerage companies. </p>
<p>Franchisees had to conform to rules relating to, and forms used for, record keeping. These financial and operating records were 
subject to audit by the franchisor. In addition, the amount, type, term, underwriter and named insureds on franchisee insurance 
policies were controlled by the franchisor. Competition with other franchisees was restricted, and sales of materials or supplies 
by one franchisee to another franchisee was prohibited without franchisor consent. Franchisees also agreed to use 'best efforts' to 
promote and sell the insurance products underwritten by the franchisor in order to add to the revenue stream. The membership, 
itself an acquired and paid for asset, was restricted in transferability by franchisor mandate with respect to liability and related 
insurance coverage. </p>
<p>The franchisee had to share profits with the franchisor through fees based on annual gross sales volume and the mandated 
national advertising fund contributions which were indexed to sales volume. The franchisee also had to share profits with the 
franchisor through fees based on annual gross sales volume and the mandated national advertising fund contributions which were 
indexed to sales volume. The franchisee also had to pay a marketing fee on each real estate transaction from which the franchisee 
received compensation of more than a certain amount and another fee if they elected to expand by opening branch offices. 
Franchisees agreed to share losses (as well as benefits) with the franchisor under the terms of one of the franchise products and 
agreed to franchisor examination of 'loss ratios' incurred under home protection contracts. They further submitted to expulsion 
from participation in these plans should the franchisor so mandate. </p>
<p>When the franchisee offered the franchisor's products to a client, it was acting on behalf of the franchisor (as well as profiting the 
franchisor). These products were created, controlled and administered by the franchisor but were sold by the franchisee. The 
franchisee could not independently offer many of these products due to both the high cost and risk. </p>
<p>As a result of this detailed analysis of the franchise's operations, plaintiffs were successful in defeating the national franchisor's 
motion for summary judgment on its claim of 'lack of control' and subsequently obtained a major contribution towards settlement 
from the franchisor's carrier. In attempting to prove a joint venture against a franchisor, obtain a copy of the franchise's 
operations manual since this document will likely discuss the detailed control exerted by the franchisor that the franchise contract 
fails to mention. Copies of regional and headquarters' business plans are helpful to prove that 'incentives' are 'controls.' Depose 
local representatives of the franchisor, as well as headquarters management, since these local representatives work for the 
franchisor and directly monitor and control the franchises within their region. And look for economic as well as day to day 
operational controls: if a franchisor requires payment into certain funds and controls the use of those resources, it is exerting <i>de 
facto</i> control over its franchisees. </p>

<hr>


<p>Proposition 51 was adopted June 3, 1986, and is codified as Civil Code section 1431.2. It revised the old rule of joint and 
several liability as to general damages and imposed a new rule of partial responsibility depending on percentages of fault. The 
statute, like any poorly drafted initiative foisted on the public by a false and misleading insurance industry advertising campaign, 
has created several unanswered questions, not the least of which is &quot;who is a defendant for apportionment purposes?&quot; </p>
<p>Most defendants erroneously take the view and would argue that under Proposition 51 they are entitled to treat every 
&quot;defendant&quot; as a separate entity to diminish the percentage of each separate defendant's liability by the amount of any negligence 
proven against other defendants, even if such other defendants are the plaintiff's employer or are vicariously liable for the 
negligence of others under established public policy. </p>
<p>While the jury will be asked to determine the percentage of the total negligence to be attributed to all defendants, Proposition 51 
does not diminish the non-economic damages that may be collected against all defendants because they are vicariously liable or 
subject to imputed liability as a matter of law. </p>
<p>The new Civil Code section 1431.2 provides: </p>
<ul>
<li>(a) In any action for personal injury, property damage or wrongful death, based upon principles of comparative fault, the 
liability of each defendant for non-economic damages shall be several only and shall not be joint. Each defendant shall be 
liable only for the amount of non-economic damages allocated to that defendant in direct proportion to that defendant's 
percentage of fault, and a separate judgment shall be rendered against that defendant for that amount.</li>
</ul>
<p>The only case construing this new statute is <i>Evangelatos v. Superior Court</i> (1988) 44 Cal.3d 1188 [246 Cal.Rptr. 629], 
which held the statute was constitutional and would be applied prospectively only. </p>
<p>The intent of the statute was to allocate general or non-economic damages between defendants as can be seen from the adoption 
of Civil Code section 1431.1 which contains the finding and declaration of the People of the State of California: </p>
<ul>
<li>The People of the State of California find and declare as follows: <ul>
<li>(a) The legal doctrine of joint and several liability, also known as &quot;the deep pocket rule,&quot; has resulted in a system of 
inequity and injustice that has threatened financial bankruptcy of local governments, other public agencies, private 
individuals and businesses and has resulted in higher prices for goods and services to the public and in higher taxes 
to the taxpayers. <p>(b) Some governmental and private defendants are perceived to have substantial financial resources or insurance 
coverage and have thus been included in lawsuits even though there was little or no basis for finding them at fault. 
Under joint and several liability, if they are found to share even a fraction of the fault, they often are held financially 
liable for all the damage. The People--taxpayers and consumers alike--ultimately pay for these lawsuits in the form 
of higher taxes, higher prices and higher insurance premiums. </p>
<p>(c)Local governments have been forced to curtail some essential police, fire and other protections because of the 
soaring costs of lawsuits and insurance premiums. <i>Therefore, the People of the State of California declare that 
to remedy these inequities, defendants in tort actions shall be held financially liable in closer proportion to 
their degree of fault.</i> To treat them differently is unfair and inequitable. </p>
<p>The People of the State of California further declare that reforms in the liability laws in tort actions are necessary 
and proper to avoid catastrophic economic consequences for state and local governmental bodies as well as private 
individuals and businesses. </p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>[Emphasis added.] </p>
<p>The campaign for Proposition 51 by the League of Cities, the County Supervisors Association and financed by the insurance 
industry never mentioned the long-standing public policy of California to penalize an employer's workers' compensation lien or 
credit rights. Nor was it ever suggested that Proposition 51 was intended to modify in any way the long-standing principle that 
when negligent agents, employees, and partners cause injuries, their innocent principals are also liable. The statute makes 
absolutely no reference to cases in which defendants are found liable as a matter of public policy as a result of vicarious or 
imputed liability. </p>
<p>It is safe to say that Proposition 51 never contemplated anything other than allocating general damages between separate 
defendants whose liability arose in a setting in which multiple separate wrongful acts combined to cause injury. </p>
<p>Most helpfully, the appendix to <i>Evangelatos v. Superior Court, supra, </i>44 Cal.3d at pp. 1243-1246, sets forth the complete 
California Voters' Handbook prepared by the Secretary of State concerning Proposition 51. Proposition 51 was initiated and 
promoted by the League of Cities and other public entities. The hypothetical situation that Proposition 51 was designed to 
remedy was described in the Argument in Favor of Proposition: </p>
<p>Nothing is more unfair than forcing someone--be it a city, a county or the state, a school, a business firm or a person--to pay for 
damages that are someone else's fault. </p>
<p>That's what California's &quot;deep pocket&quot; law is doing--at a cost of tens of millions of dollars annually. And that's why we need 
Proposition 51--the Fair Responsibility Act. </p>
<p>Regardless of whether it is a city, county or private enterprise that is hit with huge &quot;deep pocket&quot; court awards or out-of-court 
settlements, the TAXPAYER AND CONSUMER ULTIMATELY PAY THE COSTS through high taxes, increased costs of 
goods and services, and reduced governmental services. </p>
<p>How does the &quot;deep pocket&quot; law work? Here's an illustration: </p>
<p>A drunk driver speeds through a red light, hits another car, injures a passenger. The drunk driver has no assets or insurance. </p>
<p>The injured passenger's trial lawyer sues the driver AND THE CITY because the city has a very &quot;deep pocket&quot;--the city 
treasury or insurance. He claims the stop light was faulty. </p>
<p>The jury finds the drunk driver 95% at fault, the city only 5%. It awards the injured passenger $500,000 in economic damage 
(medical costs, lost earnings, property damage) and $1,000,000 in non-economic damages (emotional distress, pain and 
suffering, etc.). </p>
<p>Because the driver can't pay anything, THE CITY PAYS IT ALL--$1,500,000. </p>
<p>THAT'S THE &quot;DEEP POCKET&quot; LAW AND IT'S UNFAIR! </p>
<p>Under Proposition 51, the city could still pay all the victim's economic damages, but only its 5% portion of the non-economic. 
Total: $550,000--that's $950,000 less! </p>
<p>Everyone agrees the injured passenger should be reimbursed. But there are TWO VICTIMS--THE ACCIDENT VICTIMS 
and the TAXPAYER who foots the bill. </p>
<p>Proposition 51 is a GOOD COMPROMISE--it takes care of both victims! </p>
<p>With the passage of Proposition 51: </p>
<ul>
<li>Liability insurance, now virtually impossible to obtain, would again be available to cities and counties. </li>
<li>Private sector liability insurance premiums could drop 10% to 15%. </li>
<li>The glut of lawsuits with dubious merit would be significantly reduced. </li>
</ul>
<p>Every California county--and virtually all its cities--are IN FAVOR OF PROPOSITION 51. </p>
<p>One of the largest coalitions of school, governmental, law enforcement, small and large business, professional, labor and 
non-profit organizations in history urges you to VOTE YES ON PROPOSITION 51. </p>
<p>This initiative proposition was put on the ballot by hundreds of thousands of voters because repeated attempts in the Legislature 
to reform the unfair &quot;deep pocket&quot; law were thwarted by the intense lobbying of the California Trial Lawyers Association. </p>
<p>The Voters' Handbook and the arguments concerning Proposition 51 fail to identify any suggestion that cases of imputed or 
derivative liability, in which the State of California holds as a matter of public policy that a defendant will be held vicariously liable 
for the wrongful act of another, will result in an exoneration of the vicariously liable defendant. </p>
<p>One helpful way to understand California law on this issue is to visualize derivative or imputed liability as running &quot;vertically&quot; from 
the wrongful acts of the tortfeasor upward to the vicariously liable defendant based on public policy considerations. The same 
simile applies in any case where one defendant is responsible for the acts of another as a matter of public policy. </p>
<p>This type of &quot;vertical&quot; or derivative liability is easily distinguishable from a case of &quot;horizontal&quot; liability in which multiple separate 
tortfeasors are simultaneously negligent and proximately cause an injury. An example of this type of &quot;horizontal&quot; liability occurs in 
the hypothetical presented by the Voters' Handbook, when an intoxicated person is confused by a defectively designed 
intersection and causes an injury. Under this latter hypothetical the negligence of two defendant combines at the same time to 
bring about an injury. In such a case, a jury would be asked to allocate, pursuant to Proposition 51, the combined negligence of 
both parties causing the injury: drunk driver and public entity responsible for the defectively designed intersection. </p>
<p>On the other hand, defendants in a case of &quot;vertical&quot; liability are not entitled to allocate fault under Proposition 51, because their 
liability is derivative and is imposed on all defendants vicariously, as a result of the wrongful act of a tortfeasor. </p>
<p>Proposition 51, as a clear reading of the Voters' Handbook shows, was intended to separate fault when multiple tortfeasors have 
caused simultaneous &quot;horizontal&quot; forces to proximately cause an injury. It is only in this case that Proposition 51's requirement of 
allocation of <i>actual</i> fault occurs. </p>
<p>Proposition 51 was not intended to alter vicarious legal liability for injuries that arise as a result of public policy and never 
intended to repeal the imputed liability of: </p>
<ol>
<li>providers of automobiles to permissive users; </li>
<li>employers of negligent employees; </li>
<li>principal of negligent agents; </li>
<li>joint venturers; </li>
<li>partners; </li>
<li>owners and general contractors under Restatement 416 in peculiar risk cases; </li>
<li>parents for their children's torts; </li>
<li>public franchisees for the torts of their contractors, e.g., public utilities, trucking firms, etc. </li>
</ol>
<p>In addition to the legislative history, the statute itself provides language that is clearly consistent with statutory intent. Civil Code 
section 1431.2 sets forth the cases in which Proposition 51 rules apply and states that it is to be applied &quot;[i]n any action for 
personal injury... based upon principles of comparative fault...&quot; It is for this reason that the mandate of Civil Code section 1431.2 
that, &quot;[e]ach defendant shall be liable only for the amount of non-economic damages allocated to that defendant in direct 
proportion to that defendant's percentage of fault...&quot; does not apply in cases where liability is imposed as a matter of public 
policy and imputed to others as a matter of law, since the comparative fault of a public policy defendant should never be in issue 
and therefore the action is not based upon &quot;principles of comparative fault.&quot; </p>
<p>To hold otherwise would be to rewrite by judicial fiat years of liability imposed by public policy under rules that are universally 
accepted and respected throughout the United States to the detriment of every citizen. As preposterous as that seems, that is the 
course defendants have argued by their bald claim that Proposition 51 exonerates them from liability, except as may be proven 
against them individually with regard to non-economic or general damages. </p>
<p>Defendants also routinely and erroneously claim that in third party cases the are entitled to treat plaintiff's employer as a 
&quot;defendant&quot; (which is not the case) and diminish the percentage of each defendant's liability by the amount of any negligence 
proven against other defendants. Proposition 51 never contemplated that non-economic damages could not be collected against 
all defendants, even where the plaintiff's employer was significantly negligent. </p>
<p>In the case where there is a defense of employer's negligence raised for the purpose of reducing the amount of the overall 
judgment for which the defendants would be held responsible under the doctrine of <i>Witt v. Jackson</i> (1961) 57 Cal.2d 57 [17 
Cal.Rptr. 369], the jury is asked to determine the percentage of negligence attributed to the employer. The essential thrust of the 
<i>Witt v. Jackson</i> defense of employer's negligence is to reduce the overall damages being paid by the defendants and for that 
reason it is a defense raised only by a defendant in response to a complaint in intervention filed by the compensation carrier or 
employer. </p>
<p>The Supreme court in <i>Associated Construction &amp; Engineering of California v. Workers' Compensation Appeals Board</i> 
(1978) 22 Cal.3d 829 [150 Cal.Rptr. 88] decided that the principles of comparative negligence should apply to the subrogation 
rights of a concurrently negligent employer under the workers' compensation system. The decision further holds that the 
concurrently negligent employer may recover compensation benefits paid or have credit for unpaid future benefits only to the 
extent that such compensation benefits (and future benefits) exceed the employer's proportionate share of responsibility for the 
employee's total damages. (See <i>Arbaugh v. Proctor &amp; Gamble Manufacturing Company</i> (1978) 80 Cal.App.3d 500 [145 
Cal.Rptr. 608].) </p>
<p>For example, where an employer or compensation carrier intervenes or has a lien for $25,000 and the jury finds the plaintiff free 
of comparative negligence, the employer 60% and two defendants 30% and 10% at fault, under California law with a verdict for 
plaintiff of $225,000 in economic damages and $200,000 in non-economic damages, the judgment would be for $200,000 in 
economic damages jointly and severally against the 40% defendants ($225,000, less compensation benefits of $25,000). The 
employer/compensation carrier would receive nothing because it caused 50% of the damage to plaintiff, which is in excess of its 
$25,000 lien. In addition, the compensation carrier would be obligated to provide benefits to plaintiff until a total of $255,000 in 
benefits was paid. Another way of stating this result is that the compensation carrier would have no credit rights until it first 
expended $255,000. </p>
<p>Defendants argue under this hypothetical, that if a jury found two defendants 30% and 10% responsible for the total fault, each 
would only be obligated to pay only their respective percentage of the general damages of $200,000, for a total of $80,000 
(40% of $200,000). </p>
<p>There are no cases decided since the passage of Proposition 51 to support such claims. In large part, this is because the statute 
on its face denies the strained construction they seek. </p>
<p>Plaintiff as a matter of law cannot sue his/her employer and for that reason the <i>employer can never be a defendant.</i> The statute 
clearly states that the liability of each defendant on non-economic damages shall be &quot;in direct proportion to that <i>defendant's 
percentage of fault.</i>&quot; The intent of the statute was to allocate <i>general damages between defendants</i> as can be seen from the 
adoption of Civil Code section 1431.1 which contains the findings and declaration of the People of the State of California that, </p>
<p>Local governments have been forced to curtail some essential police, fire and other protections because of the soaring costs of 
lawsuits and insurance premiums. Therefore, the People of the State of California declare that to remedy these inequities, 
<i>defendants in tort actions </i>shall be held financially liable in closer proportion to their degree of fault. To treat them differently is 
unfair and inequitable. </p>
<p>Since an employer can never be named as a defendant, or even as a party except to assert lien rights, as a matter of law an 
employer is never a defendant as intended by the statute. </p>
<p>Under the hypothetical verdict described above, with each of two defendants found 30% and 10% responsible, their 
proportional fault, relative to each other is 75% and 25%. Therefore, these defendants would be responsible for payment of the 
general damages in the same proportion. Plaintiff could collect $200,000 in general damages as follows: $150,000 from the 30% 
defendant and $50,000 from the 10% defendant. </p>
<p>The key to understanding this allocation is that as a matter of law the defendants are fully liable for all the general damages. The 
plaintiff's employer can never be sued for general damages and the compensation lien because it is free of any payment for pain 
and suffering is properly deducted from the economic or special damages portion of the verdict. The only reason for finding a 
percentage of negligence against the employer, under long-standing public policy, is for the purpose of determining lien and credit 
rights and not for allocating general damages. For these reasons, the payment of non-economic/general damages is the 
responsibility of the liable defendants and the only fair method for allocating their proportional obligation is to compare their 
percentages of fault. </p>
<p>In a case recently tried in Santa Clara County, the trial court agreed with the public policy analysis presented here and held that a 
finding of 60% employer's negligence did not diminish the plaintiff's right to collect all general damages of $200,000 from two 
defendants found collectively to be 30% and 10% liable. A copy of the Judgment on Special Verdict in <i>Mills v. Community 
Development, James F. Boccardo, and MMM Carpets, </i>Santa Clara County No. 643493, dated May 24, 1990, tried by 
Richard Alexander, is available upon request by writing the author at P.O. Box 1330, San Jose, CA 95109-1330. </p>

<p><font size=5>E</font>ach year, millions of consumers experience problems with a product or service. There are several strategies for resolving those 
complaints. First contact the seller. If that does not work, contact a consumer complaint agency. If that does not bring 
satisfaction, consider other options, such as arbitration or filing a lawsuit. This article begins with the assumption that you do not 
yet need a lawyer to help you. If you are sure you need a lawyer open &quot;<a href="howhire.shtml">How to Hire the Right Lawyer</a>&quot; and &quot;<a href="legalfee.shtml">Understanding the 
Legal Fee Agreement</a>.&quot; There are many lawyers with many different levels of expertise and experience, who practice in widely 
different arenas. You will want someone with specific experience in prosecuting a specific case for you. These two related 
articles explain how an experienced lawyer goes about finding the &quot;right lawyer&quot; for a particular case and what you can and 
should expect in negotiating a contract for legal services. </p>
<h4>CONTACT THE SELLER </h4>
<p>Whether your problem is a defective hair dryer or a leak in your newly installed roof, the first step in resolving your problem is to 
contact the merchant who sold you the product or service. Most consumer complaints are settled at this level.</p>
<p>But first be prepared.</p>
<p>Always make a record and document what went wrong with a letter, by taking photos or by having your neighbor confirm that 
the ceiling under the new roof was leaking after the rain. Save boxes, brochures, and other written materials that were provided 
by the seller or contractor.</p>
<p>For a detailed list of considerations in cases of defective products, open the article on The Consumer Law Page entitled 
<a href="product.shtml">Preparing the Defective Product Case</a>.</p>
<p>Gather together all relevant documents, such as receipts, cancelled checks, photographs, credit card bills, warranties, contracts, 
brochures, package inserts or bills of sale. Think about what you would accept as a reasonable resolution of your complaint. Do 
you want your money back, or would a store credit suffice? Would you accept a replacement item? Can the product be 
repaired? Think through your goal.</p>
<p>In approaching the seller, call first, indicate that you have a complaint, and ask to make an appointment with the appropriate 
person, typically the store manager or customer service representative. At that meeting, explain as briefly and accurately as 
possible both the nature of the problem and what you want the merchant to do. Be firm, but polite, avoiding displays of temper. 
(If it's not possible or practical to meet with the business, you can try calling or writing.)</p>
<p>If this proves unsuccessful, take your complaint to the person on the next rung up the chain of command. This may be the 
supervisor or manager, the store owner if the store is locally owned, the corporate consumer complaint department, or even the 
president or CEO of the company. You may also decide at this point to pursue your complaint through the manufacturer, rather 
than through the merchant, particularly if your problem is covered by a warranty.</p>
<p>At this stage, you should put your complaint in writing. Your one- to two-page letter should be polite, well organized, and either 
typed or written legibly in ink. It should include:</p>
<ul>
<li>your name, address, home and work phone numbers (and when you can generally be reached at those numbers), and 
your account number, if appropriate; </li>
<li>a brief statement of the important facts concerning your purchase, including when and where you made the purchase, and 
specific information about the item in question, including make and model and serial number, if applicable; </li>
<li>if your compliant involves a service, a description of the service and the name of the person who performed it; </li>
<li>a brief statement describing your problem with that product or service; </li>
<li>a description of what you have already done to try to resolve your complaint and the response you received; and </li>
<li>what you want the merchant to do and a reasonable time period for a response.</li>
</ul>
<p>You should include copies, not originals, of all documents related to your complaint, and you should keep a copy of your letter 
for your files. Also, be sure to keep copies of any correspondence you receive from the company, and keep dated notes on any 
telephone conversations you may have regarding the complaint. This documentation could determine your success or failure if 
you need to take your complaint further.</p>
<h4>CONTACT A COMPLAINT AGENCY</h4>
<p>In most cases, contacting the seller or manufacturer will produce a satisfactory resolution to your complaint. When the merchant 
and manufacturer are not cooperative, however, you can seek assistance from a government or non-profit complaint agency. 
Your phone director or local library often lists these organizations. It is best to contact them individually, instead of copying one 
letter to many agencies.</p>
<h4>State, County, and City Consumer Protection Offices</h4>
<p>In most states, there are agencies that can assist in resolving consumer complaints. These agencies may be in independent state, 
county or city offices, the governor's office, the county District Attorney's or City Attorney's office, or the Attorney General's 
office. It is important to notify these governmental consumer protection offices of any complaints. Consumer complaints that 
report abusive practices or indicate an on-going pattern of fraud are often the basis of investigations and changes in the law.</p>
<p>Contact the agency first by phone, since most will want to mail you a complaint form to use in filing your complaint. You will also 
need to provide copies, not originals, of relevant documents, and you will need to describe what you have already done to 
resolve your complaint. If your complaint involves a business in another state, you may be referred to a consumer office in that 
state.</p>
<h4>Better Business Bureaus</h4>
<p>Better Business Bureaus (BBBs) are non-profit organizations, sponsored by local businesses, that promote good relations 
between buyers and sellers. While BBBs have no authority to force even their members to resolve complaints, most will at least 
contact the merchant, and some offer more formal binding arbitration.</p>
<p>Most BBBs prefer that you call first, so that they can determine whether your complaint is within their jurisdiction and, if so, mail 
you a complaint form. Once it has received your completed form, the BBB generally will contact the company for its response 
and try to negotiate a solution. If this effort does not resolve your problem, some BBBs will also offer arbitration, in which both 
you and the merchant agree to let a neutral third party decide on a fair resolution.</p>
<p>For more information about BBS, open the <a href="resource.shtml">Resources Section of The Consumer Law Page</a>. </p>
<h4>Consumer Action Hotlines</h4>
<p>In some communities a television news program, radio talk show host, or newspaper columnist will offer a hotline to help resolve 
consumer complaints. These services use the leverage of media exposure to encourage stubborn businesses to respond.</p>
<h4>Other Non-Profit Organizations</h4>
<p>A variety of other non-profit organizations try to resolve consumer problems. They include legal clinics associated with law 
schools and grassroots community organizations.</p>
<h4>Federal Agencies</h4>
<p>Most federal agencies do not handle individual consumer complaints. But it is important for you to bring complaints to their 
attention so that they can take any appropriate legal or regulatory actions to prevent future problems. Do not hesitate to report 
defective products to the Consumer Product Safety Commission. Report defective automobiles to the Department of 
Transportation's National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. For more information about these agencies open the Resources 
Section of The Consumer Law Page.</p>
<h4>Industry Trade Associations </h4>
<p>Some industry trade associations offer assistance in resolving complaints pertaining to their members. The assistance offered 
usually resembles the information mediation provided by BBBs. Some of the better established services of this type include the 
Major Appliance Consumer Action Panel (1-800-621-0477) and the Direct Marketing Association Mail Order Action Line 
(written complaints only to Mail Order Action Line, 6 East 43rd Street, New York, NY 10017).</p>
<p>Certain products and services are under the separate jurisdiction of specific state agencies.</p>
<h4>Banking</h4>
<p>Every state has a banking division which regulates state banks. Many will help consumers resolve complaints involving 
state-chartered banks.</p>
<h4>Insurance</h4>
<p>Consumers with complaints involving insurance companies or agents can get assistance from the state insurance division.</p>
<h4>Investments</h4>
<p>Every state has a securities division to regulate securities investments. If you have a complaint about a broker, investment adviser, 
financial planner, or a specific investment product, call your securities division for assistance.</p>
<h4>Electric, Gas, or Telephone Company</h4>
<p>In each state, the Public Utility Commission or Public Service Commission assists consumers with complaints involving public 
utilities. In some states, these utility commissions also regulate and handle consumer complaints against in-state moving, trucking, 
charter buses, and airport shuttle vehicles. In addition, some states have Consumer Utility Boards that will help consumers 
resolve their utility complaints.</p>
<h4>Licensed Trades</h4>
<p>Many states license certain trades, particularly building trades, such as general contractors, carpenters, plumbers, and 
electricians. In some states, the departments which license these trades will assist consumers to resolve their complaints about 
licenses.</p>
<h4>New Car</h4>
<p>Every state but South Dakota and Arkansas has a &quot;lemon law&quot; establishing procedures to resolve complaints involving chronic 
car problems. These state laws specify the number of days and repair attempts needed to qualify. Contact your state consumer 
protection agency for information on the state's lemon law. Some states also have lemon laws covering used cars.</p>
<h4>Mail Order</h4>
<p>Postal inspectors assist consumers in resolving mail order problems as well as with fraud cases in which the mails are used in any 
way to advance the fraud. Contact the postal inspector (not the Post Master), whom you will find listed under the Postal Service 
in the U.S. Government listings or in the white pages of the phone book.</p>
<h4>FILE A LAWSUIT</h4>
<p>If all else fails, consider pursuing your complaint in court, either through small claims court or, if the amount of money involved is 
large, through a civil lawsuit.</p>
<h4>Small Claims Court</h4>
<p>Located in nearly every county and city, small claims courts provide a relatively fast, efficient, and inexpensive way to resolve 
consumer problems. Most accept claims up to several thousand dollars and allow consumers to present their own case without 
the assistance of an attorney. In fact, in some states lawyers are not permitted in small claims court. Many of these courts and 
some consumer agencies make available written material about the small claims process and how to prepare for it.</p>
<p>When your case is called, you will have a chance to explain your problem to a judge in the presence of the subjects of your 
complaint. After hearing both sides of the case, and reviewing any written evidence provided, the judge will make a decision. Be 
aware that collecting small claims court awards may be difficult and include additional costs. Consult the court or your consumer 
agency about how best to ensure payment.</p>
<h4>Finding the &quot;Right&quot; Lawyer for a Civil Suit</h4>
<p>If your claim exceeds the small claims court limit, consider pursuing it through a civil suit. For such a suit, you will need a lawyer.</p>
<p>To find a lawyer, you can ask friends or any professionals you know for recommendations. If you have a low income, you may 
be able to get help from the legal aid or legal services office. Also, check to see if your employment benefits include a group legal 
services plan.</p>
<p>Finding the &quot;right&quot; lawyer for your case will be a significant challenge and it will take time. Your goal is to find someone who has 
experience representing consumers in cases involving commercial fraud or defective products. A lawyer experienced in consumer 
litigation will have immediate answers to your questions, will not postpone providing advice, will not promise to &quot;think about it,&quot; 
and will not have to conduct any research before making recommendations. In short, the lawyer you want will be an expert.</p>
<p>First, plan to devote 16 to 24 hours finding the right lawyer. This is a difficult task. Stay with it. Avoid most county bar referral 
programs which may or may not be manned by the &quot;right&quot; person. Despite advertising, most lawyers live behind letterheads that 
tell consumers absolutely nothing about what they do and their areas of speciality.</p>
<p>The World Wide Web is becoming an excellent sources of information for consumers who need lawyers with special skills. 
Check the law lists on the World Wide Web. These lists are growing daily. You need URL capability through Mosaic or 
Netscape both of which are freely available. One of the best is <a href="http://seamless.com">The Seamless Web</a>. Also see, <a href="http://www.yahoo.com">Yahoo</a>, <a href="http://galaxy.einet.net/galaxy/Law.html">Einet</a>, <a href="http://www.dorsai.org/p-law/">P-Law</a> and <a href="http://www.westpub.com/WLDInfo/WLD.htm">West's 
Law Directory</a>.</p>
<p>Check out the home page of <a href="http://seamless.com/alexanderlaw/">The Alexander Law Firm</a>. </p>
<p>Look for a lawyer with the same dedication, commitment, experience and record of success in the types of case that you have 
that is shown there. Dedicated lawyers who are fiercely proud of their record of success can be found across the country, but 
you have to search them out. Take the time to find the &quot;right&quot; lawyer and you will not regret the effort that it takes.</p>
<p>In addition, America Online's Court TV provides a database of lawyers and if your local newspaper is online, a search of that 
database can provide information about lawyers with special background and experience. For a detalied description of how to 
conduct your search read <a href="howhire.shtml">How to Find the &quot;Right&quot; Lawyer: Consumer Rights in the Legal Marketplace</a> here on The Consumer 
Law Page.</p>
<p>Be creative. Start with a trip to the local county law library. Find out if the state bar organization in your state has a section or 
group of attorneys who deal with your issue. Local and state bar association have groups or sections of lawyers interested in 
special areas of the law. Once you identify a section that meets your needs, call the section chair directly and ask for referrals. 
Most states require lawyers to attend Continuing Legal Education courses. Lawyers in charge of these programs are excellent 
sources of referrals. Open Martindale-Hubbell at the county law library to find specialists. This is a national rating guide and 
many lawyers provide detailed information about their practices, articles, and teaching experience.</p>
<p>Local bar presidents and the presiding judges of your general trial court are also good sources to identify a group of practitioners 
with a speciality in your problem.</p>
<p>Skilled trial lawyers are listed by the American Trial Lawyers Association in its membership list. The section on sustaining 
members contains prominent trial lawyers who can also be a good source for referrals to specialists. Skilled lawyers know the 
&quot;right&quot; lawyers in their community with special skills. Call your State or local Trial Lawyers organization or Consumer Attorneys 
Association for referrals.</p>
<p>The National Board of Trial Advocates in Boston [617.720.2032] can refer you to a certified civil trial advocate in your location 
and the National Association of Consumer Advocates [617.723.1239] is another good referral source.</p>
<p>Once you start developing a list, call and ask for an appointment concerning a &quot;new matter.&quot; Expect to be screen by a member of 
the attorneys staff. This is common. It is extremely helpful to prepare a one page typed summary of the relevant information 
concerning your case. Offer to fax it to the paralegal assistant screening your call and at the same time ask to be mailed a copy of 
the law firm's brochure describing its services and the lawyer's professional resume.</p>
<h4>Important Information to Provide Prospective Lawyers </h4>
<p>Provide prospective lawyers with copies of your complaint letters. If you have not done that type up a brief report of the events 
involving your case, make it one or two pages long, so that when you meet with the lawyer there is something for him/her to 
review. Your one page summary should provide the following information.</p>
<ul>
<li>Your First Name </li>
<li>Your Last Name </li>
<li>Number Street </li>
<li>Apt. </li>
<li>City, State Zipcode </li>
<li>e.mail </li>
<li>day phone </li>
<li>night phone </li>
<li>fax </li>
</ul>
<p>Many times lawyers are contacted by someone other than the person in need of help, such as a parent on behalf of a child, or 
wife on behalf of a husband. Provide the following information on behalf of person who needs assistance.</p>
<ul>
<li>The following information is for [describe relationship] </li>
<li>First Name </li>
<li>Last Name </li>
<li>Age </li>
<li>Occupation </li>
<li>For how long? </li>
<li>Current or last employer </li>
<li>City and state where last employed </li>
<li>Highest grade completed </li>
<li>Schools/College attended </li>
<li>Degrees </li>
<li>Year degree granted </li>
<li>Special training or experience in: </li>
</ul>
<p>Describe in 25 words or less why you need a lawyer. The following are examples from actual cases.</p>
<p>Consumer fraud examples ABC Company is defrauding consumers who buy its lightbulbs; my contact lens company sells three 
different lenses which can be worn for different periods at different prices, but they are all the same product.</p>
<p>Small business examples: I have a franchise with XYZ Corporation and other franchisees are getting preferential treatment; RST 
Company took a down payment for a franchise and never returned my money.</p>
<p>Toxic chemical examples: I worked with strong chemicals for years and was just diagnosed with leukemia; the EPA just told us 
that our home is built on a toxic waste disposal site.</p>
<p>Defective product examples: My minivan has been recalled three times and still overheats;</p>
<p>The important point is to provide a brief overview of the type of problem you need resolved.</p>
<p>State the date you were injured or when you first learned that you had been damaged?</p>
<p>How did you learn you were injured? Many times actual knowledge of injury does not occur until well after a wrongful act 
occurs.</p>
<p>Describe the damage or injury that you have suffered.</p>
<p>Where did it happen?</p>
<p>Who caused the harm?</p>
<p>Full address of wrongdoer</p>
<p>What additional information do you believe the lawyer should have to help you?</p>
<p>What is your goal? Explain here what you hope to achieve by working with a lawyer on this issue.</p>
<p>State if you are interested in serving as a representative in a class action.</p>
<h4>Contingency Fee Contracts</h4>
<p>Search for a lawyer who will take your case on a &quot;contingent fee&quot; basis, where the lawyer is paid a percentage of your recovery 
if you win and no fee if you lose. Also, consumer laws in some states allow for recovery of &quot;reasonable attorney's fees.&quot;</p>
<p>If you have a claim that makes economic sense and one that will provide a lump sum recovery, hire a lawyer who will work on a 
contingency and who will advance costs without recourse. In many states a lawyer can only promise to advance the costs of 
prosecuting a suit. In California, an attorney can lawfully agree that in the event there is no recovery,the client owes nothing for 
fees or costs, but that is not true under the Rules of Professional Conduct in most states.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that lawyers, like other professionals, have office overhead that must be paid for staff salaries and all the other 
usual costs of running a business. The percentages charged by most lawyers are not set by law and are subject to negotiation. 
There has been much public discussion about attorneys fees instigated by the insurance industry and major manufacturers who 
are working to deny consumers the right to hire lawyers under a contingency fee or percentage contract. That fact alone should 
confirm what a valuable right Americans have under this type of fee arrangement. Nearly no one else in the U.S. agrees to 
provide services and pay for the cost of a project only if they are successful and the client controls whether or not to give 
approval to the final result. This is a distinguishing aspect of American law and its support of consumers and individuals.</p>
<p>Historically, under a net fee contract case costs would be repaid to the lawyer off the top, and then the net recovery would be be 
shared 33/66 or 40/60. Because of recent court decisions, many lawyers now are offering a fixed percentage to cover both fees 
and costs, usually 33% to settle before filing suit and 40% after filing. These agreements provide the client with a guaranteed 
percentage in those cases where the expense of preparing a case are high and encourage lawyers to spend efficiently. 
Contingency contracts where the attorney requires a 45% fee off the top and requires the client to reimburse costs out of the 
client's portion of the recovery are an indication that the case may have more negatives than positives.</p>
<p>Whatever you do, always have a written fee agreement and do not sign it unless it is in clear English that you can understand.</p>
<p>This is all the more important when you are hiring a lawyer on an hourly or fixed fee basis. Reputable lawyers prepare an 
agreement that spells out what he/she is to do and what your obligations are as well. Do not sign it unless you understand it and it 
contains terms that you consider fair.</p>
<p>In evaluating lawyers, only hire a lawyer who agrees to &quot;work&quot; with you. Do not expect the lawyer to initiate contacts with you. 
Playing telephone tag is for amateurs. Real lawyers are extremely busy and they do not sit by the telephone to take calls. The 
type of lawyer you will want will be spending time in court, in depositions, meetings with other lawyers and clients, traveling a 
good deal, and responding to motions set by my opponents. To keep open communication with your lawyer, set meetings in the 
office or by telephone with the attorney's assistant. Understand that most active lawyers do not control their calendar and your 
conference may be continued from time to time. Be flexible and ready to reschedule. The key is to regularly meet, make sure 
your case has not fallen through the cracks, that you are confident all the work is getting done, and that you understand what is 
developing.</p>
<p>Lastly, if you cannot locate an attorney to take your case on a contingency basis, you might try paying an attorney for one hour 
for a consultation to discuss the potential merits of your case. If your case really has no merit (and many of do not), you are 
better off not dwelling on the subject because the focus of your frustration will shift from the wrongdoer to the attorney who told 
you you did not have a case.</p>
<h4>Free Consultations are Available </h4>
<p>Many lawyers offer initial consultations, typically for half an hour, either for free or for a small fee. Such a consultation does not 
commit you to using the lawyer or taking your case to court. During that consultation, you should ask the lawyer about his or her 
experience bringing similar cases. You should present the facts of your case, and ask for an estimate of your chances of success. 
You will also need to find out how the lawyer charges and what the expected cost for your case would be.</p>
<h4><a name="class">Class Actions are Powerful Tools to Correct Misconduct</a></h4>
<p>Be sure to ask whether your case qualifies as a class action, a powerful legal tool which can be used by one person to remedy 
wrongs committed against many consumers. Class actions provide individuals having claims that are inefficient to prosecute 
separately to be joined together providing there are common issues shared with others and the person filing the action as a class 
representative is willing to represent the interests of all persons similarly situated.</p>
<p>If you agree to serve as a class representative you will be representing the interests of all members of your class in litigation to 
recover money damages for the class. In short, you will be representing the rights of everyone who has been similarly injured 
because you have claims which are typical of those of the class, and thus involve common issues of law or fact. You are required 
by law to consider the interests of the class just as you would consider your own interests and you will participate actively in the 
lawsuit, such as by testifying at deposition and trial, and answering written interrogatories, and by keeping generally aware of the 
status and progress of the lawsuit.</p>
<p>A class action gives you effective power to force a defendant to deal with everyone fairly. Any resolution of the class claims is 
subject to court approval and must be designed in the best interests of the class as a whole. Your main obligation is to provide 
your lawyers and the court with all relevant facts of which you are aware.</p>
<p>As a class representative you volunteer to represent many other people with similar claims and damages, because you believe 
that it is important that everyone benefits from this lawsuit equally, that a class lawsuit will save time, money, and effort, and thus 
will benefit all parties, and the court, and that the class action is an important tool to assure compliance with the law and honest 
practices.</p>

<h2>Understanding The AmericansWith Disabilities Act</h2>
<hr>
<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>On July 26, 1990, President George Bush signed into law &quot;The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990&quot; (ADA). This law gives 
civil rights protection to individuals with disabilities, similar to that provided to individuals on the basis of race, sex, national origin 
and religion. The ADA guarantees equal opportunity for individuals with disabilities in the areas of employment, state and local 
government services, public transportation, privately operated transportation available to the public, places of public 
accommodation and telephone services offered to the general public. Many regard the ADA as the most sweeping piece of civil 
rights legislation since the Civil Rights Act of 1964; others believe that because of the widespread physical barriers the ADA will 
cause to be removed, it is the most far-reaching civil rights law ever enacted.</p>
<p>To understand the basis for the enactment of the ADA in 1990, one must look at certain historical events of the 1970s and the 
1980s in the disability rights struggle. First and foremost has been the ability and desire of diverse disabled individuals at all levels 
to work together, formally and informally, towards the common goals of full participation in American society for all people with 
disabilities. This strong desire for full participation--and the righteousness of this high ideal--is undeniable, and is the very fabric of 
the freedom and opportunity available to all citizens of the United States.</p>
<p>This desire for full participation in American society led to the passage of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Education For 
All Handicapped Children Act of 1974 (renamed the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act). The former law, among other 
initiatives, prohibited discrimination on the basis of disability in local programs and activities benefitting from federal financial 
assistance; its enforcement has resulted in improved program accessibility for disabled persons to health care, social services, 
recreation, housing, transportation, etc. Perhaps most importantly, the 1973 Rehabilitation Act began to open educational 
opportunities to disabled persons at all levels. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act went further, requiring the 
mainstreaming of disabled students into regular classrooms if appropriate, and the establishment of individualized educational 
programs for students with disabilities.</p>
<p>Despite these important full participation initiatives in the 1970s, an important poll of people with disabilities conducted in 1985 
by the highly regarded Louis Harris Company proved that the common thread of disability in America is unemployment. The 
Harris Poll established that two-thirds (67%) of all Americans with disabilities between the ages of 16 and 24 are unemployed. 
Further, only one in four (25%) are employed full-time. In many ways, the Harris Poll results confirmed what many Americans 
already knew from the 1980 census: non-disabled men participated in the labor force at a rate of 88%, while only 42% of 
disabled men were in the labor force; non-disabled women participated in the labor force at a rate of 64%, while only 24% of 
disabled women were in the labor force. Several other studies conducted during the 1980s indicate a steady growth from year to 
year in the numbers of disabled persons ready for employment and entering the labor force.</p>
<p>The basis for the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990 is that during the past two decades, educational and vocational training 
opportunities for individuals with disabilities have greatly improved, while employment opportunities in the private sector and 
access to places of public accommodation including public and privately-operated transportation services, have not improved. 
Enforcement of the ADA in the years ahead should enable disabled individuals to realize the heretofore elusive goal of full 
participation in American society.</p>
<h4>Key Employment Provisions</h4>
<p>Beginning July 26, 1992, employers with 25 or more employees are prohibited from discriminating against qualified individuals 
with a disability in all of the following areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>job application procedures; </li>
<li>hiring, advancement or discharge of employees; </li>
<li>employee compensation; </li>
<li>job training; </li>
<li>other terms, conditions and privileges of employment. </li>
</ul>
<p>Beginning July 26, 1994, the prohibition of discrimination in employment against qualified individuals with disabilities is expanded 
to cover employers with 15 or more employees.</p>
<p>In addition to employers, the prohibition of discrimination in employment covers employment agencies, labor organizations and 
joint labor-management committees. Types or forms of prohibited discrimination in employment include:</p>
<ul>
<li>segregating or classifying an applicant or employee in a way that adversely affects employment opportunities because of 
the individual's disability;<br>
</li>
<li>participating in a contractual arrangement that has the effect of discrimination against the applicant or employee;<br>
</li>
<li>using methods of administration that have the effect of discrimination, or which perpetuate the discrimination of others;<br>
</li>
<li>discrimination based on a qualified individual's relationship or association with another individual with a known disability;<br>
</li>
<li>using tests or other selection criteria which tend to screen out an individual or a class of individuals with disabilities;<br>
</li>
<li>failure to select and administer tests which accurately reflect the skills and aptitude of an applicant;<br>
</li>
<li>denying employment solely on the basis of the need to make &quot;reasonable accommodation&quot; to the disability of a qualified 
applicant;<br>
</li>
<li>not making &quot;reasonable accommodation&quot; to the disability of the qualified employee, unless such accommodation would 
impose an &quot;undue hardship&quot; on the employer.<br>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Making &quot;reasonable accommodation&quot; to the disability of a qualified applicant or employee is generally regarded as a key to the 
successful employment of persons with severe disabling conditions. The ADA defines &quot;reasonable accommodation&quot; as efforts 
which may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>making existing facilities used by employees accessible to disabled individuals; </li>
<li>job restructuring; </li>
<li>part-time or modified work hours; </li>
<li>reassignment to a vacant position; </li>
<li>acquisition or modification of equipment or devices; </li>
<li>appropriate adjustment or modifications of examinations, training materials or policies; </li>
<li>the provision of qualified readers or interpreters; </li>
<li>other similar accommodations for individuals with disabilities. </li>
</ul>
<p>&quot;Undue hardship&quot; means an action requiring significant difficulty or expense, and the ADA includes a number of factors for 
consideration in determining if a &quot;reasonable accommodation&quot; actually constitutes an &quot;undue hardship&quot; on the employer, such as 
the nature and cost of the accommodation, the financial resources of the employer, the impact of such accommodations on the 
financial resources of the employer, or other factors.</p>
<p>The practice of providing &quot;reasonable accommodation&quot; to the disability of a qualified applicant or employe is not new in the 
ADA. Since the 1970s, &quot;reasonable accommodation&quot; has been required in regulations of the Equal Employment Opportunity 
Commission, the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, and the Department of Justice to implement rules for 
non-discrimination in employment from sections 501, 503 and 504, respectively, of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.</p>
<p>Data from several studies conducted by federal government agencies indicate, first, that only 22% of employees with disabilities 
need &quot;accommodations&quot; at the worksite at all. A second study detailed the average costs of &quot;accommodations&quot; as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>No cost to employee 31% </li>
<li>Between $1 and $50 19% </li>
<li>Between $50 and $500 19% </li>
<li>Between $500 and $1000 19% </li>
<li>Between $1000 and $5000 11% </li>
<li>More than $5000 1% </li>
</ul>
<p>Less than one quarter of employees with disabilities need &quot;accommodations,&quot; and nearly 70% of such &quot;accommodations&quot; cost 
less than $500 per disabled employee. Additionally, if the &quot;accommodation&quot; involves removing barriers to a disabled employee 
or applicant at an existing place of business, the employer may be eligible for a tax credit of up to $5,000 per taxable year for 
such barrier removal (see pages 11-12 for more details).</p>
<p>Another form of discrimination in employment which the ADA prohibits is pre-employment medical inquiries. Pre-employment 
medical examinations and disability inquiries are prohibited. However, an employer may require a medical examination after an 
offer of employment has been made if all entering employees are subject to such examination regardless of disability; and 
employers may require employees to undergo medical exams or make inquiries as to the disability of employees if such 
examination or inquiry is shown to be job-related. Voluntary medical examinations and medical histories, conducted as part of an 
employee health program, are acceptable under the ADA.</p>
<p>The ADA specifically states that a qualified individual with a disability shall not include any employee or applicant who is 
currently engaging in the illegal use of drugs. Protection is provided, however, to those who have successfully completed a drug 
rehabilitation program, or who are currently enrolled in such programs. Employers may utilize drug testing to ensure that 
individuals who have completed or are enrolled in rehabilitation programs remain drug free. The ADA provides additional 
authority to employers to prohibit the use of drugs and alcohol at the workplace, to hold employees abusing drugs or alcohol to 
the same job performance criteria as other employees, and to require employees to comply with other federal regulations for 
certain industries concerning drug and alcohol abuse.</p>
<p>The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has issued regulations implementing the act's employment provisions. Finally, 
the ADA requires coordination among federal agencies involved in implementing employment discrimination statutes, to avoid 
duplication of efforts and to encourage consistent standards in their enforcement.</p>
<h4>Major Provisions Concerning Public Services<br>
Including Public Transportation</h4>
<p>Taken together, Title II of the ADA, which prohibits discrimination in public services including public transportation, and Title III, 
which prohibits discrimination in public accommodations operated by private entities, provide protection from discrimination to 
individuals with disabilities in the same full range of facilities available to the public at large. With few exceptions, enforcement of 
the ADA will make almost every community facility and service now available to the able-bodied public equally available to 
individuals with disabilities.</p>
<p>Concerning public services, which include state or local governments, any instrumentality of such government, and Amtrak, such 
public service providers are prohibited from discriminating against individuals with disabilities. The effective date of this section is 
January 26, 1992. The Department of Justice has issued regulations to implement the public service provisions regarding 
prohibition of discrimination, and these rules adopt the minimum design standards required in the ADA and developed by the 
federal Access Board. While many public entities have improved accessibility to individuals with disabilities in recent years 
because they are federal fund recipients and required to to so by Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, this important section of 
the ADA broadens the coverage of public services to include any state or local government, or instrumentality thereof, whether 
or not they receive federal financial assistance.</p>
<h4>Public Transportation</h4>
<p>Effective August 26, 1990, any public entity which operates a fixed route system must purchase buses which are accessible to 
individuals with disabilities, including wheelchair users. This requirement also applies to the purchase or lease of used vehicles. 
They, too, must be accessible to individuals with disabilities. It is also a discriminatory practice to remanufacture existing fixed 
route vehicles without accessibility, if the remanufactured vehicle has its usable life extended for five years or more. This provision 
also became effective on August 26, 1990. The ADA does provide an exception from fixed route vehicle accessibility for 
vehicles of an historic character.</p>
<p>Requirements for public transportation entities go beyond the purchase of accessible fixed route vehicles. It shall also be a 
discriminatory practice of public entities which operate fixed route services to fail to provide complimentary paratransit or other 
special transportation services in their geographic area. The requirement for paratransit service in the ADA also called for the 
development of a plan for this paratransit system, including implementation, by each public entity providing public transportation 
by July 26, 1993. The development of the plan also had public participation, including public hearings, involving groups and 
individuals with disabilities.</p>
<p>All new facilities constructed by a public entity providing public transportation must be built in an accessible fashion. Alterations 
to existing facilities operated by the public entity must also be rendered accessible. For rapid rail and light rail systems, &quot;key&quot; 
stations must be made accessible by July 26, 1993 or within 30 years of the effective date of the ADA if the alterations involve 
extraordinarily expensive structural changes. If, under these circumstances, a 30-year compliance period is allowed by the 
Secretary of Transportation, two-thirds of the &quot;key&quot; stations must be accessible within 20 years. &quot;Key&quot; stations in rapid and light 
rail systems are those defined by criteria established through regulation by the Secretary of Transportation. By July 26, 1995, for 
light rail and rapid rail systems, at least one car per train must be accessible to individuals with disabilities, including wheelchair 
users. Trains of an historic character may be exempted from this provision. This same &quot;one car per train&quot; rule applies to trains 
operated by public entities providing commuter rail service and Amtrak, with the same effective date of July 26, 1995.</p>
<p>All new rail passenger car purchases by Amtrak must be accessible to individuals with disabilities including, for single-level 
passenger coaches, the ability to park and remain in one's wheelchair and the ability to use wheelchair-accessible public 
restrooms on the train. Single-level dining cars and bi-level dining cars are exempted from this requirement. Within five years, on 
each Amtrak passenger train, there must be an area to park, secure and remain in a wheelchair as well as an area to store and 
fold a wheelchair, after transfer to a seat. The number of such securement/storage areas must be equal to one-half the number of 
coaches on the train; and within 10 years, they must be available on passenger coaches equal to the number of coaches on the 
train itself. Accessibility requirements are also included in the ADA concerning Amtrak for single-level dining cars. For commuter 
rail systems, effective August 26, 1990, all new rail passenger cars purchased must be accessible. The ADA also deems it 
discrimination if used railcars are purchased and not accessible, and if remanufactured railcars with a useful life of 10 or more 
years are purchased and not accessible. For commuter rail stations, any new station constructed must be accessible and 
alterations of existing stations must be made accessible to the maximum extend feasible. &quot;Key&quot; stations in commuter rail systems, 
including high ridership, transfer and feeder stations, must also be rendered accessible. For Amtrak stations, all must be made 
accessible within a 20-year period; for commuter rail systems, &quot;key&quot; stations must be made accessible within a three-year period 
but this deadline can be extended to 20 years by the Secretary of Transportation. Commuter rail authorities submitted plans to 
the Secretary of Transportation designating &quot;key&quot; stations in their systems, and the plans involved consultation with individuals 
and groups of persons with disabilities.</p>
<h4>Major Provisions Concerning Public Accommodations Operated by Private Entities </h4>
<p>Effective January 26, 1992, private entities which own, lease, lease to, or operate a place of public accommodation are 
prohibited from discriminating against individuals with disabilities. This prohibition of discrimination in places of public 
accommodation generally includes: (a) the imposition of eligibility criteria which tend to screen out individuals or classes of 
persons with disabilities; (b) a failure to make reasonable modifications in the policies and practices of the place of public 
accommodation; (c) a failure to provide necessary auxiliary aids and services in a place of public accommodation; (d) a failure to 
remove architectural and communication barriers in a place of public accommodation which are &quot;readily achievable&quot; or easily 
accomplished with little difficulty or expense; and (e) where the removal of architectural or communication barriers is not readily 
achievable, a failure to provide the means to accommodate individuals with disabilities through alternative methods.</p>
<p>The prohibition of discrimination in places of public accommodation also extends to transportation provided by places of public 
accommodation, when transporting people is not the major aspect of the activity-such as hotels, private colleges and senior 
citizen centers. For private entities which operate fixed route systems, effective August 26, 1990, it is a discriminatory practice if 
vehicles with seating in excess of 16 passenger seats are purchased and not accessible; if the private entity which operates a fixed 
route system purchases or leases a vehicle with 16 or fewer passenger seats, then the fixed route transportation program must be 
accessible when viewed in its entirety. For private entities which operate demand-responsive systems, such a system when 
viewed in its entirety must be accessible to persons with disabilities. If private entities which operate demand-responsive systems 
purchase vehicles with more than 16 passenger seats after August 26, 1990, they must prove that their demand-responsive 
systems are accessible to persons with disabilities when viewed in their entirety.</p>
<h4>Public Accommodations</h4>
<p>The following private entities are considered public accommodations for purposes of the ADA, if the operations of such entities 
affect commerce.</p>
<ul>
<li>An inn, hotel, motel, or other place of lodging, except for an establishment located within a building that contains not more 
than five rooms for rent or hire and that is actually occupied by the proprietor of such establishment as the proprietor's 
residence; </li>
<li>A restaurant, bar, or other establishment serving food or drink; </li>
<li>A motion picture house, theater, concert hall, stadium, or other place of exhibition or entertainment; </li>
<li>An auditorium, convention center, lecture hall, or other place of public gathering; </li>
<li>A bakery, grocery store, clothing store, hardware store, shopping center, or other sales or rental establishment; </li>
<li>A laundromat, dry-cleaner, bank, barber shop, beauty shop, travelservice, shoe repair service, funeral parlor, gas station, 
office of an accountant or lawyer, pharmacy, insurance office, professional office of a health care provider, hospital, or 
other service establishment; </li>
<li>A terminal, depot, or other station used for specified public transportation; </li>
<li>A museum, library, gallery, or other place of public display or collection; </li>
<li>A park, zoo, amusement park, or other place of recreation: </li>
<li>A nursery, elementary, secondary, undergraduate, or postgraduate private school, or other place of education; </li>
<li>A day care center, senior citizen center, homeless shelter, food bank, adoption agency, or other social service center 
establishment; and </li>
<li>A gymnasium, health spa, bowling alley, golf course, or other place of exercise or recreation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Concerning the new construction of places of public accommodation and commercial facilities, such new construction must be 
accessible in facilities for first occupancy after January 26, 1993. Concerning alterations in places of public accommodation, both 
the altered portion of the facility and the path of travel to the altered areas including bathrooms, telephones, and drinking 
fountains must be rendered accessible, as long as the cost of modifying the path of travel, bathrooms, telephones, and drinking 
fountains is not disproportionate to the overall cost of the alteration project. Elevators are not required in places of public 
accommodation and commercial facilities that are less than three stories or which have less than 3,000 square feet per story 
unless the building is a shopping center, a shopping mall, the professional office of a health care provider, a transportation 
terminal or an airport.</p>
<p>The prohibition of discrimination in places of public accommodation also extends to private entities whose primary business is 
transporting people, such as privately-owned bus companies. Among other prohibited practices, such private entity operating a 
fixed route system may not purchase or lease a new vehicle, other than an automobile, a van with a seating capacity of less than 
eight passengers or an over-the-road bus, unless such vehicle is accessible to disabled individuals including wheelchair users. The 
effective date of this provision is August 26, 1990. However, if the private entity operates a demand responsive system, it will 
not have to purchase such accessible vehicles, if it can prove that the transportation program provides equivalent service for 
people with disabilities (including individuals who use wheelchairs) when the system is viewed as a whole. Effective February 25, 
1992, private entities operating either a fixed route or a demand responsive system must purchase vans with a seating capacity of 
less than eight passengers that are accessible, unless the entity can prove that its entire transportation program is accessible when 
viewed in its entirety. Also effective August 26, 1990, a private entity whose main business is providing transportation to people 
may not purchase a new rail passenger car, or remanufacture an existing rail passenger car to extend its usable life for 10 years 
or more, unless such rail passenger cars are accessible to disabled individuals including wheelchair users. Under certain 
circumstances, private entities which operate historical or antiquated vehicles may obtain an exception to these requirements.</p>
<p>For over-the-road bus accessibility, i.e., a bus with an elevated passenger deck located over a baggage compartment, an ADA 
required study was undertaken to determine the feasibility, cost and potential usability of such buses. The study, completed by 
the Office of Technology Assessment, utilized an advisory committee which included disabled individuals. The Secretary of 
Transportation then issued both interim and final requirements. Such over-the-road buses must be purchased as accessible by 
private entities beginning July 26, 1996, for large over-the-road bus companies, and, July 26, 1997, for smaller transportation 
providers which utilize such buses; however, the President may extend these deadlines by a maximum of one year based on the 
office of Technology Assessment report if accessible over-the-road buses will limit overall inter-city bus travel.</p>
<p>The ADA provides two specific exemptions from the requirements for the prohibition of discrimination in places of public 
accommodation. These are for private clubs and religious organizations, including places of worship.</p>
<p>The Department of Justice has the primary enforcement responsibility for the ADA's public accommodations provisions. 
Injunctive relief is available concerning action brought against places of public accommodation. Civil penalties may be assessed 
against violators of the public accommodations section of the ADA as well, not to exceed $50,000 for a first violation and 
$100,000 for any subsequent violation. The general effective date of the provisions concerning public accommodations is 
January 26, 1992.</p>
<h4>Telecommunications Services for Hearing-Impaired and Speech-Impaired Individuals</h4>
<p>Effective July 26, 1993, each common carrier engaged in interstate communication by wire or radio must provide 
telecommunications relay services for hearing-impaired and speech-impaired individuals. Such telecommunications relay services 
provide an individual who has a hearing or speech impairment with the ability to engage in communication by wire or radio with a 
hearing individual in a manner equivalent to that of two individuals without such impairments using voice communication services 
by wire or radio. Telecommunications relay services include services that enable two-way communication to occur between an 
individual who uses a Telecommunications Device for the Deaf (TDD) or other non-voice terminal device and an individual who 
does not use such a device.</p>
<p>The Interstate Commerce Commission, which has primary enforcement responsibility for this section of the ADA, has issued 
regulations to implement the telecommunications relay services provisions of the Act. These regulations apply to both intrastate 
and interstate telecommunication relay services, and the regulations insure, among other standards, that telecommunications relay 
services operate every day for 24 hours per day, and that users of telecommunications relay services not be required to pay 
greater rates than rates paid for equivalent services utilized by individuals without hearing or speech impairments.</p>
<p>This title of the ADA also contains an important provision requiring that any television public service announcement produced or 
funded in whole or in part by any agency or instrumentality of the federal government must include closed captioning of the verbal 
content of such public service announcements.</p>
<h4>Miscellaneous Provisions</h4>
<p>One of the more important miscellaneous provisions in the ADA is one which enables insurers, hospitals or medical service 
companies, and health maintenance organizations to underwrite, classify and administer risks concomitant with such insurance or 
health benefit plans. This same enabling language applies to persons or organization covered by other sections of this Act, as well 
as to other benefit plans provided by persons or organizations covered under the Act which are not insurance plans.</p>
<p>This law also called for the Attorney General to develop a Technical Assistance Plan for entities covered under the ADA. This 
plan was published for public comment, and each federal agency responsible for the implementation of these separate titles of the 
ADA published implementation regulations. Each federal agency responsible for the implementation of the ADA then developed 
and provided entities with appropriate technical assistance manuals.</p>
<p>The ADA also required the Access Board to issue minimum guidelines, referred to as ADAAG, the ADA Accessibility 
Guidelines, which apply to building, facilities, rail passenger cars, and vehicles covered under Titles II and III of the ADA. The 
ADAAG contains procedures for qualified historic properties which are generally similar to such procedures currently available in 
the Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards.</p>
<p>The National Council on Disability has completed a plan for the accessibility of wilderness areas to individuals with disabilities, 
including wheelchair users, as required in the ADA.</p>
<p>The ADA also requires that both the U.S. Senate and the U.S. House of Representatives afford the rights and protections 
provided under the ADA to qualified individuals with disabilities. This requirement includes employment rights and privileges, and 
extends to physical accessibility matters concerning U.S. Capitol buildings.</p>
<p>The ADA also contains language which amends the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 to clarify that the definition of a handicapped 
individual does not include a person who is currently engaging in the illegal use of drugs, but that individuals who have 
successfully completed or are currently enrolled in a drug or alcohol rehabilitation program are defined as handicapped and 
protected under this act.</p>
<p>One of the important closing provisions of the ADA is one which encourages alternative means of dispute resolution. Such 
alternative means shall include settlement negotiations, conciliation, facilitation, mediation, fact-finding, mini-trials, and arbitration. 
These methods are encouraged to resolve disputes arising under the ADA.</p>
<h4>Section 44 of the IRS Code</h4>
<p>In the provisions of the Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1990, Congress adopted an important new tax credit for barrier removal 
in existing buildings to specifically comply with the requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. Effective for 
expenditures paid or incurred after November 5, 1990, Internal Revenue Code Section 44 allows an eligible small business to 
elect a nonrefundable tax credit equal to 50 percent of the amount of the eligible access expenditures for any tax year between 
$250 and $10,250. Consequently, the maximum amount of the credit for any taxable year is $5,000.</p>
<p>An eligible small business is defined as any person (term includes corporation) that: (1) had gross receipts (reduced by returns 
and allowances) for the preceding taxable year that did not exceed $1 million or (2) had no more than 30 full-time employees, 
and (3) elects the application of the disabled access credit for the tax year. An employee is considered full-time if employed at 
least 30 hours per week for 20 or more calendar weeks in the tax year.</p>
<p>Eligible access expenditures specifically include amounts paid or incurred: (1) for the purpose of removing architectural, 
communication, physical, or transportation barriers which prevent a business from being accessible to, or usable by, individuals 
with disabilities; (2) to provide qualified interpreters or other effective means of making aurally delivered materials available to 
individuals with hearing impairments; (3) to provide qualified readers, taped texts, and other effective methods of making visually 
delivered materials available to individuals with visual impairments; (4) to acquire or modify equipment or devices for individuals 
with disabilities; or (5) to provide other similar services, modifications, materials, or equipment.</p>
<p>The Section 44 tax credit can be elected in more than one taxable year, provided that eligible access expenditures were paid by 
an eligible small business; however, if the Section 44 credit is elected in a taxable year, no deduction or credit is allowed for 
access improvements under any other IRS Code provisions (e.g. Section 190 of the IRS Code). For more information about this 
tax credit, contact EPVA.</p>
<p>(The Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1990 reduced the maximum allowable amount of the IRS Code Section 190 deduction from 
$35,000 to $15,000, effective for the taxable year beginning January 1, 1991.)</p>
<h4>Section 190 of the IRS Code</h4>
<p>Businesses, private entities and places of public accommodation, including transportation systems, which must comply with 
provisions of the Americans with Disabilities Act, may need to remove certain architectural and transportation barriers in order to 
comply with this Act. An annual tax deduction of up to $15,000 each year may be taken by any taxpayer who removes barriers 
to disabled individuals in a place where a business or trade is conducted. This applies only to the removal of barriers at existing 
places of business or trade. Design areas which are covered include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Grading </li>
<li>Toilet Rooms </li>
<li>Walks </li>
<li>Water Fountains </li>
<li>Parking Lots </li>
<li>Public Telephones </li>
<li>Ramps </li>
<li>Elevators </li>
<li>Entrances </li>
<li>Controls </li>
<li>Doors and Doorways </li>
<li>Identification </li>
<li>Stairs </li>
<li>Warning Signals </li>
<li>Floors </li>
<li>Hazards </li>
<li>International Symbol of Accessibility </li>
<li>Additional Standards for Rail Facilities </li>
<li>Standards for Buses </li>
<li>Standards for Rapid and Light Rail Vehicles </li>
</ul>
<p>An additional provision in the IRS Code Section 190 Regulations covers other barrier removals, which may include a substantial 
barrier to the access or use of a facility or public transportation vehicle; a barrier to one or more major classes of such individuals 
(such as blind or deaf persons or persons using wheelchairs); and, the removal of such barrier being accomplished without 
creating any new barrier that significantly impairs access to or use of the facility or vehicle. This provision of the Section 190 
Regulations is meant to cover other barrier removals which are not covered specifically in the regulations. For example, if the 
barrier removal is covered in a local code section governing provisions for physically handicapped persons, it would be an 
eligible expense under this provision of the IRS Code Section 190 Regulations.</p>

<h2>A Special Message to Lawyers Visiting This Site: A Rising Tide Raises All Ships - Join Me on

<h4>By Richard Alexander, Esq.</h4>

<hr>


<p>Today in the United States we could not pass the Bill of Rights. </p>
<p>Although Americans live in the most complicated legal system in the history of the world, law related education is not taught in schools. </p>
<p>The average citizen knows little about our legal system and has no idea of the thousands of laws and regulations that impact every aspect of their daily lives. </p>
<p>It would be bad enough if the public were simply ignorant, but it is worse than that.</p>
<p>The average person is bombarded by the media with news of lawsuits from across the country. These daily news stories report weird, peculiar and unusual 
occurrences, which present a very distorted view of our legal system. Unfortunately this &quot;news&quot; is not just reported. It is repeated in morning papers, drive-time 
radio, discussed at work, and reported again on television. Repetition is the foundation of education, but in this case it is mis-education and as a result many 
Americans today believe the law and our system of justice makes no sense and they are outraged. </p>
<p>Add corporate America's readiness to blame the lawyers for laws passed by Congress and state legislatures and every conceivable management error. Include 
diatribes by public officials, such as a former Vice President Dan Quayle who blamed lawyers for decreased manufacturing productivity. Consider the local car 
dealer's advertisements that routinely blame lawyers when consumer information is provided as required by law. </p>
<p>Lawyers and the legal system are under daily attack and nobody is fighting back.</p>
<p>The end result is that the public believes that our courts and system of justice is not working because lawyers are at fault. For an electorate to be this mis-informed is 
not healthy in a democracy.</p>
<p>For years I thought that public legal education could only be accomplished by statewide advertising sponsored by the organized bar. Today I have changed my 
mind. The World Wide Web is providing lawyers and the profession with the means to do what we does best -- educate. And it can be done at a fraction of the 
cost of traditional mass media.</p>
<p>The central strength of the net is that it allows lawyers as information professionals to provide knowledge that the public can use on demand. The web is not the 
place to publish a firm brochure that nobody will look at more than once, but rather a medium for you to share your expertise in specific areas of the law and to give 
the public the information that it cannot get from any other place.</p>
<p>For example, for twenty years I wrote law reviews and journal articles and newspaper editorials that were published and promptly buried in libraries where only the 
most stalwart could find them.. Today I publish those same articles on my web site that is fully indexed by fifty search engines, open 24 hours a day and instantly 
available to anyone who can open All-in-One [<a href="http://www.albany.net/allinone/all1www.html#WWW">http://www.albany.net/allinone/all1www.html#WWW</a>].</p>
<p>The World Wide Web allows you to serve the public's need for information and to provide the detailed information that sophisticated purchasers of legal services 
want. In doing so it helps the public better understand how to select the right professional for a given problem. </p>
<p>From my years on the Board of Governors of The State Bar of California I know the great difficulty that the public has in finding the right lawyer. I attended many 
public hearings concerning the need to improve our system of discipline and although I heard many people complain about their lawyer, I never heard one person 
ever admit that they had selected the wrong lawyer in the first place, which was often the case. </p>
<p>The public does not choose lawyers with the dedication they bring to buying a car and most have no idea what the average corporate general counsel does to find 
the right lawyer in a given locality for a special case or assignment. </p>
<p>When consumers can find the &quot;right&quot; lawyer who is experienced and knowledgeable, many complaints about lawyers will come to an end. But finding the &quot;right&quot; 
lawyer is difficult, even for attorneys, and it takes a substantial amount of time, effort and sophistication. For non-lawyers it is a daunting task. The web makes the 
process easy for the average person. </p>
<p>For example my website is filled with substantive information about my practice and it is easy to use. Anyone interested in fighting fraud, defective products, toxic 
chemicals, pollution, insurance, banking, credit, loans, disability, medicine, cancer, dioxins, asthma, safety, injury prevention, head injuries, home hazards, radon, 
families, adoption, abuse prevention, legal negotiations, finding the &quot;right&quot; lawyer, or understanding a fee agreement consumer complaints, and class actions can find 
forty articles, more than 100 brochures and approximately 900 links to sites we use in our practice on topics ranging from the location of archives, libraries and 
university databases, defective products, disability, disaster relief: fire and earthquake, environment, legal sources, medical resources, parenting and family, safety 
and injury prevention, statutes, codes, rules, and regulations, toxic chemicals, U.S. government, to violence and abuse prevention. If you are new to the web open 
my site and spend an enjoyable evening learning what is on the net that can benefit you, your clients and your practice [<a href="http://www.seamless.com/alexanderlaw/">http://www.seamless.com/alexanderlaw/</a>].</p>
<p>At the same time that visitors are finding helpful information if they are interested they can learn about my practice by opening my firm brochure, check my 
references, records of cases won and lost, articles published, speaking engagements, a list of distinctions and awards, our current class action cases for consumers 
and small businesses, plus a statement of my philosophy and the background and experience of the great lawyers in my firm. </p>
<p>If a visitor has a specific problem they would like us to consider, they can open <a href="http://seamless.com/alexanderlaw/ques.html">How To Become A Client</a> and provide me with a thumbnail sketch of the case. For 
those we cannot help we provide a list of lawyers in their home state and recommend they read my article on &quot;<a href="howhire.shtml">How to Hire the 'Right' Lawyer</a>.&quot;</p>
<p>Because we are committed to sharing information with the public and the profession my site has won a number of awards, including Three Stars from 
<a href="http://www.mckinley.com/">Magellan/McKinley</a> and it also was selected as being in the Top Five Percent on the Web by <a href="http://www.pointcom.com">Point</a>. My site is linked on more than 800 sites, which I am told is 
more than West Law and my firm is obviously no match for West Publishing Company in marketing or economic power. [It was recently sold to a Canadian 
company for $2+ Billion] </p>
<p>This is the reason our site has had more than 1,000,000 visitors in the first six months of 1996 -- more traffic than <a href="http://www.counsel.com">Lexis Counsel Connect</a> and currently we have 
more than 50,000 visitors a week opening our various sources of information, which we regularly update. </p>
<p>The Internet is a gigantic step forward in public information and with its exponential growth I am hopeful that an increasingly sophisticated public will use the Internet 
to make better decisions about selecting lawyers.</p>
<p>One thing is sure. Our profession coined the words &quot;pro bono publico.&quot; Public service is something lawyers do all the time, across the U.S., with myriad programs 
that are excellent but which receive little publicity. The net changes all that forever.</p>
<p>With the explosive potential of the internet in its infancy we are at the threshold of a new beginning in sharing information that will eclipse the printing press. I am 
thrilled to be a part of it and I want you to join me.</p>
<p>A rising tide raises all ships. Share yourself with the public and you raise not only your practice, but everyone's. Provide free information and helpful advice. It is a 
win-win situation. Thousands of people will find out who you are and what you do and what is more, by providing needed information you can help people solve 
problems.</p>
<p>You went to law school to make a difference and the web is going to allow you to achieve that dream. The thank you letters and fan mail that will come your way 
will make it more than worthwhile. </p>

</p>
<p align=left><em>Merchants of Misery</em>, edited by Michael Hudson, is a searing examination of America's &quot;poverty industry&quot; by award-winning 
journalists from the Wall Street Journal, Barron's, the National Law Journal, Mother Jones, Southern Exposure and other 
publications. </p>
<p align=left><em>Merchants of Misery</em> reveals how brand-name Wall Street companies (Ford, Citibank, Bank of America, and American 
Express for starters) are bankrolling a growing empire of pawnshops, check-cashers and downscale financing operations. 
These predatory corporations are making millions by ripping off the nation's most economically vulnerable citizens with shady 
credit deals and outright fraud.</p>
<p align=left>But some people are fighting back. <em>Merchants of Misery</em> shows how consumer attorneys, neighborhood activists and 
average folks are attacking the poverty industry with lawsuits, protests and creating alternatives that offer financial services at 
fair prices.</p>
<p align=left>As Jonathan Kozol said, &quot;This book should jolt and shock all fair-minded Americans and ought to lead to a congressional 
investigation of the finance industry.&quot;</p>
<p align=left><em>Merchants of Misery</em> is $14.95. To order call Common Courage Press, 1-800-497-3207</p>

<p align=center>IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT <br>
FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF ALABAMA </p>
<p align=center>&#160;</p>
<p>IN RE BAUSCH &amp; LOMB CONTACT<br>
LENS LITIGATION </p>
<p>Civil Action No. CV-94-C-1144-W<br>
Judge U.W. Clemon </p>
<p align=center>CLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT NOTICE </p>
<p>TO: CONSUMER PURCHASERS OF CONTACT LENSES MANUFACTURED BY BAUSCH &amp; LOMB SOLD 
UNDER THE FOLLOWING TRADE NAMES DURING THE FOLLOWING TIME PERIODS: </p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>MEDALIST -- JANUARY 1, 1991 through DECEMBER 31, 1995 </p>
<p>OPTIMA FW -- NOVEMBER 1, 1990 through DECEMBER 31, 1995 </p>
<p>CRITERION ULTRA FW -- NOVEMBER 1, 1990 through APRIL 30, 1996 </p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p align=center>PLEASE READ THIS NOTICE CAREFULLY </p>
<p align=center>THIS NOTICE ANSWERS THESE IMPORTANT QUESTIONS: </p>
<p>1. Why should I read this notice? </p>
<p>2. What is this case about? </p>
<p>3. What are the terms of the proposed settlement? </p>
<p>4. Do I need to do anything to participate in the class settlement? </p>
<p>5. How do I make a claim? </p>
<p>6. What is the settlement approval procedure? </p>
<p>7. Where do I get additional information? </p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>1. WHY SHOULD I READ THIS NOTICE? </p>
<p>Your rights may be affected in a lawsuit known as In re Bausch &amp; Lomb Contact Lens Litigation, Civil Action No. 
94-C-1144-W, pending before the Honorable U.W. Clemon in the United States District Court for the Northern District of 
Alabama. This Notice is to inform consumer purchasers of contact lenses manufactured by Bausch &amp; Lomb sold under the 
trade names Medalist, Optima FW, and Criterion Ultra FW that a settlement in this action has been preliminarily approved by 
the District Court. This Notice sets forth the terms of the proposed settlement and your rights under the settlement. </p>
<p>2. WHAT IS THE CASE ABOUT? </p>
<p>Plaintiffs Myra S. Roberts and others, on behalf of themselves and all other persons similarly situated, brought this case 
alleging that, among other things, Bausch &amp; Lomb misrepresented the characteristics of the Medalist and Optima FW lenses. 
The action sought monetary relief against defendant Bausch &amp; Lomb. Bausch &amp; Lomb denies any misrepresentations on its 
part or any liability relating to plaintiffs' claims. The Court has yet to make any ruling on the merits of plaintiffs' claims or the 
defenses asserted by defendants Bausch &amp; Lomb. </p>
<p>3. WHO IS IN THE SETTLEMENT CLASS? </p>
<p>The settlement class consists of residents or domiciliaries of the United States who were consumer purchasers of Bausch &amp; 
Lomb's Medalist lenses from January 1, 1991 through December 31, 1995, Optima FW lenses from November 1, 1990 
through December 31, 1995, and Criterion Ultra FW lenses from November 1, 1990 through April 30, 1996. </p>
<p>The Court, on November 1, 1994, certified a class of residents or domiciliaries of the United States who were consumer 
purchasers of Bausch &amp; Lomb's Medalist and Optima FW lenses form January 1, 1991 through November 1, 1994. Notice 
of this action was disseminated in early 1995. Class members were given until May 1, 1995 to exclude themselves from the 
class. If you were such consumer purchaser of either a Medalist or Optima FW lens between the period of January 1, 1991 
and November 1, 1994, and did not timely opt-out of the class, you are bound by the settlement as to those purchases if the 
settlement is finally approved by the Court. </p>
<p>The Court, on July, 1996, certified an expanded class, adding residents or domiciliaries of the United States who were 
consumer purchasers of Bausch &amp; Lomb's Criterion Ultra FW lens from November 1, 1990 through April 30, 1996, and 
extending the class period from November 1, 1994 through December 31, 1995 for Medalist consumer purchasers and from 
November 1, 1990 through December 31, 1990 and from November 1, 1994 through December 31, 1995 for Optima FW 
consumer purchasers. If you purchased an Optima FW lens between November 1, 1990 and December 31, 1990 or 
between November 1, 1994 and December 31, 1995, or if you purchased a Criterion Ultra FW lens between November 1, 
1990 and April 30, 1996, or if you purchased Medalist lenses between November 1, 1994 and December 31, 1995, as to 
those purchases you may exercise your right to exclude yourself. The judgment in this case will bind all such class members 
who do not timely &#147;opt-out&#148; of the proposed settlement class, and you will be bound by the settlement as to those purchases, 
if it is finally approved by the Court. If you do not opt-out, you will be represented free of charge by the class counsel 
described in Paragraph 5 below, or you may appear through your own counsel at your expense. </p>
<p>4. WHAT ARE THE TERMS OF THE PROPOSED SETTLEMENT? </p>
<p>On July, 1996, the United States District Court granted preliminary approval to the proposed settlement agreement, subject to 
final approval following a fairness hearing. Bausch &amp; Lomb has agreed, in essence, to pay the difference between the average 
wholesale prices it received for the sale of the Medalist, Optima FW and Criterion Ultra FW lenses as compared with the 
average wholesale prices of its SeeQence2 lenses and to provide certificates good for certain Bausch &amp; Lomb products in an 
equal amount based upon average retail prices of those products. Specifically, under the terms of the proposed settlement, 
Bausch &amp; Lomb has agreed to pay each qualifying class member $5.36 for each four-pack of Medalist lenses purchased, 
$8.04 for each six-pack of Medalist lenses purchased, $3.43 for each Criterion Ultra FW lens purchased, and $5.33 for each 
Optima FW lens purchased. Additionally, each qualifying class member will be entitled to receive the same amount, per lens 
(or per lens pack for Medalist), in the form of product certificates for the purchase of specified Bausch &amp; Lomb products. 
Bausch &amp; Lomb has also agreed to bear the costs associated with the administration of the proposed settlement. In order for 
a class member to participate in the settlement, he or she must timely submit a claim f	orm. See Section 6, below. </p>
<p>5. PLAINTIFFS' ATTORNEYS, ATTORNEYS' FEES AND EXPENSES </p>
<p>The Court has appointed the following law firms as plaintiffs' counsel in this litigation: Ellis &amp; Rapacki; Doffermyre, Shields, 
Canfield &amp; Knowles; Hare, Wynn, Newell &amp; Newton; Lieff, Cabraser, Heimann &amp; Bernstein, LLP; Farmer, Price, Hornsby 
&amp; Weatherford; The Alexander Law Firm; Williams &amp; Troutwine, P.C., Charfoos &amp; Christensen, P.C. and The Attorneys 
Info. Exchange Group. These firms have been aggressively prosecuting this case on behalf of the class since its inception on a 
contingency basis, without charge to the class. In addition to the settlement amounts described above, Bausch &amp; Lomb has 
also agreed to pay to class counsel attorneys' fees of $8 million plus expenses actually and reasonably incurred, subject to 
approval by the Court pursuant to class counsel's application for award of fees, if the settlement is approved. Such attorneys 
fees and expenses as may be awarded by the Court will not reduce the class benefits in any way. </p>
<p>6. DO I NEED TO DO ANYTHING IN ORDER TO PARTICIPATE IN THE SETTLEMENT? </p>
<p>Yes. If you want to participate in the settlement, you must submit, no later than February 1, 1997, the enclosed Claim Form 
or the enclosed Alternative Claim Form discussed below. If you do not timely and properly submit one of these claim forms, 
you will not be allowed to participate in the benefits of the settlement. <strong>If you need a copy of a claim form, please call 
1-800-392-0581, or write to P.O. Box 371248, Birmingham, Alabama 35237-1248</strong> or on the Internet at 
_____________. </p>
<p>7. WHAT IS THE SETTLEMENT APPROVAL PROCEDURE? </p>
<p>The Court has scheduled a fairness hearing on November 26, 1996, at the hour of 9:30 a.m., in the Courtroom of the 
Honorable U. W. Clemon, United States District Court for the Northern District of Alabama, Western Division, Birmingham, 
Alabama. At the fairness hearing, the Court will consider, among other issues, whether the settlement should be granted final 
approval as fair, adequate and reasonable, and in the best interests of the class. Although you may attend this hearing, you are 
not required to do so in order to participate in the settlement. If you wish to comment in support of, or in opposition to any 
aspect of the proposed settlement, you may do so, but you must submit your detailed comments or objections in writing to 
P.O. Box 371248, Birmingham, Alabama 35237-1248, no later than November 1, 1996. If you wish to appear at the 
fairness hearing to be heard orally, you must, by written notice postmarked no later than November 1, 1996, notify the Court 
of your desire to appear personally and state in detail the nature of your comments or objections. A copy of such written 
notice must be concurrently sent to Class Counsel: James J. Thompson, Jr., Esq., Hare, Wynn, Newell &amp; Newton, 290 
North 21st Street, Suite 800, Birmingham, Alabama 35203 and to Bausch &amp; Lomb's counsel: Gregory H. Hawley, Esq., 
Maynard, Cooper &amp; Gale, 2400 AmSouth/Harbert Plaza, 1901 Sixth Avenue North, Birmingham, Alabama 35203. </p>
<p>8. HOW CAN I EXCLUDE MYSELF FROM THE SETTLEMENT? </p>
<p>If you were a consumer purchaser of either Medalist or Optima FW lenses between January 1, 1991 and November 1, 1994, 
and you have not previously excluded yourself from the action you may not exclude yourself from the proposed settlement, as 
to those purchases, as previous notice was provided to class members of the pendency of this litigation. </p>
<p>If you purchased Criterion Ultra FW lenses between November 1, 1990 and April 30, 1996, or you purchased Medalist 
lenses between November 1, 1994 and December 31, 1995, or you purchased Optima FW lenses between November 1, 
1990 and December 31, 1990 or between November 1, 1994 and December 31, 1995, as to those purchases you may 
exclude yourself (or &#147;opt-out&#148;) from this settlement. In order to do so, you must submit a written &#147;Exclusion Request,&#148; to P.O. 
Box 371248, Birmingham, Alabama 35237-1248, postmarked no later than November 1, 1996. You must personally sign 
the form, as unsigned forms or forms signed by other individuals will not be accepted. As to those purchases, if you elect to 
exclude yourself from the class, you will not share in any recovery that is to be paid to class members as a result of the 
settlement, and you will not be bound by any further orders or judgments entered for or against the class. </p>
<p>9. HOW DO I MAKE A CLAIM? </p>
<p>To make a claim under the settlement, you must determine how many of the subject contact lenses you purchased during the 
above described periods. You should contact your contact lens provider and obtain one of the following types of 
documentation to support your claim: </p>
<p>(1) A &#147;Verified Claim Form&#148; completed by your contact lense provider indicating for each purchase the number of Medalist, 
Optima FW or Criterion Ultra FW lenses you purchased and the date of purchase, and that the contact lens provider's 
records reflect such purchase. (These forms have been provided to contact lens providers by Bausch &amp; Lomb); or </p>
<p>(2) A letter from and on the stationery of your contact lens provider indicating for each purchase the number of Medalist, 
Optima FW or Criterion Ultra FW lenses you purchased and the date of purchase, and that the contact lens provider's 
records reflect such purchase. </p>
<p>If, after attempting to obtain this documentation, you are unable to obtain either of the two above documents, you should

<h3>Investment Bank Examiner &amp; Pigeon Drop Schemes </h3>
<p>Pigeon drop and bank examiner schemes are common scams. Each year hundreds of people are 
swindled out of their money--sometimes their life savings. </p>

<p><a name="Bank"><strong>Bank Examiner Scheme</strong></a><strong> </strong><a href="#top"><strong>^</strong></a><strong> (back to top)</strong></p>
<p>In the bank examiner scheme, con artists pose as FBI agents, bank examiners, police officers, 
detectives or bank officials. These con artists contact you pretending to need your help to conduct 
an investigation. As a valued bank customer or upstanding citizen, you are asked to withdraw your 
money and hand it over. They promise to redeposit it or return the money to you after they have 
completed their investigation. Of course, you never see your money again. </p>
<p><a name="pigeon"><strong>Pigeon Drop Scam</strong></a> <a href="#top&quot;">^</a> </p>
<p>In the pigeon drop scam, swindlers work in pairs or in teams. One befriends an unsuspecting 
consumer, the &quot;pigeon,&quot; while the other approaches them with money or valuables he claims just to 
have found. After some rehearsed conversation, the con artists agree to split the money three ways 
with you and arrange to meet at a lawyer's office or somewhere else of their choosing. But can 
they trust you, they ask. To get your share, you'll need to put up some &quot;good faith&quot; money, which 
they will return to you after the goods are divided. To prove yourself trustworthy, you turn over a 
large sum of money to them and, later, go to meet them at the designated spot. Soon after arriving, 
you realize the pair is long gone--and so is your money. </p>
<p><strong>Bank Examiner &amp; Pigeon Drop Schemes--Tips To Avoid Scams </strong></p>
<p>If the situation seems unusual or if you feel uncomfortable, just walk away. </p>
<p>No financial institution or government agency ever uses customers to conduct internal 
investigations. Many financial institutions request that their customers read and sign a form when 
they wish to withdraw a large amount of cash. The form alerts consumers to these scams and 
encourages them to talk to a bank or law enforcement officer if these conditions are present. This 
is not an attempt to keep your money or control how it&#185;s spent--it is an effort to protect you from 
fraud. </p>
<p>Trust only people you know. Do not trust someone because he or she has a friendly voice or 
appears to be an authoritative figure. Swindlers usually are friendly and have honest faces and 
pleasant personalities. That is how they gain your trust--and steal your money. </p>
<p>Talk to a law enforcement officer or your banker before withdrawing large sums of money at 
someone else&#185;s suggestion. </p>
<p><a name="credit"><strong>Credit Card Scams</strong></a><strong> </strong><a href="#top"><strong>^</strong></a></p>
<p>Have you ever received a phone call or mail solicitation from someone telling you that you've won 
a prize or a trip? </p>
<p>If so, you probably know that to collect your prize they want your credit card number to verify 
your identity, or to bill your account for a deposit, shipping or membership fee or merchandise. </p>
<p>The most common complaints involve telephone solicitors who attempt to sell pens, travel 
packages, water purifiers or filters, vitamins or other health products using a sweepstakes to entice 
you to respond. </p>
<p>For some of the thousands of consumers who have given the credit card numbers to strangers over 
the phone, the results have been expensive and troublesome. Trips rarely, if ever, materialize. 
Products and prizes may be overvalued and ridden with extra charges that make them anything but 
free. </p>
<p>Giving your credit card number to someone is like handing over a signed, blank check. Unless you 
initiate the call and expect to be charged for something, don't give your credit card number to 
anyone for any reason. </p>
<p>If you suspect someone illegally has used your credit card number, send a letter to your credit card 
company within 60 days of receiving your first bill. Include your name, credit card number and 
disputed charge. The biller must investigate and correct the mistake or justify the charge within two 
billing cycles. </p>
<p><a name="get"><strong>Get-Rich-Quick Pyramid Schemes</strong></a><strong> </strong><a href="#top"><strong>^</strong></a></p>
<p>A pyramid is an investment scheme in which a participant primarily makes money by recruiting 
members who, in turn, make money primarily by enticing others to join. The focus is on recruiting 
participants, not on selling a product. Products that are sold are overpriced or nearly worthless. </p>
<p>If you are considering a product-selling investment, be cautious. If the opportunity for income is 
primarily derived by recruiting more investors or salespersons rather than by selling a product, the 
plan probably is illegal. </p>
<p>Claims that a promoter makes concerning the investment opportunity often are exaggerated and 
misleading. Since few products are sold, most of the money generated is through recruitment of 
members. When recruitment slows, the marketing system collapses, leaving most participants with 
losses. </p>
<p><strong>Chain Letters</strong></p>
<p>The chain letter, a common type of pyramid operation, involves sending letters to individuals, 
sometimes requesting a small sum of money. A promise is made to persons responding that they 
will receive many times their investment by following the same procedure. </p>
<p><strong>Penalties</strong></p>
<p>Recruiting people to participate in a pyramid scheme is a felony in many states. </p>
<p>Check with your local legal aid office, state and country bar associations, city or county consumer 
agency administrator, county prosecutor's office of consumer affairs or state Attorney General's 
office for brochures and explanations of specific laws in your state on this issue. </p>
<p><a name="home"><strong>Home Equity Loans</strong></a><strong> </strong><a href="#top"><strong>^</strong></a></p>
<p>For many people, home equity is one of their primary financial assets. Scam operators are all too 
aware of this and are willing to do whatever it takes to steal this equity. </p>
<p>Techniques used in home equity schemes vary, but they typically involve the same key features. 
The first step is for the con artist to get the owner to sign a first, second or third mortgage. </p>
<p>Frequently this isn't difficult because all that's required is the homeowner's signature. The loan 
documents, including the mortgage, are written in fine print and many homeowners have no idea 
what they're signing. </p>
<p>The loan's terms are usually incredibly unfavorable to the consumer with enormous up-front costs 
and high interest rates (sometimes exceeding 50 percent). They frequently are coupled with a 
balloon payment a few years down the road. </p>
<p>With a loan like this the unscrupulous lender can't lose. If consumer pays off the note, the creditor 
makes a tremendous profit. If the consumer defaults, the lender forecloses and immediately 
recoups the loan amount plus points and fees paid up front, and gains the opportunity to buy the 
home at a fraction of its real value. </p>
<p><strong>How To Stop Fraud</strong></p>
<p>Be wary of any business that actively solicits you, particularly if the firm already seems to be aware 
of your financial plight. </p>
<p>Watch out for businesses that say they&#185;re not concerned with your ability to repay the loan. The 
ads may say, &quot;No income or credit check. If you have equity, we'll guarantee the loan.&quot; These 
catch phrases may be a tip-off to an unfair scheme. </p>
<p>Look for discrepancies between the promised or stated interest rate and the annual percentage 
rate (APR) figure required in all consumer loan contract (Truth in Lending). If that figure is 
significantly higher than the rate state in the contract, the loan contains hidden interest charges. </p>
<p>Determine who the lender is. A lender could be nothing more than a few individuals in for a quick 
score. Does the agent have an office? Is the company old and established one with community 
ties? </p>
<p><strong>Help for Fraud Victims</strong></p>
<p>Any attempt to get out of a fraudulent loan contract must be done with an attorney's help. Also, 
because lenders quickly sell these loans to other financial institutions on the secondary market, 
speed is of the essence to retain your full legal rights. </p>
<p>Under the federal Truth in Lending Act, a homeowner is entitled to rescind a mortgage contract for 
three business days after receiving certain disclosures concerning the loan. If the disclosures are 
not properly made or if notice of the right to rescind is not given the debtor, the borrower can 
rescind the contract for up to three years. </p>
<p><strong>Home Equity Loans--How to Avoid Scams</strong> </p>
<p>Have a financial adviser such as an attorney or accountant review all papers before signing 
anything. Paperwork involved in a loan contract is often technical and unclear.</p>
<p>Try first to resolve the matter directly with the original creditors if you need cash to pay off 
creditors. Most creditors are more interested in negotiating an affordable repayment schedule than 
in taking expensive legal action. </p>
<p>Don't assume you will be denied a traditional (non-mortgage) loan. Apply first and find out. </p>
<p>Check with your local legal aid office, state and country bar associations, city or county consumer 
agency administrator, county prosecutor's office of consumer affairs or state Attorney General's 
office for brochures and explanations of specific laws in your state on this issue. </p>
<p><a name="investment"><strong>Investment Scams and Brokerage Abuses</strong></a><strong> </strong><a href="#top"><strong>^</strong></a></p>
<p>Promises of huge financial returns from securities investments such as stocks and bonds, oil and 
gas leases, or limited partnerships are often nothing more than that--empty promises. A growing 
number of consumers, primarily seniors, are targeted by fraudulent securities promoters and 
persuaded to invest their life savings. </p>
<p>Although most securities investments are not fraudulent, people should be leery when a promoter 
promises huge returns on an investment. </p>
<p>The Federal Trade Commission reports that Americans are losing $1,000,000,000 [one billion 
dollars] a year to investment swindlers and according to the Los Angeles Times, &quot;California and 
New York have the most stock brokers but the weakest regulatory systems. In fact, California 
ceased to license brokers in 1980.&quot; </p>
<p>The North American Securities Administrators Association is concerned that &quot;the retirement nest 
eggs of Americans are in danger of being scrambled today by an alarming surge in investment 
schemes&quot; and the American Association of Retired Persons confirms: &quot;while people over the age 
of 65 constitute only 12 percent of the population, they probably make up 30 percent of scam 
victims.&quot; </p>
<p>Clearly the federal Securities and Exchange Commission lacks the resources to fully investigate 
and prosecute every investment fraud case in the United States and under the law the 
overwhelming number of investment fraud cases are prosecuted by individuals, through private 
skilled attorneys, despite the efforts of market manipulators to deprecate the efforts of lawyers for 
consumers and small investors who seek to re-coup their losses as a result of corporate 
manipulation and artificially enhancement of stock prices through misrepresentation and fraud. </p>
<p>National Council of Individual Investors -- NCII is the nation's watchdog organization holding 
brokers and brokerage houses accountable in cases where class actions are ineffective because of 
prevailing individual issues involving an investor's account. If you've been ripped off, scammed, or 
misled in your investing efforts by brokers who either should have known better or were taking 
advantage of you, NCII is the place to turn. The Investor's Rights section guides you in solving 
your investment problems and offers an excellent overview of arbitration, which is mandated by 
most brokerage contracts. This is a substantial, worthwhile and extremely valuable site. </p>
<p><strong>Tips to Avoid Scams</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Don't invest unless you can afford what lose what you invest. </li>
<li>If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. No legitimate promoter ever will claim to 
offer a risk-free investment--a commodities or securities investment is basically a form of 
speculation or risk-taking, solicitation that claims there is little or no risk is a dangerous &quot;red 
flag.&quot; </li>
<li>Verify that the brokerage firm is registered with the Commissioner of Securities. In most 
instances, firms that trade commodities also are required to register with the Commodity 
Futures Trading Commission and are subject to its regulations. Be suspicious of firms that 
trade commodities and are not registered. However not all registered firms are honest ones. 
(You also should consider consulting with a trusted adviser.) Registration simply means that 
the CFRC will be able to tell you whether there are any past or present legal actions 
pending by the government against the company. </li>
<li>Make sure the broker's address and phone number match the company for which he claims 
to work. </li>
<li>Never give money to collector/messenger who comes to a consumer's home following up 
on a phone sale. Never write the broker's own name on a check as the payee; use the 
company's name. </li>
<li>Ask the firm to send a prospectus or other literature about the firm. Don't be swayed, 
however, by the glossy brochures con artists produce. Also, ask for a written proposal 
describing conditions of the contract and a form outlining the risks involved with the 
investment. </li>
<li>Ask a phone solicitor to explain the investment to your lawyer or accountant. Even if you 
don't have an attorney or accountant, ask anyway because the salesperson&#185;s response might 
be a tip-off to his real identity. </li>
<li>A legitimate broker will have no objections while a con artist will say something like, 
&quot;Normally I'd be glad to, but there just isn&#185;t enough time for that,&quot; or &quot;Those people give 
investment advice.&quot;</li>
<li>Arrange for a meeting at the broker&#185;s or your attorney&#185;s office. It is never a good idea to do 
business with a faceless person over the phone. Ask a third party to attend. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Investment Scams--How One Scam Works</strong> </p>
<p>Fraudulent securities brokers often run their business from a &quot;boiler room&quot;--a low budget office 
lined with telephones. </p>
<p>The class securities fraud involves an out-of-state promoter who contacts prospective buyers by 
phone. The promoter's sales pitch includes: </p>
<ul>
<li>Claims that no risk is involved. </li>
<li>Guarantees of large and fast profits. </li>
<li>A requirement that money be paid immediately or the opportunity will be missed. </li>
</ul>
<p>Under the scam, the consumer--convinced the promoter is making a legitimate offer--sends large 
sums of money to the promoter. The fraudulent promoter then disappears with the money. </p>
<p><a name="business"><strong>Business Opportunities</strong></a><strong> </strong><a href="#top"><strong>^</strong></a></p>
<p>Consumers sometimes may be attracted to a business opportunity that offers extra cash for a 
modest investment of time and money. </p>
<p>Such offers may include distributorships, work-at-home opportunities, franchises or other 
investment plans. Treat any such business opportunity with extreme caution, especially when you 
are promised a lot of profit for a small risk or little work. </p>
<p><strong>Warning Signs</strong></p>
<p>There are several warning signs of business opportunity fraud. These include: </p>
<ul>
<li>Pressure to sign a contract quickly and pay a large sum of money before you can check out 
the offer. </li>
<li>Promises of a large return on the investment with low risk. </li>
<li>Evasive answers by sellers or an unwillingness to give disclosure documents required by 
law. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The FTC Rule</strong></p>
<p>If you are considering buying a franchise or business, you should know about a Federal Trade 
Commission rule that requires people who sell franchise and business opportunities to provide 
certain information to potential investors. </p>
<p>Under the FTC rule, anyone who tries to sell a franchise or business opportunity must provide you 
with a detailed disclosure document at least ten (10) business days before you pay any money or 
legally commit yourself to a purchase. This document gives 20 important items of information about 
the business, including: </p>
<ul>
<li>The names, addresses and telephone numbers of other purchasers. </li>
<li>A financial statement of the seller. </li>
<li>The background and experience of the business's key executives. </li>
<li>The cost required to start and maintain the business. </li>
<li>The responsibilities you and the seller will have to each other once you buy. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Prepared for Success</strong></p>
<p>Be ready to fully research and prepare the groundwork for a new business so it can become 
success. Even a legitimate franchise opportunity can fail if you are unwilling to make these 
commitments. </p>
<p><strong>Business Opportunities--Tips Before Investing Or Buying A Business</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>Study the disclosure documents and proposed contracts carefully. </li>
<li>Talk to the current owner if buying a business. </li>
<li>Investigate earnings claims. </li>
<li>Shop around. </li>
<li>Listen carefully to the sales presentation.</li>
<li>Be sure all of the seller&#185;s promises are in the contract or sales documents. </li>
<li>Check to see if the investment is registered with state and federal agencies. </li>
<li>Talk to a professional or someone you trust. </li>
</ul>

<p><a name="health"><strong>Health and Fitness Clubs</strong></a><strong> </strong><a href="#top"><strong>^</strong></a><strong> (back to top)</strong></p>
<p>As more companies have become involved in the lucrative fitness industry, problems with health 
spas have grown. </p>
<p>Some health and fitness centers have closed their doors without warning their members while 
others never opened for business after taking consumers' money for memberships. </p>
<p>Many states are enacting legislation to regulate the operation of heath clubs which include 
provisions requiring: </p>
<ul>
<li>Health clubs must register with the state and pay an annual filing fee. </li>
<li>Consumers have three days after signing a contract with a health spa to cancel the 
agreement. Health clubs are required to refund consumers' money within 30 days if the 
contract is canceled within three days. </li>
<li>Health clubs must provide for an extension (freeze period) of the consumer's membership 
for time lost due to a temporary disability. Contracts can be canceled if the consumer 
becomes permanently disabled or dies. </li>
<li>All health spa contracts must be in writing; contracts cannot exceed 36 months. </li>
<li>Consumers may cancel if their contracts don't contain provisions informing them of their 
right to a three-day cancellation period, cancellation due to death or permanent disability, 
and a freeze period. </li>
<li>All money collected before a club opening must be held in escrow, until the health club 
opens. Clubs that post a bond are exempt from this provision. </li>
<li>Consumers are not responsible for the balance due on a health club contract if the club has 
closed and failed to provide alternative services within 10 miles of the spa's original location. </li>
</ul>
<p>Check with your local legal aid office, state and country bar associations, city or county consumer 
agency administrator, county prosecutor's office of consumer affairs or state Attorney General's 
office for brochures and explanations of specific laws in your state on this issue. </p>
<p><a name="long"><strong>Long-Term Care Insurance</strong></a><strong> </strong><a href="#top"><strong>^</strong></a></p>
<p>Long-term care refers to a wide range of services for persons who, due to chronic illness or 
infirmity, need help with everyday m activities for a long period of time. </p>
<p>Although long-term care traditionally has meant nursing home care, the full spectrum of long-term 
care services may include home health care, adult day care, respite care services care provided in 
congregate housing, aides/chore services, home delivered meals and friendly visiting services. </p>
<p>Long-term care insurance policies may or may not cover all of the above services. Each policy is 
different. </p>
<p>Before you buy any policy you must know what resource you need to take care of your long-term 
care needs. </p>
<p>Then you must consider what kind of coverage you need to buy. Be aware that there are some 
companies that prey on consumers. They will try to confuse you, sell you policies that not 
beneficial to you or sell you more insurance than you need. That is why it is essential you examine 
and carefully compare policies. </p>
<p>Here is a list of questions you should ask in comparing long-term care insurance policies: </p>
<ul>
<li>Must I meet any special requirements before I go into the nursing home to receive benefits? 
If so, what are they? </li>
<li>Are there any special levels of care I must receive in a nursing home to be eligible for 
benefits? </li>
<li>Must I be in a certain type of nursing home to receive skilled, intermediate or custodial 
benefits? If so, what type? Does this type of nursing home exist in my area? </li>
<li>Are there any waiting or elimination periods before I can receive benefits after I am in a 
nursing home? If so, how long must I wait?</li>
<li>Must I meet any special requirements before I can receive home care benefits? Are such 
home care services available in my area? </li>
<li>Can the company cancel or refuse to renew my policy? If so, under what circumstances? </li>
<li>What happens if I fail to pay my premiums?</li>
<li>Can the company raise rates on my policy? If so, under what circumstances? </li>
<li>Does the policy provide benefits for: </li>
<li>Skilled care? Intermediate care? Personal/custodial care? Home care? Other? </li>
<li>How long may I receive benefits for: </li>
<li>Skilled care? Personal/custodial care? Intermediate care? Home care? </li>
<li>How much are my daily benefits for: </li>
<li>Skilled care? Personal/custodial care? Intermediate care? Home care? </li>
<li>What is the pre-existing condition limitation of this policy? </li>
<li>Does it apply to me? </li>
<li>What is not covered under this policy? </li>
<li>Does the policy cover Alzheimer's disease? </li>
<li>How much does this policy cost? </li>
<li>Per month? Per year? </li>
<li>What will the total cost be over a 10-year period? (Some plans may be inexpensive at first, 
but premiums may increase dramatically over time.) </li>
<li>Will I receive benefits if I have duplicate or other coverage? </li>
</ul>

<p><a name="medical"><strong>Medical Quackery</strong></a><strong> </strong><a href="#top"><strong>^</strong></a></p>
<p>Miraculous Cure for Baldness Discovered! </p>
<p>Ancient Secret of Youth Revealed! </p>
<p>Cellulite Guaranteed to Disappear in Days! </p>
<p>If you have been tempted by fabulous health claims like those above, don't be embarrassed. Each 
year thousands of consumers are bilked out of billions of dollars for bogus health products 
treatments. </p>
<p>The real tragedy of health quackery, however, cannot be measured in dollars. Rather, the greatest 
threat posed by these fraudulent schemes is that they may persuade people who are seriously ill to 
buy useless products rather than seek effective, proven medical treatment. Without proper medical 
treatment, diseases may progress, sometimes beyond treatable stages. In addition some bogus 
products themselves may be harmful. </p>
<p>Many medical quacks are easy to spot, but other health fraud promoters make promises that 
appear to be based on science, exploiting popular misconceptions about health to make a profit. </p>
<p><strong>Telltale Signs</strong></p>
<p>A healthy dose of skepticism and a little investigating can help you avoid wasting money or 
jeopardizing your health. To help spot health quackery watch for these signs: </p>
<ul>
<li>Promises of a &quot;quick and painless&quot; cure. </li>
<li>Extraordinary promises such as a claim that a single remedy will cure all diseases. </li>
<li>A &quot;special,&quot; &quot;secret&quot; or &quot;ancient&quot; formula available only for a short time and only from one 
supplier. </li>
<li>Testimonials reporting incredible medical results from &quot;satisfied users,&quot; especially if no 
substantive medical support for the claim is offered. </li>
<li>The term &quot;alternative.&quot; Promoters of questionable therapy often describe themselves as 
alternative healers or therapists. Some alternative healers do not follow accepted scientific 
protocol. </li>
<li>&quot;Scientific breakthroughs&quot; that a promoter says have been held back or overlooked by the 
medical community. </li>
</ul>
<p>A government study on quackery found that a majority of all victims of health-care fraud are older 
persons, and the three largest areas for medical quackery are the aging process, arthritis and 
cancer. </p>
<p><strong>The Fountain of Youth</strong></p>
<p>In a youth-oriented society quacks find it easy to promote products that promise to stop or 
reverse the aging process. Be wary of claims that cosmetics erase wrinkles, vitamins enhance 
virility or creams reverse baldness. </p>
<p><strong>Arthritis Remedies</strong></p>
<p>More than 30 million Americans suffer from arthritis. Although there are legitimate, effective 
treatments for arthritis, there is no known cure. The Arthritis Foundation estimates that for every 
$1 spent on arthritis research, $25 is spent on quack &quot;cures.&quot; </p>
<p><strong>Diet and Weight</strong></p>
<p>Weight-loss promotions are common in today's image-conscious society and, unfortunately, some 
unscrupulous businesses have taken advantage of the trend. In recent years health quacks have 
marketed &quot;megavitamins&quot; or other pills promising to give users perfect bodies in a short period of 
time or &quot;body toning&quot; devices that are advertised and sold as substitutes for exercise. </p>
<p><strong>Cancer Cures</strong></p>
<p>Cancer is a name given to a wide range of diseases requiring different forms of treatment as 
determined by a physician. There is no one treatment or medicine capable of treating all types of 
cancer. Medical science has been able to help many cancer patients, but use of a bogus remedy 
can delay proper diagnosis and treatment. </p>
<p><strong>Metabolic Therapy</strong></p>
<p>Older consumers should be especially cautious of &quot;metabolic therapy,&quot; which operates under the 
premise that diseases are caused by a buildup of toxins in the body. The course of therapy often 
includes a combination of potentially dangerous &quot;alternative&quot; health procedures such as fasting or 
enemas. </p>
<p><strong>Consumer, Beware</strong></p>
<p>Before investing your money in a product or treatment, investigate thoroughly. Check with your 
doctor or other healthcare professional before starting new treatments or therapies. </p>

<p><a name="weight"><strong>Weight Loss</strong></a><strong> </strong><a href="#top"><strong>^</strong></a></p>
<p>Looking for a quick and easy way to lose weight? </p>
<p>You're not alone. </p>
<p>An estimated 50 million Americans will go on diets this year. And while some will succeed in 
taking off weight, very few--perhaps 5 percent--will manage to keep all of it off in the long run. </p>
<p>One reason for the low success rate is that many people look for quick and easy solutions to their 
weight problems. They find it hard to believe in this age of scientific innovations and medical 
miracles that an effortless weight-loss method doesn't exist. </p>
<p>So they succumb to quick-fix claims like &quot;Eat All You Want and Still Lose Weight!&quot; or &quot;Melt Fat 
Away--While You Sleep!&quot; And they invest their hopes and their money in all manner of pills, 
potions, gadgets and programs that hold the promise of a slimmer, happier future. </p>
<p>The weight-loss business is a booming industry. Trying to sort out all of the competing 
claims--often misleading, unproven or just plain false --can be confusing and costly. Here are the 
facts behind the claims to help you avoid outright scams and to encourage you to consider 
thoroughly the costs and consequences of dieting decisions you make. </p>
<p><strong>Weight-Loss Facts</strong></p>
<p>Being obese can have serious health consequences. These include increased risk of heart disease, 
stroke, high blood pressure, diabetes, gallstones and some forms, of cancer. Losing weight can 
help reduce these risks. Some points to remember: </p>
<ul>
<li>Any claims that you can lose weight effortlessly are false. The only proven way to lose 
weight is either to reduce the number of calories you eat or to increase the number of 
calories you burn off through exercise. Most experts recommend both. </li>
<li>Extreme low-calorie diets are risky and should be pursued only under medical supervision. 
When unsupervised, they can deprive you of important nutrients and potentially are 
dangerous. </li>
<li>Fad diets rarely have any permanent effect. Sudden and radical changes in your eating 
patterns are difficult to sustain over time. In addition, so-called &quot;crash&quot; diets often send 
dieters into a cycle of quick weight loss, followed by a &quot;rebound&quot; weight gain once normal 
eating resumes, and even more difficulty reducing when the next diet is attempted. </li>
</ul>
<p>To lose weight safely and keep it off requires long-term changes in daily eating and exercise habits. 
Many experts recommend a goal of losing about a pound a week. A modest reduction of 500 
calories per day will achieve this goal - a reduction of 3,500 calories is required to lose one pound 
of fat. </p>
<p><strong>In Search of the Magic Bullet</strong></p>
<p>Some dieters peg their hopes on pills and capsules that promise to &quot;burn,&quot; &quot;block,&quot; &quot;flush&quot; or 
otherwise eliminate fat from the system. But science has yet to come up with a low-risk &quot;magic 
bullet&quot; for weight loss. Some pills may help control the appetite, but they can have serious side 
effects. (Amphetamines, for instance, are highly addictive and can have an adverse impact on the 
heart and central nervous system.) Other pills are utterly worthless. </p>
<p>The FTC successfully has challenged marketers of pills claiming to absorb or burn fat. The FDA 
has banned 111 ingredients once found in over-the-counter diet products. None of these 
substances, which include alcohol, caffeine, dextrose and guar gum, has proved effective in 
weight-loss or appetite suppression. Beware of these products that are touted as weight-loss 
wonders: </p>
<ul>
<li>Diet patches, which are worn on the skin, have not been proved to be safe or effective. </li>
<li>&quot;Fat blockers&quot; purport physically to absorb fat and mechanically to interfere with the fat a 
person eats. </li>
<li>&quot;Starch blockers&quot; promise to block or impede starch digestion. Not only is the claim 
unproven, but users have complained of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and stomach pains. </li>
<li>&quot;Magnet&quot; diet pills allegedly &quot;flush fat out of the body.&quot; </li>
<li>Glucomannan is advertised as the &quot;Weight Loss Secret That's Been in the Orient for Over 
500 Years.&quot; There is little evidence supporting this plant root's effectiveness as a weight-loss 
product. </li>
<li>Some bulk producers or fillers, such as fiber-based products, may absorb liquid and swell 
in the stomach, thereby reducing hunger. Some fillers, such as guar gum, can prove harmful, 
causing obstructions in the intestines, stomach or esophagus.</li>
<li>Spirulina, a species of blue-green algae, has not been proved effective. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Phony Devices and Gadgets</strong></p>
<p>Phony weight-loss devices range from those that are simply ineffective to those that are truly 
dangerous to your health. At the very least they are a waste of your hard-earned money. Some of 
the fraudulent gadgets that have been marketed to hopeful dieters include: </p>
<ul>
<li>Electrical muscle stimulators have legitimate use in physical therapy treatment. But the FDA 
has taken a number of them off the market because they were promoted for weight loss and 
body toning. When used incorrectly, muscle stimulators can be dangerous, causing electrical 
shocks and burns. </li>
<li>Appetite suppressing eyeglasses are common eyeglasses with colored lenses that claim to 
project an image to the retina that dampens the desire to eat. There is no evidence these 
work. </li>
<li>Magic weight-loss earrings and devices custom-fitted to the buyer's ear that purport to 
stimulate acupuncture points controlling hunger have not been proved. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Diet Programs</strong></p>
<p>About 8 million Americans a year enroll in some kind of structured weight-loss program involving 
liquid diets, special diet regimens or medical or other supervision. Before you join such a program 
you should know that, according to published studies, relatively few participants succeed in 
keeping off weight long term. Before you sign up with a diet program, you might ask these 
questions: </p>
<ul>
<li>What are the health risks? </li>
<li>What data can you show me that proves your program works? </li>
<li>Do customers keep off the weight after they leave the program? </li>
<li>What are the costs for membership, weekly fees, food, supplements, maintenance and 
counseling? What's the payment schedule? Are any costs covered under health insurance? 
Do you give refunds if I drop out? </li>
<li>Do you have a maintenance program? Is it part of the package or does it cost extra? </li>
<li>What kind of professional supervision is provided? What are the credentials of these 
professionals? </li>
<li>What are the program's requirements? Are there special menus or foods, counseling visits 
or exercise plans? </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Weight Maintenance Tips</strong></p>
<p>Losing weight may not be effortless, but it doesn't have to be complicated. To achieve long-term 
results, avoid quick-fix schemes and complex regimens. Focus instead on making modest changes 
to your exercise and diet routines. Although nutrition science is evolving, here are some generally 
accepted guidelines for losing weight: </p>
<ul>
<li>Consult with your doctor, a dietitian or other qualified health professions to determine your 
ideal healthy body weight. </li>
<li>Eat smaller portions and choose from a variety of foods. </li>
<li>Load up on high-fiber foods: fruits, vegetables, legumes and whole grain. </li>
<li>Limit portions of foods high in fat: dairy products such as cheese, butter and whole milk; red 
meat; cakes; and pastries. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>For Help or to File Complaints</strong> </p>

and prosecute unfair or deceptive acts and practices. He also has the power to seek consumer

<a href="#odometer">Odometer Rollback</a></p>
<p><a name="car"><strong>Car Repairs</strong></a><strong> </strong><a href="#top"><strong>^</strong></a><strong> (back to top)</strong></p>
<p>Automobile repair problems consistently rank No. 1 among all consumer complaints. </p>
<p>Each year thousands of complaints are logged. The majority of them involve overcharging, poor 
workmanship and deceptive repair practices. </p>
<p>State consumer laws prohibit unfair and deceptive practices in auto repair. Mechanics who 
mislead, deceive or make misrepresentations to consumers may be subject to penalties. </p>
<p>Common sense, advance planning and using a little caution can help you avoid many common auto 
repair difficulties. </p>
<p><strong>Tips to Follow When You Have Car Problems</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Research repair shops. Ask friends and neighbors if they know a reliable mechanic. Contact 
your local Better Business Bureau to check a shop's reputation. </li>
<li>Before you take your car to the shop, pay attention to your car's problem. Be specific in 
describing your car's symptoms and tell the mechanic about any past repairs for similar 
trouble. </li>
<li>Although you may not fully understand the technical terms, listen to the mechanic's diagnosis 
carefully. </li>
<li>Don't be afraid to ask questions if you don't understand something. </li>
<li>Get a cost estimate in writing and instruct the mechanic to call for authorization before 
making repairs not listed on the original repair order. </li>
<li>If you believe the mechanic has recommended unnecessary work or you are dissatisfied 
with the estimate, get a second opinion. A second opinion is an especially good idea when 
your car needs major repairs. </li>
<li>If the mechanic recommends replacing certain parts, ask for the old parts. You may receive 
credit on some parts if the mechanic wants to keep them. However, some used parts may 
not have any credit value. It's a particularly good idea to keep the old parts if you are 
concerned unnecessary work is being done on your car. Remember, if you want the old 
parts returned, that information must be included on the repair order before the work 
begins. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Dealing with Disputes</strong> </p>
<p>Many disputes arise when consumers pick up their cars and see their service bills. How to avoid 
problems: </p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure the repair order specifically lists the labor, parts and service performed. Be sure 
the repairs listed on the repair order cover all the problems you described. </li>
<li>If the work is guaranteed, get all the warranty information in writing on the repair order or 
bill. </li>
<li>If you do have a problem, such as the bill greatly exceeds the estimate or the repairs were 
made improperly, always go back to the original mechanic. Often, a dispute can be settled 
quickly and calmly. However, if the business refuses to correct the problem or answer your 
questions about the bill, then legal action may be appropriate. </li>
<li>Your options include contacting the Attorney General's Office, Better Business Bureau, 
local consumer affairs office of your district attorney or your own attorney. </li>
</ul>
<p>Check with your local legal aid office, state and country bar associations, city or county consumer 
agency administrator, county prosecutor's office of consumer affairs or state Attorney General's 
office for brochures and explanations of specific laws in your state on this issue. </p>
<p><a name="lemon"><strong>Lemon Law</strong></a><strong> </strong><a href="#top"><strong>^</strong></a></p>
<p>Lemon Laws protects buyers of new motor vehicles by enforcing the manufacturer's expressed 
warranty. But not every state has lemon laws and these statutes vary from state to state. You will 
definitely need a qualified lawyer to represent you. To find someone close by who is the &quot;right&quot; 
lawyer, read &quot;How to Hire the Right Lawyer&quot; and contact the Center for Auto Safety 2001 S 
Street NW, Suite 410, Washington, DC 20009, 202-328-7700. </p>
<p><strong>What Vehicles Are Covered?</strong></p>
<p>All new vehicles sold or leased with warranty provisions are covered under the law, except for 
commercial and off-road vehicles, mopeds, motorcycles and the non-chassis portion of 
recreational vehicles. Also included are demonstrators or lease purchase vehicles as long as a 
manufacturer's warranty was issued as a condition of the sale. </p>
<p>A defect must affect the use, value or safety of the vehicle. The law applies while the vehicle is 
under the manufacturer's expressed warranty or up to one year after the date of delivery, 
whichever expires earlier. Some extended warranties are offered by the dealer or an insurance 
company--check with your dealer. </p>
<p><strong>Vehicle Owner Responsibilities</strong></p>
<p>New-vehicle owners must report problems or defects in writing to the manufacturer to use the 
provisions of the Lemon Law. The manufacturer must be permitted a &quot;reasonable number&quot; of 
attempts to correct the problem. Law defines this as: </p>
<ul>
<li>The vehicle has been in the repair shop for the same problem four or more times and the 
problem still exists; or </li>
<li>The vehicle has been out of service because of a warranty repair for 30 or more working 
days since delivery, excluding delays that are beyond the manufacturer's control. </li>
<li>If the problem cannot be fixed in a &quot;reasonable number of repair attempts,&quot; the manufacturer 
can offer you a cash refund or a vehicle of comparable value. </li>
<li>Usually dealerships can deduct a &quot;reasonable allowance for the consumer's use of the 
vehicle&quot; from the refund. The law also stipulates that a replacement vehicle must be 
acceptable to the consumer. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Refund Qualifications</strong></p>
<p>If after repairs are made to your vehicle you still believe the vehicle does not conform to the 
warranty, but the manufacturer or dealer has indicated that it doesn't believe you are due a refund, 
then submit a complaint according to the manufacturer's informal dispute settlement procedure. </p>
<p>All three major American manufacturers have appeals procedures. These arbitration boards try to 
resolve problems consumers have with t manufacturer or dealer. The address and phone number 
of your manufacturer's consumer appeals or arbitration center are in your owner's manual. </p>
<p>During or at the end of the dispute procedure, the manufacturer may make a settlement offer. You 
must decide whether to accept the offer or to get a refund under the Lemon Law by going to 
court. </p>
<p>If you elect to go to court, the Lemon Law provides for a private cause of action. You must use a 
private lawyer to enforce your individual rights under the Lemon Law. </p>
<p>Before you can go to court under the Lemon Law, you first must have submitted your claim to the 
manufacturer&#185;s appeals procedure if it has one. </p>
<p><strong>Tips</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Before buying a car, check the warranty carefully. Some manufacturers offer only limited 
warranties. </li>
<li>Find out how long your car warranty lasts, what is covered and who will honor it. </li>
<li>Get a detailed repair order for all warranty work and keep it. </li>
<li>Use the same description each time you take your car in for the same problem. </li>
<li>Check with your local legal aid office, state and country bar associations, city or county 
consumer agency administrator, county prosecutor's office of consumer affairs or state 
Attorney General's office for brochures and explanations of specific laws in your state on 
this issue. </li>
</ul>
<p><a name="odometer"><strong>Odometer Rollback</strong></a> <a href="#top">^</a></p>
<p>As the price of new cars increases, many consumers are considering used cars. One factor most 
car shoppers consider is mileage. </p>
<p>However you need to watch out for odometer tampering. </p>
<p>To increase a used car's selling price, some unscrupulous dealers will roll back the odometer. 
Odometer tampering, which state and federal laws forbid, can be costly to consumers. </p>
<p><strong>State Law Requirements</strong></p>
<p>All state have law that require that a dealer or an individual selling a used car must reveal to a 
potential buyer: </p>
<ul>
<li>Total number of miles registered on the odometer. </li>
<li>Whether the odometer reading accurately reflects the number of miles the vehicle has been 
driven. </li>
</ul>
<p>It is illegal to: </p>
<ul>
<li>Tamper with or reset an odometer with the intent to change the number of miles registered. </li>
<li>Drive with a non-functional odometer if the purpose is to defraud. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Checking for Rollbacks</strong></p>
<p>Even if the seller appears to be honest it is a good idea to check out the car's history. You can do 
this by: </p>
<ul>
<li>Requesting a title search from the Department of Motor Vehicles. </li>
<li>Asking dealers who sold the vehicle previously for copies of the vehicle's odometer 
disclosure forms. </li>
<li>Checking oil change stickers which are usually inside the door frame. </li>
<li>Checking the inspection sticker for mileage at vehicle's last inspection. </li>
<li>Taking the car to a trusted mechanic for an opinion. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Legal Remedies</strong></p>
<p>If you believe you have been defrauded by an odometer rollback, you may sue in federal court 
under the federal Motor Vehicle Information Cost Savings Act or in state court. </p>
<p>In addition, most states law makes odometer rollbacks a felony. Criminal cases can be prosecuted 
by the Attorney General and county prosecutors. </p>
<p>Check with your local city or county consumer agency administrator, county prosecutor's office of 
consumer affairs or state Attorney General's office for specific laws in your state on this issue. </p>
<p><strong>Used Cars</strong> </p>
<p>If you buy a used car one of the most important things to pay attention to is the Buyer's Guide. </p>
<p>The Federal Trade Commission requires dealers to display a Buyer's Guide in the window of each 
used car offered for sale. The guide lists the vehicle make, model, year and identification number. </p>
<p>The guide also includes a warranty section where one of two choices must be checked. The first is 
&quot;as is--no warranty.&quot; The second choice is &quot;warranty.&quot; </p>
<p><strong>Warranty</strong></p>
<p>If this block is checked, then the dealer is promising to pay some or all of the costs of repair on the 
car if repairs are needed within the warranty period. Under this block are two choices: &quot;full 
warranty&quot; or &quot;limited warranty.&quot; </p>
<p><strong>Full Warranty</strong></p>
<p>If the full warranty block is checked, the dealer promises to: </p>
<p>Provide warranty service to anyone who owns the vehicle during the warranty period if a problem 
is reported. </p>
<p>Provide warranty service free of charge, including costs such as returning vehicle or removing and 
reinstalling a &quot;covered&quot; system when necessary. </p>
<p>Provide at the consumer's choice either a replacement or a full refund if the dealer is unable, after a 
reasonable number of tries, to repair the vehicle or a covered system. </p>
<p>Provide warranty service without requiring that consumers return a warranty registration card. </p>
<p>Not limit the duration of implied warranties. </p>
<p>A full warranty may not cover the entire vehicle. The dealer may specify certain systems for 
coverage (for example, electrical or brake system). </p>
<p><strong>Limited Warranty</strong></p>
<p>If any of the above conditions don't apply, then the dealer will check the block next to limited 
warranty. You are responsible for some repair costs of the covered system. </p>
<p>The dealer must fill in the percent of labor and the percent of parts that he will pay on a limited 
warranty, and must list the specific systems covered and the length or duration of the warranty (in 
terms of days or miles). </p>
<p><strong>Implied Warranty</strong></p>
<p>The Uniform Commercial Code adopted in all state implies certain warranties unless the seller of 
the car specifically disclaims or excludes these warranties. Implied warranties, which are somewhat 
technical, give you some rights to have the dealer take care of serious problems that are not 
apparent when you buy the car. A car with a full warranty must include the implied warranties, but 
not so if the car is sold with a limited warranty. </p>
<p><strong>As Is: No Warranty</strong></p>
<p>A dealer may sell a car &quot;as is.&quot; There are no specific warranties, and the warranties normally 
implied by law do not apply. You are responsible for any repairs on an &quot;as is&quot; vehicle. </p>
<p>As an added precaution before buying a used car, ask the dealer to allow your mechanic to 
inspect the vehicle on the dealer's lot or elsewhere. </p>
<p>And remember, if you buy a car from a private individual, the sale is not covered by the FTC rule 
and you will not receive a Buyer's Guide. Most cars sold privately are sold &quot;as is&quot; and without any 
expressed warranties. </p>
<p>Check with your local legal aid office, state and country bar associations, city or county consumer 
agency administrator, county prosecutor's office of consumer affairs or state Attorney General's 
office for brochures and explanations of specific laws in your state on this issue. </p>

<p><a name="charitable"><strong>Charitable Solicitations</strong></a><strong> </strong><a href="#top"><strong>^</strong></a><strong> (back to top)</strong></p>
<p>Most charities are honest and put their charitable dollars good use. </p>
<p>However, there also are many so-called charitable groups spend the vast majority of donations 
they receive on salaries, administrative costs and little--if any--on those in need. </p>
<p>Also, many charitable organizations hire professional fundraisers to solicit money. The fundraisers, 
not the charities, keep most of the donation. </p>
<p><strong>In Most States</strong></p>
<p>Most charitable organizations must register with the Attorney General, Office of Consumer Affairs, 
or an equivalent state or county office. Some charities exempt from this provision include religious 
organizations and educational institutions. Organizations that must register are required to file 
annual reports with the Attorney General's Office and, on request disclose how much of the 
solicited money is spent on fundraising costs. </p>
<p>The key to fighting charity fraud is to ask these questions: </p>
<ul>
<li>How will the contribution be spent? </li>
<li>What percent of the contribution is earmarked for administrative costs? </li>
<li>If it is a telephone solicitation ask caller for his name and the name of company or 
organization he represents. Check the company's reputation with your local Better Business 
Bureau the National Charities Information Bureau, 212-929-6300. </li>
<li>Ask if the caller works for a professional fund-raiser or if he/she is paid a commission on 
successful solicitations. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tips on Dealing with Solicitors</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Be careful when responding to charity solicitations that come through the mail. Read any 
solicitation carefully, including the fine print. </li>
<li>If the mail solicitation is for a &quot;charity sweepstakes,&quot; be aware that &quot;winners' in some 
sweepstakes may receive only a few cents and that the charity cannot require you to 
contribute before responding to a sweepstakes offer. </li>
<li>Don't judge a charity by its name. Ask the solicitor to describe clearly how your donation 
will be used. </li>
<li>Watch out for names of charities that closely resemble names of other organizations. </li>
<li>If you are unfamiliar with the charity, research it first. Watch out for hard-sell solicitations, 
and be careful about letting door to door solicitors into your home. </li>
<li>Request a copy of the organization's annual report. Legitimate charities gladly will send you 
written information when requested. </li>
<li>Avoid cash donations and make your checks payable to the organization not to the 
individual. Be careful about giving out your credit card number. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Charitable Solicitations -- Check on Charities</strong></p>
<p>Charitable organizations and professional fundraisers are required to register with state and local 
authorities. Ask and demand to see identification and verification. </p>
<p>Check with your local city or county consumer agency administrator, county prosecutor's office of 
consumer affairs or state Attorney General's office for the specific laws in your state on this issue.</p>
<p><a name="door"><strong>Door-to-Door Sales</strong></a> <a href="#top"><strong>^</strong></a></p>
<p>Unscrupulous sellers try to victimize consumers in their own homes, selling everything from 
magazines to vacuum cleaners to energy-saving products. These sellers often use high-pressure or 
scare tactics and sometimes misrepresent the quality and value of their products. </p>
<p>Complaints show that consumers have paid several times the going rate for comparable 
merchandise and services. To avoid being victimized by an unscrupulous seller, follow these tips: </p>
<ul>
<li>High-pressure sales tactics often are a part of fraudulent activity. Don't let yourself be 
hurried, intimidated or coerced. After all, the salesperson is at your door uninvited and 
remain there only at your courtesy. </li>
<li>If you are interested in buying from a door-to-door seller, get everything in writing including 
price, warranty and all conditions. Tell the salesperson you will check it out and get back to 
him. </li>
<li>Ask for proper identification before listening to a sales pitch. </li>
<li>Be careful about letting any salesperson into your home. </li>
<li>Don't fall for the &quot;sympathy&quot; approach. Salespersons may say they're working their way 
through college or in some other way try to get your sympathy.</li>
<li>Be wary of any offer that includes &quot;referral sales.&quot; A referral or promises a discount if you 
give the name of friends who might buy his products. </li>
<li>Don't make any payment hastily, especially for merchandise or services. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Canceling an Agreement</strong></p>
<p>In many state the law provides that you have the right to cancel any credit (not cash) contract 
within a given number of business days after the sale (excluding Saturdays, Sundays and legal 
holidays) if the seller personally solicited and presented the contract in your home. But, there is no 
uniform rule that applies in every state. </p>
<p>States that allow for cancellation of home solicitations exempt cases where: </p>
<ul>
<li>The buyer requested the seller provide the goods or services without delay because of an 
emergency; </li>
<li>The seller in good faith made a substantial start toward fulfilling the agreement before the 
notice of cancellation was given; and </li>
<li>If goods are involved, the items cannot be returned to the seller in &quot;substantially&quot; as good a 
condition as when received by the buyer. </li>
</ul>
<p>Check with your local city or county consumer agency administrator, county prosecutor's office of 
consumer affairs or state Attorney General's office for the specific laws in your state on this issue. </p>
<p><a name="home"><strong>Home Repair Fraud</strong></a><strong> </strong><a href="#top"><strong>^</strong></a></p>
<p>Consumers routinely file complaints about workers who accept money for repair jobs they never 
finish or who fail to honor warranties on home improvement projects. </p>
<p>A common complaint concerns a deceptive asphalt scheme. In this scam workers offer to use 
leftover asphalt from one job to repave your driveway. More often than not, the workers either 
start the job and then say it will cost hundreds or thousands more to complete it, or they will just 
lay black paint instead of asphalt on the driveway and leave town with your money. </p>
<p>Another common complaint concerns work on foundations and attics, which you are unable to 
see. Many times, recommended repair work is worthless, unnecessary and vastly overpriced. </p>
<p><strong>Phony Workers</strong></p>
<p>Phony workers like these are a special breed of con artists called &quot;gypsies.&quot; Unfortunately seniors 
are often their prime targets. </p>
<p>The reason is simple: Half of all seniors own their own homes and most of them live in older 
homes. </p>
<p>Sometimes these homes do need repair work and crafty con artists look for this situation. They 
usually ask for a large down payment before they begin the work, and there even have been 
reported cases where the repairman goes to the bank with the consumer to withdraw the money. </p>
<p>Sometimes con artists use the obituaries or city directory to find seniors living alone. </p>
<p>Some con artists claim to be city building or health inspectors who are there to check out the 
furnace. Once in the basement they either cause damage or claim a health or safety threat exists. </p>
<p><strong>Phony Inspectors</strong></p>
<p>Be wary of anyone who offers to inspect your home for free. They may be looking for defects 
ranging from a leaky roof to termite or foundation damage. If they tell you damage exists, always 
get a second opinion before you sign a contract or agree to have any repair work done. </p>
<p>Other con artists simply use repair come-ons to get into your home. These people usually work in 
groups of two or three. For example, one distracts you with a bogus furnace inspection while the 
others search and burglarize your home. Once they have your money and valuables they leave. </p>
<p><strong>Tips to Help Avoid Con Artists </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Always check workers' credentials. </li>
<li>Never let anyone into your home without first asking for identification. Representatives of 
utilities and reputable businesses will have proper ID. When in doubt, look up the 
company&#185;s number in the phone book and call to verify the identity of the workers. </li>
<li>Ask for an address and phone number if the workers tell you they are self-employed. </li>
<li>If you agree work should be done, ask for an estimate in writing and tell the workers you'll 
get back to them. </li>
<li>Always get a second opinion and written estimates from one or two local firms. </li>
<li>Get all guarantees in writing. Ask for the names of references and call them. </li>
<li>Remember, if an offer is good &quot;now or never,&quot; you can bet it never will be good. </li>
<li>If you encounter a suspected home repair gypsy, say &quot;no,&quot; close your door and call local 
authorities immediately. </li>
<li>Check with your local legal aid office, state and country bar associations, city or county 
consumer agency administrator, county prosecutor's office of consumer affairs or state 
Attorney General's office for brochures and explanations of specific laws in your state on 
this issue. </li>
</ul>
<p><a name="landlord"><strong>Landlord-Tenant Law</strong></a><strong> </strong><a href="#top"><strong>^</strong></a></p>
<p>Landlord-tenant disputes are a common occurrence in the renting process. Some of these disputes 
could be avoided if landlords and tenants were aware of their rights and responsibilities. </p>
<p>The following is a general statement of the law, but it varies from state to state. </p>
<p><strong>The Lease</strong></p>
<p>Renters are bound either by an oral or written agreement. Written agreements are more common 
and offer greater protection to both tenant and landlord. When considering a written lease 
agreement, the tenant should remember to: </p>
<ul>
<li>Read the entire contract and ask questions or obtain a legal opinion about objectionable 
provisions you do not understand. Ask for changes. If a tenant dislikes certain provisions in 
the lease, he or she has the right to ask the landlord to amend the lease with written 
changes. However, if the landlord refuses, which he or she has a right to do, it is up to the 
tenant to decide whether to sign the lease. If changes are made both the tenant and landlord 
should initial the changes. </li>
<li>At a minimum the lease should include the landlord's name, address and phone number; 
address of the rental property; amount of the monthly rent; rent due date and grace period; 
and terms governing the amount and return of the security deposit. </li>
<li>Although an oral agreement usually obligates the tenant for only one month, it greatly 
reduces security. A landlord can evict the tenant or raise rent with 30 days' notice. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Security Deposit</strong></p>
<p>In many states the law requires a landlord, within 30 days of the termination of the lease, to return 
the full deposit or cash the tenant with an itemized list of damages for which any portion of the 
deposit is kept. Prior to the expiration of the 30-day period, the landlord must notify the tenant of 
the time and date the landlord plans to inspect the dwelling to determine any damage. The landlord 
cannot prevent the tenant from being present during the inspection. </p>
<p>The landlord may keep a part or all of a deposit to compensate for or repair actual damage done, 
not to include normal wear and tear. </p>
<p>If the landlord has wrongfully withheld a part or all of a deposit, the tenant may sue to recover up 
to twice the amount wrongfully withheld. </p>
<p><strong>Repairs </strong></p>
<p>You may have more success if you request the landlord to make repairs within a reasonable period 
of time. If the repairs are not made, the tenant may send, by registered mail, a written request for 
the necessary repairs. The tenant should keep a copy of the letter. </p>
<p>If the repairs still are not made, the tenant may seek legal assistance. If the dwelling becomes 
unsafe due to the repair problems, the tenant should contact the local health or housing authorities. </p>
<p>Tenants and landlords need to remember if rent payments are withheld pending completion of 
repairs, the renter may be in violation of his lease and may be subject to eviction. </p>
<p>If a tenant damages property, consistently fails to pay rent on time or otherwise violates the terms 
of the lease, the landlord may begin eviction proceedings. </p>
<p>A landlord may not evict a tenant without a court order. Attempts by a landlord to physically 
remove a tenant or his property without a court order should be reported to the police. </p>
<p>Check with your local legal aid office, state and country bar associations, city or county consumer 
agency administrator, county prosecutor's office of consumer affairs or state Attorney General's 
office for brochures and explanations of specific laws in your state on this issue. </p>
<p><a name="lien"><strong>Lien Law</strong></a><strong> </strong><a href="#top"><strong>^</strong></a></p>
<p>When you hire a general contractor to build a home or to home repair or remodeling work, the 
general contractor becomes the middleman between you and any others who provide labor 
supplies for the project. </p>
<p>In most cases homeowners pay their general contractors, who in turn pay their material suppliers 
and subcontractors. </p>
<p>But there have been cases in which the homeowner paid the contractor in full, but the contractor 
failed to pay his subcontractors. The subcontractors then filed liens on the homeowner's property, 
forcing the homeowner to pay for the work or labor a second time. </p>
<p><strong>Check References</strong></p>
<p>One of the best things you can do to protect yourself from liens is to for references from any 
contractor you are considering hiring for home building, improvements or repairs. Be sure to 
specify you want recent references. When you get the references, thoroughly check them out. </p>

<p><a name="telemarketing"><strong>Telemarketing Fraud</strong></a> <a href="#top"><strong>^</strong></a></p>
<p>The Federal Trade Commission estimates that American consumers lose $1 billion a year from 
deceptive peddling of goods and services over the telephone. </p>
<p>The majority of companies involved in telemarketing are reputable firms that use the telephone to 
sell quality goods and services. However, there are unscrupulous companies involved in 
telemarketing fraud, which is defined as the use of telephone communications to fraudulently 
promote goods or services. </p>
<p>Fraudulent sales callers use phony prizes, cheap products and high-pressure sales tactics to 
defraud consumers. They attempt to sell goods and services such as investments in oil and gas 
leases, gemstones, &quot;free&quot; vacations and substandard office supplies. </p>
<p><strong>Protect Yourself</strong></p>
<p>To protect yourself or your business from telemarketing fraud, keep these tips in mind: </p>
<ul>
<li>Be extremely careful in giving out your credit card number. </li>
<li>Be cautious if the caller says an investment, purchase or charitable donation must be made 
immediately. Ask that the information be sent to you. </li>
<li>Ask who is in charge of the firm or organization represented. </li>
<li>Ask for the address and telephone number of the firm calling you. Be cautious if the caller 
won't provide that information. </li>
<li>Ask if it is possible to obtain the names and phone numbers of satisfied customers in your 
community. </li>
<li>Check with your state and local consumer protection offices an Better Business Bureau for 
information about the organization. </li>
<li>Be wary of offers for free merchandise or prizes. You may end up paying handling fees 
greater than the value of the gifts. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tougher Federal Laws</strong></p>
<p>Under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, if you clearly inform a company to not call you 
again, and does within 12 months, you may sue the company for $500 or your actual monetary 
loss, whichever is greater. </p>
<p><strong>How to Handle Sales Calls</strong></p>
<p>Many consumers enjoy receiving phone calls at home about products or services. But the choice is 
yours. When you receive a sales call: </p>
<ul>
<li>Find out who is calling. </li>
<li>If you think you may be interested but want to know more, ask the caller to mail information 
about the offer or charity. </li>
<li>If you are not interested, interrupt the caller and say so. </li>
<li>If you don't want to get another call from that company, ask the person take your name off 
its list. </li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to reduce the number of home solicitation calls you receive from national companies, 
put your request in writing and send it to: </p>
<p>Telephone Preference Service<br>
Direct Marketing Association<br>
P.O. Box 9014<br>
Farmingdale, NY 11735-9014 </p>
<p><a name="warranties"><strong>Warranties</strong></a> <a href="#top">^</a></p>
<p>If you complained about a problem with a product while it still was under warranty, you are 
entitled to get it repaired under the terms of your warranty contract. </p>
<p>Even if your warranty has ended but you complained about problem before the expiration, a 
company still is expected to repair or replace the product under the warranty terms. However, 
keep copies of repair orders and the warranty if you need to back up your claims. </p>
<p>To help prevent future problems when you make a major purchase, compare warranties on 
competing products. </p>
<p><strong>Questions to Ask</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>What parts and repairs are covered by the warranty? </li>
<li>Are any expenses excluded from coverage? (Some warranties require you to pay for labor 
charges.) </li>
<li>How long does the warranty last? </li>
<li>What will you have to do to get the product repaired? (Look for conditions that could 
prove expensive, such as requiring you to ship a heavy object to a factory for servicing.) </li>
<li>What will the company do if the product fails? Will the company repair it, replace it or 
return your money? </li>
<li>Does the warranty cover &quot;consequential damages?&quot; (Most do not. This means the company 
will not pay for any damage the product caused or your time and expense in getting the 
damage repaired. For example, if your freezer breaks and the food in it spoils, the company 
will not pay for the food you lost.) </li>
<li>Are there conditions or limitations on the warranty? (Some warranties only provide 
coverage if you maintain or use a product as directed. For example, a warranty may not 
cover business uses.) </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Spoken Warranties</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes a salesperson will make an oral promise, for example, that the store will provide free 
repairs. Have the salesperson put the promise in writing, or do not count on the service. </p>
<p><strong>Service Contracts</strong></p>
<p>When you buy a car, home or major appliance, you may be offered a service contract. Although 
often called extended warranties, service contracts are not warranties. Warranties are included in 
the price of the product. </p>
<p>Service contracts come separately from the product at an extra cost. </p>
<p>To decide whether you need a service contract, you should consider several factors: whether the 
warranty already covers the repairs you would get under the service contract; whether the product 
is likely to need repairs and what the potential costs might be; how long the service contract is in 
effect; and the reputation of the company offering the service contract. </p>
<p><strong>Resolving Disputes</strong></p>
<p>If you are faced with any problems with a product or with obtaining the promised warranty 
service, here are some steps you can take. </p>
<p>Carefully read the product instructions and warranty. Do not expect features the product was not 
designed to give or assume warranty coverage that never was promised. Having a warranty does 
not mean you automatically get a refund if a product is defective. The company may be entitled to 
try to fix it first. </p>
<p>First discuss your complaint with the retailer. If you cannot reach an agreement, write the 
manufacturer. Your warranty should list the company's address. Send all letters by certified mail 
and keep copies. If this doesn't work, you can call your local consumer protection agency; contact 
the company's dispute resolution organization; take your case to small claims court; or consider a 
lawsuit. </p>

<p>Whenever you receive a letter telling you that you have won a &quot;fabulous&quot; prize, beware. The prize 
you win may not be worth the effort to collect it. </p>
<p>The prizes often are cheap imitations of the real thing. These deceptively described prizes 
sometimes are used as an inducement to attract customers to sales meetings for land or vacation 
timesharing (the use of a vacation home for a limited, prearranged time) or other merchandise. 
Promoters who use these cheap imitations call them &quot;switchers.&quot; </p>
<p>The next time you get a computerized &quot;personal&quot; letter telling you that you have won a great prize, 
keep these points in mind: </p>
<ul>
<li>Do not be deceived by letters that look official or urgent. Some contest promoters use 
names that resemble official organizations (such as a state lottery or a charity organization) 
or an envelope that looks as if it contains an important telegram. </li>
<li>Read the letter carefully. In some cases, the letter may tell you the cash value of each prize 
or that you must attend a sales seminar as part of the contest. This information often appears 
in fine print at the end of the letter. </li>
<li>Remember, the chances of winning a truly valuable prize are slim. </li>
<li>If you attend a sales meeting, do not sign a contract or give the salesperson a deposit right 
away. Ask for a few days to consider your decision. During that time, check out the 
company. </li>
<li>Do not let the salesperson make you feel guilty for not buying what is being sold. It is only a 
sales tactic. </li>
<li>If you sign an agreement for a vacation timeshare, many states law allow you five days to 
change your mind and cancel the agreement. There is no uniform rule and in many states 
there is no grace period. </li>
<li>Before signing make sure you read the contract carefully. If the salesperson makes claims 
that are not in the contract, remember it is the contract that counts. </li>
<li>Don't buy a product just for the prize. </li>
</ul>

<p><a name="magazine"><strong>Magazine Subscriptions</strong></a><strong> </strong><a href="#top"><strong>^</strong></a></p>
<p>Unscrupulous magazine telemarketers (see Telemarket below) trick consumers into paying 
hundreds of dollars multiyear subscriptions to magazines they don't want or can't afford. 
Fraudulent sellers make presentations so slick that consumers often are unaware they have 
purchased several magazine subscriptions until they receive the bill. </p>
<p>Some deceptive salespeople avoid identifying themselves magazine subscription salespeople or 
they fail to give their names or the names of their companies. Others encourage consumers make 
purchases without giving the total costs. Some callers ask for a credit card or bank account 
number for &quot;verification&quot; purposes. They then use the credit card number to charge unwanted 
subscriptions or use the bank account number to withdraw money from your account. </p>
<p><strong>Tips</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>If you're contacted by a magazine telemarketer, listen carefully to the initial sales 
presentation. Don't be afraid to interrupt a ask questions. If you're not interested, say 
good-bye and hang up. </li>
<li>If it sounds like a good deal and you're interested in buying, ask the caller for his name, and 
the name, address and phone number of the company. Do not give out your credit card 
number before verifying who it is you are talking to and checking out the company. </li>
<li>Ask for the total yearly cost of each magazine and for the whole package. </li>
<li>Before you agree to buy anything, ask to receive a written copy of the sales terms offered 
over the telephone. </li>
<li>Another thing to remember about magazine subscriptions: If you receive an offer in the mail 
or as part of a sweepstakes promotion to review a &quot;free&quot; issue of a magazine - be careful. 
Supposedly, when the free issue comes, you can review it to see if you Re it. Then when the 
invoice comes you can simply write &quot;cancel&quot; on it and return it to the company with no 
further obligation, or you can pay the invoice amount and continue to receive the magazine. 
However, according to some complaints the bill comes first. Consumers who haven't kept 
track may think they owe the money and pay it automatically. In other cases the bin comes 
after several issues and consumers feel obligated to pay. </li>
<li>If you agree to review a free issue, keep track of when you sent the offer in and when the 
magazine and bill come. Return the bill to the company as soon as possible with your 
decision whether to continue or cancel the subscription. </li>
</ul>
<p><a name="shopping"><strong>Shopping</strong></a><strong> </strong><a href="#top"><strong>^</strong></a></p>
<p>Federal and state laws prohibit deceptive mail order practices. In addition, federal law specifies 
certain procedures companies must follow when offering merchandise through the mail.</p>
<p><strong>Mail Order</strong></p>
<p><strong>Before You Order</strong></p>
<p>Look closely at the advertisement. Pictures can be deceiving. </p>
<p>Order from reputable firms. If in doubt call the Better Business Bureau. </p>
<p>Determine the extent of any warranty before ordering. </p>
<p>Be wary of any offers that fail to offer a money-back guarantee. </p>
<p><strong>Delays</strong></p>
<p>After ordering merchandise you have the right to receive the items in a reasonable amount of time. </p>
<p>If the delivery time is not mentioned in the advertisement, 30 days after receipt of payment is 
considered reasonable. </p>
<p>If the delivery date cannot be met, the seller must notify you of the new delivery date. If the new 
delivery date is expected to be more than 30 days after the original date promised, the seller must 
provide an easy, cost-free method for you to respond whether you wish to cancel the order or 
accept the new delivery date. If the new delivery date is less than 30 days after the original 
promised time, the same procedure occurs, but failure by you to respond will be considered 
acceptance of the new delivery date. </p>
<p><strong>Refunds</strong> </p>
<p>If a prepaid order is canceled, the seller must mail your refund within seven business days. If you 
charged your purchase, the seller must adjust your account within one billing cycle. </p>
<p><strong>Damaged Merchandise</strong></p>
<p>If, before opening a package, it is obvious an item is damaged and it was delivered by regular U.S. 
mail, simply write &quot;Refused&quot; on the package and return it to the seller. No new postage will be 
required. </p>
<p>If the damage is concealed, repackage it, include a note stating the problem and return it to the 
sender (you will have to pay the postage). </p>
<p>Any merchandise that is unsatisfactory should be reported to the seller. If the problem is not 
quickly resolved and you think the seller has been deceptive in its advertisements or has been 
unfair, report the incident to your local postal inspector or call your local district attorney or 
attorney general's office of consumer affairs. </p>
<p><strong>Refunds, Exchanges, Returns</strong></p>
<p>Most states allow stores set their policies: A retailer can offer you a cash refund, credit, exchange 
or nothing. If a store does not post its policies, it is your responsibility to ask. </p>
<p><strong>Garage Sales, Auctions, Flea Markets</strong></p>
<p>Before buying any new or used item at a garage sale, remember: </p>
<p>There generally are no warranties or refunds on the merchandise. </p>
<p><strong>Shopping--Cancellations</strong> </p>
<p>Most states do not allow you to cancel an order with a retailer and expect a partial or full refund of 
your money. Before you put money down or sign a contract, find out what a store's cancellation 
policy is. </p>
<p>Check with your local legal aid office, state and country bar associations, city or county consumer 
agency administrator, county prosecutor's office of consumer affairs or state Attorney General's 
office for brochures and explanations of specific laws in your state on this issue. </p>
<p><a name="travel"><strong>Travel Scams</strong></a> <a href="#top"><strong>^</strong></a></p>
<p>If you receive a phone call or postcard offering you a free vacation, beware. There's a good 
chance your dream vacation may turn into a real nightmare if you aren't careful. </p>
<p><strong>The Catch</strong></p>
<p>In some travel scams, the consumer is sent a postcard telling him he has won a free vacation. In 
others, the &quot;vacation&quot; is one of several prizes in a sweepstakes. In most cases, the consumer is 
required to call a number for more details or to &quot;claim&quot; the prize. </p>
<p>In one version of the scam, the consumer is told he will receive a package in the mail detailing the 
vacation offer. The operator then asks for his credit card number, telling him there will be a small 
service charge made to his account if he accepts the vacation. </p>
<p>One consumer is assured he will have a review period to decide if he wants the package before his 
account is billed for the service charge. This promise usually proves to be false. </p>
<p>These companies are slow in sending the vacation package materials and when they do arrive, the 
review period already has expired. The firm quickly bills the consumer's credit card for hundreds 
of dollars for its &quot;service fee.&quot; </p>
<p>In other scams, a consumer is offered a &quot;dream vacation&quot; for an incredibly low price. After the 
consumer agrees and discloses his credit card number, he learns the catch: To qualify for the 
vacation he has to buy a second round-trip fare at &quot;regular price&quot; - only the regular price may cost 
him two or three times more than it would if he bought his ticket in advance or through an airline or 
reputable travel agency. </p>
<p>In other instances the salesperson fails to mention that the &quot;free&quot; vacation doesn't include such 
things as meals, taxes, deposits or surcharges. </p>
<p>In a similar scam, consumers win a &quot;free&quot; vacation when they pay several hundred dollars to join a 
travel club. The problem? When the consumer picks out dates and tries to book the trip, he is told 
all the dates he has chosen are either unavailable or already booked. </p>
<p>A similar twist played by some con artists involves selling consumers &quot;discount travel packages.&quot; 
What the consumer actually buys, however, may be a book containing coupons and discounts 
available for free to all vacationers from chambers of commerce and business promoters. </p>
<p>The end result in vacation scams is when you finally are ready to take your trip, the company has 
disconnected its phones, moved or closed without notifying you or issuing you a refund. </p>
<p><strong>How to Avoid Scams</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>See <a href="home.shtml#telemarketing">Telemarketing</a>, (most travel scams involve telemarketing). </li>
<li>Don't give your credit card number to any person or business unless you expect to be 
charged for a product or service. </li>
<li>Beware of ads with few details that promise a lot for little money. </li>
<li>Be cautious of firms that ask you to pay before confirming reservations. Most reputable 
travel agents will confirm before payment. </li>
<li>Deal with an established firm. If a firm is unfamiliar to you, check with relatives, friends or 
the Better Business Bureau. </li>
<li>If you are not familiar with the firm, request written information regarding total costs of the 
vacation and all items included in the cost. Any transportation, lodging, meals or other items 
not specifically mentioned may not be included. </li>
<li>Ask about your right to cancel. In the event of illness or change of plans, you could end up 
paying for a trip you never take. Also inquire about the availability of cancellation insurance. </li>
<li>Be wary of vacation offers that are &quot;good today only.&quot; </li>
<li>Remember, the better a vacation package sounds the more thoroughly you need to verify 
the package's details. </li>
</ul>
<p><a name="vacation"><strong>Vacation Timesharing</strong></a><strong> </strong><a href="#top"><strong>^</strong></a></p>
<p>Consumers sometimes are targeted by real estate developers and resort communities to buy 
vacation timeshares, an arrangement in which consumers buy vacation homes, usually in a resort 
area, for a specific length of time each year. </p>
<p>The property, which typically consists of condominiums, apartments, lodges, cabins or hotel 
rooms, sometimes is sold by salespersons using high-pressure tactics and misleading advertising. 
Sometimes the timeshare property may be a campground where timeshare members must provide 
their own campers or recreational vehicles. </p>
<p>Many states have special laws dealing with timeshares which protect consumers by providing: </p>
<ul>
<li>Right of recision. In some states a consumer signs a contract to buy a timeshare and then 
changes his mind, he has five days to cancel. The cancellation must be in writing, and 
cancellation is effective when the letter is postmarked. According to law in some states, the 
seller must give the buyer notice of the right to cancel at the time of purchase. </li>
<li>Follow-through on promotional offers. The name of the business entity and all timeshare 
operations involved in the promotion must be included in promotional literature. This 
material also must contain the deadline by which all prizes are to be awarded, the odds of 
winning each prize and the manufacturer's suggested retail price for each prize. </li>
<li>Delivery of promised gifts. When the seller uses free offers or other promotions when 
soliciting, the seller must deliver any promised gifts or an acceptable substitute gift or cash in 
an amount equal to the retail value of the gift offered within 10 days of when promised. The 
seller also must make available to the public a list of names and addresses of all winners. If 
the seller fails to provide the buyer with a promised gift, the buyer can sue. </li>
<li>Explanation of timeshare exchange plans. Exchange plans usually involve trading a vacation 
at one timeshare facility for a vacation in another location. Limitations, restrictions or 
priorities regarding exchange programs must be outlined for the buyer. For example, the 
timeshare operator must tell a buyer if a Lake of the Ozarks vacation can be exchanged for 
an Alaska vacation only during December. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Understanding Timeshares</strong></p>
<p>A timeshare often carries with it a potential for liability for the owner or member. </p>
<p><strong>Complaints</strong></p>
<p>Be sure to obtain and read any restrictions and covenants filed with the recorder of deeds in the 
county where the time-share resort is located. </p>
<p>Also, read the bylaws and rules and regulations. Sometimes, timeshare owners and members are 
subject to &quot;special assessments&quot; in addition to annual maintenance fees. </p>
<p>If you do not understand the full extent of your liability as a member or owner, consult an attorney 
before buying. </p>
<p>Also, beware of subsequent amendments to these documents. They may affect your liability. </p>
<p><strong>Violations</strong></p>
<p>Use of any deception, fraud, false pretense, false promise, misrepresentation, unfair practice or 
concealment of fact by a person in connection with the sale of timeshares is subject to civil and 
criminal penalties in most states. </p>
<p>Vacation Timesharing--Typical Complaints </p>
<p>Complaints range from disappointment with a prize and high-pressure sales tactics to outright 
deception and fraud. </p>
<p>Typical complaints include: </p>
<p>Not informing consumers they must listen to a lengthy sales pitch before receiving their &quot;prizes.&quot; </p>
<p>Misrepresenting the facility's physical condition. </p>
<p>Misrepresenting the facility's market value. </p>
<p>Misrepresenting the facility's resale or exchange potential. </p>
<p>Making oral promises that were omitted from the written contract. </p>
<p>Including fees and obligations in the contract that never were mentioned orally. </p>
<p>Check with your local legal aid office, state and country bar associations, city or county consumer 
agency administrator, county prosecutor's office of consumer affairs or state Attorney General's 
office for brochures and explanations of specific laws in your state on this issue.</p>

<p>Each year, millions of consumers experience problems with a product or service. There are several strategies for resolving 
those complaints. First contact the seller. If that does not work, contact a consumer complaint agency. When a courteous 
request for relief gets no response, maybe small claims or a class action lawsuit will bring necessary relief. </p>

<h3>Facts for Consumers from the Federal Trade Commission</h3>
<h2>Auto Service Contracts -- July 1993</h2>
<p>Buying a car? You also may be encouraged to buy an auto service contract to help protect against unexpected, costly repairs. 
While that may sound like a good idea, do not answer &quot;yes&quot; until you fully understand both the terms of the contract and, just as 
important, who is responsible for providing the coverage.</p>
<p>This fact sheet explains what an auto service contract is, and suggests some important questions to ask before buying one. It also 
discusses warranty protection that may come with both new and used cars.</p>
<h4>The Auto Service Contract: Not a Warranty</h4>
<p>Although a service contract is sometimes called an &quot;extended warranty,&quot; it is not a warranty as defined by federal law. Like a 
warranty, a service contract is a promise to perform (or pay for) certain repairs or services.</p>
<p>However, a warranty comes with a new car and is included in the original price, whereas a service contract may be arranged at 
any time and always costs extra. It is the separate and additional cost that primarily distinguishes a service contract from a 
warranty.</p>
<h4>The Terms: Questions to Ask</h4>
<p>To help decide whether to buy an auto service contract, you might consider asking the service contract provider the following 
questions.</p>
<p>Does the service contract duplicate any warranty coverage?</p>
<p>Do not buy a service contract until you compare it with the manufacturer's warranty or you could be paying for coverage you 
already have. Most new cars come with a manufacturer's warranty, which usually offers coverage for at least one year or 12,000 
miles. Today some warranties last much longer. Even used cars may come with some type of coverage (see pages 6-7).</p>
<p>You may decide to buy a &quot;demonstrator&quot; model--a car that has never been sold to a retail customer but has been driven for 
purposes other than test drives. If so, be sure to ask when warranty coverage begins and ends. It could start when you purchase 
the car, or it might have begun earlier, when the dealer put the car into service. Again, it is important to know how much 
coverage you have before you consider buying a service contract.</p>
<h4>Who backs the service contract?</h4>
<p>Make sure you understand who is liable either to perform or pay for repairs under the contract's terms. It may be the 
manufacturer, the dealership, or an independent company.</p>
<p>Many service contracts sold by dealers are actually handled by independent companies, called administrators. These 
administrators act as claims adjusters, authorizing the payment of claims to any dealers under the contract. Therefore, if you have 
a dispute over whether a claim should be paid, you should deal with the administrator.</p>
<p>If the administrator goes out of business, the dealership still may be obligated to perform under the contract. The reverse also 
may be true. If the dealer goes out of business, the administrator may be required to fulfill the terms of the contract. Whether you 
have recourse depends on your contract's terms and/or your state's laws.</p>
<p>It is important to learn about the reputation of the dealer and/or administrator. Ask for references and check them. You also can 
contact your local or state consumer protection office, state Department of Motor Vehicles, local Better Business Bureau, or 
local automobile dealers association to find out if they have public information on the firms. Look for the phone numbers and 
addresses in your telephone directory.</p>
<p>Be sure to find out how long the dealer or administrator has been in business, and try to determine whether they have the financial 
resources to meet their contractual obligations. Individual car dealers or dealer associations may set aside funds or buy insurance 
to cover future claims. Some independent companies are insured against a sudden rush of claims.</p>
<p>You also should find out if the auto service contract is underwritten by an insurance company. In some states, this is required. If 
the contract is backed by an insurance company, contact your State Insurance Commission to ask about the solvency of the 
company and whether any complaints have been filed against it.</p>
<h4>How much does the auto service contract cost?</h4>
<p>Usually, the price of the service contract is based on the car make, model, condition (new or used), what is covered, and the 
length of the contract. The upfront cost can range anywhere from several hundred dollars to more than $1000.</p>
<p>In addition to this initial charge, you may need to pay another fee, called a deductible, each time your car is serviced or repaired. 
Under some service contracts, you pay one charge per visit for all repairs--no matter how many. Other contracts, however, 
require you to pay a deductible for each unrelated repair.</p>
<p>You also may need to pay transfer or cancellation fees if you sell your car or wish to end the contract. Often, contracts limit the 
amount paid for towing or related rental car expenses.</p>
<h4>What is covered and not covered?</h4>
<p>Few auto service contracts cover all repairs. Common repairs for such parts as brakes and clutches generally are not included in 
service contracts. If the service contract does not list an item, assume it is not covered. For example, if the contract covers the 
&quot;drive train&quot; only, it will not cover the alternator (a part of the electrical system).</p>
<p>Watch out for absolute exclusions that deny coverage for any reason. For example:</p>
<p>If a covered part is damaged by a non-covered component, the claim may be denied.</p>
<p>If the contract specifies that only &quot;mechanical breakdowns&quot; will be covered, problems caused by &quot;normal wear and tear&quot; may be 
excluded.</p>
<p>If the engine must be taken apart to diagnose a problem and it is discovered that non- covered parts need to be repaired or 
replaced, you may have to pay for the labor involved in the teardown and re-assembling of the engine.</p>
<p>Even for parts that are covered in the contract, you may not have full protection. Some companies use a &quot;depreciation factor&quot; in 
calculating coverage. This means the company may pay only partial repair or replacement costs if, for example, they take into 
account your car's mileage.</p>
<h4>How are claims handled?</h4>
<p>When your car needs to be repaired or serviced, you may be able to choose among several service dealers or authorized repair 
centers. Or, you may be required to return the vehicle to the purchasing dealer for service, which could be inconvenient if you 
bought the car from a dealership in another town.</p>
<p>Find out if your car will be covered if it breaks down while you are using it on a trip or if you take it when you move out of town. 
Some auto service contract companies and dealers offer service only in a specific geographical area.</p>
<p>For any repair work or towing services, you may need prior authorization from the contract provider. If so, be sure to ask:</p>
<ul>
<li>how long it takes to get such authorization.<p>whether you can get authorization outside of normal business</p>
<p>hours if, for example, your car breaks down on a weekend.</p>
<p>whether the company has a toll-free number or if you must call long-distance for authorization. (You may want to test the 
toll-free number before you buy the contract to see if you can get through easily.)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You may be required to pay for covered repairs and then wait for the service company to reimburse you. If the auto service 
contract does not specify how long reimbursement usually takes, be sure to ask. You also should find out who arbitrates or 
settles claims in case you ever have a dispute with the service contract provider and need to use a dispute resolution program.</p>
<p>Are new or reconditioned (&quot;like&quot;) parts authorized for use in covered repairs?</p>
<p>If this concerns you, ask. Some consumers are disappointed when they find out &quot;reconditioned&quot; engines are being used as 
replacement parts under some service contracts. Also ask whether the authorized repair facility maintains an adequate stock of 
parts. Repair delays may occur if authorized parts are not readily available and must be ordered.</p>
<h4>What are your responsibilities?</h4>
<p>Under the contract, you may have to follow all of the manufacturer's recommendations for routine maintenance, such as getting 
oil and spark plug changes periodically. Failure to do so could void the contract. To prove you have maintained the car properly, 
you may have to keep detailed records, including sales receipts.</p>
<p>Find out if the contract prohibits either taking the car to an independent station for routine maintenance, or performing the work 
yourself. The contract may specify that the selling dealer is the only authorized facility for servicing the car.</p>
<h4>What is the length of the service contract?</h4>
<p>If the service contract lasts longer than you expect to own the car, find out if it can be transferred when you sell the car, or if a 
shorter contract is available. Remember, there may be a fee for transferring the contract to another owner.</p>
<h4>Used Cars: Warranty Protection</h4>
<p>When shopping for a used car, look for a Buyers Guide sticker posted on the car's side window. This sticker is required by the 
FTC on all used cars sold by dealers. It tells whether a service contract is available. It also indicates whether the vehicle is being 
sold with a warranty, with implied warranties, or &quot;as is.&quot;</p>
<p>Warranty. If the manufacturer's warranty is still in effect on the used car, you may have to pay a fee to obtain coverage, making it 
a service contract. However, if the dealer absorbs the cost of the manufacturer's fee, the coverage is considered to be a 
warranty.</p>
<p>Implied warranties only. There are two common types of implied warranties. Both are unspoken and unwritten and based on the 
principle that the seller stands behind the product. Under a &quot;warranty of merchantability,&quot; the seller promises the product will do 
what it is supposed to do. For example, a toaster will toast, a car will run. If the car doesn't run, implied- warranties law says that 
the dealer must fix it (unless it was sold &quot;as is&quot;) so that the buyer gets a working car. A &quot;warranty of fitness for a particular 
purpose&quot; applies when you buy a vehicle on a dealer's advice that it is suitable for a certain use, for example, hauling a trailer. 
Used cars usually are covered by implied warranties under state law.</p>
<p>As Is - No Warranty. If you buy a car &quot;as is,&quot; you must pay for all repairs, even if the car breaks down on the way home from 
the dealership. However, if you buy a dealer-service contract within 90 days of buying the used car, state law &quot;implied 
warranties&quot; may give you additional rights.</p>
<p>Some states prohibit &quot;as is&quot; sales on most or all used cars. Other states require the use of specific words to disclaim implied 
warranties. To find out about your state laws, check with your local or state consumer protection office or attorney general.</p>
<h4>Other Tips: Problems to Avoid</h4>
<p>If you are told you must purchase an auto service contract to qualify for financing, contact the lender yourself to find out if this is 
true. Some consumers have had difficulty canceling their service contract after discovering the lender did not require one.</p>
<p>If you decide to buy a service contract through a car dealership--and the contract is backed by an administrator and/or a third 
party--make sure the dealer forwards your payment and gives you written confirmation. Some consumers have discovered too 
late that the dealership failed to forward their payment, leaving them with no coverage months after they signed a contract. 
Contact your local or state consumer protection office if you have reason to believe that your contract was not put into effect as 
agreed.</p>
<p>In some states, service contract providers are subject to insurance regulations. Find out if this is true in your state. Insurance 
regulations generally require companies to:</p>
<ul>
<li>maintain an adequate financial reserve to pay claims.<p>base their contract fees on expected claims. (Some service providers have been known to realize huge profits because the 
cost of their contracts far exceed the cost of repairs or services they provide.)</p>
<p>seek approval from the state insurance office for their premium amounts, or contract fees.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Complaints: How to Handle Them </h4>
<p>To report contract problems with a service provider, contact your local and state consumer protection agencies, including the 
state insurance commissioner and state attorney general.</p>
<p>You also can contact the FTC. Write: Correspondence Branch, Federal Trade Commission, Washington, DC 20580. Although 
the FTC generally does not intervene in individual disputes, the information you provide may indicate a pattern of possible law 
violations requiring action by the Commission.</p>
<h4>More Information: From the FTC</h4>
<p>The FTC offers other free car publications: Car Ads: Low Interest Loans and Other Offers; Buying a Used Car; Car Financing 
Scams; New Car Buying Guide; Warranties; and A Consumer Guide to Vehicle Leasing. Write: Public Reference, Federal 
Trade Commission, Washington, DC 20580. You also can write to that address for the Best Sellers brochure, which lists all the 
FTC's consumer publications.</p>

<h3>Facts for Consumers from the Federal Trade Commission</h3>
<h2>Car Ads: Low Interest Loans &amp; Other Offers -- January 1993</h2>
<p>Many new car dealers have been advertising unusually low interest rates and other special promotions such as high trade-in 
allowances and free or low-cost options. While these advertisements may help you shop, finding the best deal requires careful 
comparison.</p>
<p>There are many factors that determine whether a special offer provides genuine savings. The interest rate, for example, is only 
part of the car dealer's financing package. Other terms, such as the size of the downpayment, also affect the total financing cost. 
Be sure to consider all aspects of a financing plan before you sign a contract.</p>
<p>When considering an advertised special, read the ad carefully and call or visit the dealer to find out about all the terms and 
conditions of the offer. Then compare the specials advertised by other dealers.</p>
<h4>Questions About Low Interest Loans</h4>
<p>Listed below are some financing questions you should consider when talking to dealers.</p>
<p>Will you be charged a higher price for the car to qualify for the low-rate financing? Would the price be lower if you paid cash, or 
supplied your own financing from your bank or credit union?</p>
<p>Does the financing require a larger-than-usual downpayment? Perhaps 25 or 30 percent?</p>
<p>Are there limits on the length of the loan? In other words, are you required to repay the loan in a shorter period of time, such as 
24 or 36 months?</p>
<p>Do you have to buy special or extra merchandise or services such as rustproofing, an extended warranty, or a service contract to 
qualify for a low interest loan?</p>
<p>Is the financing available for a limited time only? Some merchants limit special deals to a few days or require that you take 
delivery by a specified date.</p>
<p>Does the low rate apply to all cars in stock or only to certain models?</p>
<p>Are you required to give the dealer the manufacturer's rebate (if one is offered) to qualify for financing?</p>
<h4>Questions About Other Promotions</h4>
<p>Other special promotions include high trade-in allowances and free or low-cost options. Some dealers also promise to sell you a 
car for a stated amount over the dealer's invoice. The following questions can help you determine if such special promotions offer 
genuine value.</p>
<p>Does the advertised trade-in allowance apply to all cars, regardless of their condition? Are there any deductions for high mileage, 
dents, or rust?</p>
<p>Does the larger trade-in allowance make the cost of the new car higher than it would be without the trade-in? You might be 
giving back the big trade-in allowance by paying more for your new car.</p>
<p>Is the dealer who offers high trade-in allowance and free or low-cost options actually giving you a better price on the car than 
another dealer who does not offer such promotions?</p>
<p>Does the &quot;dealer's invoice&quot; reflect the actual amount that the dealer pays the manufacturer? You can consult consumer or 
automotive publications for information about what the dealer pays.</p>
<p>Does the &quot;dealer's invoice&quot; include the cost of options, such as rustproofing or waterproofing, that already have been added to 
your car? Is the dealer charging more for these options than other dealers?</p>
<p>Does the dealer have cars in stock without expensive added options? If not, will the dealer order one for you?</p>
<p>Are the special offers available if you order a car instead of buying one off the lot?</p>
<p>Can you take advantage of all special offers simultaneously?</p>
<p>Remember, you are not limited to financing offered by the dealer. You may wish to see what type of loan you can arrange with 
your bank or credit union.</p>
<p>Once you decide which dealer offers the car and financing you want, read the invoice and the installment contract carefully. 
Check to see that all the terms of the contract reflect the agreement you made with the dealer. If they differ, get a written 
explanation before you sign. Careful shopping will help you decide what financing, car, and options are best for you.</p>

<h3>Facts for Consumers from the Federal Trade Commission</h3>
<h2>Car Financing Scams -- June 1994</h2>
<h4>When buying a car, don't be misled by cost comparisons between financing and paying cash.</h4>
<p>Many car dealers now use fancy computer printouts to show that financing a car is a better deal than paying cash for it. Beware. 
The numbers may look good, but the bottom line isn't. Although there may be good reasons to finance a car or other expensive 
items, it's not usually because it saves money. Be skeptical, then, if an auto dealer claims that financing costs you less than paying 
cash. Information telling the whole story may be missing.</p>
<h4>How Much Will It Cost?</h4>
<p>The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has taken action against a company that distributed computer software used to 
misrepresent the &quot;savings&quot; of financing versus paying cash for a car. Many auto dealerships across the country may be using 
similar software.</p>
<p>The computerized cost comparison seems to &quot;prove&quot; you can save money by financing at one rate and investing the cash not 
spent in a certificate of deposit (CD) at a lower rate. But can you really come out ahead by borrowing at one rate and investing 
at a lower rate?</p>
<h4>No! This comparison leaves out a crucial point.</h4>
<p>When you pay cash, you have no monthly payments to make. If each month you invest an amount equal to the car payment, the 
total you accumulate will be more than the value of the CD described above. In the end, paying interest on a loan always costs 
you more - unless you can invest your cash at an interest rate higher than the loan rate.</p>
<h4>Why Finance Your Car or Other Purchases?</h4>
<p>You may, however, find it advantageous to finance your car. Many car buyers prefer taking out loans to paying cash for any of 
the following reasons.</p>
<p>You may need your cash for other purposes, such as paying for other products or services, maintaining a better cash flow, or 
building a &quot;cash cushion&quot; for such things as emergencies or college tuition.</p>
<h4>You may be able to buy a more expensive car by using financing.</h4>
<p>Under some circumstances, if you finance a car that develops serious problems, you may not have to continue making payments.</p>
<p>Be aware, however, that car salesmen may be earning commissions when they convince you to finance a car through their 
dealership. Think carefully, then, about any claims that financing a car can save you money.</p>
<h4>For More Information</h4>
<p>The FTC publishes a number of brochures on credit and car-buying issues.</p>
<p>Auto Air Conditioners &amp; the Ozone Layer: A Consumer Guide</p>
<p>Buying a Used Car</p>
<p>Car Ads: Low Interest Loans &amp; Other Offers</p>
<p>A Consumer Guide to Vehicle Leasing</p>
<p>New Car Buying Guide</p>

326-2502. For a complete list of FTC consumer publications, ask for a copy of Best Sellers.</p>
<p>If you have questions or problems about the way auto dealers present cost comparisons between financing and paying cash, you 
may want to contact your local or state consumer protection agency or your state attorney general. You also can contact the 
National Fraud Information Center at 1-800-876-7060 (9:00 a.m. - 5:30 p.m., EST, Monday - Friday). NFIC will forward all 
appropriate information to the FTC.</p>

<h3>Facts for Consumers from the Federal Trade Commission</h3>
<h2>Car Rental Guide -- October 1993</h2>
<p>When you go to rent a car, you may be puzzled by some terms car-rental agents use, such as collision damage waivers and 
drop-off fees. This fact sheet explains such industry terms, and also provides a checklist and worksheet to help you choose the 
rental car best suited for your needs. (We apologize that the worksheet is not available on-line. To obtain a copy of the 
worksheet, please request a free copy of the brochure by contacting: Public Reference, Federal Trade Commission, Washington, 
D.C. 20580; (202) 326-2222. TDD call (202) 326-2502.)</p>
<h4>Choosing a Car-Rental Company</h4>
<p>Before you reserve a car, know what model and options you want or need and how much you are willing to spend. In that way, 
you are less likely to feel pressured into making a hasty or expensive decision that you may regret later. Before you choose, you 
may want to take the following steps.</p>
<p>Call several car-rental companies and get price estimates. Many companies have toll- free numbers, and many offer weekly and 
weekend specials. Watch the newspaper ads and ask about advertised specials. If your business or vacation plans permit 
flexibility, you may be able to save money by renting a car when you can get a price break. Be sure to ask about any restrictions 
on special offers, including blackout dates, when an advertised special price is unavailable.</p>
<p>Decide on what model and size car you want, but realize that each car-rental company has its own vehicle classification system. 
The terms &quot;compact,&quot; &quot;mid-size,&quot; and &quot;luxury&quot; sometimes differ among companies.</p>
<p>Know that there may be additional fees that could substantially increase an advertised base rate. These costs might include: 
collision damage waiver fees, in states that allow them; a refundable charge; airport surcharges and drop-off fees; fuel charges; 
mileage fees; taxes; additional-driver fees; under-age driver fees; out-of-state charges; and equipment-rental fees, for items such 
as ski racks and car seats. To understand the meaning of these charges, check the definitions given below. To help you compare 
the cost of these additional fees, refer to the worksheet on pages 6-7.</p>
<h4>Learning the Terms</h4>
<p>The glossary listed here defines charges that are frequently added to the quoted base rental rate. Asking about these charges 
before you sign your rental agreement may help you save money on your trip and avoid disputes when it is time to pay the bill.</p>
<p>Collision Damage Waiver (CDW), in states that allow it, is an option charge of $9 to $13 a day. Car-rental agents may use 
hard-sell tactics to convince you to buy it. Although they call it &quot;collision damage&quot; coverage, technically it is not collision 
insurance. Rather, it is a &quot;guarantee&quot; that you buy from the car-rental company that it will pay for damages to your rented car. 
However, under CDW, the rental company will not pay for bodily injuries or damages to your personal property. If you do not 
buy CDW coverage or are not covered by your own auto insurance policy, you could be liable for the full value of the car. Other 
companies will hold you liable for the first $1,000 to $2,000.</p>
<p>Some CDWs exclude coverage under certain circumstances. For example, coverage may be revoked if you damage the car 
when driving in a negligent manner, on unpaved roads, or out of the state in which you rented the vehicle. Some companies void 
their CDW coverage if a driver drinks alcoholic beverages or if someone is driving other than the one authorized on the rental 
contract. The coverage offered by car-rental companies may duplicate what is already provided by your auto and 
homeowner\'20s insurance policies. If you are concerned about bodily injuries, coverage under your medical plan would offer 
protection that CDW coverage lacks. Check your policies and medical plan. If you are traveling on business, your employer may 
have insurance that covers you. Also, some credit-card companies and motor clubs provide their members free rental protection 
when they use the card to pay for the rental.</p>
<p>In addition to CDW coverage, a car-rental company also may offer:</p>
<p>Personal-accident insurance (PAI), at a daily cost of between $1.50 and $4.00, insures against death and at least part of your 
medical expenses if you are involved in an accident.</p>
<p>Personal-effects coverage (PEC), also known as personal-effects protection (PEP), safeguards your luggage against damage at 
an average daily cost of $1.25. You may not need this protection if your homeowner's policy already covers your luggage and 
other belongings when you are traveling.</p>
<p>A Refundable Charge may be required when you pick up your car. The charge varies, but may cost hundreds of dollars. Most 
companies make the charge to your credit card but do not process the amount against your account unless you do not return the 
car, as specified in your rental contract. What you need to remember is that, until you return the car, the spending limit on your 
card may be reduced by the amount of the deposit. This may be important if you are on vacation, intend to place large charges 
for hotels and other items on your credit-card account, and are approaching your credit limit on your card. If you do not have a 
major credit card, or do not wish to charge the deposit to your account, companies may ask for the amount in cash.</p>
<p>Airport Surcharges and Drop-off Fees can add considerably to a base rental rate. Surcharges apply when airport authorities 
impose fees for airport use even when car- rental companies shuttle you to an off-airport site. Drop-off charges refer to fees that 
some companies charge to allow you to drop the car at a location different from your pick-up point.</p>
<p>A Fuel Charge is the amount many rental companies add to your bill for gasoline. Some companies give you a half-tank at a 
charge of $10 to $15 and tell you to return the car empty; others initially fill the tank and charge for the amount of gas you use. 
Companies that do not charge you for the initial tank of gas may ask you to return the car with a full tank. If you do not refuel the 
car, you will be charged the rental company's price for gasoline, which is often much higher than you would find at a local station.</p>
<p>Mileage Fees are usually assessed on a cents-per-mile basis or a flat fee when you exceed the allotted free mileage cap. 
Knowing approximately how far you will drive will help you select the company that offers you the most favorable mileage terms. 
Taxes, of course, are levied by states and some local municipalities. But you might save some costs if, for example, you pick up 
your rental car at a suburban location, so as not to be subject to a higher tax rate of an urban pick-up site.</p>
<p>Additional-Driver Fees and Under-Age Driver Fees, costs that a company assesses when you share the driving with a 
companion or when the driver is under a certain age (often 25), can add a daily charge to your base rental rate.</p>
<p>Out-of-State Charges, as the name suggests, are fees a company adds when you drive the car out of the state where you rented 
it. Equipment-Rental Fees are costs that a company assesses when you order such extras as ski racks and car seats. If these 
items are important to you, be sure to request them in advance.</p>
<h4>Checklist for Renting a Car</h4>
<p>As mentioned earlier, you are likely to negotiate a better deal if you know what kind of car you want and what you want to 
spend. Here are some other check points that may save you money.</p>
<p>Determine where you will pick up and drop off the car and if these locations are without special fees.</p>
<p>Find out about any blackout dates that could affect an advertised special.</p>
<p>Ask about the weekly rate if you are considering a rental for more than four days. The daily rate for rentals of more than four 
days, but less than seven, is often higher than renting a car at the weekly rate.</p>
<p>Ask about mandatory additions to the quoted price, such as mileage rates and caps, airport surcharges, and taxes.</p>
<p>Ask about charges for optional CDW, PAI, and PEC coverage. Find out if your own auto insurance policy covers rental cars 
and the conditions of the coverage.</p>
<p>Ask about other optional charges, such as additional-driver fees, under-age driver fees, out-of-state charges, and 
equipment-rental fees.</p>

<h4>COST OF OWNING &amp; OPERATING AUTOMOBILES, VANS &amp; LIGHT TRUCKS -- 1991</h4>
<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>The cost of owning and operating a motor vehicle is of major significance, as Americans experience increasing demands on their 
incomes. It costs about $14,000 to purchase a 1991 intermediate-sized model year car. If it is driven 128,500 miles by one 
owner over a period of 12 years, the total cost to the owner will be about $42,700. During that time it will cost about $16,300 
for depreciation and finance charges, $9,050 to insure the vehicle, $7,800 (including taxes) for some 6,500 gallons of gasoline, 
$200 for oil, $5,350 for maintenance and repair work, $1,250 for fires, $1,650 for parking and tolls, and, for Maryland drivers, 
$1,100 for license, registration, and vehicle excise tax. </p>
<p>The pie chart below illustrates a breakdown of total costs over twelve years for the 1991 intermediate-sized model year car. Tax 
revenues for gasoline and oil are used primarily for improvements to roads on which the vehicle is driven and account for less 
than five percent of the total costs. The average annual cost of $3,560 represents about 12.3 percent of a household's 1991 
disposable income. This report updates The Cost of Owning and Operating Automobiles and Vans -- 1984. It traces selected 
vehicles in personal use and their costs through a 12-year lifetime of 128,500 miles using 1991 data. The user is cautioned 
against making direct comparisons between the costs reported in this and previous issues. The study methodology has been 
modified (details below). As with earlier reports, costs are based on operation to typical vehicles in the Baltimore, Maryland, 
suburbs. A worksheet for developing costs for the first year of a vehicle's life in other localities is provided at the back of this 
report. Although a vehicle will usually pass through three or more owners during its life, the cost resulting from transfer of 
ownership are not included in this report.</p>
<p>The average annual cost of $3,560 represent about 12.3 percent of a household's 1991 disposable income.</p>
<p>Methodology For the Study: The basic methodology for this study was modified somewhat from the used in the 1984 study. For 
the 1991 study, vehicle lifetime mileage was increased from 120,000 to 128,500. The five vehicle classes used for the 1984 
study have been retained, and three additional classes have been added: compact pickup trucks, full-sized pickup trucks, and 
minivans. The average age of an automobile (7.8 years) is higher now than it has been at any time in the post-World War II 
period. The average annual mileage per vehicle is approximately 10,700, with travel decreasing as the age of the vehicle 
increases. As in the 1984 study, the cost of the home garage or a parking facility was omitted. In a suburban setting, parking 
facilities range from curb parking to paved drive ways to carports to fully-enclosed garages, with an equally wide range in costs. 
In suburban areas, garage costs are not usually a factor in automobile purchase or use decisions. Only costs to the vehicle owner 
are addressed. The costs of vehicle emissions and other external costs of vehicle use are not considered. </p>
<h4>Vehicles Used in this Study</h4>
<p>Description: The vehicle classes, repair and maintenance operations, replacement items, insurance, fuel and oil consumption, 
taxes, and other costs included in the study and the values of the factors used to compute these costs are given in Table 1, 
Vehicle and Estimating Bases. In the current study, between two and seven vehicles were selected to represent each vehicle 
class.</p>
<p>For this study, 29 domestic and imported vehicles were chosen to represent eight vehicle classes: subcompacts, compacts, 
intermediates, and full-sized automobiles; compact and full-sized pickups; and minivans and full-sized vans. The selected vehicles 
represent the most popular nameplates in their class. For each class, the selected nameplates account for at least 47 percent of 
1990 sales (using the Automotive News assignment of vehicles to classes). The vehicles selected are intended to be typical of 
new vehicles in each size category, but, because of changing technology, they are probably not representative of older vehicles in 
their respective size classes.</p>
<p>The average age of an automobile (7.8 years) is higher now than it has been at any time in the post-World War II period.</p>
<p>The vehicles were equipped as described in Table 1. All have gasoline engines. The optional equipment selected is that which the 
automotive industry reports to be typical for each vehicle size group. For example, data show that about 92 percent of 
intermediates have air conditioning. The purchase price of each vehicle was calculated using dealer cost plus freight plus an 
estimate of dealer markup. The markup depends on many factors--the size of the dealership, the dealer's inventory situation, the 
time of year, and the ability of the buyer to negotiate. For most vehicles, the markup is roughly half the difference between sticker 
price and dealer cost.</p>
<p>Vehicle Life: Many things, such as individual driving habits, climate, garage facilities, type and condition of road, type of use, and 
sometimes luck, can affect the service life and operating costs of a vehicle. Most private passenger vehicles are now staying on 
the road for at least 12 years; and the average vehicle accumulates 128,500 miles in these 12 years. The same distribution of 
these miles over time--12,900 miles the first year, decreasing to 8,200 miles traveled in the 12th year--has been used for all eight 
vehicle classes. (Annual mileage actually does vary somewhat by vehicle class, but the data on how it varies is weak and using 
different annual mileages would reduce the comparability of results across vehicle classes.) The complete mileage distribution is 
shown in Tables 2 through 9.</p>
<p>The decreasing mileage distribution is consistent with the average annual miles driven by age of vehicles; but, in normal 
circumstances, an individual's need for transportation is relatively stable from year to year. It is unlikely that an only car would be 
driven successively fewer miles each year. What is more likely is that, as a vehicle ages, it becomes a second or third family 
vehicle or its ownership is transferred to a household that uses it less.</p>
<p>The average vehicle is sold or traded two or more times during its life, often through new or used car dealers. This is often 
prompted by the need for or anticipation of repairs. Dealers serve as quality control judges of the used vehicle trade. They 
wholesale those vehicles that require very expensive or time-consuming work and make the repairs on the remainder prior to 
resale. Battery and tire replacements, brake linings, radiator repairs, body work, and numerous other replacements and repairs 
are included in the used vehicle reconditioning programs of many dealers. The additional work done under dealer warranty does 
not impose direct out-of-pocket expenditures on the vehicle owner, but these costs are submerged in each vehicle's purchase 
price. For the purpose of this report, no effort has been made to separate them.</p>
<h4>Types of Costs</h4>
<p>Some owners may think of costs only in terms of outlays for fuel, oil, tires and tolls. A more careful examination shows that some 
costs occur whether or not the vehicle is driven, while others are directly related to the amount of travel. The travel-related group 
is generally referred to as operating costs, and the other group as ownership costs. Analysts often differ on the costs that should 
be included in each category. The following defines the terms as they relate to this study.</p>
<p>Ownership Costs: Ownership costs include depreciation, finance charges, insurance, registration and titling fees, and any taxes 
applied to these items. No matter how little a vehicle is driven, the majority of the cost of each of these items is incurred.</p>
<p>1. Depreciation is the loss of value of the vehicle during its lifetime due to passage of time, its mechanical and physical condition, 
and the number of miles it is driven.</p>
<p>National vehicle dealer groups issue vehicle value books for different regions of the country, usually on a quarterly basis. These 
values are determined by a survey of vehicle selling prices by make and model year in each geographic area. The values are 
based on normal travel, so lower or higher odometer readings will be reflected as higher or lower remaining vehicle values, 
respectively. The depreciation costs in this report represent the projected decline in real value over time, obtained from such 
reports and adjusted to exclude the effect of inflation and the difference between prices charged by dealers and those obtainable 
by individuals when they sell their vehicle.</p>
<p>Depreciation is the single greatest cost of owning and operating most passenger vehicles; however, the cost of insurance, gas and 
maintenance are also significant. In the majority of cases, the age of the vehicle is the most important factor in determining resale 
or trade-in value. Other influences are mileage, brand popularity, body style, size, color, and the state of the used-vehicle market.</p>
<p>Typically, between 25 and 45 percent of all depreciation occurs in the first year of ownership. Much of this occurs as soon as the 
vehicle is purchased (an individual cannot get as much for a car as a dealer can), and there is additional depreciation when the 
next year's models become available. Purchasers of used vehicles also will encounter significant depreciation during their first 
year of ownership. The tables represent the case in which a vehicle is owned by the same family for all twelve years, so the extra 
depreciation that occurs in the first year of ownership of a used vehicle is not shown. For new cars, the percentage of 
depreciation occurring in the first year is highest for compact pickups and subcompact automobiles and lowest for minivans.</p>
<p>Depreciation rates drop sharply in the second year (to 7-10 percent of the purchase price) and much more gradually after that. 
Since vehicles generally are driven less as they age, depreciation cost declines more slowly when it is expressed on a per-mile 
basis than as an annual cost. For a$13,715 intermediate-sized car, depreciation in the first year is about $4,350. or 33.7 cents 
per mile; while in the second year it is about $1,270, or 10.1 cents per mile, and in the 12th year it is $430, or 5.3 cents per mile. 
If the car is kept for 12 years, overall depreciation averages 10.7 cents per mile.</p>
<p>2. Finance Charges are based on a typical interest rate of 10.5 percent, a 4-year financing term and a 25 percent down payment. 
However, since a number of options are available, methods are provided so that readers can approximate their own costs with 
relative ease. Most vehicle buyers either pay interest on money they borrow to buy their vehicles, or they forego interest they 
would have earned if they elect to use savings or other investments to pay for the vehicles outright.</p>
<p>Lending institutions and vehicle dealerships have various financing plans available. Institutions may differ as to the portion of the 
vehicle cost they are willing to finance, the rate of interest charged, the length of the loan term. These conditions may depend 
upon whether the vehicle is new or old. Dealers are sometimes willing to provide financing at below market interest rates, but 
recipients of such subsidized loans actually pay for them by foregoing a cash payment from the dealer or otherwise paying a 
higher purchase price for their vehicle.</p>
<p>A more careful examination shows that some costs occur whether or not the vehicle is driven (ownership costs), while others are 
directly related to the amount of travel (operating costs).</p>
<p>Interest charged should be considered in the cost of owning a vehicle. The lender will provide the total interest charges, which 
may be divided by the accumulated miles of travel for the length of the loan. For a 4-year loan, total interest charges would be 
divided by 49,700 miles. The computation will give the cost-per-mile figure that should be added to each of the 4-year totals 
shown in the tables.</p>
<p>The computation of interest lost on savings is more difficult. The cash payment for the purchase of a vehicle, the type of savings 
plan, the current rate of interest, and the period of time for monthly deposits to equal the cash payment, will vary greatly among 
purchasers. Savings institutions will provide the amount of interest that could be earned by the deposit of an amount equal to the 
cash payment for the selected period of time and the amount of interest that can be earned if equal monthly amounts are paid into 
the savings account for the same period. The difference between these two interest amounts is the interest lost by paying cash for 
the purchase of a vehicle.</p>
<p>Alternative methods of financing a new vehicle purchase can make important cost difference; and merits of different plans should 
be weighed carefully before a particular plan is selected.</p>
<p>If $12.000 is needed to purchase a vehicle and four years (48 months) is selected as the period of time needed to save this 
amount, the monthly payment into savings would be $250 ($12,000 divided by 48). The difference in interest earned by these 
payments and the interest earned on $12,000 on deposit for four years is the interest lost by paying cash. At five percent interest 
compounded quarterly, $12,000 on deposit for four years would earn $2,638 in interest. This would be lost if the money were 
withdrawn from savings to pay cash for a car. To replace the $12,000 in savings over four years, the purchaser would have to 
deposit $250 at the end of each month. These deposits would earn $1,248 in interest. The difference between these two interest 
amounts ($2,638 - $1,248 = $1,390) would be the interest cost of paying for the automobile purchase from savings.</p>
<p>Alternative methods of financing a new vehicle purchase can make important cost differences; and merits of different plans should 
be weighed carefully before a particular plan is selected. Table 10 shows the cost per thousand dollars for financing a vehicle 
purchase through a loan and financing through a savings withdrawal at various interest rates.</p>
<p>3. Insurance Costs are determined by vehicle type, the amount and type of coverage selected, the purpose for which the vehicle 
is used, the operator's driving record, and the location in which it is garaged. Insurance rates may also be affected by unusually 
high or low annual mileage driven.</p>
<p>Automobiles are continuously exposed to the possibility of damage, whether on the highway or parked. The large number of 
vehicles on the roads and streets and in parking lots make each vehicle susceptible to accident involvement. The cost of repairing 
even minor damage has continued to increase and is reflected in the insurance rates. For comparable coverages, the insurance 
rates used for automobiles in this study average about 50 percent more than they did in 1984 (though the rates for full-sized vans 
are almost unchanged).</p>
<p>The insurance coverage in this study for all vehicles except full-sized vans includes $20,000/$40,000 bodily injury, $10,000 
property damage, $2,500 personal injury protection, and $20,000/$40,000/$10,000 uninsured motorist coverage. This 
coverage is the minimum required by law in the State of Maryland and according to State officials is the most common coverage 
purchased. For full-sized vans, the insurance coverage includes $300,000 single limit liability, $2,500 personal injury protection, 
and $50,000 uninsured motorist coverage. The higher coverage for full-sized vans reflects an assumption that they will be used 
primarily for van-pool commuting. Coverage reflects the cost for a policy where the driver has no moving violations or accidents 
in the last 3 years, no youthful drivers are covered and there is no multi-vehicle discount. Coverage for all vehicles also includes 
$100 deductible comprehensive coverage and $250 deductible collision coverage. Collision coverage is assumed to be dropped 
after the first 5 years. The deductibles are higher than those used in 1984, reflecting the effects of inflation and a trend to 
controlling premiums by increasing deductibles. There is a considerable saving to the insurance company when a large number of 
small claims do not have to be processed. The saving is passed on to the insured in lower rates.</p>
<p>All coverages with the exception of collision are assumed to remain in effect for the full 12-year period covered. Some owners of 
older vehicles do not obtain comprehensive or collision coverage, either because they choose to self-insure or because their 
insurance company does not offer these coverages on older vehicles.</p>
<p>4. Registration, Title and Inspection Fees are fees collected by the State and some local subdivisions in which the vehicle is 
registered. All States charge a fee for registration, and some charge an additional fee for obtaining title to a vehicle when it is first 
purchased (whether new or old). Also, some States charge fees for emissions or safety inspections performed by a State agency 
or a State contractor. The fees shown in Tables 2 through 9 consist of an annual registration fee varying with vehicle weight, a 
biennial $8.50 emissions inspection fee, and a $12 titling fee applied when the vehicle changes ownership (assumed to occur only 
in Year 1).</p>
<p>5. Vehicle Taxes consist of sales taxes and personal property taxes levied on the value of the vehicle by some States and local 
subdivisions as well as the Federal &quot;gasguzzler&quot; tax and the Federal luxury tax levied on the portion of a new-car sales price that 
exceeds $30,000. Tables 2 through 9 show the effect of a five percent &quot;excise titling tax&quot; applied when the vehicle changes 
ownership (assumed to occur only in Year 1 ). None of the vehicles selected for this study are subject to either of the Federal 
taxes.</p>
<p>Operating Costs: Operating costs include scheduled maintenance and unscheduled repairs and maintenance, fuel, oil, tires, 
parking, tolls, and the taxes applied to these items. The majority of each of these costs are a function of vehicle usage. 1. 
Scheduled Maintenance includes the services shown in the owner's manual. Generally, the suggested maintenance intervals are 
expressed in miles driven or period of time owned. The services include maintenance of the cooling system, oil changes, safety 
checks, tuneups, and lubrication. When the owner's manual recommends that an item (e.g., brakes) be checked for wear, the 
cost of the labor to make such an inspection is considered scheduled maintenance. If a repair is found to be necessary, the cost 
of the replacement parts and the labor to install them are included in nonscheduled repairs.</p>
<p>2. Unscheduled Repairs and Maintenance shown in this report were estimated by taking data on total costs for repairs and 
maintenance (from the 1989 Consumer Expenditure Survey), adjusting for differences across vehicle classes, and subtracting the 
cost of scheduled repairs and maintenance. The estimated costs exclude the cost of any repairs that are done by a dealer when a 
vehicle is traded but that would have to be performed by the owner if the vehicle is kept for the full 12 years.</p>
<p>About 65 percent of repair and maintenance costs are for labor and 35 percent are for parts. A Baltimore, Maryland labor rate 
of $48.67 per hour was used. Both the labor rate and the prices for parts include markups that cover the cost of buildings, 
equipment, supervision and other costs of doing business. Actual labor costs for maintenance and repairs vary widely. This factor 
should be taken into account in using the results of the study.</p>
<p>Many dealers offer an optional extended warranty, usually 5 years/50,000 miles, which, if chosen by the vehicle purchaser, 
would have a bearing on costs for major unscheduled repairs. The optional extended warranty is not included in this study.</p>
<p>Some owners of older vehicles do not obtain comprehensive or collision coverage, either because they choose to self- insure or 
because their insurance company does not offer these coverages on older vehicles.</p>
<p>Some maintenance jobs, such as replacement of radiator hoses or fan belts, are relatively easy and present the vehicle owner an 
opportunity to save by performing them himself/herself. Many vehicle owners, however, opt to pay professional mechanics for 
these services. 3. Fuel is a major cost item for vehicles of all sizes. For the gasoline-engine vehicles used in this study, the 
difference in fuel costs between the 1991 full-sized car and the subcompact over the lives of the vehicles is $2,690 (including 
taxes). As shown in Tables 2 and 5 respectively, over the first 3 years, gasoline will cost $791 more for the full-sized car than for 
the subcompact. This comparison is more meaningful when considering the full-sized car provides only about 35 percent more 
interior space for the nearly 50 percent higher fuel cost.</p>
<p>A cost of $1.196 per gallon, including State and Federal taxes, for unleaded regular gasoline was used for this study. This 
represents an 80/20 mix of self-service and full-service prices for the study area (in line with the average mix of self-service and 
full-service purchases). Full-service costs in the Baltimore area are about 28 cents per gallon higher than the price used in this 
study and self-service costs are about 7 cents per gallon lower (though the difference averages only about 22 cents per gallon 
nationally).</p>
<p>Fuel is a major cost item for vehicle of all sizes. For the gasoline-engine vehicle used in this study, the difference in fuel costs 
between the 1991 fullsized car and the subcompact over the lives of the vehicles is $2,690 (including taxes).</p>
<p>The gasoline costs shown in Tables 2 through 9 can be adjusted to reflect changes in the price of gasoline. For each one cent 
increase in the cost of a gallon of gasoline, the total cost per mile for the full-sized car would increase 0.0558 cents. This is 
computed by dividing the total cost per mile of gasoline (4.85 cents) plus State and Federal taxes (1.03 cents and 0.79 cents) by 
$1.196, the cost per gallon used in this study. Table 11 show the gasoline cost per mile for each class of vehicles for a selected 
range of gasoline prices.</p>
<p>4. Oil Costs for a new or relatively new vehicle are mainly dependent on the car manufacturer's instructions for oil changes, 
because little, if any, oil is burned by these vehicles. The oil change interval is 7,500 miles for all five study vehicles. The 
subcompact cars and compact pickups have an average 4.7 quart capacity, the full-sized pickups and full-sized vans have an 
average 5.5 quart capacity, and all other vehicles have a 5-quart capacity.</p>
<p>5. Tires receive 514,000 miles of wear when an automobile is driven 128,500 miles. All vehicles have radial fires and all 
replacement tires are assumed to be radial. The number of replacement tires is based on a life expectancy of 40,000 miles for 
radial tires. Tables 2 through 9 presume that tires are replaced in Years 4, 7 and 12 (i.e., at odometer readings of 40,000, 
80,000 and 120,000) causing small spikes in the operating cost figures for those three years. In practice, the timing of these three 
spikes will depend upon the tire-replacement schedule actually followed, rather than the one assumed in this study.</p>
<p>6. Parking and Tolls include metered curb parking, fees charged in parking lots, and toll charges for using private or public 
highways, tunnels, and bridges.</p>
<p>7. Taxes on fuel and oil are the primary component of operating cost taxes. These taxes are paid on a per-gallon basis. The 
Federal gasoline tax is 14.1 cents per gallon. The Maryland gasoline tax is 18.5 cents.</p>
<h4>Adjustment of Costs to Other Vehicles and Localities</h4>
<p>In this study, all vehicles use regular unleaded gasoline at a cost, in suburban Baltimore, of $1.196 per gallon, including taxes. If 
the cost in another area is $1.10, persons living there can estimate their own operating costs by adjusting the gasoline cost figure 
to reflect the lower price. Procedures for accomplishing this are described in the section titled Fuel. Similar adjustments can be 
made for other cost items. The costs most likely to change in the short run and to need adjustment for specific geographic 
locations are fuel prices, insurance premiums, taxes and fees, repair labor rate, tolls, and parking charges. Also, the market value 
of vehicles can differ somewhat among regions.</p>
<p>In general, rural costs are lower than suburban or urban costs. This is evident in insurance premiums, primarily because vehicles 
in rural areas are exposed to less traffic and fewer opportunities for accidents. Retail costs and labor rates are also usually lower 
in rural areas. Operating costs (fuel, oil, tires, repairs, etc.) per mile for vehicles in rural operation also tend to be lower than for 
comparable vehicles in suburban use because there are fewer traffic control devices and less congestion on rural roads.</p>
<p>The worksheet included at the back of this report has been prepared as a guide so that costs for the first year of a vehicle's life 
can be developed for specific vehicles and for other localities.</p>
<p>If current per mile costs for an older vehicle are desired, the appropriate column of Tables 2 through 9 to use is the first one that 
shows a cumulative mileage that is at least equal to the mileage currently on the vehicle's odometer. (If costs over the next year 
are desired, an additional allowance should be made for miles expected to be driven over the next six months.) This column can 
be used to identify cost factors for everything except depreciation. Since depreciation is dependent on both car age and mileage, 
local used car prices or &quot;book&quot; values can be used. The figures shown for fuel and scheduled maintenance may also be slightly 
low for a vehicle built several years ago, since these figures are for vehicles with 1991 technology.</p>
<p>It should be noted that a family's annual auto usage does not usually match the mileage distribution in the tables. As mentioned 
before. a family would drive approximately the same number of miles each year. while the tables show a decreasing annual 
mileage pattern. This is because the mileages used in constructing Tables 2 through 9 represent averages for annual miles of all 
new vehicles, all one-year-old vehicles, all two-year-old vehicles, etc. Each of these averages represents a mix of vehicles that 
may have been purchased new and used and may serve as first vehicles, second vehicles, third vehicles, etc. If the family 
customarily drives 12,900 miles per year, at the end of three years its total mileage would be 38,700. Tables 2 through 9 show 
the accumulated mileage for Years 1-3 as 37,800. The total miles a car has been driven may not always be a good measure of 
its wear or condition. A long highway trip produces less wear than the same number of miles driven around town in stop-and-go 
traffic.</p>
<p>The total vehicle cost per mile is lower for the high-mileage driver because depreciation in the early years of a vehicle's life is 
determined more by age than by miles and because some of the annual charges, such as insurance, do not increase in direct 
proportion to mileage. However, most insurance companies charge lower rates for pleasure and recreational uses of vehicles and 
higher rates for vehicles used directly for work or in relation to business, and many companies apply a surcharge for high-mileage 
drivers in both categories.</p>
<p>To some degree, the purpose for which a vehicle is used and the circumstances of its use will dictate the vehicle-cost pattern. For 
example, the high-mileage driver will find that tire replacements should be moved to earlier years than those shown in this study.</p>
<h4>Applications for Study Data</h4>
<p>Choosing Your Next Vehicle: Choice of an automobile--full-sized, intermediate, compact, or subcompact--is based on more 
than the consideration of cost. For the motorist who needs the space provided by the full-sized car because of a large family, 
car-pool needs, or equipment to be carried, the economic and size advantages of smaller cars must be foregone. If space needs 
are not compelling, cost considerations may lead the motorist to choose a smaller car. Dollar depreciation, financing and fuel 
costs are substantially lower for subcompacts and compacts. Also, repair costs generally are lower for smaller cars, tires cost 
less, and, in some States, registration fees are lower. Non-cost advantages are maneuverability in city traffic and ease of curb 
parking. The advantages of larger cars in capacity, comfort, safety and possibly status can be compared to the dollar costs 
incurred to obtain these benefits.</p>
<p>To some degree, the purpose for which a vehicle is used and the circumstances of its use will dictate the vehicle-cost pattern.</p>
<p>When To Trade In: There is no set answer to the question of when to trade in or to sell a vehicle. Monetary considerations are 
only part of the answer. Vehicle style, size, mechanical features, dependability, as well as the availability of money. are also 
factors in the decisions regarding when and which vehicle to purchase. A vehicle owner can minimize the depreciation costs by 
keeping the vehicle longer. The &quot;annual trader&quot; drives a current model vehicle all the time, but depreciation for the 
intermediate-sized car will cost about $52,000 over a 12-year period (12 times the first year depreciation). A &quot;two year trader&quot; 
pays about $34,000 in depreciation. This is a saving of $18,000 from the &quot;annual trader's&quot; costs, and even more can be saved by 
becoming a &quot;three-year trader.&quot; Of course, consideration must be given to the outlays for necessary repairs and replacement tires 
when the vehicle is kept longer.</p>
<p>Once the vehicle-use pattern is determined, the owner may be able to relate costs to those shown in this report and to decide 
when it will be most advantageous to trade vehicles. Of course, comfort, dependability, and appearance are important to most 
vehicle owners, and these weigh heavily in the purchasing decision.</p>
<p>Ridesharing is another effective way to reduce automobile expenses . . . The cost for an intermediate car operator by a single 
driver is 33.25 cents per passenger mile compared to a cost of 8.31 cents per passenger mile for the same car with 4 occupants.</p>
<p>Business Use Of Vehicles: This study is not intended to establish the basis for determining an appropriate reimbursement for 
costs associated with use of an employee's personal vehicle for business purposes. The results of the study may be useful as a 
general guide for determining reimbursement rates; however, many factors, such as higher annual mileage and special 
requirements pertaining to purchase or upkeep of the vehicle related to use for business purposes should also be taken into 
account. Information concerning reimbursement for private vehicle use can be obtained from business travel advisory services 
that have made studies of costs for specific vehicles and groups of vehicles under various conditions of use.</p>
<h4>Opportunities for Cost Savings</h4>
<p>Vehicle costs can be minimized by selecting the smallest, most economical and fuel-efficient vehicle consistent with a family's 
needs and by avoiding unnecessary use.</p>
<p>During the first year of operation, intermediate-sized cars have daily owning and operating costs of $21.35. The portion 
attributable gasoline costs, including taxes, amounts to $2.14.</p>
<p>Throughout the 12-year life of these vehicles, fuel and oil costs, including taxes, would account for about 16 percent of the total 
cost for subcompact cars, about 18 to 20 percent of total costs for other cars, compact pickups, and minivans, and 24 or 25 
percent for full-sized pickups and full-sized vans. These figures indicate that substantial savings can be achieved by conserving 
fuel. This can be accomplished through more efficient driving habits, careful planning to eliminate or combine trips, proper vehicle 
maintenance, and ridesharing. Fuel efficiency should also be considered when selecting a new vehicle both in determining the size 
of vehicle and the particular model within a size class.</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Energy has published the &quot;1992 Gasoline Mileage Guide&quot; containing the Environmental Protection 
Agency's fuel economy estimates. Consumer Reports also publishes fuel-efficiency estimates for individual vehicles as well as a 
qualitative information on relative costs for depreciation and for repair and maintenance.</p>
<p>Ridesharing is another effective way to reduce automobile expenses. Most people find that work trips are the most convenient 
for ridesharing. For example, if an auto is principally used for the work trip, and the individual rideshares with another and uses 
that auto 50 percent of the time, mileage and depreciation will likewise be reduced. According to the data generated for this 
study, the cost for an intermediate car operated by a single driver is 33.25 cents per passenger mile compared to a cost of 8.31 
cents per passenger mile for the same car with 4 occupants. For a 9 person van-pool the cost drops even further to 4.95 cents 
per passenger mile. In addition, use of &quot;High Occupancy Vehicle&quot; lanes not only speed the work trip but reduce depreciation on 
an automobile, by avoiding daily &quot;stop and go&quot; travel on congested highways. Data from the Federal Highway Administration's 
1990 Nationwide Personal Transportation Survey show that travel to work and back comprises 32.8 percent of all personal 
driving, providing the opportunity for substantial cost savings by ridesharing.</p>

<h3>Facts for Consumers from the Federal Trade Commission</h3>
<h2>Truth in Leasing -- February 1992</h2>
<p>Are you wondering whether leasing your next car would be a good idea?</p>
<p>OR</p>
<p>Would you rather lease than buy furniture for an apartment you'll use for only a year?</p>
<p>When leasing looks like a good option, there's a federal law that will help you shop for the best deal. The Consumer Leasing Act 
requires leasing companies to tell you the facts about the cost and terms of their contracts. You can use the information to 
compare one lease with another or to compare the cost of leasing with the cost of buying the same property. The law also limits 
any extra payment you may have to make at the end of a lease and regulates lease advertising. This brochure describes the 
Consumer Leasing Act and the regulation issued by the Federal Reserve Board to carry it out.</p>
<h4>What leases are covered?</h4>
<p>The law applies to personal property leased by an individual for a period of more than four months for personal, family, or 
household use. It covers long-term rentals of cars, furniture, appliances, and other personal property.</p>
<p>The law does not cover:</p>
<p>daily car rentals or month-to-month rentals that you can cancel without penalty at the end of the month;</p>
<p>leases for apartments or houses -- or furniture that comes with a rented apartment;</p>
<p>property leased to companies or to individuals for business use.</p>
<p>What about costs?</p>
<p>Before you agree to a lease, the law requires that you get a written statement of its costs, including:</p>
<p>the amount of any advance payment, such as a security deposit;</p>
<p>the number, the amount, and the dates your regular payments are due, as well as the total amount of those payments; and</p>
<p>the amount you must pay for license, registration and taxes, and for any other fees, such as maintenance.</p>
<h4>What about terms of the lease?</h4>
<p>You must also be told certain terms of the lease, including:</p>
<p>what kind of insurance you need;</p>
<p>any express warranty on the property;</p>
<p>who is responsible for maintaining and servicing the property, and any standards for wear and tear (which must be reasonable) 
set by the leasing company;</p>
<p>any penalty for default or late payment;</p>
<p>how you or the leasing company may cancel the lease and the charges for doing so; and</p>
<p>whether or not you can buy the property and, if you can, when and at what price.</p>
<h4>What are open end leases and balloon payments?</h4>
<p>One decision that will affect leasing costs and terms is whether you choose an &quot;open end&quot; (or &quot;finance&quot;) or &quot;closed end&quot; lease. In 
an open end lease, you run the risk of owing extra money depending on the value of the property when you return it. This 
payment is often called a &quot;balloon payment.&quot; For example, when you sign a three-year open end car lease, the leasing company 
may estimate that the car will be worth $4,000 after three years of normal use. If the car is worth only $3,300 when you return it, 
you may have to pay a $700 balloon payment.</p>
<p>In a closed end lease, you are not responsible for the value of the property when you return it and will not have to make a 
balloon payment. As a result, closed end leases usually have higher monthly payments than open end leases.</p>
<p>You should know that in an open end lease:</p>
<p>The leasing company must tell you that you may have a balloon payment and how it is calculated.</p>
<p>At the end of the lease you have the right to obtain an estimate of the property's worth from an independent appraiser. Both 
parties must abide by the estimate.</p>
<p>Limits on Balloon Payments. You should also know that the law limits a balloon payment in an open end lease to no more than 
three times the average monthly payment -- unless you agree to make a higher payment or you have used the property more than 
average (for example, if you put more than average mileage on a car). The leasing company may also seek a larger payment by 
going to court. If it goes to court, the company has the burden of proving that its original estimate of the value of the property, 
although wrong, was reasonable and made in good faith. The company must pay your attorney's fees in such a lawsuit, whether 
or not it wins.</p>
<h4>How do I shop for a lease?</h4>
<p>First, decide whether you want to buy with cash, buy on credit, or lease. When making your decision, be sure to take into 
account such expenses as the cost of insurance, maintenance, and special fees.</p>
<p>To help you compare the cost of buying on credit with the cost of open end leasing, you must be told the total amount you are 
responsible for under the lease, the value of the property at the beginning of the lease, and the difference between the two. For 
example, a three-year open end car lease might show:</p>
<p>36 monthly payments of $225 $ 8,100</p>
<p>+ Estimated value of car at end of lease 4,000</p>
<p>Amount you are responsible for under lease 12,100</p>
<p>- Value of car at beginning of lease 10,700</p>
<p>Difference $ 1,400</p>
<p>You could compare this &quot;difference&quot; of $1,400 with the finance charge you would pay if you bought the car on credit.</p>
<p>If you decide to lease, shop around for the best price and terms. Your overall costs will be lower if you bargain for the lowest 
lease price, just as you would to purchase the car for cash or credit. If you don't bargain, you won't get the lowest price, which 
affects other lease costs. Compare the costs and advantages of open end and closed end leases, and look at such options as 
whether the leasing company will pay for repairs and maintenance.</p>
<h4>What about advertising?</h4>
<p>The law also regulates the advertising of leases. If a leasing company advertises the amount or number of payments or that any or 
no downpayment is required, it must also mention several other important terms, including the total of regular payments, your 
responsibilities at the end of the lease, and whether or not you may purchase the property. This is to make sure you receive 
enough information from the advertisement to understand the offer and to compare it with others.</p>
<h4>What are the penalties?</h4>
<p>You as an individual may sue a leasing company if it fails to give you the required information or does so improperly. You may 
sue for 25 percent of the total of the monthly payments (but not less than $100 or more than $1000) plus any actual damages. If 
an advertisement violates the law, you may sue the leasing company for your actual damages. In any successful lawsuit, you are 
also entitled to court costs and reasonable attorney's fees. You must file your suit within one year of the termination of the lease 
agreement. The law also provides criminal penalties for intentional violators.</p>
<h4>For More Information</h4>
<p>A number of Federal agencies are responsible for enforcing the Consumer Leasing Act. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) 
enforces the law for almost all leasing companies other than banks. Questions or complaints can be sent to the nearest FTC

<h3>Facts for Consumers from the Federal Trade Commission</h3>
<h2>Vehicle Repossession -- December 1993</h2>
<p>When you buy a car, truck, or other vehicle on credit, you should be aware that, until you have made the last payment, your 
creditor retains important rights in the vehicle. These rights are established by the contract you signed and by the law of your 
state. Your failure to make timely payments on the vehicle carries serious consequences. Your creditor will then have the right to 
&quot;repossess&quot; - take back - your car without going to court or, in many states, without warning you in advance.</p>
<p>However, your creditor's right to repossess your car is subject to some limitations. In particular, state law places limits on how 
your creditor may repossess the vehicle and resell it to reduce or eliminate your debt. If any rules are violated, your creditor may 
lose other rights against you, or even be required to pay you damages. For further information about the rights discussed 
generally below, and about your state's specific repossession requirements, contact your state consumer protection agency or 
your private attorney.</p>
<h4>Seizing the Car</h4>
<p>Normally, your creditor has legal authority to seize your vehicle as soon as you &quot;default&quot; on your loan. What constitutes default 
will be stated in your contract, but failure to make a payment on time would certainly be an example.</p>
<p>However, if your creditor has agreed to accept your late payments or to change your payment date, the terms of your original 
contract may no longer apply. Such a change in your credit contract may be made orally, in writing, or, sometimes, simply by 
your creditor's repeated acceptance of late payments without complaint.</p>
<p>Once you are in default, the laws of most states permit the creditor to repossess your car at any hour of the day or night, without 
prior notice, and to come onto your property to do so. However, when seizing the vehicle, your creditor may not commit a 
&quot;breach of the peace&quot; by, for example, using physical force or threats of force. Taking your car over your protest or removing it 
from a closed garage without your permission also may constitute a breach of the peace, depending on the law in your state.</p>
<p>Should there be a breach of the peace in seizing your car, your creditor may be required to pay a penalty or, if any harm is done 
to you or your property, to compensate you. Also, because of a breach of peace, your creditor may lose the right to collect a 
&quot;deficiency judgment.&quot; A deficiency judgment is the difference between what you owe on your loan and what your creditor 
receives when reselling your vehicle. A private attorney or your local legal aid society can give you guidance about how your 
state courts have dealt with these matters.</p>
<h4>Reselling the Car</h4>
<p>Once your car has been repossessed, your creditor may decide to keep the car as compensation for your debt or to resell it in 
either a public or private sale. In any case, generally your creditor must notify you about what will happen to the car. Under most 
state laws, your creditor must tell you if it wants to keep the car because you have the right to demand that the car be sold 
instead. You may want to exercise this right if the car is worth more than what you owe on it. Most creditors prefer to sell the 
car, however, rather than keep it. If your creditor chooses to resell the car at public auction, state law usually requires you to be 
notified of the date so that, if you wish, you can attend and participate in the bidding. If the vehicle is to be sold privately, you are 
usually entitled to a notice of the date after which it will be sold.</p>
<p>In any of these circumstances, you may be entitled to &quot;redeem&quot; or buy back the vehicle by paying the full amount owed on it, plus 
the expenses connected with its repossession, such as storage and preparation for sale. Some states have consumer protection 
laws that also allow you to &quot;reinstate&quot; your loan. This means that you can reclaim your car by paying the amount you are behind 
on your loan together with your creditor's repossession expenses. Check with your state consumer protection office to learn 
what the laws are in your state.</p>
<p>Any resale of a repossessed car must be conducted in a &quot;commercially reasonable manner.&quot; This does not mean that your 
creditor must get the highest possible price (or even a good price) for the vehicle. A resale price that is below fair market value, 
however, may indicate that the sale was not commercially reasonable. A sale made according to standard custom in a particular 
business or in an established market will be considered commercially reasonable in almost all cases. Failure to resell your car in a 
commercially reasonable manner may give you either a claim against your creditor for damages or a defense against a deficiency 
judgment. (For an explanation, see the next section.)</p>
<p>Whatever method is used to dispose of a repossessed car, a creditor may not keep or sell any personal property found inside. 
(This does not include most improvements made to the car itself, such as the addition of a stereo player or luggage rack.) Your 
creditor also may be required to use reasonable care to prevent others from removing your property from the repossessed car. If 
you find that your creditor cannot account for valuable articles left in your car, you may wish to speak with an attorney about 
your right to compensation.</p>
<h4>Paying the Deficiency</h4>
<p>Any difference between what you owe on your loan and what your creditor gets for reselling the vehicle is a &quot;deficiency.&quot; For 
example, if you owed $2,500 on the car and your creditor sells it for $1,500, the deficiency is $1,000. In most states, a creditor 
who has followed the proper procedures for repossession and sale is allowed to sue you for a &quot;deficiency judgment&quot; to collect 
the loan balance. Several states, however, have consumer protection laws that restrict creditors from suing for a deficiency when 
vehicles or other similar consumer goods are involved. Your state consumer protection agency will be able to tell you whether 
this is true in the state where you live.</p>
<p>If you are sued for a deficiency judgment, you will be notified about the date of the court hearing. It may be important for you to 
appear at this hearing, because it may be your only opportunity to use any legal defenses you may have. If your creditor 
breached the peace when seizing the vehicle or failed to resell the car in a commercially reasonable manner, these may be 
defenses against a deficiency judgment. An attorney will be able to tell you whether you have grounds to contest a deficiency 
judgment.</p>
<h4>Talking with Your Creditor</h4>
<p>Because it is difficult to dispute a repossession once it has occurred, you should contact your creditor when you first realize you 
will be late with a payment. Many creditors will agree to a delay, if they believe you will be able to pay later.</p>
<p>Sometimes it may be possible to negotiate with your creditor to improve your position. If you do reach an agreement to modify 
your original contract, be sure it is in writing so that it cannot be questioned later. You may wish to hire an attorney or contact 
your local attorney referral service for low-cost legal help.</p>
<p>However, your creditor may refuse to accept late payments and may demand that you return the car. By agreeing to a &quot;voluntary 
repossession,&quot; you may reduce your creditor's expenses in retaking the car, which you otherwise would be responsible for 
paying. But remember, even if you return the car voluntarily, you still are responsible for paying any deficiency on your loan, and 
your creditor still may enter the repossession on your credit report.</p>
<p>If you need help in dealing with your debts, you may want to contact a Consumer Credit Counseling Service (CCCS). This is a 
non-profit organization with more than 850 offices located in 50 states. CCCS counselors will try to arrange a repayment plan 
that is acceptable to you and your creditors. They also will help you set up a realistic budget and plan future expenses. These 
services are offered at little or no charge to you. You can find the CCCS office nearest you by checking the white pages of your 
local telephone directory or by contacting:</p>
<p>National Foundation for Consumer Credit, Inc. 8611 Second Avenue, Suite 100 Silver Spring, Maryland 20910 (301) 
589-5600 1(800) 388-2227</p>
<h4>Where to Find More Information</h4>
<p>The Federal Trade Commission does not resolve individual problems between lenders and borrowers, but it can act against a 
creditor if it sees a pattern of possible federal law violations. If you have a complaint that may involve a violation of consumer 
protection law administered by the Commission, write to:</p>

<h3>Facts for Consumers from the Federal Trade Commission</h3>
<h2>VW Mediation/Arbitration Program -- July 1994</h2>
<p>Under the terms of a 1988 Federal Trade Commission order, Volkswagen of America (VWoA) has established a 
mediation/arbitration program for all owners and lessees of VWoA or Audi cars and light trucks with engine problems. Through 
this informal program, operated by the Better Business Bureau (BBB), you may seek one of the following settlements: a refund 
for the money you spent on repairs; repairs to be made by VWoA at no charge to you; or a VWoA buy-back of your car.</p>
<p>To participate, you must contact the nearest BBB or VWoA and request an arbitration package that includes, among other 
things, a settlement request form, which you must complete and return. The BBB toll-free number is 1-800-955-5100. You can 
contact VWoA by writing:</p>
<p>Volkswagen of America, Inc., Customer Services Department, 888 West Big Beaver, P.O. Box 3951 Troy, MI 48007-3951 
or by calling: #1-800-822-8987 (VWoA owners) #1-800-822-2834 (Audi owners)</p>
<p>This arbitration program covers two categories of problems -- specified claims and internal engine component claims. Specified 
claims can be filed by owners or lessees who experienced oil consumption-related problems in water-cooled gasoline engine 
Volkswagen and Audi vehicles from model years 1974 through 1979. If you have had such oil consumption problems, you need 
not still own or lease the car to be eligible to participate in the program.</p>
<p>Internal engine component claims involve all other engine problems. All owners or lessees who experienced internal engine 
component problems with any Volkswagen or Audi vehicle, regardless of the model year and engine type, can file claims. 
However, you still must own or lease your car to be eligible.</p>
<h4>Mediation</h4>
<p>The arbitration program, which is offered to you at no charge, has two phases: mediation and arbitration. First, the BBB will try 
to mediate a settlement between you and VWoA without having an arbitration hearing. For example, BBB staff may ask you to 
talk to the dealer one more time. Or they may suggest that you contact your VWoA regional office about your problem. 
Sometimes, the BBB talks to each party and tries to arrange a settlement. This mediation process may result in VWoA making 
an offer that satisfies you.</p>
<p>If you accept the VWoA offer, you give up your right to arbitrate this particular problem (unless the problem happens again, of 
course). If you are not satisfied with the VWoA offer, you have the right to an arbitration hearing. Make sure you notify the BBB 
if you want to have a hearing. Keep a record of the date you contacted the office.</p>
<h4>Arbitration</h4>
<p>Arbitration is the next step when mediation fails. It differs from mediation in that the parties do not settle the problem between 
themselves. They present their claims to an impartial third party called the arbitrator, who is the decision maker. Arbitration is 
informal; you do not need a lawyer and there are no complicated legal rules. The arbitrator listens to both sides, asks questions, 
and ultimately makes a decision that he or she believes is fair. The arbitrator may decide for or against your claim. You do not 
have to accept the arbitrator's decision (see page 7). However, VWoA must accept the arbitrator's decision as final if it's 
accepted by you. If you decide to arbitrate, your local BBB will give you further explanations about the program's rules.</p>
<h4>The Award Request</h4>
<p>On your arbitration form, you will be asked to state exactly what you want to receive from VWoA through the arbitration 
process. If you already have had your car repaired, you may wish to ask for the amount of your bill. If your car has not been 
repaired, you may wish to ask the arbitrator to order VWoA to make the repairs at no charge to you. Or, if your case justifies it, 
you might ask for a combination of these. You are eligible to file a claim and have an arbitration hearing regardless of your 
vehicle's age or mileage. However, age and mileage are factors that can be taken into consideration by the arbitrator in arriving at 
a decision.</p>
<p>In an extraordinary case -- for example, if the dealer has been unable to fix serious problems with the car after several tries -- 
you may wish to ask the arbitrator to order VWoA to buy back the car. In this case, VWoA may ask the arbitrator to deduct an 
amount from the cost of the car for mileage or use. The arbitrator does not have to make any deduction from the award, but may 
do so based on individual circumstances. The arbitrator cannot give you more than you have asked for on the award request.</p>
<h4>The Arbitrator</h4>
<p>Arbitrators are community volunteers whom the BBB has recruited and trained. VWoA does not take part in selecting an 
arbitrator. An arbitrator is never paid, except for occasional travel expenses.</p>
<p>If you live far from the BBB office, the staff will try to arrange a hearing location closer to your home. Once the arbitrator is 
appointed, the BBB will set a date for the hearing.</p>
<h4>The Arbitration Hearing</h4>
<p>The arbitration hearing is an informal proceeding where you have an opportunity to tell your story. You can present any 
documents and witnesses you want. Essentially, you have to convince the arbitrator that what you are asking is fair.</p>
<p>VWoA will have the same opportunity. If necessary, the arbitrator may decide to ask the BBB to supply and pay for an expert, 
or you can bring, at your expense, your own expert -- for example, the mechanic who worked on your car. You do not need a 
lawyer.</p>
<h4>Preparing for an Arbitration Hearing</h4>
<p>A key factor in the outcome of arbitration is preparation. If you are well-organized, your case will be easier for the arbitrator to 
understand.</p>
<p>Documents, such as receipts for car maintenance and repair, are usually the best type of information to present at the hearing. 
But letters from anyone who is familiar with the details, such as the mechanic who repaired the car, are good substitutes. At the 
hearing, of course, you or others can tell the arbitrator about any relevant details, even if you do not have documents.</p>
<p>Repair Information. You should list all of the details about the car and each problem for which you are seeking a refund or repair:</p>
<p>the identification of the car by VIN (Vehicle Identification Number)</p>
<p>the make, model, and year</p>
<p>the mileage on the car</p>
<p>the date(s) of any repair(s) and the mileage at which any repair(s) were made</p>
<p>the car part(s) that were repaired</p>
<p>the cost(s) of any repair(s)</p>
<p>if repairs were paid, some indication that you (rather than someone else) paid the bill(s).</p>
<p>As suggested above, a receipt often can show much of the necessary information. If you no longer have a receipt, you can ask 
your mechanic for a copy of the repair record or ask the repair mechanic to come to your hearing or write a letter. In reporting 
information, the mechanic should include:</p>
<p>what was wrong with the car</p>
<p>what caused the failure and</p>
<p>if you have properly maintained your car.</p>
<p>If the repair work has not yet been done, an estimate or work order providing such information would be important.</p>
<p>If you no longer own the vehicle but are arbitrating an oil consumption-related problem covered by the specified claims program, 
you should have proof of past ownership for your arbitration hearing, such as a copy of the title, registration, an insurance policy, 
a purchase contract, or financing documents. The repair receipt itself may show ownership, as well as the necessary repair 
information.</p>
<h4>Maintenance and Driving Habits</h4>
<p>VWoA may argue at the hearing that your problem was caused by poor maintenance or improper driving habits. If you can show 
that you followed the recommended maintenance schedule and that you avoided driving practices the owner's manual cautions 
against, you have a better chance of winning. For example, if the problem involves an internal engine part such as a camshaft, it 
would be helpful to show that you changed the engine oil at the recommended intervals for the type of driving you do and that 
you used the type of oil recommended in the owner's manual. To demonstrate maintenance, written records -- such as receipts, 
door stickers, or personal notes -- usually are the best. On the other hand, to show proper driving practices, your statements to 
the arbitrator may be the only evidence possible.</p>
<h4>Other Information</h4>
<p>Sometimes, showing the arbitrator that others have had similar car failures can help indicate that the problem was with the car 
rather than with your maintenance or driving habits. For example, your mechanic may know of similar failures; you may have 
seen (or be able to find) articles about similar problems in your local newspaper or in car magazines (check columns written by 
expert mechanics); and your state or city consumer protection offices may be aware of others with similar car problems or may 
have additional information.</p>
<p>Also, VWoA sends service bulletins about certain problems to its dealers. Although many service bulletins simply update the 
dealers about changes in part numbers, other bulletins may indicate that your car repair was a common problem. Therefore, if 
you can obtain a copy of an appropriate service bulletin and find a mechanic who will verify that the bulletin applies to your car 
problem, you might want to show it to the arbitrator.</p>
<p>For information about how to order some or all of the bulletins that may apply to your car, call 1-800-544-8021. You also may 
be able to look at copies of the bulletins at local VWoA dealers. If your complaint involves an oil consumption-related problem 
in a 1974 through 1979 water-cooled gasoline engine VW or Audi vehicle, when you receive your specified claims arbitration 
forms, you also will get &quot;background statements&quot; prepared by the FTC and VWoA. You can present these statements to the 
arbitrator. They may help the arbitrator reach a decision.</p>
<h4>The Arbitrator's Decision</h4>
<p>Usually a few days after the hearing, the arbitrator will write a decision, called an &quot;award.&quot; It is binding on VWoA, but not on 
you. You can accept or reject it. If you accept the award, VWoA must do what the arbitrator decides. For example, you might 
ask for $700 but only be awarded $500 by the arbitrator. You can accept the $500 award, which ends your claim, or you can 
reject the $500 award and pursue your case through other avenues, such as a small claims court.</p>

on the next page.</p>

<h3>Facts for Consumers from the Federal Trade Commission</h3>
<h2>Automatic Debit Scams -- October 1993</h2>
<p>Fraudulent telemarketers have found yet another way to steal your money, this time from your checking account. Consumers 
across the country are complaining about unauthorized debits (withdrawals) from their checking accounts.</p>
<p>While automatic debiting of your checking account can be a legitimate payment method (many people pay mortgages or make 
car payments this way), the system is being abused by some telemarketers. Therefore, if a caller asks for your checking account 
number or other information printed on your check, you should follow the same warning that applies to your credit card number 
-- do not give out checking account information over the phone unless you initiate the call or are familiar with the company. 
Remember, if you give your checking account number over the phone to an unknown person for &quot;verification&quot; or &quot;computer 
purposes,&quot; that person may use it to improperly take money from your checking account.</p>
<h4>How the Scam Works</h4>
<p>The new telemarketing scam usually works like this. You either get a postcard or a telephone call saying you have won a free 
prize or can qualify for a major credit card, regardless of past credit problems. If you respond to the offer, the telemarketer often 
asks you right away, &quot;Do you have a checking account?&quot; If you say &quot;yes,&quot; the telemarketer then goes on to explain the offer, 
making it sound too good to pass up.</p>
<p>Near the end of the sales pitch, the telemarketer may ask you to get one of your checks and to read off all of the numbers at the 
bottom. Sometimes you may not be told why this information is needed. Other times you may be told the account information will 
help ensure that you qualify for the offer. And, in some cases, the telemarketer may explain that this information will allow them to 
debit your checking account and ship the prize or process the fee for the credit card.</p>
<p>Once the telemarketer has your checking account information, it is put on a &quot;demand draft,&quot; which is processed much like a 
check. The draft has your name, account number, and states an amount. Unlike a check, however, the draft does not require 
your signature. When your bank receives the draft, it takes the amount on the draft from your checking account and pays the 
telemarketer's bank. You may not know that your bank has paid the draft until you receive your bank statement.</p>
<h4>What You Can Do to Protect Yourself</h4>
<p>Automatic debit scams involve a fraud that is hard to detect and could expose you to large financial losses. However, the 
following suggestions may help you avoid becoming a victim.</p>
<p>Do not give your checking account number over the phone in response to solicitations from people you do not know.</p>
<p>If anyone asks for your checking account number, ask them why they need this information.</p>
<p>Beware of offers that sound too good to be true, especially any offers that require your checking account number. Ask to review 
the company's offer in writing before you agree to a purchase.</p>
<h4>What to Do if You are a Victim</h4>
<p>If a telemarketer has issued a draft against your checking account without your knowledge or permission, or the amount is more 
than you authorized, contact your bank immediately. Depending on the timing and the circumstances, you may be able to get 
your money back. You also may want to contact your local consumer protection agency, state Attorney General and the Better 
Business Bureau to report the telemarketer.</p>
<p>You also may file a complaint with the FTC by writing to: Correspondence Branch, Federal Trade Commission, Washington, 
DC 20580. Although the FTC generally does not intervene in individual disputes, the information you provide may help to 
indicate a pattern of possible law violation requiring action by the Commission.</p>
<h4>For More Information</h4>
<p>The FTC has a series of Facts for Consumers that explain fraudulent sales practices that often take place over the phone. The 
brochures list precautions you can take to avoid becoming a victim. Titles include:</p>

<h2>DIRECT DEPOSIT: A Consumer's Guide</h2>
<p>Trust-nowhere is it more important than in a banking relationship. Trust is its mainstay, and electronic banking is no exception.</p>
<p>With this in mind, your neighborhood financial institution has joined with others to create a system that allows individuals to take 
advantage of technology that has been used by businesses for years-the electronic deposit and transfer of funds, commonly 
known as Direct Deposit.</p>
<p>Direct Deposit offers consumers a money-management tool that is reliable, simple and convenient. With this system, you delegate 
the task of depositing certain payments into a designated account at your local financial institution. Your money is then 
electronically deposited into that account on the day of payment and is available for your use that day.</p>
<p>What makes the system work is consistent, timely execution. Your financial institution takes great care in handling your account, 
and consumer safeguards exist to ensure accuracy. More than 30 million people trust their funds to Direct Deposit. To begin 
your Direct Deposit service, contact your financial institution.</p>
<h4>How does Direct Deposit work?</h4>
<p>The process is simple. The organization paying you notifies your financial institution electronically that a specified amount of 
money should be made available to you in an account you designate. Federal Reserve Banks and financial institutions process 
these electronic transactions through a national automated clearinghouse (ACH) system.</p>
<p>You will receive a payment stub from the organization paying you when your deposit is made. This stub is similar to a deposit slip 
in that it indicates the date and amount of money deposited into your account and may be used as proof of availability of funds. 
However, you will not receive a payment stub with federal recurring payments</p>
<p>With Direct Deposit, your funds are available for use the morning of the payment date. If you go to your bank and deposit your 
check in person, you might not have access to your funds until the next day or longer. In addition, the confidentiality of your 
payment is maintained when Direct Deposit is used because fewer people are involved in the process of depositing your money. 
Finally, there is no charge for Direct Deposit. </p>
<h4>What payments are best suited to Direct Deposit?</h4>
<p>Any ongoing, regularly scheduled payment is a good candidate for Direct Deposit. Many government payments qualify, and 
many employers offer it as an option for payroll checks. Listed below are just a few of the payments available through Direct 
Deposit:</p>
<h4>Company Payroll</h4>
<p>Dividend or Interest Federal Salary Social Security Civil Service Retirement Veterans Affairs Compensation Railroad Retirement </p>
<h4>How do I begin Direct Deposit?</h4>
<p>Inquire at your financial institution for information on beginning Direct Deposit. A member of the staff will be able to answer any 
questions you may have about Direct Deposit and will help you begin your service. In the case of company payroll payments, 
ask your personnel or payroll department for information.</p>
<h4>What happens if my deposit is not made for some reason?</h4>
<p>Direct Deposit is extremely reliable. Of more than 1 billion deposits made in 1992 by Direct Deposit, 99.9 percent were 
processed without a hitch. Of those deposits that did experience a problem, almost all were rectified within one day.</p>
<p>However, because every deposit is important to you, rules are in place to protect your funds and credit in case of an error. Your 
funds are safeguarded under the Federal Reserve Electronic Funds Transfer Act (Regulation E), as well as National Automated 
Clearing House Association (NACHA) guidelines.</p>
<p>Under these regulations and guidelines, your financial institution agrees to rectify any problem and make your funds available 
within one day once it has been established an error has occurred. Many financial institutions will also help customers resolve 
problems that result from a bank error, such as bounced checks, by notifying the business where the transaction occurred.</p>
<p>Your financial institution must investigate the error and quickly report the results to you. Once the investigation confirms an error 
did occur, your financial institution will rectify the situation immediately.</p>
<p>If the investigation indicates an error did not occur, the financial institution must deliver to you a written explanation of its findings 
within three days after concluding its investigation. You may also request copies of the documentation or information used in the 
investigation.</p>
<p>If the financial institution is unable to determine whether an error occurred, or if there is a dispute concerning the error, additional 
procedures exist to resolve the problem. For more information concerning these procedures, contact the Consumer Affairs 
Division at your Federal Reserve Bank.</p>
<h4>Can I use Direct Deposit to have money withdrawn from my account?</h4>
<p>In addition to receiving payments into your account through Direct Deposit, you can electronically withdraw money from your 
account to pay your bills. By authorizing a withdrawal for a specific amount at a predetermined date each month, you can pay 
your bills without having to write and mail checks. The automated bill payment method saves you time, saves you money on 
postage costs and ensures prompt payment of bills.</p>
<h4>Benefits of Direct Deposit</h4>
<dl>
<dt>Security </dt>
<dd>With Direct Deposit, you do not have to worry about lost or stolen payment checks. Your payment is automatically 
deposited safely into your account.</dd>
<dt>Convenience </dt>
<dd>You do not have to take the time to go to your financial institution to deposit your check. If you are out of town, your 
payment will be deposited into your account in your absence, allowing that money to immediately begin drawing whatever 
interest may apply. Many payments are sent through the mail, losing up to 10 days of interest. Direct Deposit eliminates 
the mailing period, so your payments begin drawing interest on the day of deposit.</dd>
<dt>Simplicity </dt>
<dd>Direct Deposit is easy to begin, and you may change your financial institution, change the account receiving the Direct 
Deposit or stop service by simply completing a form.</dd>
<dt>Flexibility </dt>
<dd>You may have your funds deposited into one of a variety of accounts, such as a money market account, a savings account 
or a checking account, depending on your needs.</dd>
<dt>Reliability </dt>
<dd>You can be assured your funds are deposited into your designated account on time, correctly and confidentially. 
Regulation E ensures proper handling of your account.</dd>

<h3>Comptroller of the Currency Administrator of National Banks November 1993</h3>
<h2>Deposits Investments There's a critical difference</h2>
<p>Maybe you've been thinking about putting some money into one of the investment products you can now get at your bank. You 
know that some of these new products currently earn higher interest than your certificate of deposit (CD). Who doesn't want to 
earn more money?</p>
<p>This brochure is about these new products that some banks are now selling. It tells you about deposits, which are insured by the 
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and investments, like mutual funds and annuities, which are not insured by the 
FDIC or guaranteed by the bank selling them. It tells you about the U.S. government's role when it comes to deposits and 
investments. It has basic information about some types of investment products and lists references where you can find out more. 
It offers some ideas about personal financial goals that might help you decide what's right for you. And it tells you what you can if 
you have problems.</p>
<h4>About Deposits and Investments</h4>
<p>A deposit is the money you put bank account in a checking need all your money right away--for example, you want to save 
some money for retirement--you may decide to put your money in a special kind of bank deposit called a certificate of deposit 
(CD). When you buy a CD from your bank, you agree to keep your money in the bank for a certain amount of time, generally 
six months to five years. The amount of interest the bank will pay on your CD often depends on how long you agree to keep 
your money at the bank. In most cases, the longer you keep your deposit at the bank, the higher the rate of interest you earn.</p>
<p>The bank must give you your deposit back when you ask for it. Even if you want to take your money out of a CD before it 
matures, you generally can withdraw your money if you are willing to pay a penalty. If something happens to the bank and it can't 
pay your deposits in the bank generally are insured by the U.S. government up to $100,000.</p>
<p>An investment product, like a mutual fund, is not a deposit. The bank is simply selling you a product. The bank generally receives 
a commission for performing this service, and may charge you other fees for administering your investment account, but it is not 
obligated to compensate you if the investment is not successful. If interest rates or market values change, you may lose income 
you have earned--you may even lose some of the amount you invested (your principal). The U.S. government does not insure 
you against such losses, even if you purchased the investment product at a bank. In other words, if you buy an investment 
product, there's no guarantee that you'll get all of your investment back. But--there may be a good chance that you'll earn more!</p>
<h4>The Role of the U.S. Government</h4>
<p>The U.S. government has strict rules and regulations to monitor the safety of your bank. These rules and regulations protect you 
from unsafe banking practices. They also allow the U.S. government to protect bank depositors if a bank fails. As a general rule, 
your deposits in a bank are insured up to $100,000.</p>
<p>The U.S. government plays a different role when it comes to investments. Investment products are not insured by the FDIC and 
can involve risks. The U.S. government has rules and regulations to make sure that the features of the investment product are 
clearly disclosed to you so that you can make an informed decision before you buy. It also monitors industry rules to be sure that 
sellers of investment products follow certain standards of conduct. These rules are meant to make sure that you are treated fairly 
and to ensure that the product that is recommended for you to buy is suitable for your personal investment needs.</p>
<p>The U.S. government also oversees the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC). This corporation protects customers 
of broker/dealers who are insured by SIPC against the physical loss of securities, including mutual funds, if the broker/dealer 
holding the securities for you fails. It does not protect investors against a decline in the market value of securities. SIPC insurance 
is not the same as federal deposit insurance provided by the FDIC.</p>
<h4>The Role of the U.S. Government</h4>
<p>Not all banks sell investment products. Of those that do, the most widely available are mutual funds and annuities.</p>
<p>When you invest in a mutual fund, your money is combined or pooled with the money of other investors and used to purchase 
specific types of securities. Mutual funds are run by investment professionals who decide which investments to buy or sell for the 
fund. The professional picks from a wide variety of stocks, bonds, money market instruments, or other financial instruments. The 
investments selected will depend on the fund's investment objectives. That's why it's so important for you to choose a fund with 
objectives compatible with yours.</p>
<p>Some mutual funds, such as money market mutual funds, are designed for individuals who want to invest for only a short time and 
have easy access to their money, sometimes by writing a check. Many of these funds invest primarily in government securities or 
very short-term bank CDs. Many people who don't want to take too much risk invest in this type of fund. Other funds invest in 
bonds sold by corporations or municipalities that pay regular dividends and carry higher interest rates. These funds can provide 
steady income but may be more risky. See the reference list at the back of this brochure if you want to know more about these 
and other types of mutual funds. The types of investments that a mutual fund holds, its investment goals, the fees charged, and 
information about who manages and advises the fund are described in a prospectus. You should receive and review a prospectus 
before investing.</p>
<p>The prospectus usually tells you how well the fund has performed in the past. This information can give you an idea about what 
you might earn on your investment. As with all investments, however, past performance is no guarantee of future result. All 
investments carry some risk, including loss of principal.</p>
<p>Banks use different arrangements to sell mutual funds. Some banks simply rent space in bank lobbies to outside companies. 
Other banks sell proprietary funds. These funds are sponsored by an outside entity. The bank then advises the fund about what 
investments to make. It receives a fee from the fund for that service. Other banks offer private label funds. These funds are 
sponsored and managed by an outside entity but are sold exclusively through the bank.</p>
<p>Some mutual funds have names similar to a bank's name. But just like other mutual funds or investment products, those funds are 
not backed by the bank or insured by the government. Some banks sell annuities. Annuities are investment products that can pay 
you a return annually or at regular intervals. When you buy an annuity, the insurance company invests your money and agrees to 
pay you back according to the terms of the annuity contract. Annuities can be part of a long-term retirement savings plan. Like 
mutual funds, annuities are not insured by the U.S. government or guaranteed by the bank.</p>
<p>Some annuities help you set aside money on a tax-deferred basis until you retire. You don't pay taxes on the income earned by 
this money until you retire. Other annuities allow you to receive income immediately--but the income you receive can go up or 
down with changes in the financial markets and the income won't be tax deferred. For more information about annuities, see the 
reference list at the end of the brochure.</p>
<p>Before you buy an annuity, you should review the annuity contract. That document will spell out the terms of your agreement with 
an insurance company. You should also ask whether your annuity contract can be transferred to another company. </p>
<h4>What if you have a problem?</h4>
<p>Once you have made an investment, problems can still come up--just as they can when you buy a car or any other product. If 
you have a problem, it's always a good idea to explain it in writing and to send your explanation and copies of any documentation 
to the place where you bought the product. And, of course, keep a copy of everything for your files.</p>
<p>If you have a problem with an investment product you purchased at a bank, you should write to the bank. The bank should 
respond to you and keep a record of your complaint on file.</p>
<p>If the bank doesn't respond or if you are unhappy with the response, you should contact the federal or state agency that regulates 
the bank and/or the Securities and Exchange Commission, which regulates registered broker/dealers and the securities business. 
If your problem concerns an annuity, you can also contact the insurance company that issued the annuity or your state's insurance 
regulatory department.</p>
<h4>Tips for First-Time Investors:</h4>
<p>* You don't have to rely on telephone or mail solicitations to purchase an investment product.</p>
<p>* If you are contacted by a bank about an investment product and you want to find out more, make an appointment to visit the 
bank.</p>
<p>* Don't ask the bank teller for advice about the bank's products. Tellers generally are prohibited from giving investment advice.</p>
<p>* Make sure you understand what you're getting into. After all, it's your money that's at risk. Don't be afraid to ask questions 
about anything you don't understand. You're entitled to a simple explanation of what you are being offered, what it will cost, and 
what risks you could be taking.</p>
<p>* Don't rely solely on oral explanations. Ask for information in writing. Written explanations of the products and fees should be 
understandable. Make a list of things you don't understand and ask the salesperson about them.</p>
<p>* Get advice from other sources, such as an investment advisor, your accountant, or a tax advisor. The more you know about 
what you are buying, the more likely you are to make a wise choice.</p>
<p>* Shop around. See what other banks, investment houses, or brokers in your area are offering.</p>
<h4>Making Your Investment Decision</h4>
<p>If you've decided to buy an investment product, you now have to decide what is best for you. There are thousands of investment 
products for you to choose from. Don't think you can't make an informed decision because &quot;it's just too complicated.&quot;</p>
<h4>You can start by asking yourself:</h4>
<p>* How much risk am I willing to take? Are some investment products less risky than others? If I choose less risky investments, 
does that mean that I'm going to earn less on my investment?</p>
<p>* Am I planning to invest for a short time or over the long</p>
<p>haul? * What do I want out of my investment? For example, do I want an investment that will give me a steady source of income 
each month after I retire?</p>
<p>* Do I need a product to help me start saving--perhaps for my child's education? Can I put aside a certain amount of my 
paycheck each week for an investment that will grow over time?</p>
<p>* How does my tax bracket affect my investment decisions? Do I need something that will allow me to defer taxes until a later 
date?</p>
<p>You can see that not everyone has the same investment goals. That's why there are so many choices available to you. only you 
know what's best for you.</p>
<p>You should also know that the investment salesperson is required to ask you these kinds of questions before recommending 
which product is suitable for you.</p>
<h4>What are some of the fees associated with investments?</h4>
<p>When you buy an investment product, you are likely to be bombarded with terms that are unfamiliar or confusing. For example, 
one of the first things you want to know is: &quot;What's it going to cost me?&quot; But with investment product sales the answer may lead 
to more questions. What in the world are &quot;front-end loads&quot;? What about &quot;no-loads&quot; or &quot;back-end loads&quot;? Or, how about &quot;12b-1 
distribution fees&quot;?</p>
<p>If you don't understand these terms, ask questions. You should always ask your investment salesperson for a simple explanation 
of anything you don't understand.</p>
<p>To help you get started, here is some basic information about the kinds of fees that may be charged by banks and other entities 
that sell investment products. The reference list at the back of the brochure will give you more information.</p>
<p>Front-end loads or asset-based sales charges are sales commissions. This is how a bank or any other intermediary makes 
money. These fees are set as a percentage of the amount you invest. They can range up to 8.5 percent of your investment.</p>
<p>Back-end loads, also known as contingent deferred sales charges or redemption fees, are sales charges that you don't pay until 
you redeem or cash in your investment (sell your shares back to the fund). Back-end loads are generally calculated on how long 
you keep your investment: the sooner you sell, the higher the fee.</p>
<p>12b-1 fees are fees charged by some funds to cover advertising and marketing costs. Management fees cover the cost of paying 
the fund's investment advisor, who is the person or entity that recommends which investments the fund should buy or sell. These 
fees can also be called investment advisory fees or account maintenance fees.</p>
<h4>What about fees on annuities?</h4>
<p>Surrender charge fees are fees the insurer charges if you withdraw your funds before a certain period of time. This is a little like 
an early withdrawal penalty on a CD.</p>
<p>Annual charges cover the cost of administering the annuity contract.</p>

<h3>Facts for Consumers from the Federal Trade Commission</h3>
<h2>Electronic Banking -- February 1993</h2>
<p>To most of us, electronic banking means having 24-hour access to cash through an automated teller machine (ATM) or having 
our paychecks deposited directly into our checking or savings accounts. But electronic banking offers several other services that 
you may find useful.</p>
<p>This brochure lists types of consumer transactions that are covered under the federal Electronic Fund Transfer Act (EFT Act), 
discusses the information financial institutions must disclose, explains what you can do if you find errors on your monthly 
statements, discusses your liability if your ATM card is lost or stolen, and describes your limited stop-payment privileges. The 
brochure concludes by suggesting where to file complaints.</p>
<h4>Electronic Fund Transfers</h4>
<p>Electronic banking, also known as electronic fund transfer (EFT), uses computer and electronic technology as a substitute for 
checks and other paper transactions. Because EFTs are so convenient, you may wish to know the full range of their services.</p>
<p>Automated Teller Machines or 24-hour Tellers are electronic terminals that permit you to bank at almost any time of the day or 
night. To withdraw cash, make deposits, or transfer funds between accounts, you generally insert a special ATM card and enter 
your personal identification number (PIN).</p>
<p>Direct Deposits or Withdrawals allow you to authorize specific deposits such as paychecks and social security checks to go 
directly to your account on a regular basis. You also can arrange to have recurring bills, such as insurance premiums and utility 
bills, paid automatically. This service applies only if you authorize transactions in advance.</p>
<p>Pay-by-Phone Systems permit you to telephone your bank (or other financial institutions) with instructions to pay certain bills or 
to transfer funds between accounts. You must have an agreement in advance with the financial institution to make such transfers.</p>
<p>Point-of-Sale Transfers allow you to pay for retail purchases with an EFT (or &quot;debit&quot;) card. This is similar to using a credit card, 
but with one important exception -- the money for the purchase is transferred immediately (or soon thereafter) from your bank 
account to the store's account. Both MasterCard and Visa, among others, offer debit cards that can be used at participating 
retailers, and an increasing number of merchants are accepting this type of payment. For example, these transfers are becoming 
more common at grocery stores, oil companies, and convenience stores. However, because point of sale transfers are still 
relatively new, they might not yet be widely available at retailers in your region of the country.</p>
<h4>Disclosures</h4>
<p>The best way to understand your legal rights and responsibilities regarding your EFT account is to read the documents you 
receive from the financial institution that issued you the &quot;access device.&quot; An access device is a card, code, or other means of 
gaining access to your account for the purpose of initiating electronic fund transfers. The means may vary from institution to 
institution, but most use a PIN for this purpose. This unique number should be known only to you and to select employees of the 
financial institution.</p>
<p>Before you contract for EFT services or make your first electronic transfer, the institution is required to disclose to you the 
following information in a form you can keep.</p>
<p>A summary of your liability for unauthorized transfers.</p>
<p>The telephone number and address of the person to be notified when you believe that an unauthorized transfer has been or may 
be made, along with a statement of the institution's &quot;business days.&quot; This information will tell you the number of days you have to 
report suspected unauthorized transfers.</p>
<p>The type of transfers you can make, the amount of any charges for transfers, and any limitations on the frequency and dollar 
amount of transfers.</p>
<p>A summary of your right to receive documentation of transfers, of your right to stop payment on a pre-authorized transfer, and 
the procedures to follow to stop payment.</p>
<p>A notice describing the procedures you must follow to report an error on a receipt for an EFT, how to request more information 
about a transfer listed on your statement, and the time period in which you must make your report.</p>
<p>A summary of the institution's liability to you if it fails to make or stop certain transactions.</p>
<p>Circumstances under which the institution will disclose information to third parties concerning your account.</p>
<p>In addition to these disclosures, you will receive for most transactions two other types of important papers -- terminal receipts 
and periodic statements. (Separate rules apply to passbook accounts from which pre-authorized transfers are drawn. Your 
contract for that account is the best source of information about those rules.) You are entitled to a terminal receipt each time you 
initiate an electronic transfer, whether you use an ATM or make a point-of-sale electronic transfer. Among other things, the 
receipt must show the date and the amount of the transfer and the type of the transfer, such as &quot;transfer from savings to 
checking.&quot; When you make a point-of-sale transfer, you probably will get your terminal receipt from the salesperson. If you 
make a withdrawal from a cash-dispensing machine that cannot issue receipts, the institution is required to mail you a receipt on 
the next business day following the transfer.</p>
<p>You also are entitled to a periodic statement for each statement cycle in which an electronic transfer is made. This statement must 
show, among other things, the amount of any transfer, the date it was credited or debited to your account, the type of transfer 
and type of account(s) to or from which funds were transferred, and the address and telephone number to be used for inquiries. 
You are entitled to a quarterly statement even if you made no electronic transfers within that quarter.</p>
<p>Keep and compare your EFT receipts with your periodic statements each month in the same way you compare your credit card 
invoices with your monthly credit card statement or your checks against your monthly bank statements. Doing so will enable you 
to make the best use of your rights under federal law to dispute errors and avoid liability for unauthorized transfers.</p>
<h4>Errors</h4>
<p>You have 60 days from the date a problem or error appears on your periodic statements or terminal receipt to notify your 
financial institution. The best way to protect yourself in the event of an error (or a lost or stolen ATM or EFT card) is to notify 
the issuer by certified letter, return receipt requested, so you can prove that the institution received your letter. Keep a copy of 
the letter you send for your records.</p>
<p>After notification about an error on your statement, the institution has 10 business days to investigate and tell you the results. If 
the institution needs more time, it may take up to 45 days to complete the investigation -- but only if the money in dispute is 
returned to your account and you are notified promptly of the credit. At the end of the investigation, if no error is found, the 
institution may take the money back, if it sends you a written explanation.</p>
<p>If you fail to notify the institution of the error within 60 days, you may have little recourse. Under federal law, the institution has 
no obligation to conduct an investigation if you have missed the 60-day deadline.</p>
<p>An error also may occur in connection with a point-of-sale purchase using an EFT card. An oil company, for example, might give 
you an EFT card that lets you pay for gasoline purchases directly from your bank account. These purchases will be shown on 
your periodic statement from the bank. In case of an error on your account, however, you should contact the issuer of the card 
(here, the oil company) at the address or phone number provided by that company. For these types of purchases, after 
notification about an error, the company has 20 business days to investigate and tell you the results. It has up to 90 days to 
complete the investigation, if it returns the money to your account and notifies you promptly of the credit. If no error is found at 
the end of the investigation, the institution may take back the money, if it sends you a written explanation.</p>
<h4>Lost or Stolen EFT Cards</h4>
<p>You cannot lose more than $50 if your credit card is lost or stolen, but, if someone uses your ATM or EFT card without your 
permission, you can lose much more.</p>
<p>If you report an ATM or EFT card missing before it is used without your permission, the EFT Act says the card issuer cannot 
hold you responsible for any unauthorized withdrawals. If unauthorized use occurs before you report it, the amount you can be 
held responsible for depends upon how quickly you report the loss to the card issuer. If you report the loss within two business 
days after you realize your card is missing, you will not be responsible for more than $50 for unauthorized use. However, if you 
do not report the loss within two business days after you realize the card is missing, but you do report its loss within 60 days after 
your statement is mailed to you, you could lose as much as $500 because of an unauthorized withdrawal. And, if you do not 
report an unauthorized transfer or withdrawal within 60 days after your statement is mailed to you, you risk unlimited loss. That 
means you could lose all the money in your account and the unused portion of your maximum line of credit established for 
overdrafts.</p>
<p>If your failure to notify the institution within the time periods allowed was due to an extenuating circumstance, such as lengthy 
travel or illness, the issuer must extend the time period for notification to what is reasonable. Also, if state law or your contract 
imposes lower liability limits, those lower limits apply instead of the limits in the federal EFT Act.</p>
<p>After reporting the loss or theft of your ATM card, you are not liable for additional unauthorized transfers that may be made. 
Because these unauthorized transfers may appear on your statements, however, you should carefully review each statement you 
receive after you report the loss or theft. If the statement shows transfers that you did not make or that you need more 
information about, contact the institution immediately, using the special procedures provided for reporting errors.</p>
<h4>Limited Stop-Payment Privileges</h4>
<p>When you use an electronic fund transfer, the EFT Act does not give you the right to stop payment. If your purchase is defective 
or if your order is not delivered, it is up to you to resolve the problem with the seller and get your money back -- just as if you 
had paid cash.</p>
<p>There is one situation, however, in which you can stop payment. If you have arranged regular payments out of your account to 
third parties, such as life insurance companies, you can stop payment if you notify your institution at least three business days 
before the scheduled transfer. The notice may be oral or written, but the institution may require a written follow-up to be made 
within 14 days of the oral notice. Your failure to provide the written follow-up ends the institution's responsibility to stop 
payment. This right to stop payment does not apply to mortgage or loan payments you owe to the institution that issued the EFT 
access device.</p>
<p>Although federal law provides only limited rights to stop payment, individual financial institutions may offer more rights or state 
laws may require them. If this feature is important to you, you may want to shop around to be sure you are getting the best &quot;stop 
payment&quot; terms available.</p>
<h4>Other Rights</h4>
<p>The EFT Act protects your right of choice in two specific situations regarding use of electronic fund transfers. First, the Act 
prohibits financial institutions from requiring you to repay a loan by electronic transfer. Second, if you are required to receive 
your salary or government benefit check by EFT, you have the right to choose the institution to receive the funds.</p>
<h4>Some Suggestions</h4>
<p>If you decide to become an EFT user, remember the following precautions.</p>
<p>Take care of your EFT card. Know where it is at all times and report its loss as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Choose a PIN different from your address, telephone number, social security number, or birthdate. Choosing a different number 
will make it more difficult for a thief to use your EFT card.</p>
<p>Keep and compare your EFT receipts with your periodic statements so that you can find and promptly report errors and 
unauthorized transfers.</p>
<h4>Where to File Complaints</h4>
<p>If you believe the institution that issued your EFT access device has failed to fulfill its responsibilities to you under the EFT Act, in 
addition to informing the issuer, you may wish to complain to the federal agency listed below that has enforcement jurisdiction 
over that issuer.</p>

Reserve System 20th &amp; C Sts., N.W. Washington, D.C. 20551</p>

<h2>Investor's Bill of Rights</h2>
<p>Honesty in Advertising<br>
Full and Accurate Information<br>
Disclosure of Risks<br>
Explanation of Obligations and Costs<br>
Time to Consider<br>
Responsible Advice<br>
Best Effort Management<br>

Access to Your Funds<br>
Recourse, If Necessary</p>
<p>In many important ways, an investor is not simply a consumer but a party to a legal contract. Both the offeror and purchaser of 
an investment have rights and responsibilities. This &quot;Bill of Rights&quot;is designed to assist you the investor in making an informed 
decision before committing your funds. It is not intended to be exhaustive in its descriptions. Should you desire further 
information about a particular type of investment, you are invited to contact the appropriate organization listed on the back of this 
brochure.</p>
<h4>Honesty in Advertising</h4>
<p>Many individuals first learn of investment opportunities through advertising -- in a newspaper or magazine, on radio or television, 
or by mail. Phone solicitations are also regarded as a form of advertising. In practically every area of investment activity, false or 
misleading advertising is against the law and subject to civil, criminal or regulatory penalties. Bear in mind that advertising is able 
to convey only limited information, and the most attractive features are likely to be highlighted. Accordingly, it is never wise to 
invest solely on the basis of an advertisement. The only bona fide purposes of investment advertising are to call your attention to 
an offering and encourage you to obtain additional information.</p>
<h4>Full and Accurate Information</h4>
<p>Before you make any investment, you have the right to seek and obtain information about the investment. This includes 
information that accurately conveys all of the material facts about the investment, including the major factors likely to affect its 
performance.</p>
<p>You also have the right to request information about the firm or the individuals with whom you would be doing business and 
whether they have a &quot;track record.&quot; If so, you have the right to know what it has been and whether it is real or &quot;hypothetical.&quot; If 
they have been in trouble with regulatory authorities, you have the right to know this. If a rate of return is advertised, you have the 
right to know how it is calculated and any assumptions it is based on. You also have the right to ask what financial interest the 
seller of the investment has in the sale.</p>
<p>Ask for all available literature about the investment. If there is a prospectus, obtain it and read it. This is where the bad as well as 
the good about the investment has to be discussed. If an investment involves a company whose stock is publicly traded, get a 
copy of its latest annual report. It can also be worthwhile to visit your public library to find out what may have been written about 
the investment in recent business or financial periodicals.</p>
<p>Obtaining information isn't likely to tell you whether or not a given investment will be profitable, but what you are able to find 
out--or unable to find out--could help you decide if it's an appropriate investment for you at that time. No investment is right for 
everyone.</p>
<h4>Disclosure of Risks</h4>
<p>Every investment involves some risk. You have the right to find out what these risks are prior to making an investment. Some, of 
course, are obvious: Shares of stock may decline in price. A business venture may fail. An oil well may turn out to be a dry hole.</p>
<p>Others may be less obvious. Many people do not fully understand, for example, that even a U.S. Treasury Bond may fluctuate in 
market value prior to maturity. Or that with some investments it is possible to lose more than the amount initially invested. The 
point is that different investments involve different kinds of risk and these risks can differ in degree. A general rule of thumb is that 
the greater the potential reward, the greater the potential risk.</p>
<p>In some areas of investment, there is a legal obligation to disclose the risks in writing. If the investment doesn't require a 
prospectus or written risk disclosure statement, you might nonetheless want to ask for a written explanation of the risks. The 
bottom line: Unless your understanding of the ways you can lose money is equal to your understanding of the ways you can make 
money, don't invest!</p>
<h4>Explanation of Obligations and Costs</h4>
<p>You have the right to know, in advance, what obligations and costs are involved in a given investment. For instance, does the 
investment involve a requirement that you must take some specific action by a particular time? Or is there a possibility that at 
some future time or under certain circumstances you may be obligated to come up with additional money?</p>
<p>Similarly, you have the right to a full disclosure of the costs that will be or may be incurred. In addition to commissions, sales 
charges or &quot;loads&quot; when you buy and/or sell, this includes any other transaction expenses, maintenance or service charges, profit 
sharing arrangements, redemption fees or penalties and the like.</p>
<h4>Time to Consider</h4>
<p>You earned the money and you have the right to decide for yourself how you want to invest it. That right includes sufficient time 
to make an informed and well&#169;considered decision. High pressure sales tactics violate the spirit of the law, and most investment 
professionals will not push you into making uninformed decisions. Thus, any such efforts should be grounds for suspicion. An 
investment that &quot;absolutely has to made right now&quot; probably shouldn't be made at all.</p>
<h4>Responsible Advice</h4>
<p>Investors enjoy a wide range of different investments to choose from. Taking into consideration your financial situation, needs 
and investment objectives, some are likely to be suitable for you and others aren't--perhaps because of risks involved and 
perhaps for other reasons. If you rely on an investment professional for advice, you have the right to responsible advice.</p>
<p>In the securities industry, for example, &quot;suitability&quot; rules require that investment advice be appropriate for the particular customer. 
In the commodity futures industry a &quot;know your customer&quot; rule requires that firms and brokers obtain sufficient information to 
assure that investors are adequately informed of the risks involved. Beware of someone who insists that a particular investment is 
&quot;right&quot; for you although he or she knows nothing about you.</p>
<h4>Best-Effort Management</h4>
<p>Every firm and individual that accepts investment funds from the public has the ethical and legal obligation to manage the money 
responsibly. As an investor, you have the right to expect nothing less.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, in any area of investment, there are those few less-than-ethical persons who may lose sight of their obligations, 
and of your rights: By making investments you have not authorized, by making an excessive number of investments for the 
purpose of creating additional commission income for themselves or, at the extreme, appropriating your funds for their personal 
use. If there is even a hint of such activities, insist on an immediate and full explanation. Unless you are completely satisfied with 
the answer, ask the appropriate regulatory or legal authorities to look into it. It's your right.</p>
<h4>Complete and Truthful Accounting</h4>
<p>Investing your money shouldn't mean losing touch with your money. It's your right to know where your money is and the current 
status and value of your account. If there have been profits or losses, you have the right to know the amount and how and when 
they were realized or incurred. This right includes knowing the amount and nature of any and all charges against your account. 
Most firms prepare and mail periodic account statements, generally monthly. And you can usually obtain interim information on 
request. Whatever the method of accounting, you have both the right to obtain this information and the right to expect that it be 
timely and accurate.</p>
<h4>Access to Your Funds</h4>
<p>Some investments include restrictions as to whether, when or how you can have access to your funds. You have the right to be 
clearly informed of any such restrictions in advance of making the investment. Similarly, if the investment may be illiquid--difficult 
to quickly convert to cash--you have the right to know this beforehand. In the absence of restrictions or limitations it's your 
money and you should be able to have access to it within a reasonable period of time.</p>
<p>You should also have access to the person or firm that has your funds. Investment scam artists are well versed in ways of finding 
you but, particularly once they have your money in hand, they can make it difficult or impossible for you to find them.</p>
<h4>Recourse, If Necessary</h4>
<p>Your rights as an investor include the right to seek an appropriate remedy if you believe someone has dealt with you---or 
handled your investment--dishonestly or unfairly. Indeed, even in the case of reasonable misunderstandings, there should be 
some way to reconcile differences.</p>
<p>It is wise to determine before you invest what avenues of recourse are available to you if they should be needed. One means of 
exercising your right of recourse may be to file suit in a court of law. Or you may be able to initiate arbitration, mediation or 
reparation proceedings through an exchange or a regulatory organization. Additional information about filing complaints can be 
obtained through various regulatory organizations.</p>

<h3>Facts for Consumers from the Federal Trade Commission</h3>
<h2>A New Credit Identity: A New Credit Repair Scam -- 
November 1992</h2>
<p>If you have filed for bankruptcy, you may be the target of a new credit repair scheme, often called 
&quot;file segregation.&quot; In this scheme, you are promised a chance to hide unfavorable credit information 
by establishing a new credit identity. That may sound perfect, especially if you fear that you will not 
be given any credit as long as bankruptcy appears on your credit record. The problem is, &quot;file 
segregation&quot; is illegal. If you use it, you could face fines or even prison.</p>
<p>This fact sheet alerts you to some aspects of this new type of credit repair scam, describes the false 
claims that fraudulent companies sometimes use to sell you the service, and says why participation is 
illegal. It also lists other FTC brochures that discuss your credit rights and responsibilities.</p>
<h4>The Pitch: A New Credit Identity</h4>
<p>If you have filed for bankruptcy, you may receive a letter from a credit repair company that warns 
you about your inability to get credit cards, personal loans, or any other types of credit for ten years. 
For a fee, the company promises to help you hide your bankruptcy and establish a new credit identity 
you can use when applying for credit.</p>
<p>If you pay the fee and sign up for the service, you may be directed to apply for an Employer 
Identification Number (EIN) from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Typically, EINs--which 
resemble social security numbers--are used by businesses to report financial information to the IRS 
and the Social Security Administration.</p>
<p>After you receive your EIN, you are advised to use it in place of your social security number when 
you apply for credit. You also are advised to use a new mailing address and to include some credit 
references.</p>
<h4>The Catch: False Claims</h4>
<p>Listed here are reasons a credit repair service may give you for establishing a new credit identity. 
These false claims, along with the pitch for getting a new credit identity, should alert you to the 
possibility of fraud.</p>
<p>Claim 1: You will not be able to get credit for 10 years (the period of time bankruptcy information 
may stay on your credit record).</p>
<p>Each creditor has its own criteria for granting credit. While one may reject your application because 
of a bankruptcy, another may grant you credit shortly after you filed for bankruptcy. And, given a 
new reliable payment record, your chances of obtaining credit will probably increase as time passes.</p>
<p>Claim 2: The company or &quot;file segregation&quot; program is affiliated with the federal government.</p>
<p>The federal government does not support or work with companies offering such programs.</p>
<p>Claim 3: The &quot;file segregation&quot; program is legal.</p>
<p>It is a federal crime to make any false statements on a loan or credit application, which the credit 
repair company may advise you to do. It is a federal crime to misrepresent your social security 
number. It also is a federal crime to obtain an EIN from the IRS under false pretenses.</p>
<p>Further, you could be charged with mail or wire fraud if you use the mail or the telephone to apply for 
credit and provide false information. Also, file segregation would likely constitute civil fraud under 
many state laws.</p>
<p>If you receive a letter from a company making such claims, contact your state attorney general or 
consumer protection office. You also can file a complaint with the FTC. Write: Correspondence 
Branch, Federal Trade Commission, Washington, D.C. 20580. While the FTC does not handle 
individual cases, it can act against companies when it sees a pattern of possible law violations 
developing.</p>
<h4>Other FTC Brochures</h4>
<p>For more information about credit reports, you can order these free FTC brochures: Building a 
Better Credit Record, Credit Repair Scams, Fair Credit Reporting, Fix You Own Credit Problems 
and Save Money, Scoring for Credit, Solving Credit Problems, and Women and Credit Histories.

<h3>Facts for Consumers from the Federal Trade Commission</h3>
<h2>Choosing and Using Credit Cards -- February 1993</h2>
<p>Chances are you have received offers in the mail asking if you would like to open credit card accounts. Frequently, these offers 
say that you have been &quot;pre-approved&quot; for the card, with a line of credit already set aside for your use. Typically, these offers 
urge you to accept quickly, &quot;before the offer expires.&quot; However, before accepting a credit card offer, understand the card's 
credit terms and compare costs of similar cards to get the features and terms you want.</p>
<h4>Choosing a Credit Card</h4>
<p>Credit card offers may seem attractive, but remember a credit card is a form of borrowing that usually involves a &quot;finance charge&quot; 
-- a charge for the convenience of borrowing -- and often other charges as well.</p>
<h4>Credit Card Terms</h4>
<p>Before selecting a credit card, learn which credit terms and conditions apply. Each affects the overall cost of the credit you will 
be using. Under the Fair Credit and Charge Card Disclosure Act, you can compare terms and fees before you agree to open a 
credit card or charge card (no interest) account. Be sure to consider and compare the following terms that direct-mail 
applications and pre-approved solicitations must reveal.</p>
<p>Annual Percentage Rate. The &quot;annual percentage rate,&quot; or APR, is disclosed to you when you apply for a card, again when you 
open the account, and it is also noted on each bill you receive. It is a measure of the cost of credit, expressed as a yearly rate. 
The card issuer also must disclose the &quot;periodic rate&quot; -- that is, the rate the card issuer applies to your outstanding account 
balance to figure the finance charge for each billing period. Some credit card plans allow the card issuer to change the annual 
percentage rate on your account when interest rates or other economic indicators (called indexes) change. Because the rate 
change is linked to the performance of the index, which may rise or fall, these plans are commonly called &quot;variable rate&quot; plans. 
Rate changes raise or lower the amount of the finance charge you pay on your account. If the credit card you are considering has 
a variable rate feature, the card issuer must tell you that the rate may vary and how the rate is determined, including which index 
is used and what additional amount (the &quot;margin&quot;) is added to the index to determine your new rate. You also must be told how 
much and how often your rate may change.</p>
<p>Free Period. A free period - also called a &quot;grace period&quot; - allows you to avoid the finance charge by paying your current balance 
in full before the &quot;due date&quot; shown on your statement. Knowing whether a credit card plan gives you a free period is especially 
important if you plan to pay your account in full each month. If there is no free period, the card issuer will impose a finance 
charge from the date you use your credit card or from the date each credit card transaction is posted to your account. If your 
credit card plan allows a free period, the card issuer must mail your bill at least 14 days before your payment is due. This is to 
ensure that you have enough time to make your payment by the due date.</p>
<p>Annual Fees. Most credit card issuers charge annual membership or other participation fees. These fees range from $25 to $50 
for most cards, and from $75 on up for premium &quot;gold&quot; or &quot;platinum&quot; cards.</p>
<p>Transaction Fees and Other Charges. A credit card also may involve other types of costs. For example, some card issuers 
charge a fee when you use the card to obtain a cash advance, when you fail to make a payment on time, or when you go over 
your credit limit. Some charge a flat monthly fee whether or not you use the card.</p>
<p>Balance Computation Method for the Finance Charge. If your plan has no free period, or if you expect to pay for purchases 
over time, it is important to know how the card issuer will calculate your finance charge. This charge will vary depending upon 
the method the card issuer uses to figure your balance. The method used can make a difference, sometimes a big difference, in 
how much finance charge you will pay -- even when the APR is identical to that charged by another card issuer and the pattern 
of purchases and payments is the same. Examples of how finance charges based on identical APRs can differ are shown on page 
4. Some of the ways card issuers figure balances for finance charges are described on pages 4 and 5.</p>
<p>Average Daily Balance (including or excluding new purchases). The average daily balance method gives you credit for your 
payment from the day the card issuer receives it. To compute the balance due, the card issuer totals the beginning balance for 
each day in the billing period and deducts any payments credited to your account that day. New purchases may or may not be 
added to the balance, depending on the plan, but cash advances typically are added. The resulting daily balances are added up 
for the billing cycle and the total is then divided by the number of days in the billing period to arrive at the &quot;average daily balance.&quot; 
This is the most common method used by credit card issuers.</p>
<p>Adjusted Balance. This balance is computed by subtracting the payments you made and any credits you received during the 
present billing period from the balance you owed at the end of the previous billing period. New purchases that you made during 
the billing period are not included. Under the adjusted balance method, you have until the end of the billing cycle to pay part of 
your balance and you avoid the interest charges on that portion. Some creditors exclude prior, unpaid finance charges from the 
previous balance. The adjusted balance method usually is the most advantageous to card users.</p>
<p>Previous Balance. As the name suggests, this balance is simply the amount that you owed at the end of the previous billing 
period. Payments, credits, or new purchases made during the current billing period are not taken into account. Some creditors 
also exclude unpaid finance charges in computing this balance. If you do not understand how the balance on your account is 
computed, ask the card issuer. (An explanation of how the balance was determined must appear on the billing statements the 
card issuer provides you and on applications and pre-approved solicitations the card issuer may send you.)</p>
<p>The following are examples of how different methods of calculating finance charges affect the cost of credit:</p>

<h4>Costs and Features</h4>
<p>Credit terms differ among card issuers, so shop around for the card that is best for you. Which one is best may depend on how 
you plan to use it. If you plan to pay bills in full each month, the size of the annual fee or other fees, and not the periodic and 
annual percentage rate, may be more important. If you expect to use credit cards to pay for purchases over time, the APR and 
the balance computation method are important terms to consider. In either case, keep in mind that your costs will be affected by 
whether or not there is a grace period.</p>
<p>When shopping for a credit card, you probably will want to look at other factors besides costs - such as whether the credit limit 
is high enough to meet your needs, how widely the card is accepted, and what services and features are available under the plan. 
You may be interested, for example, in &quot;affinity cards&quot; - all-purpose credit cards that are sponsored by professional 
organizations, college alumni associations, and some members of the travel industry. Frequently, an affinity card issuer donates a 
portion of the annual fees or transaction charges to the sponsoring organization, or allows you to qualify for free travel or other 
bonuses.</p>
<h4>Using a Credit Card</h4>
<p>Federal law prohibits card issuers from sending you a credit card that you did not request. (The issuer may send you a renewal 
or substitute card without a request.) Card issuers are permitted to mail you an application or a solicitation for a credit card or to 
ask you by phone whether you want to receive a card -- and to send you one if you say yes.</p>
<h4>Credit Card Protections</h4>
<p>Federal law protects consumers when they use credit cards. The protections include the following items.</p>
<p>Prompt Credit for Payment. A card issuer must credit your account on the day the issuer receives your payment, unless the 
payment is not made according to the creditor's requirements or the delay in crediting to your account does not result in a charge. 
To avoid delays that could result in finance charges, follow the card issuer's instructions about where to send payments. 
Payments sent to other locations could delay getting credit for your payment for up to five days. If you lose your payment 
envelope, look on the billing statement for the address for payments or call the card issuer.</p>
<p>Refunds of Credit Balances. When you return merchandise or pay more than you owe, you have the option of keeping the credit 
balance on your account or requesting a refund (if the amount exceeds $1.00). To obtain a refund, write the card issuer. The 
card issuer must send you the refund within seven business days of receiving your request. (Also, if a credit balance remains on 
your account for more than six months, the card issuer must make a good faith effort to refund the credit balance.) Errors on 
Your Bill. Federal law provides specific rules that the card issuer must follow for promptly correcting billing errors. The card 
issuer will give you a statement describing these rules when you open the credit card account and, after that, at least once a year. 
In fact, many card issuers print a summary of your rights on each bill they send you.</p>
<p>You must notify the card issuer in writing at the address specified for billing errors when you find an error, and you must do so 
within 60 days after the first bill containing the error was mailed to you. (For this reason, keep your credit card receipts and 
promptly compare them when your bills arrive.) In your notification letter, include your name, your account number, the amount 
of the suspected error, and the reason why you believe that the bill contains an error. The card issuer, in turn, must look into the 
problem and either correct the error or explain to you why the bill is correct. This must occur within two billing cycles and not 
later than 90 days after the issuer receives your billing error notice. During the period that the card issuer is investigating the error, 
you do not have to pay the amount in question. (For further information, write: &quot;Credit Billing Errors,&quot; Public Reference, Federal 
Trade Commission, Washington, D.C. 20580.)</p>
<p>Unauthorized charges. Under federal law, if your credit card is used without your authorization, you can be held liable for up to 
$50 per card. If you report the loss before the card is used, federal law says the card issuer cannot hold you responsible for any 
unauthorized charges. If a thief uses your card before you report it missing, the most you will owe for unauthorized charges is 
$50. This is true even if a thief is able to use your credit card at an automated teller machine (ATM) to access your credit card 
account. To minimize your liability, report the loss of your card as soon as possible. Some companies have toll-free numbers 
printed on their statements and 24-hour service to accept such emergency information. For your own protection, you should 
follow up your phone call with a letter to the card issuer. The letter should give your card number, say when your card was 
missing, and mention the date you called in the loss.</p>
<p>FTC CONSUMER &amp; SMALL BUSINESS ADVISORY - PUBLIC DOCUMENT</p>
<p>Disputes about Merchandise or Services. If you have a problem with merchandise or services that you charged to a credit card, 
and you have made a good faith effort to work out the problem with the seller, you have the right to withhold from the card issuer 
payment for the merchandise or services. You can withhold payment up to the amount of credit outstanding for the purchase, 
plus any finance or related charges. If the card you used is a bank card, a travel and entertainment card, or another card not 
issued by the seller of the defective merchandise, you can withhold payment only if the purchase exceeded $50 and occurred in 
your home state or within 100 miles of your billing address. If these conditions do not apply to you, you may want to consider 
filing an action in small claims court -- an informal legal proceeding that can be used to settle disputes. While the maximum 
amounts that can be claimed or awarded differ from state to state, most small claims courts hear cases involving amounts ranging 
from $25 to $2,000. Some states have recently raised their limits to $5,000. Check your local telephone book under your 
municipal, county, or state government headings for small claims court listings.</p>
<h4>Some Suggestions</h4>
<p>Shop around for credit card terms that are best for you.</p>
<p>Make sure you understand the terms of a credit card plan before you accept the card. Review the disclosures of terms and fees 
that must appear on credit-card offers you receive in the mail.</p>
<p>Pay bills promptly to keep finance charges as low as possible.</p>
<p>Keep copies of sales slips and promptly compare charges when your bills arrive.</p>
<p>Protect your credit cards and account numbers to prevent unauthorized use. Draw a line through blank spaces above the total 
when you sign receipts. Rip up or retain carbons.</p>
<p>Keep a list of your credit card numbers and the telephone numbers of each card issuer in a safe place in case your cards are lost 
or stolen.</p>

<h3>Facts for Consumers from the Federal Trade Commission</h3>
<h2>Credit and Charge Card Fraud -- February 1993</h2>
<p>The cost of credit and charge card fraud -- to card holders and to card companies alike -- was $864 million in 1992. Everyone 
pays for credit and charge card fraud in higher prices, whether or not they are personally defrauded.</p>
<p>While theft is the most obvious form of credit and charge card fraud, fraud occurs in other ways, as well. For example, someone 
may use your card number (not the card itself) without your permission. This may occur in a variety of ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>A thief rifles through trash to find discarded receipts or carbons to use the card numbers illegally.</li>
<li>A dishonest clerk makes an extra imprint from your credit card or charge card for his or her personal use.</li>
<li>You receive a postcard or a letter asking you to call an out-of-state number to take advantage of a free trip or a 
bargain-priced travel package. When you call, you are told you must join the travel club first. You are asked for your 
credit card number so you can be billed for the membership fee. The catch? New charges continue to be added at every 
step and you never get your free or bargain-priced vacation.</li>
</ul>
<h4>How to Guard Against Credit and Charge Card Fraud</h4>
<p>Here are some suggested precautions you can take to help protect yourself against credit and charge card fraud. You also may 
want to instruct any other person who is authorized to use your account to take the same precautions.</p>
<p>Sign your new cards as soon as they arrive.</p>
<p>Carry your cards separately from your wallet. Keep a record of your card numbers, their expiration dates, and the phone 
number and address of each company in a secure place.</p>
<p>Keep your card in view, whenever you can, after you give it to a clerk. Retrieve your card promptly after using it.</p>
<p>Avoid signing a blank receipt, whenever possible. Draw a line through blank spaces above the total when you sign card receipts.</p>
<p>Void or destroy all carbons and incorrect receipts.</p>
<p>Save your card receipts to compare with your billing statements.</p>
<p>Open billing statements promptly and reconcile your card accounts each month, just as you would your checking account.</p>
<p>Report promptly and in writing any questionable charges to the card issuer.</p>
<p>Notify card companies in advance of a change in address.</p>
<p>In addition, here are some things you should not do:</p>
<p>Never lend your card(s) to anyone.</p>
<p>Never leave your cards or receipts lying around.</p>
<p>Never put your card number on a postcard or on the outside of an envelope.</p>
<p>Never give your number over the phone unless you are initiating a transaction with a company you know is reputable. If you have 
questions about a company, check with your local consumer protection office or Better Business Bureau before ordering.</p>
<h4>What To Do If Your Cards Are Lost or Stolen</h4>
<p>If your credit or charge cards are lost or stolen, call the issuer(s) immediately. Most card companies have a toll-free number for 
reporting missing cards. Some companies provide 24-hour service. By law, once you report the loss or theft, you have no further 
liability for unauthorized charges. In any event, your maximum liability under federal law is $50 per card.</p>
<h4>What To Do About Suspected Fraud</h4>
<p>If you suspect that someone has illegally used your credit card, call the card issuer immediately. Use the special telephone 
number that many card issuers list on their billing statements. You also may want to follow up your phone call with a letter. You 
may be asked to sign a statement under oath that you did not make the purchase(s) in question, but you cannot be required to do 
so.</p>

<h3>Facts for Consumers from the Federal Trade Commission</h3>
<h2>Credit and Divorce -- April 1994</h2>
<p>Produced in cooperation with the American Bar Association, Public Education Division</p>
<p>Mary and Bill were recently divorced. Their court-approved divorce decree stated that Bill would pay the balances on their three 
joint credit card accounts. Some months later, after Bill neglected to pay off these accounts, all three creditors contacted Mary 
for payment. She referred them to the divorce decree, insisting that she was not responsible for the accounts.</p>
<p>The creditors stated, correctly, that they were not parties to the divorce decree and that Mary was still legally responsible for 
paying off the couple's joint accounts. Mary later found out that the late payments appeared on her own credit report. If you 
have recently been through a divorce-- or are contemplating one--you may want to look closely at issues involving credit. As the 
above example illustrates, you may discover unanticipated problems.</p>
<p>Understanding the different kinds of credit accounts opened during a marriage may help illuminate the potential benefits--and 
pitfalls--of each.</p>
<p>There are two types of credit accounts: individual and joint. With either type, you can permit authorized users to use the account. 
When you apply for credit--whether a charge card or a mortgage loan--you will be asked to select one kind.</p>
<h4>Applying for an Individual or Joint Account</h4>
<p>INDIVIDUAL ACCOUNT: When you apply for an individual account, only your own income, assets, and credit history are 
considered by the creditor. Whether married or single, you alone are responsible for paying off the debt on this account. The 
account will appear on your credit report (and may appear on the credit report of any &quot;authorized&quot; user as discussed below).</p>
<p>Please note that this may not be the case if you live in a community property state. In some community property states, both 
spouses may be responsible for debts incurred during the marriage, and the individual debts of one spouse may appear on the 
credit report of the other spouse. You may want to check your state laws if you live in one of the following states: Arizona, 
California, Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Washington, and Wisconsin.</p>
<p>Advantages/Disadvantages: For spouses who do not work for pay outside the home, work part-time, or work in lower-paying 
jobs, it may be difficult to demonstrate a strong financial picture without the income of the other spouse. But, if you are able to 
open an account in your own name, nobody else can adversely affect your credit record.</p>
<p>JOINT ACCOUNT: The income, financial assets, and credit history of both spouses are taken into consideration for a joint 
account.</p>
<p>No matter who actually handles the household bills, both spouses are responsible for seeing that all debts are paid. A creditor 
who reports the credit history of a joint account to credit bureaus must report it in both names (if the account was opened after 
June 1, 1977).</p>
<p>Advantages/Disadvantages: A joint application combining the financial resources of two people may present a stronger case to a 
creditor for granting a loan or credit card. But because two people applied together for the credit, each spouse is legally 
responsible to the creditor for the entire debt accumulated. This is true for a joint account even if a divorce decree assigns 
separate debt obligations to each spouse. A former spouse can adversely affect another spouse's credit history on a jointly-held 
account, for example, by running up bills and not paying them.</p>
<h4>Allowing &quot;Users&quot; on Your Account</h4>
<p>If you open an individual or joint account, you may authorize another person, often a relative, to use that account. You apply for 
credit based on your own financial information and are fully responsible for paying any debt. If you authorize your spouse to 
&quot;use&quot; your individual account, a creditor who reports the credit history to a credit bureau must report it in the name of your 
spouse as well as in your name (if the account was opened after June 1, 1977). A creditor also may report the credit history in 
the name of any other authorized user.</p>
<p>Advantages/Disadvantages: These accounts are often opened for convenience. They are helpful to people who might not qualify 
for credit on their own, such as students or homemakers. While these persons may use the account, they are not contractually 
liable for paying the debt. If you are permitting others to use your credit card, know that you alone are responsible for paying the 
bills.</p>
<h4>What To Do in the Event of Divorce</h4>
<p>If you are contemplating divorce or separation, be sure to pay attention to the status of your credit accounts. If you maintain joint 
accounts during that time, it is important to make regular payments\'d0\'d0so your credit record won't suffer. As long as there is 
an outstanding balance on any joint account, both you and your spouse are liable for it.</p>
<p>You also may want to ask creditors to close any joint accounts or accounts in which your former spouse was an authorized user. 
Or, preferably, ask the creditor to convert these accounts to individual ones or to the name of the spouse handling that debt. By 
law, a creditor cannot close a joint account because of a change in marital status, but can do so at the request of either spouse. A 
creditor, however, does not have to agree to change joint accounts to individual ones. The creditor can require you to reapply 
for credit on an individual basis and then, based on your new application, extend or deny you credit. In the case of a mortgage or 
home equity loan, a lender is likely to require refinancing to remove a spouse from the obligation.</p>

<h3>Facts for Consumers from the Federal Trade Commission</h3>
<h2>Credit and Older Americans -- January 1993</h2>
<p>Prepared in cooperation with the American Association of Retired Persons</p>
<p>Securing credit is as important for older Americans as it is for younger. Yet, older consumers and particularly older women may 
find they have special problems with credit.</p>
<p>For example, if you have paid with cash all your life, you may find it difficult to open a credit account, because you have &quot;no 
credit history&quot; (i.e., no history of how you paid for credit). If you now are living on a lower salary or pension, you may find it 
harder to obtain a loan because you have &quot;insufficient income.&quot; Or, if your spouse dies, you may find that creditors try to close 
accounts that you and your spouse once shared.</p>
<p>Under the federal Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA), it is against the law for a creditor to deny you credit or terminate 
existing credit simply because of your age. This brochure will help you learn what rights you have.</p>
<h4>Applying for Credit</h4>
<p>Applying for credit used to mean asking a neighborhood banker or tradesperson for a loan. Now, with national credit cards and 
computerized applications, the day of personal evaluations may be over. Instead, computer evaluations look at, among other 
things, your income, your past payment records, your credit cards, and your outstanding balances. Paying in cash and in full may 
be sound financial advice, but they will not give you a history on which to get credit.</p>
<p>When you apply for credit or a loan, one major indicator of your ability to repay is your current income. If you are retired or 
employed part-time, this may be of some concern. But creditors who consider income must consider types of income that are 
likely to be received by older Americans. These include not only salary from a job, but also from Social Security, pensions, and 
other retirement benefits.</p>
<p>In addition, you may want to inform creditors about other assets or sources of income, such as your home, other real estate, 
savings and checking accounts, money market funds, certificates of deposit, and stocks and bonds.</p>
<p>If you are 62 or over, you have certain other protections when you apply for credit. You cannot be denied credit because of 
your age or the fact that you cannot obtain credit-related insurance because of your age. Credit-related insurance pays off the 
creditor if you should die or become disabled.</p>
<p>However, a creditor can consider your age to: </p>
<ul>
<li>favor applicants who are 62 or over.<p>determine other elements of creditworthiness. (For example, a creditor could use your age to see if your income might 
change because you are at the age of retirement.)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Checking Your Credit History</h4>
<p>When you apply for credit, a creditor will often check your credit history by contacting a credit bureau. If you want to know 
what is in your credit file, contact the local credit bureaus that have your file. (Credit bureaus can be found in the Yellow Pages 
under headings such as &quot;Credit&quot; or &quot;Credit Rating and Reporting Agencies.&quot;) They will tell you what information is in your file and 
may give you a copy of your credit report. Credit bureaus may charge a small fee for this (unless you have been denied credit 
based on your credit report).</p>
<p>You may find that your credit file does not list all of your credit accounts. This is because not all creditors report to credit 
bureaus. You can request, however, that additional accounts be reported to your file. Credit bureaus, though, may charge for this 
service.</p>
<p>If you move, request that the credit bureau in your new location transfer your credit file from your previous location. Most credit 
bureaus are willing to share this information.</p>
<p>Credit information about shared accounts should be reported in your name and in your spouse's. If it is not, you can write to the 
creditor and request that the account be reported in both names.</p>
<h4>Establishing a Credit History</h4>
<p>If you are denied a loan or credit card because you have no credit history, you may want to establish one. The best way to do 
this is to borrow money or use a credit card and make payments regularly. For example, you could apply for a small line of 
credit from your bank or for a credit card from a local department store. Local creditors that you know usually are more inclined 
to give you credit.</p>
<p>Of course, you will want to give these creditors your best financial references. And, make sure the creditor you open an account 
with reports your credit history to a credit bureau; not all do.</p>
<h4>If a Spouse Should Die</h4>
<p>Under the ECOA, a creditor cannot automatically close or change the terms of a joint account solely because of the death of 
your spouse. (A &quot;joint account&quot; is one for which both spouses applied and signed the credit agreement.) In some instances 
though, a creditor may ask you to update your application or reapply. This can happen if the initial acceptance was based on all 
or part of your spouse's income and if the creditor has reason to suspect your income is inadequate to support the credit line.</p>
<p>After you submit a re-application, the creditor will determine whether to continue to extend you credit or change your credit 
limits. While your application is being reviewed, the creditor must let you use the account without new restrictions. Within 30 
days of receiving a completed application, the creditor must give you a written response on your application. If your application 
is turned down, you must be given specific reasons for denial. All these protections regarding closing or changing the terms of an 
account also apply when you retire, reach a certain age, or change your name or marital status.</p>
<h4>Kinds of Accounts</h4>
<p>To ensure that you are protected if a spouse should die, it is important to know what kind of credit accounts you have. For 
example, there are three basic kinds of credit accounts. They are:</p>
<p>An individual account, where the charge is opened in one person's name and is based only on that person's income and assets.</p>
<p>A joint account, where the charge is opened in two people's names, often a husband and wife, and is based on the income and 
assets from both or either person, and where both people are contractually liable for any debts because they signed the credit 
application.</p>
<p>A user account, where two people's name may appear on a charge card, but the account is based on the income and assets of 
just one of those people, who also is the only one legally responsible for any debts.</p>
<p>If you and your spouse share a credit account, only a joint account gives you the protections against closing the account should 
your spouse die; a user account does not. If you combine your own and your spouse's financial resources to apply for a credit 
account, make sure you are opening a joint account and not a user account, where your name simply appears on the credit card.</p>
<p>To find out what kind of account you have, check the application to see if you applied for credit as &quot;joint applicants&quot; or ask your 
creditor. That way, your credit status would be protected in the event of your spouse's death.</p>
<p>If you are concerned about your credit status if your spouse should die, you may want to try -- if you have enough income and 
assets on your own -- to open one or more individual accounts in your own name. In that way, your credit status would remain 
unaffected in the event of your spouse's death.</p>
<p>When you are applying for individual credit, you should ask the creditor to consider the credit history of accounts that are 
reported in your spouse's or former spouse's name only, as well as those that are in your name. The creditor must consider this 
information if you can show that it reflects on your ability to manage credit. For example, you may be able to show through 
cancelled checks that you made payments on an account, even though it is listed in your spouse's name only.</p>
<h4>If You Are Denied Credit</h4>
<p>While the ECOA gives you certain rights, it does not guarantee that you will be granted credit. Creditors are the ones who make 
that decision. But if you are ever denied credit, first make sure you request the reasons for the denial. It may have been an error 
or the computer system may not have evaluated all relevant information. In that case, you can ask the creditor to reconsider.</p>
<p>You might be able to negotiate a compromise with the creditor. If, for example, at the age of 70, you apply for a 30-year 
mortgage, a lender might be concerned about your ability to</p>
<p>repay the loan. However, if you applied for a 15-year mortgage, increased your downpayment, or did both, you might satisfy the 
creditor's concerns.</p>
<p>If you believe you have been discriminated against, however, you may want to write to the federal agency that regulates that 
particular creditor. You should be able to find the name and address of this federal agency in the letter turning down your request 
for credit.</p>
<p>If you do write, try to include all the facts -- including any oral statements or discussions. Keep copies of all documents and 
submit this information along with a letter of explanation to the appropriate federal agency or, if you wish, to an attorney. You 
have the right to sue a creditor who violates the ECOA.</p>

<h3>Facts for Consumers from the Federal Trade Commission</h3>
<h2>Credit Card Blocking -- March 1994</h2>
<p>Have you ever presented your credit or charge card to a store clerk and been surprised when told you were over your credit 
limit? If this happened soon after you stayed at a hotel or motel or rented a car, the problem may have been caused by credit 
card &quot;blocking.&quot;</p>
<h4>How Credit Card Blocking Works</h4>
<p>When you use a credit or charge card to check into a hotel or motel or to rent a car, the clerk usually contacts your card issuer 
electronically with the estimated cost. If the card issuer approves the transaction, your available line of credit is reduced by this 
amount. This is called a &quot;block&quot; (or &quot;authorization&quot;).</p>
<p>For example, suppose you use a credit card to check into a $100-a-night hotel for five nights. At least $500 would most likely 
be blocked on that card. In addition, hotel and car rental companies sometimes add anticipated &quot;incidental&quot; costs for such things 
as food, beverages, or gasoline. These amounts can vary widely among merchants.</p>
<p>If you pay your bill with the same credit card you used at the beginning of the transaction, the final actual charge probably will 
replace the block within a day or two.</p>
<p>If, however, you use a different credit card, cash, or a check to pay for these services, the company that issued the credit card 
you originally presented might keep the block on for as long as 15 days -- after you've checked out of the hotel or returned the 
car.</p>
<p>This delay occurs because the first card issuer does not receive notice of the final charge and, therefore, is not aware that the 
transaction has been completed. Most card issuers program their computers to retain for a specific number of days all blocks 
that have not been replaced by final charges. Issuers often choose a 10 or 15-day period because it is longer than most hotel 
stays and car rentals. Holding blocks for this long ensures that card holders do not use their entire credit limit before checking out 
of the hotel or returning their rental car, leaving the hotel or rental car company unpaid. The number of days that blocks are 
retained varies widely among card issuers.</p>
<h4>Why Credit Card Blocking Can Be a Problem</h4>
<p>Consumers who are far below their credit limit probably will not be affected by credit card blocking. But for consumers with 
charges close to their credit limit, credit card blocking can present problems. For example, consumers who need to use their 
cards for emergencies may find that, because of this temporary block, they have no credit left to use.</p>
<p>Those consumers who pay for their room or rental car with cash, a check, or a different credit card also may have problems. 
They may find that they do not have access to the amount of the block for 10 or 15 days, even though they already have paid the 
bill in full.</p>
<h4>How to Protect Yourself</h4>
<p>If you do not want the aggravation that blocking can cause, you may want to:</p>
<p>Consider paying for all hotel, motel, or rental car expenses with the same credit card you used at the beginning of the transaction.</p>
<p>Ask clerks how much is being blocked on your credit line, and how that amount was determined, when you check into a hotel or 
pick up a rental car.</p>
<p>If you pay with a different credit card or cash, ask the clerk to remove the block.</p>
<p>In addition, when selecting among credit cards, ask credit card issuers how long credit lines are blocked for transactions 
involving hotels, motels, and rental cars. You may wish to choose an issuer that removes blocks more quickly.</p>

<h3>Facts for Consumers from the Federal Trade Commission</h3>
<h2>Credit Billing Errors -- November 1992</h2>
<p>At certain times of the year, you may find yourself facing particularly large credit card bills. At those times especially, the Federal 
Trade Commission (FTC) advises you to review your billing statements with care.</p>
<p>Credit card billing errors do occur, but they are simple to resolve if you know how to use the Fair Credit Billing Act (FCBA). 
Under this law, you must send the creditor a written notice about the problem to avoid paying for any charges you dispute. Many 
consumers forfeit their rights under this Act because they rely on calling the company to correct a billing problem. You may call if 
you wish, but phoning does not trigger the legal safeguards provided under the FCBA.</p>
<p>To take full advantage of your rights under the law, this is what you need to do.</p>
<p>1. Write to the bank, the financial institution, or retailer who issued the card. Your letter must be received within 60 days after the 
issuer mailed you the first bill containing the error. In your letter include: your name and account number; the date, type, and 
dollar amount of the charge you are disputing; and why you think there was a mistake.</p>
<p>2. Be sure to send the letter to the special address for billing inquiries, as designated by the card issuer. You frequently can find 
the proper address on your bill under a heading such as &quot;send inquiries to.&quot; </p>
<p>3. Do not put your letter in the same envelope as your payment. To be sure the card issuer receives your letter, you may wish to 
send it by certified mail.</p>
<p>If you follow the previous requirements, this is what the creditor is required to do.</p>
<p>1. Acknowledge your letter in writing within 30 days after it is received, unless the problem has been resolved within that time.</p>
<p>2. Conduct a reasonable investigation and, within no more than 90 days, either explain why the bill is correct or correct the error.</p>
<p>3. Include documents showing that the charge was correct, if the creditor states the bill is correct and you asked for &quot;proof&quot; in 
your letter.</p>
<p>Under the FCBA, the card issuer cannot close your account just because you disputed a bill under the law.</p>
<p>If you continue to have problems with the card issuer, you might wish to seek legal advice or contact your local consumer 
protection agency. For more information about this law, contact the FTC for a free brochure. Write: &quot;Fair Credit Billing,&quot; Public 
Reference, Federal Trade Commission, Washington, D.C. 20580.</p>

<h3>Facts for Consumers from the Federal Trade Commission</h3>
<h2>The Credit Practices Rule -- November 1992</h2>
<p>If you are one of the millions of Americans who borrows money, buys items on installment credit, or cosigns for another person's 
debt, you may want to know about the Federal Trade Commission's Credit Practices Rule. The Rule, which became effective 
March l, 1985, prohibits many creditors from including certain provisions in consumer credit contracts. It also requires creditors 
to provide a written notice to consumers before they cosign obligations for others about their potential liability if the other person 
fails to pay. Finally, it prohibits one method of assessing late charges.</p>
<h4>What Contracts are Covered?</h4>
<p>The Rule applies to consumer credit contracts offered by finance companies, retailers (such as auto dealers and furniture and 
department stores), and credit unions for any personal purpose except to buy real estate. It does not apply to banks or bank 
credit cards; to savings and loan associations; or to some non-profit organizations. (However, similar rules for banks -- under the 
Federal Reserve Board -- and for savings and loans -- under the Office of Thrift Supervision -- went into effect January 1, 
1986.) The Rule does not apply to business credit.</p>
<h4>What Contract Provisions are Prohibited?</h4>
<p>The Rule prohibits creditors from including certain provisions in their consumer credit contracts. Specifically, credit contracts no 
longer can include provisions that:</p>
<p>Require you to agree in advance, should the creditor sue you for non-payment of a debt, to give up your right to be notified of a 
court hearing to present your side of the case or to hire an attorney to represent you. (These clauses were often called 
&quot;confessions of judgment&quot; or &quot;cognovits.&quot;)</p>
<p>Require you to give up your state-law protections that allow you to keep certain personal belongings even if you do not pay your 
debt as agreed. (These clauses were called &quot;waivers of exemption.&quot;) State law generally allows you to keep your home, clothing, 
dishes, and other belongings of a fixed minimum value. However, when the debt incurred is to purchase an item and that item is 
used as security for the debt, it is permissible under the Rule for a creditor to repossess that item.</p>
<p>Permit you to agree in advance to wage deductions that would pay the creditor directly if you default on the debt, unless you can 
cancel that permission at any time. (These clauses were called &quot;wage assignments.&quot;) However, a wage or payroll deduction plan, 
through which you arrange to repay a loan, is a common payment method and is permissible under the Rule.</p>
<p>Require you to use as collateral certain household and uniquely personal items that are of significant value to you but are of little 
economic value to a creditor. Such items include appliances, linens, china, crockery, kitchenware, wedding rings, family 
photographs, personal papers, the family Bible, and household pets. (These were called &quot;household goods security&quot; clauses.) 
However, if you borrowed money to buy any of these household or personal items, and use the items as collateral, the creditor 
can repossess the purchased item if you do not repay the loan.</p>
<h4>What Notices Must be Given to Cosigners?</h4>
<p>When you agree to be a cosigner for someone else's debt, you are guaranteeing to pay if that person fails to pay the debt. The 
Rule requires that you be given a notice that explains the responsibility you are undertaking. Under the Rule, the cosigner notice 
must say:</p>
<p>You are being asked to guarantee this debt. Think carefully before you do. If the borrower doesn't pay the debt, you will have 
to. Be sure you can afford to pay if you have to, and that you want to accept this responsibility.</p>
<p>You may have to pay up to the full amount of the debt if the borrower does not pay. You may also have to pay late fees or 
collection costs, which increase this amount.</p>
<p>The creditor can collect this debt from you without first trying to collect from the borrower.* The creditor can use the same 
collection methods against you that can be used against the borrower, such as suing you, garnishing your wages, etc. If this debt 
is ever in default, that fact may become a part of your credit record.</p>
<p>This notice is not the contract that makes you liable for the debt.</p>
<p>*Depending on your state, this may not apply. If state law forbids a creditor from collecting from a cosigner without first trying to 
collect from the primary debtor, this sentence may be crossed out or omitted on your cosigner notice.</p>
<p>This notice is not required when you receive benefits from the contract, such as when you buy goods, take out a loan, or open a 
joint credit-card account with another person. In these cases, you would be a co-buyer, co-borrower, or co-applicant 
(co-cardholder) rather than a cosigner. Therefore, the creditor would not be required to provide the notice.</p>
<h4>How Can Late Charges Be Assessed?</h4>
<p>A creditor can charge a late fee if you do not make your loan payment on time. However, it is illegal under the Rule for a creditor 
to charge you late fees or payments simply because you have not yet paid a late fee you owe. This practice is called &quot;pyramiding 
late fees.&quot; Under the Rule, this means that if you do not include the late fee you owe with your next regular payment, it is illegal 
for a creditor to subtract the late fee from your payment and then charge you a second late fee because the current payment is 
insufficient. For example, your loan contract may state that your monthly payments are $100 and that you will be assessed a $10 
late fee if you pay after the grace period. If you make your $100 loan payment after that time and you do not include the $10 late 
fee with your next $100 payment, a creditor cannot first deduct the missing $10 late fee from the $100 payment, claim you have 
now paid $90, and then charge you an additional late fee. But, if you skip one month's payment entirely, the creditor can charge 
late fees on all subsequent payments until you bring your account up to date.</p>

<h3>Facts for Business from the Federal Trade Commission</h3>
<h2>Credit Reports: What Employers Should Know About Using Them -- 
November 1992</h2>
<p>Credit reports are gaining popularity with employers faced with the task of recruiting honest, reliable employees. Some 
employers use credit reports to screen applicants for sensitive positions, such as cashiers or couriers. Other employers use credit 
reports to give them a general indication of an applicant's financial honesty and personal integrity. But many employers may not 
know that a federal law, the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), governs their use of credit reports.</p>
<p>This brochure briefly explains the FCRA and then describes how you, as an employer, can use credit reports. It also discusses 
your legal responsibility under the FCRA to notify applicants if information in their credit reports influenced your decision not to 
hire them.</p>
<h4>The Act</h4>
<p>The FCRA, which has been in effect since 1971, is designed to protect the privacy of information in credit reports and to ensure 
that information supplied by credit bureaus about consumers is as accurate as possible. The law specifically permits credit 
bureaus to release to employers credit reports for employment purposes. While the FCRA does not supersede fair employment 
laws, it allows employers to review credit records for the purpose of evaluating anyone they may hire, promote, reassign, or 
retain, consistent with other laws.</p>
<h4>The Disclosure Notice</h4>
<p>When a decision to deny employment is based on information in a credit report, the employer must disclose this fact to the 
applicant--along with the name and address of the credit bureau making the report. This is important because some credit 
reports may contain errors. The disclosure notice allows an applicant to obtain a free copy of the credit report and check it for 
accuracy and completeness.</p>
<p>The disclosure is required even if credit-report information was not the main reason the applicant was turned down. It may have 
played a small part in the overall decision, but the applicant still must be notified.</p>
<p>The disclosure requirement also pertains to any current employee who applies (and is turned down) for a new position or whose 
employment is terminated because of information in a credit report.</p>
<p>A written disclosure is not required. However, employers often provide written notices--and keep copies of them for two 
years--to show compliance with the FCRA.</p>
<h4>Some Common Situations</h4>
<p>The following examples illustrate situations where the notice must be given to job applicants.</p>
<p>A business receives 100 applications for a cashier position. It obtains credit reports on all of them and dismisses 50 from further 
consideration based on information contained in the credit report. The remaining 50 have good credit histories. All but ten of 
them are ultimately rejected for other reasons.</p>
<p>The first 50 applicants are entitled to the notice. Their rejections were based solely on their credit reports.</p>
<p>A person with an unfavorable credit history is denied employment. Although the credit history was considered a negative factor, 
the applicant's lack of relevant experience for the position was even more important.</p>
<p>The applicant is entitled to the notice because the credit report played a part--however minor--in the employer's decision.</p>
<p>An employer is looking for an employee to fill a particularly sensitive position. It rejects one applicant with a good credit 
repayment history because the report shows a debt load that may be too great for the proposed salary. Another applicant is 
rejected because the credit report shows only one trade line, and the employer prefers to hire someone who has demonstrated 
financial responsibility.</p>
<p>Both applicants are entitled to notices. If any information in the report influences an adverse decision--even though the 
information may not be otherwise thought of as &quot;negative&quot;--the disclosure must be given.</p>
<p>An employer obtains credit reports on applicants. It does not send rejection letters to those not hired. These applications are 
simply filed and later discarded.</p>
<p>Employers are not excused from their notification responsibilities merely because they had not communicated with the applicants. 
Once an applicant is no longer under consideration, in part because of something in a credit report, the notice must be given.</p>
<h4>Noncompliance with FCRA</h4>
<p>Employers who do not provide the disclosure when it is required may face several consequences. Under the FCRA, individuals 
can sue employers in federal court for actual damages suffered from an FCRA violation that occurs because of negligence. A 
person who successfully sues under the FCRA is entitled to recover court costs and a reasonable attorney's fee. The law also 
permits suing for punitive damages if it is established that the employer willfully violated the law.</p>
<p>In addition, the FTC (and other Federal agencies) may sue users of credit reports who do not comply with the FCRA. Most 
employers (except banks and a few other employers) are subject to the FTC's jurisdiction.</p>

<h3>Facts for Consumers from the Federal Trade Commission</h3>
<h2>Equal Credit Opportunity -- September 1992</h2>
<p>If you still think only of credit cards when you hear the word &quot;credit,&quot; think again. Credit is used by millions of consumers for a 
variety of purposes: to finance education, remodel homes, obtain small business loans, and for home mortgages.</p>
<p>A law passed by Congress ensures that all consumers will be given an equal chance to receive credit. The Equal Credit 
Opportunity Act says it is illegal for creditors to discriminate against applicants on the basis of their sex, marital status, race, 
national origin, religion, age or because they get public assistance income. This does not mean all consumers who apply for credit 
will get it. Creditors can still use factors such as income, expense, debts, and credit history to judge applicants. The law protects 
you when dealing with any creditor who regularly extends credit, including: banks, small loan and finance companies, retail and 
department stores, credit card companies, and credit unions. Anyone participating in the decision to grant credit, such as real 
estate brokers who arrange financing, is covered by the law. Businesses applying for credit are protected by the law, too.</p>
<p>Consumers have equal rights in every phase of the credit application process. Here is a checklist of important rights to remember 
when you request credit:</p>
<h4>When You Apply For Credit, A Creditor May Not...</h4>
<p>Discourage you from applying because of your sex, marital status, age, national origin, or because you receive public assistance 
income.</p>
<p>Ask you to reveal your sex, race, national origin, or religion. A creditor may ask you to voluntarily disclose this information if you 
are applying for a real estate loan. This information helps federal agencies enforce anti-discrimination laws. A creditor may ask 
what your residence or immigration status is.</p>
<p>Ask whether you are divorced or widowed.</p>
<p>Ask what your marital status is if you are applying for a separate, unsecured account. A creditor may ask you to reveal this 
information if you live in the &quot;community property&quot; states: Arizona, California, Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, 
and Washington. In any state, a creditor may ask for this information if you apply for a joint account or any account secured by 
property.</p>
<p>Ask you for information about your husband or wife. A creditor may ask about your spouse if: your spouse is applying with you; 
your spouse will be allowed to use the account; you are relying on your spouse's income or on alimony or child support income 
from a former spouse; or if you reside in a community property state (listed above).</p>
<p>Ask about your plans for having or raising children.</p>
<p>Ask if you receive alimony, child support, or separate maintenance payments. A creditor may ask for this information if you are 
first told that you don't have to reveal it if you won't rely on it to get credit. A creditor may ask if you have to pay alimony, child 
support, or separate maintenance payments.</p>
<h4>When Deciding To Give You Credit, A Creditor May Not...</h4>
<p>Consider your sex, marital status, race, national origin, or religion.</p>
<p>Consider whether you have a telephone listing in your name. A creditor may consider whether there is a phone in your home.</p>
<p>Consider the race of the people who live in the neighborhood where you want to buy or improve a house with borrowed money.</p>
<p>Consider your age, with certain exceptions:</p>
<p>-- if you are too young to sign contracts. Generally, this applies to those 18 and under.</p>
<p>-- if you are 62 or over, and the creditor will favor you because of your age.</p>
<p>-- if it is used to determine the meaning of other factors which are important to credit-worthiness. For example, a creditor could 
use your age to see if your income might be reduced because you are about to retire.</p>
<p>-- if it is used in a scoring system which favors applicants age 62 and over. A credit-scoring system assigns different points to 
your answers to application questions. For example, owning a home might be worth 10 points, while renting might be worth 5.</p>
<p>The total number of points helps the creditor to decide if you are credit-worthy.</p>
<h4>When Evaluating Your Income, A Creditor May Not...</h4>
<p>Refuse to consider reliable public assistance income in same manner as other income.</p>
<p>Discount income because of your sex or marital status. For example, a creditor cannot count a man's salary at 100% and a 
woman's at 75%. A creditor may not assume a woman of child-bearing age will stop work to raise children.</p>
<p>Discount or refuse to consider income because it is derived from part-time employment or from pension, annuity, or retirement 
benefits programs.</p>
<p>Refuse to consider consistently-received alimony, child support, or separate maintenance payments. A creditor may ask you for 
proof that this income has been received consistently.</p>
<h4>You Also Have The Right...</h4>
<p>To have credit in your birth name (Mary Smith), your first and your spouse's last name (Mary Jones), or your first name and a 
combined last name (Mary Smith-Jones).</p>
<p>To get credit without a co-signer, if you meet the creditor's standards.</p>
<p>To have a co-signer other than your husband or wife, if one is necessary.</p>
<p>To keep your own accounts after you change your name, marital status, reach a certain age, or retire, unless the creditor had 
evidence that you are unable or unwilling to pay.</p>
<p>To know whether your application was accepted or rejected within 30 days of filing it.</p>
<p>To know why your application was rejected. The creditor must either immediately give you the specific reasons for your 
rejection or tell you of your right to learn the reason if you ask them within 60 days. (Examples of reasons are: &quot;Your income was 
low,&quot; or &quot;You haven't been employed long enough.&quot; Examples of unacceptable reasons are: &quot;You didn't meet our minimum 
standards,&quot; or &quot;You didn't receive enough points on our credit-scoring system.&quot;) Indefinite and vague reasons are illegal--ask for 
specifics.</p>
<p>To learn the specific reasons why you were offered less favorable terms than you applied for. Example of less favorable terms 
include higher finance charges or less money than you requested. This does not hold if you accept the less favorable terms.</p>
<p>To know the specific reasons why your account was closed or why the terms of the account were made less favorable to you. 
This does not hold if these actions were taken because your account was delinquent or because you have not used the account 
for some time.</p>
<h4>A Special Note To Women</h4>
<p>A good credit history, a record of how you paid past bills, is often necessary to obtain credit. Unfortunately, this hurts many 
married, separated, divorced, and widowed women. There are two common reasons women do not have credit histories in their 
own names: they lost their credit histories when they married and changed their names; and creditors reported accounts shared 
by married couples in the husband's name only.</p>
<p>The law says that when creditors report histories to credit bureaus or to other creditors they must report information on accounts 
shared by married couples in both names. This is true only for accounts opened after June 1, 1977. If you and your spouse 
opened an account before that time, you should ask the creditor to use both names.</p>
<p>If you are married, divorced, separated, or widowed, you should make a special point to call or visit your local credit bureau(s) 
to ensure that all relevant information is in a file under your own name. To learn more about building your credit file, send for the 
free brochure, Women and Credit Histories, by writing: Public Reference, Federal Trade Commission, Washington, D.C. 
20580. You also can write to this address for a free copy of Best Sellers, which lists all the FTC's consumer information 
publications.</p>
<h4>What You Can Do If You Suspect Discrimination...</h4>
<p>Complain to the creditor. Make it known that you are aware of the law. The creditor may reverse the decision or detect an 
error.</p>
<p>Many states have their own equal credit opportunity laws. Check with your state's Attorney General's office to see if the creditor 
violated state laws. Your state may decide to take the creditor to court.</p>
<p>Bring a case in Federal district court. If you win, you can recover your damages and be awarded a penalty. You can also 
recover reasonable attorney's fees and court costs. An attorney can advise you on how to proceed.</p>
<p>Join with others to file a class action suit. You may recover punitive damages for the class of up to $500,000 or 1% of the 
creditor's net worth, whichever is less.</p>
<p>Report violations to the appropriate government agency. If you are denied credit, the creditor must give you the name and 
address of the agency to contact. While the agencies do not resolve individual complaints, they do use consumer comments to 
decide which companies to investigate. A list of agencies appears at the end of this brochure.</p>
<h4>Where To Send Complaints and Questions</h4>
<p>If a retail store, department store, small loan and finance company, mortgage company, oil company, public utility company, state 
credit union, government lending program, or travel and expense credit card company is involved, contact the Federal Trade 
Commission office nearest you:</p>

<h3>Facts for Consumers from the Federal Trade Commission</h3>
<h2>Fair Credit Billing -- December 1993</h2>
<p>Has the department store's computer ever billed you for merchandise you returned to the store or never received? Or has the 
credit card company ever charged you twice for the same item or failed to properly credit a payment made on your account?</p>
<p>Credit billing errors do occur, but they are easy to resolve if you know how to use the Fair Credit Billing Act (FCBA). Congress 
passed this law in 1975 to help consumers resolve disputes with creditors and to ensure fair handling of credit accounts.</p>
<h4>Which Credit Transactions are Covered?</h4>
<p>The FCBA generally applies only to &quot;open end&quot; credit accounts. Open end accounts include credit cards, revolving charge 
accounts (such as department store accounts), and overdraft checking. The periodic bills, or billing statements, you receive 
(usually monthly) for such accounts are covered by the FCBA. The Act does not apply to loans or credit sales which are paid 
according to a fixed schedule until the entire amount is paid back.</p>
<h4>What Types of Disputes are Covered?</h4>
<p>The FCBA settlement procedure applies only to disputes over &quot;billing errors&quot; on periodic statements, such as the following:</p>
<p>Charges not made by you or anyone authorized to use your account.</p>
<p>Charges which are incorrectly identified or for which the wrong amount or date is shown.</p>
<p>Charges for goods and services you did not accept or which were not delivered as agreed.</p>
<p>Computational or similar errors.</p>
<p>Failure to properly reflect payments or other credits, such as returns.</p>
<p>Not mailing or delivering bills to your current address (provided you give a change of address at least 20 days before the billing 
period ends).</p>
<p>Charges of which you request an explanation or written proof of purchase.</p>
<h4>How to Use the Settlement Procedure</h4>
<p>When many consumers find a mistake on their bill, they pick up the phone and call the company to correct the problem. You can 
do this if you wish, but phoning does not trigger the legal safeguards under the FCBA.</p>
<p>To be protected under the law, you must send a separate written billing error notice to the creditor. Your notice must reach the 
creditor within 60 days after the first bill containing the error was mailed to you. Send the notice to the address provided on the 
bill for billing error notices (and not, for example, directly to the store, unless the bill says that's where it should be sent). In your 
letter, you must include the following information:</p>
<p>Your name and account number.</p>
<p>A statement that you believe the bill contains a billing error and the dollar amount involved.</p>
<p>The reasons why you believe there is a mistake.</p>
<p>It's a good idea to send it by certified mail, with a return receipt requested. That way you'll have proof of the dates of mailing and 
receipt. If you wish, send photocopies of sales slips or other documents, but keep the originals for your records.</p>
<h4>What Must the Creditor Do?</h4>
<p>Your letter claiming a billing error must be acknowledged by the creditor in writing within 30 days after it is received, unless the 
problem is resolved within that period. In any case, within two billing cycles (but not more than 90 days), the creditor must 
conduct a reasonable investigation and either correct the mistake or explain why the bill is believed to be correct.</p>
<h4>What Happens While a Bill is Being Disputed?</h4>
<p>You may withhold payment of the amount in dispute including the affected portions of minimum payments and finance charges 
until the dispute is resolved. You are still required to pay any part of the bill which is not disputed, including finance and other 
charges on undisputed amounts.</p>
<p>While the FCBA dispute settlement procedure is going on, the creditor may not take any legal or other action to collect the 
amount in dispute. Your account may not be closed or restricted in any way, except that the disputed amount may be applied 
against your credit limit.</p>
<h4>What About Your Credit Rating?</h4>
<p>While a bill is being disputed, the creditor may not threaten to damage your credit rating or report you as delinquent to anyone. 
However, the creditor is permitted to report that you are disputing your bill.</p>
<p>Another federal law, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, prohibits creditors from discriminating against credit applicants who, in 
good faith, exercise their rights under the FCBA. You cannot be denied credit merely because you have disputed a bill.</p>
<h4>If the Creditor Makes a Mistake</h4>
<p>If your bill is found to contain a billing error, the creditor must write you explaining the corrections to be made on your account. 
In addition to crediting your account with the amount not owed, the creditor must remove all finance charges, late fees, or other 
charges relating to that amount. If the creditor concludes that you owe part of the disputed amount, this must be explained in 
writing. You also have the right to request copies of documents proving you owe the money.</p>
<h4>If the Bill is Correct</h4>
<p>If the creditor investigates and still believes the bill is correct, you must be told promptly in writing how much you owe and why. 
You may also ask for copies of relevant documents. At this point, you will owe the disputed amount, plus any finance charges 
that accumulated while it was disputed. You may also have to pay the minimum payment amount missed because of the dispute.</p>
<h4>If You Still Disagree</h4>
<p>Even after the FCBA dispute settlement procedure has ended, you may still feel the bill is wrong. If this happens, write the 
creditor within 10 days after receiving the explanation and say you still refuse to pay the disputed amount. At this point, the 
creditor may begin collection procedures. However, if the creditor reports you to a credit bureau as delinquent, he must also 
state that you don't think you owe the money. Also, you must be told who receives such reports.</p>
<h4>If the Creditor Doesn't Follow the Procedures</h4>
<p>Any creditor who fails to follow the FCBA dispute settlement procedure may not collect the amount in dispute, or any finance 
charges on it, up to $50, even if the bill turns out to be correct. For example, this penalty would apply if a creditor acknowledges 
your complaint in 45 days (15 days too late) or takes more than two billing cycles to resolve a dispute. It also applies if a 
creditor threatens to report -- or goes ahead and improperly reports -- your nonpayments to anyone. You also have the right, as 
more fully described below, to sue a creditor for any violation of the FCBA.</p>
<h4>Complaints About Quality</h4>
<p>Disputes about the quality of goods and services are not necessarily &quot;billing errors,&quot; so the dispute procedure may not apply. 
However, if you purchase unsatisfactory goods or services with a credit card, the FCBA allows you to take the same legal 
actions against the credit card issuer as you could take under state law against the seller. If your state law permits you to withhold 
payment to a seller for defective merchandise, or pay and sue for a refund, you might also be able to withhold payment to your 
credit card issuer. Because state laws on your right to stop payment vary, it is best to get legal advice before you do so.</p>
<p>However, before you take legal action, you must give the seller a chance to remedy the problem. Also, unless the seller is also 
the card issuer (such as a company that issued you a gasoline credit card), you must have bought the item in your home state or 
within 100 miles of your current mailing address, and the amount charged must have been more than $50.</p>
<h4>Other Billing Rights for Consumers</h4>
<p>The FCBA also requires &quot;open end&quot; creditors to do the following for their customers:</p>
<p>Give you a written notice when you open a new account, and at other specified times, describing your right to dispute billing 
errors.</p>
<p>Provide a statement for each billing period in which you owe or they owe you more than $1.00.</p>
<p>Mail or deliver your bill to you at least 14 days before the payment is due, if you are given a time period within which to pay the 
bill without incurring additional finance or other charges.</p>
<p>Credit all payments to your accounts as of the date they are received, unless not doing so would not result in extra charges.</p>
<p>Promptly credit or refund overpayments.</p>
<h4>You Can Also Sue</h4>
<p>You can sue a creditor who violates any FCBA provisions. If you win, you may be awarded damages resulting from the 
violation, plus twice the amount of any finance charge (not less than $100 or more than $1,000). The court may also order the 
creditor to pay your attorney's fees and costs. If possible, retain a private attorney who is willing to accept whatever the fee the 
court awards as the entire fee for representing you. Some lawyers may not be willing to accept your case unless you agree to pay 
their fee -- win or lose -- or if you will add to a fee awarded by the court but which they believe is too low. Be sure you get a full 
explanation of what it could cost before you go to court.</p>
<h4>Where to Report FCBA Violations</h4>
<p>The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) enforces the FCBA for almost all creditors except banks. While the Commission does 
not represent individuals in private disputes, information from consumers as to their experiences and concerns is vital to the 
enforcement of the Act. Questions or complaints may be addressed to the nearest FTC Regional Office. If they concern national 
creditors, write: Correspondence Branch, Federal Trade Commission, Washington, D.C. 20580.</p>

<h3>Facts for Consumers from the Federal Trade Commission</h3>
<h2>Fair Credit Reporting -- February 1992</h2>
<p>If you've ever applied for a charge account, a personal loan, insurance, or a job, someone is probably keeping a file on you. This 
file might contain information on how you pay your bills, or whether you've been sued, arrested, or have filed for bankruptcy. 
The companies that gather and sell this information are called &quot;Credit Reporting Agencies,&quot; or &quot;CRA's.&quot; The most common type 
of CRA is the credit bureau. The information sold by CRA's to creditors, employers, insurers, and other businesses is called a 
&quot;consumer report.&quot; This report generally contains information about where you work and live and your bill-paying habits.</p>
<p>In 1970, Congress passed the Fair Credit Reporting Act to give consumers specific rights in dealing with CRA's. The Act 
protects you by requiring credit bureaus to furnish correct and complete information to businesses to use in evaluating your 
applications for credit, insurance, or a job.</p>
<p>The Federal Trade Commission enforces the Fair Credit Reporting Act. Here are answers to some questions about consumer 
reports and CRA's.</p>
<h4>How do I locate the CRA that has my file?</h4>
<p>If your application was denied because of information supplied by a CRA, that agency's name and address must be supplied to 
you by the company you applied to. Otherwise, you can find the CRA that has your file by calling those listed in the Yellow 
Pages under &quot;credit&quot; or &quot;credit rating and reporting.&quot; Since more than one CRA may have a file about you, call each one listed 
until you locate all agencies maintaining your file.</p>
<h4>Do I have the right to know what the report says?</h4>
<p>Yes, if you request it. The CRA is required to tell you about every piece of information in the report, and in most cases, the 
sources of that information. Medical information is exempt from this rule, but you can have your physician try to obtain it for you. 
The CRA is not required to give you a copy of the report, although more and more are doing so. You also have the right to be 
told the name of anyone who received a report on you in the past six months. (If your inquiry concerns a job application, you can 
get the names of those who received a report during the past two years.)</p>
<h4>Is this information free?</h4>
<p>Yes, if your application was denied because of information furnished by the CRA, and if you request it within 30 days of 
receiving the denial notice. If you don't meet these requirements, the CRA may charge a reasonable fee.</p>
<h4>What can I do if the information is inaccurate or incomplete?</h4>
<p>Notify the CRA. They're required to reinvestigate the items in question. If the new investigation reveals an error, a corrected 
version will be sent, on your request, to anyone who received your report in the past six months. (Job applicants can have 
corrected reports sent to anyone who received a copy during the past two years.)</p>
<h4>What can I do if the CRA won't modify my report?</h4>
<p>The new investigation may not resolve your dispute with the CRA. If this happens, have the CRA include your version or a 
summary of your version of the disputed information in your file and in future reports. At your request, the CRA also will show 
your version to anyone who recently received a copy of the old report. There is no charge for this service if it's requested within 
30 days after you receive notice of your application denial. After that, there may be a reasonable charge.</p>
<h4>Do I have to go in person to get the information?</h4>
<p>No, you also may request information over the phone. But before the CRA will provide information, you must establish your 
identity by completing forms they will send you. If you do wish to visit in person, you'll need to make an appointment.</p>
<h4>Are reports prepared on insurance and job applicants different?</h4>
<p>If a report is prepared on you in response to an insurance or job application, it may be an investigative consumer report. These 
are much more detailed than regular consumer reports. They often involve interviews with acquaintances about your lifestyle, 
character, and reputation. Unlike regular consumer reports, you'll be notified in writing when a company orders an investigate 
report about you. This notice also will explain your right to ask for additional information about the report from the company you 
applied to. If your application is rejected, however, you may prefer to obtain a complete disclosure by contacting the CRA, as 
outlined in this brochure. Note that the CRA does not have to reveal the sources of the investigative information.</p>
<h4>How long can CRA's report unfavorable information?</h4>
<p>Generally, seven years. Adverse information can't be reported after that, with certain exceptions:</p>
<p>bankruptcy information can be reported for 10 years;</p>
<p>information reported because of an application for a job with a salary of more than $20,000 has no time limitation;</p>
<p>information reported because of an application for more than $50,000 worth of credit or life insurance has no time limitation;</p>
<p>information concerning a lawsuit or a judgment against you can be reported for seven years or until the statute of limitations runs 
out, whichever is longer.</p>
<h4>Can anyone get a copy of the report?</h4>
<p>No, it's only given to those with a legitimate business need.</p>
<h4>Are there other laws I should know about?</h4>
<p>Yes, if you applied for and were denied credit, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act requires creditors to tell you the specific 
reasons for your denial. For example, the creditor must tell you whether the denial was because you have &quot;no credit file&quot; with a 
CRA or because the CRA says you have &quot;delinquent obligations.&quot; This law also requires creditors to consider, upon request, 
additional information you might supply about your credit history.</p>
<p>You may wish to obtain the reason for the denial from the creditor before you go to the credit bureau.</p>
<h4>Do women have special problems with credit applications?</h4>
<p>Married and formerly married women may encounter some common credit-related problems. For more information, write for the 
free FTC brochure, Women and Credit Histories, Public Reference, Federal Trade Commission, Washington, D.C. 20580. You 
also may write to this address for a free copy of Best Sellers, which lists all the FTC's consumer and business publications.</p>
<h4>Where should I report violations of the law?</h4>
<p>Although the FTC can't act as your lawyer in private disputes, information about your experiences and concerns is vital to the 
enforcement of the Fair Credit Reporting Act. Please send questions or complaints to: Correspondence Branch, Federal Trade 
Commission, Washington, D.C. 20580.</p>

<h3>Facts for Consumers from the Federal Trade Commission</h3>
<h2>Fair Debt Collection -- September 1992</h2>
<p>If you use credit cards, owe money on a personal loan, or are paying on a home mortgage, you are a &quot;debtor.&quot; If you fall behind 
in repaying your creditors, or an error is made on your accounts, you may be contacted by a &quot;debt collector.&quot;</p>
<p>You should know that in either situation the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act requires that debt collectors treat you fairly by 
prohibiting certain methods of debt collection. Of course, the law does not forgive any legitimate debt you owe.</p>
<p>This brochure provides answers to commonly asked questions to help you understand your rights under the Fair Debt Collection 
Practices Act.</p>
<h4>What debts are covered?</h4>
<p>Personal, family, and household debts are covered under the Act. This includes money owed for the purchase of an automobile, 
for medical care, or for charge accounts.</p>
<h4>Who is a debt collector?</h4>
<p>A debt collector is any person, other than the creditor, who regularly collects debts owed to others. Under a 1986 amendment 
to the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, this includes attorneys who collect debts on a regular basis.</p>
<h4>How may a debt collector contact you?</h4>
<p>A collector may contact you in person, by mail, telephone, telegram, or FAX. However, a debt collector may not contact you at 
unreasonable times or places, such as before 8 a.m. or after 9 p.m., unless you agree. A debt collector also may not contact you 
at work if the collector knows that your employer disapproves.</p>
<h4>Can you stop a debt collector from contacting you?</h4>
<p>You may stop a collector from contacting you by writing a letter to the collection agency telling them to stop. Once the agency 
receives your letter, they may not contact you again except to say there will be no further contact. Another exception is that the 
agency may notify you if the debt collector or the creditor intends to take some specific action.</p>
<h4>May a debt collector contact any person other than you concerning your debt?</h4>
<p>If you have an attorney, the debt collector may not contact anyone other than your attorney. If you do not have an attorney, a 
collector may contact other people, but only to find out where you live and work. Collectors usually are prohibited from 
contacting such permissible third parties more than once. In most cases, the collector is not permitted to tell anyone other than 
you and your attorney that you owe money.</p>
<h4>What is the debt collector required to tell you about the debt?</h4>
<p>Within five days after you are first contacted, the collector must send you a written notice telling you the amount of money you 
owe; the name of the creditor to whom you owe the money; and what action to take if you believe you do not owe the money.</p>
<h4>May a debt collector continue to contact you if you believe you do not owe money?</h4>
<p>A collector may not contact you if, within 30 days after you are first contacted, you send the collection agency a letter stating you 
do not owe money. However, a collector can renew collection activities if you are sent proof of the debt, such as a copy of a bill 
for the amount owed.</p>
<h4>What types of debt collection practices are prohibited?</h4>
<p>Harassment. Debt collectors may not harass, oppress, or abuse any person. For example, debt collectors may not:</p>
<p>use threats of violence or harm against the person, property, or reputation;</p>
<p>publish a list of consumers who refuse to pay their debts (except to a credit bureau);</p>
<p>use obscene or profane language;</p>
<p>repeatedly use the telephone to annoy someone;</p>
<p>telephone people without identifying themselves;</p>
<p>advertise your debt.</p>
<p>False statements. Debt collectors may not use any false statements when collecting a debt. For example, debt collectors may not:</p>
<p>falsely imply that they are attorneys or government representatives;</p>
<p>falsely imply that you have committed a crime;</p>
<p>falsely represent that they operate or work for a credit bureau;</p>
<p>misrepresent the amount of your debt;</p>
<p>misrepresent the involvement of an attorney in collecting a debt;</p>
<p>indicate that papers being sent to you are legal forms when they are not;</p>
<p>indicate that papers being sent to you are not legal forms when they are.</p>
<p>Debt collectors also may not state that:</p>
<p>you will be arrested if you do not pay your debt;</p>
<p>they will seize, garnish, attach, or sell your property or wages, unless the collection agency or creditor intends to do so, and it is 
legal to do so;</p>
<p>actions, such as a lawsuit, will be taken against you, which legally may not be taken, or which they do not intend to take.</p>
<p>Debt collectors may not:</p>
<p>give false credit information about you to anyone;</p>
<p>send you anything that looks like an official document from a court or government agency when it is not;</p>
<p>use a false name.</p>
<p>Unfair practices. Debt collectors may not engage in unfair practices in attempting to collect a debt. For example, collectors may 
not:</p>
<p>collect any amount greater than your debt, unless allowed by law;</p>
<p>deposit a post-dated check prematurely;</p>
<p>make you accept collect calls or pay for telegrams;</p>
<p>take or threaten to take your property unless this can be done legally;</p>
<p>contact you by postcard.</p>
<h4>What control do you have over payment of debts?</h4>
<p>If you owe more than one debt, any payment you make must be applied to the debt you indicate. A debt collector may not apply 
a payment to any debt you believe you do not owe.</p>
<h4>What can you do if you believe a debt collector violated the law?</h4>
<p>You have the right to sue a collector in a state or federal court within one year from the date you believe the law was violated. If 
you win, you may recover money for the damages you suffered. Court costs and attorney's fees also can be recovered. A group 
of people also may sue a debt collector and recover money for damages up to $500,000, or one percent of the collector's net 
worth, whichever is less.</p>
<h4>Where can you report a debt collector for an alleged violation of the law?</h4>
<p>Report any problems you have with a debt collector to your state Attorney General's office and the Federal Trade Commission. 
Many states also have their own debt collection laws and your Attorney General's office can help you determine your rights.</p>
<p>If you have questions about the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, or your rights under the Act, write: Correspondence Branch, 
Federal Trade Commission, Washington, D.C. 20580. Although the FTC generally cannot intervene in individual disputes, the 
information you provide may indicate a pattern of possible law violations requiring action by the Commission.</p>

<h3>Facts for Consumers from the Federal Trade Commission</h3>
<h2>Fix Your Own Credit Problems -- May 1992</h2>
<p>If you are having trouble getting credit, ads that promise to fix your credit history or clean up your credit report may sound like 
the answer to your problems. But before you pay a credit repair clinic to &quot;fix&quot; your credit record, learn what the law says and 
consider saving your money by making some phone calls yourself. Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, you have the right to 
learn what your credit report says. If you have been denied credit based on a report from a credit bureau, the creditor must 
provide you with the name and address of the credit bureau it contacted. If you contact that bureau within 30 days to learn what 
is in your file, there is no charge for this service.</p>
<p>If you simply wish to learn what is in your credit file, check the Yellow Pages under Credit Bureaus or Credit Reporting 
Agencies. If several are listed, call to find which ones keep your file. Credit bureaus may charge to give you file information. 
Their fees usually range from $5 to $15.</p>
<p>After you review your credit record, contact your credit bureau if you find inaccurate information in your file. By law, the credit 
bureau must investigate it and, if it is inaccurate, remove it.</p>
<p>However, if the information is accurate, no one can require the credit bureau to remove it -- unless it is outdated. If you have 
been late paying your bills during the last seven years, the law permits the credit bureau to tell creditors about your history of late 
payments. Bankruptcy may be reported for 10 years. That is the law. If anyone tells you that they can remove negative but 
accurate information from your file, they are making promises that they cannot keep.</p>
<p>If you are having problems paying your bills and need help, you have several options. You can contact the companies you owe 
money and try to work out an adjusted repayment plan yourself, or you can check your telephone directory for non-profit 
financial counseling programs to get help. Some universities, local county extension agents, military bases, credit unions, housing 
authorities, and banks operate such programs and charge little, if anything, for their assistance.</p>
<p>You also may want to contact a Consumer Credit Counseling Service (CCCS), a non-profit organization with more than 850 
offices located in 50 states. CCCS counselors will try to arrange a repayment plan that is acceptable to you and your creditors, 
and they also will help you set up a realistic budget. Check the White Pages of your telephone directory to get the number for the 
CCCS office nearest you, or call 1-800-388-2227 using a touch-tone phone. If you have other questions, write or call: National 
Foundation for Consumer Credit, 8611 Second Avenue, Suite 100, Silver Spring, MD 20910, (301) 589-5600. For more 
information about credit, write: Solving Credit Problems, Public Reference, Federal Trade Commission, Washington, D.C. 
20580.</p>

<h3>Facts for Business from the Federal Trade Commission</h3>
<h2>Getting Business Credit -- October 1993</h2>
<p>As a business owner, or a person planning to start a business, you may need to borrow money to get started or to help your 
business develop or expand. If so, you should know about a law that protects you against illegal discrimination in business credit.</p>
<p>The Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) prohibits creditors from discriminating on the basis of certain factors unrelated to 
creditworthiness. This law also permits you to find out why your application was denied and to sue creditors who discriminate 
illegally. Here is a summary of what the law provides:</p>
<p>Credit cannot be denied on the basis of sex, marital status, race, age, national origin, or religion. This applies to you and to the 
people you deal with. For example, if you request a loan for a store in an ethnic or minority neighborhood, creditors cannot deny 
your application based on your race or the race of your customers.</p>
<p>If your application for business credit is rejected, you can find out why by making a written request for the reasons within 30 
days after you are denied credit. The creditor must give you the specific reasons in writing within 30 days after you ask. If you do 
not agree with the reasons, discuss your concerns with the lender. Complaints frequently can be resolved at this level.</p>
<p>If your business is small (less than $1 million in gross revenues), the lender must keep records of your credit application for a 
year after telling you of the credit decision.</p>
<p>If your business is larger, the lender must keep your records for only 60 days after a credit denial, and if you do not request 
reasons within 60 days, the creditor may destroy your records. However, if you request that records be kept longer, or ask for a 
written statement of the reasons for denial, the lender will maintain records relating to your application for one year. These 
records are important for any future legal action you may consider against a lender.</p>
<p>If you believe your rights have been violated, you may wish to seek legal advice. You have the right to sue a creditor who 
violates the ECOA. If your complaint is about a governmental lender, public utility company, small loan and finance company, 
travel and expense credit card company, or other non-bank creditor, you may also wish to contact the Federal Trade 
Commission. Although the FTC cannot help you resolve your individual dispute, it may be able to provide you with some useful 
information and to take enforcement action against the company if it is warranted. Write to: Correspondence Branch, Federal 
Trade Commission, Washington, DC 20580.</p>

<h3>Facts for Consumers from the Federal Trade Commission</h3>
<h2>Gold and Platinum Cards -- July 1994</h2>
<p>If you're looking for credit, be wary of some `gold' or `platinum' card offers promising to get you credit cards or improve your 
credit rating.</p>
<p>While sounding like general-purpose credit cards, some 'gold' or 'platinum' cards only permit you to buy merchandise from 
specialized catalogues. Marketers of these credit cards often promise that by participating in their credit programs, you will be 
able to get major credit cards (such as an unsecured Visa or MasterCard), lines of credit from national specialty and department 
stores, better credit reports, and other financial benefits.</p>
<p>Rarely, however, can you improve your credit rating or obtain major credit cards by purchasing 'gold' or 'platinum' credit cards. 
Often the only major credit card you might obtain is a secured credit card that requires you to make a substantial security deposit 
with a bank. In addition, many of these credit-card offerors do not report to credit bureaus, as they promise, and their cards 
seldom help secure lines of credit with other creditors.</p>
<p>Such 'gold' and 'platinum' credit-card offers are usually promoted through television or newspaper advertisements, direct mail, or 
telephone solicitations using automatic dialing machines and recorded messages. People who live in lower-income areas are often 
the target of these sales pitches.</p>
<h4>What To Watch Out For</h4>
<p>Be wary of 'gold' and 'platinum' card promotions that:</p>
<p>Charge upfront fees, without saying there may be additional costs.</p>
<p>Some 'gold' or 'platinum' credit-card promoters charge $50 or more for their card. Only after you agree to pay this fee are you 
told it costs extra, sometimes another $30 or more, to get the merchandise catalogues. Yet, these catalogues are the only places 
you can use these cards. Find out total costs before ordering any such card.</p>
<p>Use '900' or '976' telephone exchanges.</p>
<p>`Gold' and 'platinum' card advertisements may urge you to call telephone numbers with '900' or '976' exchanges for information 
about these cards. Remember: you pay for phone calls with these prefixes -- even if you never get the 'gold' or 'platinum' card 
offered. The cost of the call could be as high as $50 or more. Before you call, be sure you know the total cost of the call.</p>
<p>Misrepresent prices and payments for merchandise.</p>
<p>To purchase something from 'gold' or 'platinum' card catalogues, you're not permitted to charge the total amount on your card. 
Instead, you often must pay a cash deposit on each item you charge an amount usually equal to what the company paid for the 
product. Only after you pay your deposit can you charge the rest of the cost, and prices in these specialty catalogues are usually 
much higher than those at most discount stores.</p>
<p>Promise to get you &quot;better credit&quot; easily.</p>
<p>`Gold' and 'platinum' card marketers like to promise that it's easy to get major credit cards such as Visa or MasterCard after 
using their cards for a few months. In fact, the only Visa or MasterCard these marketers usually can get for you are secured. 
That is, you first must deposit a sum of money in a bank account, often $300 to $500, and the total you can charge on the credit 
card is limited to that amount. (Secured credit cards are available from banks, finance companies, and other credit card issuers 
even to those who do not buy a 'gold' or 'platinum' card.)</p>
<p>Some of these marketers promise to report your prompt payment for merchandise in their catalogues to credit bureaus, in order 
to boost your credit rating. In fact, many 'gold' or 'platinum' card merchants do not report to credit bureaus. As a result, using the 
card will not improve your credit rating.</p>
<h4>How To Protect Yourself</h4>
<p>To avoid being caught in a 'gold' or 'platinum' card scam, take these precautions.</p>
<p>Think twice about any offer to get &quot;easy credit.&quot;</p>
<p>There are no &quot;easy&quot; solutions to a poor credit rating that is based on accurate information. Be skeptical of any promises to erase 
bad credit or to secure major credit cards regardless of past credit problems -- whether they come from 'gold' or 'platinum' card 
offers, credit repair schemes, or similar plans.</p>
<p>Before agreeing to any gold card offer, investigate it thoroughly.</p>
<p>You may want to contact your local Better Business Bureau, consumer protection agency, or state Attorney General's office to 
see if any complaints have been lodged against a particular promoter of 'gold' or 'platinum' cards.</p>
<p>If a marketer promises you that a credit card is accepted at particular retail chains, call those stores to make sure the promise is 
true.</p>
<p>If a marketer assures you that credit bureaus will get reliable credit information about you, call those bureaus to confirm that the 
merchant is a member of the credit bureau. Unless 'gold' or 'platinum' card merchants are subscribers to credit bureaus, they are 
unable to report information concerning your credit experience.</p>
<p>Be cautious about calling '900' or '976' telephone numbers.</p>
<p>Making phone calls with '900' or '976' prefixes will cost you. Do not confuse these exchanges with toll-free '800' numbers where 
the company pays for the call. If you mistakenly call one of these numbers, contact your local phone company immediately. You 
may be able to have the charge removed from your bill.</p>
<h4>For More Information</h4>
<p>If you want more information on your credit rights or on '900' telephone numbers, contact the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) 
for free single copies of the following publications:</p>

request a copy of Best Sellers, which lists all the FTC's consumer and business publications.</p>
<p>If you have problems or questions about 'gold' or 'platinum' cards, contact your local consumer protection agency or state 
Attorney General's office. You also can contact the National Fraud Information Center at 1-800-876-7060 (9:00 a.m. - 5:30 
p.m., EST, Monday - Friday). NFIC will forward all appropriate information to the FTC.</p>

<h3>Facts for Consumers from the Federal Trade Commission</h3>
<h2>How to Dispute Credit Report Errors -- April 1994</h2>
<p>Your credit report contains important information about you. It generally includes facts about where you work and live and your 
bill-paying habits. It also may state whether you've been sued or arrested or have filed for bankruptcy. Companies called credit 
reporting agencies or credit bureaus compile and sell your credit report to businesses, which use it to evaluate your applications 
for credit, insurance, employment, and other purposes allowed by federal law. Therefore, it is important that your credit report 
contain complete and accurate information. Some financial advisors suggest that you review your report every three or four years 
to check for inaccuracies or omissions. You also may want to check your report sooner if you are considering a major purchase, 
such as buying a home.</p>
<p>This brochure explains how to obtain a copy of your credit report and how to dispute errors. It also provides a sample dispute 
letter and lists resources for additional credit information.</p>
<h4>How to Obtain Your Credit Report</h4>
<p>If you have been denied credit, insurance, or employment because of information that was supplied by a credit reporting agency, 
the Fair Credit Reporting Act requires the report recipient to give you the name and address of the credit reporting agency that 
supplied the information. If you contact that agency to learn what is in your file within 30 days of receiving the denial notice, your 
report is free.</p>
<p>If you simply want a copy of your report, call the credit reporting agencies listed in the Yellow Pages under &quot;credit&quot; or &quot;credit 
rating and reporting.&quot; Call each credit reporting agency listed since more than one agency may have a file on you, some with 
different information. You may have to pay a reasonable charge for each report.</p>
<h4>How To Correct Errors</h4>
<p>You have the right, under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, to dispute the completeness and accuracy of information in your credit 
file. When a credit reporting agency receives a dispute, it must reinvestigate and record the current status of the disputed items 
within a &quot;reasonable period of time,&quot; unless it believes the dispute is &quot;frivolous or irrelevant.&quot; If the credit reporting agency cannot 
verify a disputed item, it must delete it. If your report contains erroneous information, the credit reporting agency must correct it. 
If an item is incomplete, the credit reporting agency must complete it. For example, if your file showed that you were late in 
making payments on accounts, but failed to show that you were no longer delinquent, the credit reporting agency must show that 
your payments are now current. Or if your file showed an account that belongs only to another person, the credit reporting 
agency would have to delete it. Also, at your request, the credit reporting agency must send a notice of correction to any report 
recipient who has checked your file in the past six months.</p>
<p>If a reinvestigation does not resolve your dispute, the Fair Credit Reporting Act permits you to file a statement of up to 100 
words to explain your side of the story. The credit reporting agency must include this explanation in your report each time it 
sends it out. Credit reporting agency employees often are available to help you word your statement.</p>
<p>Be aware, however, that when negative information in your report is accurate, only the passage of time can assure its removal. 
Credit reporting agencies are permitted by law to report bankruptcies for 10 years and other negative information for 7 years. 
Also, any negative information may be reported indefinitely for use in the evaluation of your application for:</p>
<p>$50,000 or more in credit;</p>
<p>a life insurance policy with a face amount of $50,000 or more; or</p>
<p>consideration for a job paying $20,000 or more.</p>
<h4>How to Register a Dispute</h4>
<p>You must make your dispute directly to the credit reporting agency. Although the Fair Credit Reporting Act does not require it, 
the Federal Trade Commission staff recommends that you submit your dispute in writing, along with copies (NOT originals) of 
documents that support your position.</p>
<p>In addition to providing your complete name and address, your letter should clearly identify each item in your report you dispute, 
explain why you dispute the information, state the facts, and request deletion or correction. You may want to enclose a copy of 
your report with the items in question circled. Your letter may look something like the one at the end of this brochure.</p>
<p>Send your dispute by certified mail, return receipt requested, and keep copies of your dispute letter and enclosures. By doing so, 
you can document what the credit reporting agency received.</p>
<h4>Adding Accounts to Your File</h4>
<p>Your credit file may not reflect all of your credit accounts. Although most national department store and all-purpose bank credit 
card accounts will be included in your file, not all creditors supply information to credit reporting agencies. Those not reporting to 
credit reporting agencies include, for example, some travel, entertainment, and gasoline card companies, local retailers, and credit 
unions.</p>
<p>If you have been told that you were denied credit because of an &quot;insufficient credit file&quot; or &quot;no credit file&quot; and you have accounts 
with creditors that do not appear in your credit file, you can ask the credit reporting agency to add this information to future 
reports. Although they are not required to do so, many credit reporting agencies will add other verifiable accounts for a fee.</p>

<h3>Facts for Consumers from the Federal Trade Commission</h3>
<h2>Lost or Stolen: Credit and ATM Cards -- August 1992</h2>
<p>A joint production of the Federal Trade Commission and Citibank N.A.</p>
<p>Increasingly, people find it convenient to shop with credit cards or to bank at automated teller machines (ATMs) with ATM 
cards. But the ease with which these cards can be used also makes them very attractive to thieves.</p>
<p>Loss or theft of credit and ATM cards is a serious consumer problem. However, two federal laws, the Fair Credit Billing Act 
(FCBA) and the Electronic Fund Transfer Act (EFTA), establish procedures for you and your creditors to follow to resolve 
problems with credit cards and electronic fund transfer accounts. This brochure explains what to do if any of your cards are 
missing or stolen, suggests how to protect your cards, and explains what you can expect from a credit card registration or 
protection service.</p>
<h4>Limiting Your Financial Loss</h4>
<p>There are at least two good financial reasons for you to report the loss or theft of your credit and ATM cards quickly. First, the 
sooner you report the loss, the more likely you will limit your liability if someone uses your card without your permission. Most 
card fraud occurs within the first 48 hours after a card is stolen.</p>
<p>Second, the sooner you report any loss, the more card costs in general can be kept down. You pay higher interest rates and 
annual fees because card fraud costs issuers hundreds of millions of dollars each year.</p>
<p>If any of your cards are missing or stolen, report the loss as soon as possible to your card issuers. Some companies have 
toll-free or WATS numbers printed on their statements and 24-hour service to accept such emergency information. For your 
own protection, you should follow up your phone calls with a letter to each card issuer. The letter should give your card number, 
say when your card was missing, and mention the date you called in the loss.</p>
<p>You may wish to check your homeowner's insurance policy to see if it covers your liability for card thefts. If not, some insurance 
companies will allow you to change your current policy to include protection for card losses.</p>
<p>Credit Card Loss. If you report the loss before these cards are used, the FCBA says the card issuer cannot hold you responsible 
for any unauthorized charges. If a thief uses your cards before you report them missing, the most you will owe for unauthorized 
charges on each card is $50. This is true even if a thief is able to use your credit card at an ATM machine to access your credit 
card account.</p>
<p>However, it is not enough simply to report your credit card loss. After the card loss, review your billing statements carefully. If 
your statements show any charges not made by you, send a letter to the card issuer describing each questionable charge on your 
account. Again, tell the card issuer the date your card was lost or stolen and when you reported it to them. Be sure to send the 
letter to the address provided for billing errors. Do not send it with a payment or to the address where you send your payments 
unless you are directed to do so.</p>
<p>ATM Card Loss. If you report an ATM card missing before it is used without your permission, the EFTA says the card issuer 
cannot hold you responsible for any unauthorized withdrawals. If unauthorized use occurs before you report it, the amount you 
can be held responsible for depends upon how quickly you report the loss to the card issuer. For example, if you report the loss 
within two business days after you realize your card is missing, you will not be responsible for more than $50 for unauthorized 
use.</p>
<p>However, you could lose as much as $500 because of an unauthorized withdrawal from your bank account if you do not tell the 
card issuer within the two business days after you discover the loss. And, you risk unlimited loss if, within 60 days after your 
bank statement is mailed to you, you do not report an unauthorized transfer or withdrawal. That means you could lose all the 
money in your bank account and the unused portion of your maximum line of credit established for overdrafts.</p>
<p>If any unauthorized transactions appear on your bank statement, report them to the card issuer as soon as you can. As with a 
credit card, once you have reported the loss of your ATM card you cannot be held liable for additional amounts, even if more 
unauthorized transactions are made.</p>
<h4>Protecting Your Cards</h4>
<p>The best protections against card fraud, of course, are to know where your cards are at all times and to keep them secure. For 
ATM card protection, it is important to keep your Personal Identification Number (PIN) a secret. Memorize this number. 
Statistics show that in one-third of ATM card frauds, cardholders wrote their PINS on their ATM cards or on slips of paper 
they kept with their cards.</p>
<p>The following suggestions may help you protect your credit and ATM card accounts.</p>
<p>For credit cards:</p>
<p>Be cautious about disclosing your account number over the phone unless you know you are dealing with a reputable company.</p>
<p>Never put your account number on the outside of an envelope or on a postcard.</p>
<p>Draw a line through blank spaces on charge slips above the total so the amount cannot be changed.</p>
<p>Do not sign a blank charge slip unless absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>Rip up carbons from the charge slip and save your receipts to check against your monthly billing statements.</p>
<p>Open billing statements promptly and compare them with your receipts. If there are any mistakes or differences, report them as 
soon as possible to the special address listed on the billing statement for &quot;billing inquiries.&quot; Under the FCBA, the card issuer must 
investigate billing errors if you report them within 60 days of the date your card issuer mailed you the statement.</p>
<p>Keep in a safe place (away from where you keep your cards) a record of your card numbers, expiration dates, and the 
telephone numbers of each credit-card company for the emergency of reporting losses.</p>
<p>Carry only those cards that you regularly need, especially when traveling.</p>
<p>For ATM cards:</p>
<p>Select a PIN (personal identification number) that is different from other numbers noted in your wallet, such as your address, 
birthdate, phone, or social security number.</p>
<p>Memorize your PIN.</p>
<p>Do not write your PIN on your ATM card or carry your PIN in your wallet or purse.</p>
<p>Never put your PIN on the outside of a deposit slip, an envelope, or on a postcard.</p>
<p>Examine all ATM receipts and bank statements as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Buying a Card Registration Service</p>
<p>Many companies offer card registration and protection services that will notify all companies where you have credit and ATM 
card accounts in case your card is lost or stolen. With this service, you need make only one phone call to report all card losses 
instead of calling each card issuer individually. Also, most services will request replacement cards on your behalf. Registration 
services usually cost $10 to $35 yearly.</p>
<p>Purchasing a card registration may be a convenience to you, but it is not required by card issuers. The FCBA and the EFTA give 
you the right to contact credit card companies and ATM card issuers directly in the event of loss or suspected unauthorized use.</p>
<p>If you do decide to buy a registration service, compare offers and look for one that will best suit your needs. Read the service 
contract carefully to check the company's obligations and your liability. For example, will the company reimburse you if it fails to 
notify charge card loss promptly after you report the loss? If not, you could be liable for unauthorized charges.</p>

<h3>Facts for Consumers from the Federal Trade Commission</h3>
<h2>Scoring for Credit -- October 1993</h2>
<p>How does a creditor decide whether to lend you money for such things as a new car or a home mortgage? Many creditors use a 
system called &quot;credit scoring&quot; to determine whether you are a good credit risk. Based on how well you score, a creditor may 
decide to extend credit to you or turn you down. The following questions and answers may help you understand who gets credit, 
and why.</p>
<h4>What is Credit Scoring?</h4>
<p>Credit scoring is a system used by some creditors to determine whether to give you a loan or credit card. The creditor may 
examine your past credit history to evaluate how promptly you pay your bills and look at other factors as well, such as the 
amount of your income, whether you own a home, and how many years you have worked at your job. A credit scoring system 
awards points for each factor that the creditor considers important. Creditors generally offer credit to those consumers awarded 
the most points because those points help predict who is most likely to pay back the debt.</p>
<h4>Why is Credit Scoring Used?</h4>
<p>In smaller communities, shopkeepers, bankers, and others who extend credit often knew by word of mouth who paid their debts 
and who did not. As some creditors became larger and as the number of their consumer credit applications grew, these creditors 
needed to establish more systematic and efficient methods for evaluating which consumers were good credit risks. Credit scoring 
is one such technique.</p>
<p>Although smaller creditors still may rely on informal credit evaluations, many large companies now use formal credit scoring 
systems. Although no system is perfect, credit scoring systems can be at least as accurate as informal methods for granting credit 
-- and often are more so -- because they treat all applicants objectively.</p>
<h4>How is a Credit Scoring System Developed?</h4>
<p>Most credit scoring systems are unique because they are based on a creditor's individual experiences with customers. To 
develop a system, a creditor will select a random sample of its customers and analyze it statistically to identify which 
characteristics of those customers could be used to demonstrate creditworthiness. Then, again using statistical methods, a 
creditor will weigh each of these factors based on how well each predicts who would be a good credit risk.</p>
<h4>How is a Consumer's Application Scored?</h4>
<p>To illustrate how credit scoring works, consider the following example that uses only three factors to determine whether someone 
is creditworthy. (Most systems have 6 to 15 factors.)</p>
<p>EXAMPLE</p>
<pre>
Monthly income     Points Awarded

</pre>
<p>Less than $400 0 $400 to $650 3 $651 to $800 7 $801 to $1,200 12 $1,200 + 15 </p>
<p>Age</p>
<p>21-28 11 28-35 5 36-48 2 48-61 12 61 + 15 </p>
<p>Telephone in home</p>
<p>Yes 12 No 0 </p>
<p>Some credit scoring systems award fewer points to people in their thirties and forties, because these individuals often have a 
relatively high amount of debt at that stage of their lives. The law permits creditors using properly-designed scoring systems to 
award points based on age, but people who are 62 or older must receive the maximum number of points for this factor.</p>
<p>If, for example, you needed a score of 25 to get credit, you would need to make sure you had enough income at a certain age 
(and, perhaps a telephone) to qualify for credit.</p>
<p>Remember, this example shows very generally how a credit scoring system works. Most credit scoring systems consider more 
factors than this example -- sometimes as many as 15 or 20. Usually these factors are obviously related to your credit 
worthiness. Sometimes, however, additional factors are included that may seem unusual. For example, some systems score the 
age of your car. While this may seem unrelated to creditworthiness, it is legal to use factors like these as long as they do not 
illegally discriminate on race, sex, martial status, national origin, religion, or age.</p>
<h4>How Valid is the Credit Scoring System?</h4>
<p>With credit scoring systems, creditors are able to evaluate millions of applicants consistently and impartially on many different 
characteristics. But credit scoring systems must be based on large enough numbers of recent accounts to make them statistically 
valid.</p>
<p>Although you may think that such a system is arbitrary or impersonal, a properly developed credit scoring system can make 
decisions faster and more accurately than an individual can. And many creditors design their systems so that marginal cases -- 
not high enough to pass easily or low enough to fail definitively -- are referred to a credit manager who personally decides 
whether the company will extend credit to a consumer. This may allow for discussion and negotiation between the credit manager 
and a consumer.</p>
<h4>What Happens If You Are Denied Credit?</h4>
<p>While a creditor is not required to tell you the factors and points used in its scoring system, the creditor must tell you why you 
were rejected for credit. This is required under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA).</p>
<p>So if, for example, a creditor says you were denied credit because you have not worked at your current job long enough, you 
might want to reapply after you have been at that job longer. Or, if you were denied credit because your debt-free 
monthly-income was not high enough, you might want to pay some of your bills and reapply. Remember, also, that credit scoring 
systems differ from creditor to creditor, so you might get credit if you applied for it elsewhere.</p>
<p>Sometimes you can be denied credit because of a bad credit report. If so, the Fair Credit Reporting Act requires the creditor to 
give you the name and address of the credit reporting bureau that reported the information. You might want to contact that credit 
bureau to find out what your credit report said. This information is free if you request it within 30 days of being turned down for 
credit. Remember that the credit bureau can tell you what is in your report, but only the creditor can tell you why it denied your 
application.</p>
<h4>Where Can You Go For More Information?</h4>
<p>If you have additional questions about credit scoring issues, write to: Correspondence Branch, Federal Trade Commission, 
Washington, D.C. 20580. While the FTC cannot resolve individual problems for consumers, it can act when it sees a pattern of 
possible law violations.</p>

<h3>Facts for Consumers from the Federal Trade Commission</h3>
<h2>Secured Credit Card Marketing Scams -- September 1993</h2>
<p>ANYONE CAN QUALIFY FOR A MAJOR CREDIT CARD!</p>
<p>Separated? Divorced? Bankrupt? Widowed? BAD CREDIT? NO CREDIT? NO PROBLEM!</p>
<p>Make the call NOW and get the credit you deserve!</p>
<p>Even if you've been turned down before, you owe it to yourself and your family.</p>
<p>Your major credit card is waiting.</p>
<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>If you have no credit or a poor credit history, this ad may appeal to you. Before you respond, read this brochure. Using a 
secured credit card can be an effective way to build or re-establish your credit history. However, be aware that some marketers 
of secured credit cards make deceptive advertising claims to get you to respond to their ads.</p>
<p>This brochure explains the differences between a secured and unsecured credit card, describes how marketing scams are used to 
sell secured credit cards, and tells how to recognize and avoid deceptive credit card offers. Some organizations that offer 
additional consumer credit information and assistance are listed at the end of this brochure.</p>
<h4>Secured versus Unsecured Cards</h4>
<p>Secured and unsecured credit cards work the same way; both can be used to pay for goods and services. However, a secured 
card requires you to open and maintain a savings account as security for your line of credit; an unsecured card does not. The 
savings account for a secured card may range from a few hundred to several thousand dollars. Your credit line will be a 
percentage of your deposit, typically from 50 to 100 percent. Usually, a bank will pay interest on your deposit. Also, you may 
have to pay application and processing fees that sometimes amount to hundreds of dollars. Before you apply, be sure to ask 
what the total fees are and if they will be refunded if you are denied a card.</p>
<p>A secured credit card also typically requires an annual fee and has higher interest rates than unsecured cards.</p>
<h4>Deceptive Ads and Scams</h4>
<p>The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has taken action against companies that deceptively advertise Visa and MasterCards 
through television, newspapers, and postcards. The ads may offer unsecured credit cards, secured credit cards, or not specify a 
type of card. The ads typically are phrased to make you believe you can get a credit card simply by calling a telephone number 
listed in the ad. Sometimes the number is not toll-free. A &quot;900&quot; number service, for which you will be billed just for making the 
call, may instruct you to give your name and address to receive a credit application, or it may give you a list of banks offering 
secured cards, or direct you to call another &quot;900&quot; number at an additional charge to get more information. Be aware that 
deceptive ads often leave out important information.</p>
<p>They often omit the cost of the &quot;900&quot; telephone call, which can range from $2 to $50, or more.</p>
<p>The ads often do not mention a required security deposit, and application and processing fees for the secured card.</p>
<p>The ads frequently fail to say anything about income and age requirements.</p>
<p>The ads may not mention the annual fee for the secured card and a higher than average interest rate on any balance.</p>
<h4>How to Avoid the Scam</h4>
<p>To avoid being victimized by a secured credit card marketing scam, look for the following signals.</p>
<p>Beware of offers of easy credit. No one can guarantee to get you credit. Before deciding whether to give you a credit card, 
legitimate credit providers examine your credit history through a credit report.</p>
<p>Think twice before making a call to a &quot;900&quot; telephone number for a credit card. Remember: you pay for calls with a &quot;900&quot; prefix 
and may never receive a credit card.</p>
<p>Be wary of credit cards offered by &quot;credit repair&quot; companies or &quot;credit clinics.&quot; These businesses also may offer to clean-up your 
credit history for a fee. However, you can correct genuine mistakes or outdated information yourself by contacting credit bureaus 
directly. But remember, only time and good credit will repair your credit report if you have a poor credit history.</p>
<h4>Credit Reporting</h4>
<p>If you are considering a secured card as a means to build or re-establish a credit record, make sure the issuer reports to a credit 
bureau. Your credit history is maintained by companies called credit bureaus that collect information reported to them by banks, 
mortgage companies, department stores, and other creditors. If your card issuer does not report to a credit bureau, the card will 
not help you build a credit history.</p>
<h4>For More Information and Assistance</h4>
<p>To build a credit record, you may want to apply for a charge card or a small loan at a local store or lending institution. Ask if the 
creditor reports transactions to a credit bureau. If they do and you pay back your debts regularly, you will build a good credit 
history.</p>
<p>If you cannot get credit on your own, you also can ask a relative or friend with a good credit history to act as your co-signer. 
The cosigner must promise to repay the debt if you do not.</p>
<p>If you are interested in applying for a secured credit card, the BankCard Holders of America (BHA) provides a list of institutions 
offering secured cards. BHA's &quot;Secured Card List&quot; is free to BHA members, $4.00 for non-members. Write to:</p>
<p>BankCard Holders of America 560 Herndon Parkway, Suite 120 Herndon, VA 22070.</p>
<p>If you are having difficulty paying your bills, you may want to contact a Consumer Credit Counseling Service (CCCS). This is a 
non-profit organization with more than 850 offices located in 50 states that counsels heavily-indebted consumers. Check the 
White Pages of your telephone directory to get the number for the CCCS office nearest you, or call 1-800-388-2227 using a 
touch-tone phone. If you have other questions, write or call:</p>
<p>National Foundation for Consumer Credit 8611 Second Avenue, Suite 100 Silver Spring, MD 20910 (301) 589-5600</p>

<h3>Facts for Consumers from the Federal Trade Commission</h3>
<h2>Solving Credit Problems -- May 1992</h2>
<p>If you are having problems getting credit or paying your monthly bills, you may be tempted to turn to businesses that advertise 
quick and easy solutions to credit problems. But do not be misled. There are no instant solutions. Although some credit 
counseling businesses &quot;guarantee results or your money back,&quot; you may find that there are hidden strings attached or that the 
company is gone when you want your money back.</p>
<p>There are steps you can take to help solve your credit problems. However, solving them takes time, patience, and some 
understanding of the law. This brochure may help you. It explains why your credit history is important, how to build a credit 
history and establish credit, and what can be done to improve a bad credit history. It also suggests ways to help deal with debts 
you may have, possibly by using a non-profit Consumer Credit Counseling Service.</p>
<h4>Why Your Credit History is Important</h4>
<p>Although creditors usually consider a number of factors in deciding whether to grant credit, most creditors rely heavily on your 
credit history. To learn how you have handled credit in the past, most creditors obtain a report from your local credit bureau. 
Credit bureaus gather and sell credit information about consumers and are a principal source of information about your credit 
history. Your credit bureau report is based on information supplied over time by your creditors. It also provides information on 
where you live and work and may note other matters of public record such as judgments or bankruptcies. Your report records 
payments you have made on credit cards, installment loans, and other credit accounts and helps creditors predict whether you 
are likely to be a good credit risk. A history of timely credit payments helps you get additional credit.</p>
<p>Some creditors are reluctant to grant credit to consumers who have not established a &quot;track record&quot; with other creditors first. In 
addition, many creditors will not extend credit to consumers with a history of delinquent payments, repossession, judgments, or 
bankruptcy. If you are in either situation, be wary of ads that promise you &quot;instant credit&quot; or &quot;a major credit card regardless of 
your lack of credit history or your past credit record.&quot; The fact is that all legitimate creditors want to know whether you are likely 
to be a good credit risk. Whether you get credit will depend on whether your qualifications meet the creditor's criteria. No one 
can guarantee you credit in advance.</p>
<h4>How to Build A Credit History and Establish Credit</h4>
<p>Building a good credit history is important. If you have no reported credit history, it may take time to establish your first credit 
account. This problem affects young people just beginning careers as well as older people who have never used credit. It also 
affects divorced or widowed women who shared credit accounts that were reported only in the husband's name. If you do not 
know what is in your credit file, check with your local credit bureaus. Most cities have two or three credit bureaus, which are 
listed under &quot;Credit&quot; or &quot;Credit Reporting Agencies&quot; in the Yellow Pages. For a small fee, they will tell you what information is in 
your file and may give you a copy of your credit report.</p>
<p>If you have had credit before under a different name or in a different location and it is not reported in your file, ask the credit 
bureau to include it. If you shared accounts with a former spouse, ask the credit bureau to list these accounts under your name as 
well. Although credit bureaus are not required to add new accounts to your file, many will do so for a small fee. Finally, if you 
presently share in the use of a credit account with your spouse, ask the creditor to report it under both names.</p>
<p>Creditors are not required to report any account history information to credit bureaus. If a creditor does report on an account, 
however, and if both spouses are permitted to use the account or are contractually liable for its repayment, under the Equal 
Credit Opportunity Act you can require the creditor to report the information under both names. When contacting your creditor 
or credit bureau, do so in writing and include relevant information, such as account numbers, to help speed the process. As with 
all important business communications, keep a copy of what you send.</p>
<p>If you do not have a credit history, you should begin to build one. If you have a steady income and have lived in the same area 
for at least a year, try applying for credit with a local business, such as a department store. Or you might borrow a small amount 
from your credit union or the bank where you have checking and savings accounts. A local bank or department store may 
approve your credit application even if you do not meet the standards of larger creditors. Before you apply for credit, ask 
whether the creditor reports credit history information to credit bureaus serving your area. Most creditors do, but some do not. If 
possible, you should try to get credit that will be reported. This builds your credit history.</p>
<p>If you are rejected for credit, find out why. There may be reasons other than lack of credit history. Your income may not meet 
the creditor's minimum requirement or you may not have worked at your current job long enough. Time may resolve such 
problems. You could wait for a salary increase and then reapply, or simply apply to a different creditor. However, it is best to 
wait at least 6 months before making each new application. Credit bureaus record each inquiry about you. Some creditors may 
deny your application if they think you are trying to open too many new accounts too quickly.</p>
<p>If you still cannot get credit, you may wish to ask a person with an established credit history to act as your co-signer. Because a 
co-signer promises to pay if you don't, this can substantially improve your chances of getting credit. Once you have repaid the 
debt, try again to get credit on your own.</p>
<h4>What Can Be Done to Improve a Bad Credit Report</h4>
<p>You are entitled by law to correct any inaccurate information that appears in your credit bureau file. If a creditor rejects your 
application because of negative information in your credit bureau report, it must identify the credit bureau involved. At your 
request, the credit bureau must disclose the contents of your credit file. If you act within 30 days of being turned down, there is 
no charge for this service.</p>
<p>Check to see whether the information in your credit report is accurate and complete. You have the right, under the Fair Credit 
Reporting Act, to dispute the completeness or accuracy of any information in your report. When you do so, it helps to tell the 
credit bureau, in writing, why you think the information is not correct. Unless your dispute is frivolous or irrelevant, the credit 
bureau then must reinvestigate the matter. The credit bureau must correct any information that it finds is not reported accurately. 
Information that cannot be verified must be deleted. If you disagree with the results of the credit bureau's reinvestigation, you may 
file a brief dispute statement explaining your side of the story. At your request, the credit bureau will note your dispute in future 
credit bureau reports. Be aware that when negative information in your report is accurate, only the passage of time can assure its 
removal. Credit bureaus are permitted by law to report bankruptcies for 10 years and other negative information for 7 years. 
There is nothing that you (or anyone else) can do to require a credit bureau to remove accurate information from your credit file 
until the reporting period has expired. Don't be misled by ads aimed at people with bad credit histories, judgments, or 
bankruptcies. Promises to &quot;repair&quot; or &quot;clean up&quot; a bad credit history can almost never be kept.</p>
<h4>How to Deal with Your Debts</h4>
<p>A sudden illness or the loss of your job may make it impossible for you to pay your bills on time. Whatever your situation, if you 
find that you cannot make your payments, contact your creditors at once. Try to work out a modified payment plan with your 
creditors that reduces your payments to a more manageable level. If you have paid promptly in the past, they may be willing to 
work with you. Do not wait until your account is turned over to a debt collector. At that point, the creditor has given up on you.</p>
<p>Automobile loans present special problems. Most automobile financing agreements permit your creditor to repossess your car 
any time that you are in default on your payments. No advance notice is required. If your car is repossessed you may have to 
pay the full balance due on the loan, as well as towing and storage costs, to get it back. Do not wait until you are in default. Try 
to solve the problem with your creditor when you realize you will not be able to meet your payments. It may be better to sell the 
car yourself and pay off your debt than to incur the added costs of repossession.</p>
<h4>How to Evaluate Credit Repair Companies</h4>
<p>If you are having trouble paying your bills, you may be tempted to turn to a company that claims to offer assistance in solving 
debt problems. Such businesses may offer debt consolidation loans, debt counseling, or debt reorganization plans that are 
&quot;guaranteed&quot; to stop creditors' collection efforts. Before signing up with such a business, investigate it thoroughly. Be sure you 
understand what services the business provides and what they will cost you. Do not rely on oral promises that do not appear in 
your contract. Also, check with the Better Business Bureau and your local consumer protection office. They may be able to tell 
you whether other consumers have registered complaints about the business.</p>
<p>Consumers who turn to such businesses for help sometimes encounter additional problems. For example, debt consolidation or 
other large short-term loans may have high hidden costs and may require your home as collateral. An unscrupulous company 
may misrepresent the terms of such loan agreements; if so, you could end up losing your home.</p>
<p>Businesses offering debt counseling or reorganization may charge substantial fees or a percentage of your debts, but fail to follow 
through on the services they sell. Some may do little more than refer indebted consumers to a bankruptcy lawyer, who charges 
an additional fee. Businesses advertising voluntary debt reorganization plans or &quot;Chapter 13&quot; relief may fail to explain that 
Chapter 13 debt adjustment actually is a form of bankruptcy. To qualify for it, you must have a source of regular income and a 
plan for repaying your creditors that meets the approval of the bankruptcy court. Businesses that sell bankruptcy-related services 
may not tell you all that is involved or assist you through what can be a complex and lengthy legal process. Debt problems can be 
distressing, but be careful when selecting a solution. Some &quot;solutions&quot; may only add to your problems.</p>
<h4>Where to Find Low-Cost Help</h4>
<p>If you need help in dealing with your debts, you may want to contact a Consumer Credit Counseling Service (CCCS). This is a 
non-profit organization with more than 850 offices located in 50 states. CCCS counselors will try to arrange a repayment plan 
that is acceptable to you and your creditors. They will also help you set up a realistic budget and plan future expenses. These 
services are offered at little or no charge to you. You can find the CCCS office nearest you by checking the White Pages of your 
telephone directory or by calling from a touch-tone phone 1-800-388-2227 to get the telephone number. However, if you have 
other questions, contact:</p>
<p>National Foundation for Consumer Credit, Inc. 8611 Second Avenue, Suite 100 Silver Spring, Maryland 20910 (301) 
589-5600</p>
<p>In addition, non-profit counseling programs are sometimes operated by universities, military bases, credit unions, and housing 
authorities. They are likely to charge little or nothing for their assistance. Or, you can check with your local bank or consumer 
protection office to see if it has a listing of reputable, low-cost financial counseling services.</p>
<h4>Where to Find More Information</h4>
<p>The Federal Trade Commission enforces a number of federal laws involving consumer credit, including the Equal Credit 
Opportunity Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Truth in Lending Act, the Fair Credit Billing Act, and the Fair Debt 
Collection Practices Act. It also provides free brochures explaining these laws. For these or related publications, such as Building 
a Better Credit Record, Women and Credit Histories, and Credit Billing Blues, write to: Public Reference, Federal Trade 
Commission, Washington, D.C. 20580.</p>
<p>Although the Commission cannot solve individual problems for consumers, it can act when it sees a pattern of possible law 
violations develop. If you have a complaint that may involve a violation of consumer protection law, write to: Correspondence 
Branch, Federal Trade Commission, Washington, D.C. 20580.</p>

<h3>Facts for 
Consumers from the Federal Trade Commission</h3>
<p> 
<p> 
<h2>Using Plastic: A Young Adult's Guide to Credit 
Cards -- July 1992</h2><p> 
<p> 
Some of your friends may have credit cards already. At first 
glance, a credit card gives you freedom to buy something on the 
spur of the moment -- without worrying if you have enough cash 
in your pocket. It makes shopping look incredibly easy: just 
one payment at the end of the month.<p> 
<p> 
But if you talk to friends or adults about using credit cards, 
you may find that there are drawbacks. Some credit card users 
find they've spent too much money on too many things. Some can't 
pay their bills on time. And, those who have trouble paying back 
their debts may find they can't borrow money when they want to 
make a really important purchase -- like a car or a house.<p> 
<p> 
The key to using a credit card wisely is knowing how to use it 
responsibly. We hope this brochure helps you do that by highlighting 
the important things all credit card users should know.<p> 
<p> 
<h4>"I want to get my first credit card. How 
do I do it?"</h4><p> 
<p> 
You may be able to get your first credit card with your name 
on it through your parents. By having your parents co-sign for 
the card, you use your parents' income and good repayment history 
to qualify. You then can make purchases with the credit card, 
and you or your parents can pay the bills.<p> 
<p> 
If you have a job or other income, you may be able to get a credit 
card on your own. This is important because if you want to use 
credit regularly -- and someday apply for even more credit -- 
you will need to establish your own "credit history."<p> 
<p> 
This credit history (prepared as a "credit report" by a credit 
bureau) is a description of how responsibly you handle credit 
-- for example, whether you pay bills on time. Financial institutions 
usually check your credit report before lending you money or 
issuing you a credit card. To establish your credit history:<p> 
<p> 
1.  Apply for a credit card at a local store or a small loan 
at a local lending institution. Ask the creditor if the store 
or lending institution reports credit histories to a credit bureau. 
If they do      and you pay back your debts regularly, you will 
compile a good credit history.<p> 
<p> 
 2.  Ask the creditor for specific reasons if you are ever turned 
down for credit. For example, your current salary might not be 
high enough or you may not have worked at your current job long 
enough. Time may resolve these matters. Reapply for credit when 
your situation changes.<p> 
 3.  Ask someone with an established credit history (such as 
a relative) to act as your co-signer if you cannot get credit 
on your own. The co-signer must promise to pay your debts if 
you don't. If you use a co-signer, repay your debt promptly and 
try again to get credit on your own.<p> 
<p> 
<h4>"There are so many credit cards. Which one 
should I apply for?"</h4> <p> 
<p> 
 If you are choosing a credit card, think about how you will 
use it. You may want to compare the following cost features to 
see which card will best suit your financial needs.<p> 
<p> 
1.  Annual percentage rate (APR): The APR measures the cost of 
credit on an annual basis and may be the easiest way to compare 
costs among credit cards. Usually, the lower the APR, the less 
you'll be charged for credit. The APR includes the interest rate 
and other costs, such as service charges or loan fees. If you 
expect to pay back less than the full amount you charge each 
month, you'll have to pay finance charges on the unpaid balance. 
In this case, choose a card with a low      APR.<p> 
<p> 
 2.  Annual fees: Many companies charge an annual fee, no matter 
how much or little you use their credit card. But if you intend 
to pay your credit card bills in full each month, you may not 
have to pay monthly finance charges. In this case, a card with 
a low annual fee may be more important to you than one with a 
low APR.<p> 
<p> 
 3.  Grace periods: This "free" period allows you to avoid any 
finance charges by paying your bill before the due date shown 
on your statement. Some cards have grace periods from 21 to 30 
days. Some have no grace periods and impose finance charges from 
the day you use the card. Cards with longer grace periods may 
save you money, but only if you pay all of your charges each 
month.<p> 
<p> 
 4.  Other charges: In addition to comparing the terms noted 
above, check several credit card offers to see if you will be 
charged a fee for things such as paying your bill late or charging 
more than your credit limit. These extra fees, which may be charged 
in addition to interest, add to the cost of using your credit 
card.<p> 
<p> 
<h4>"There's a mistake on my credit card bill. 
What do I do about it?"</h4><p> 
<p> 
Always read your monthly credit card statement promptly and carefully. 
Check whether there are errors on your bill (such as wrong amounts 
or no credits given for a returned item), or whether someone 
has made illegal charges on your credit card. If you find an 
error:<p> 
<p> 
1.  Send the credit card issuer a letter right away -- within 
60 days after the first bill containing the error was mailed 
to you. Use the special "billing error address" given on your 
monthly statement or  credit card contract. Remember that only 
a letter to the special address protects your rights under the 
law. Phone calls do not protect you.<p> 
<p> 
2.  Include in your letter: your name and account number; the 
date, type, and dollar amount of the charge you question; and 
why you think there was a mistake. You may be asked later to 
sign a statement under oath that you did not make the purchase 
in question.<p> 
<p> 
3.  Know that the credit card company must tell you that it has 
received your letter and corrected the mistake, or explain why 
the bill is believed to be correct.<p> 
<p> 
4.  Make sure to pay the charges on your credit card bill that 
are not in dispute.<p> 
<p> 
<h4>"Help! My wallet was stolen -- with my credit 
card in it. What should I do?"</h4><p> 
<p> 
If you discover your credit card lost or stolen:<p> 
<p> 
1.  Call the credit card issuer immediately about the situation. 
Use the telephone number established by the card issuer for this 
purpose. Follow up the call with a letter giving your card number, 
when the card was missing, and the date you called in the loss.<p> 
<p> 
2.  Understand that if a thief uses your card before you notify 
the credit card issuer, you may be held responsible for up to 
$50 for unauthorized charges for each card.<p> 
<p> 
3.  Know that you cannot be held responsible for more than $50 
in unauthorized charges for each card.<p> 
<p> 
<h4>"I don't want anyone else using my credit 
card. How can I protect my credit card account?"</h4> <p> 
<p> 
To safeguard your credit card -- and your credit record -- make 
sure you:<p> 
<p> 
Never lend your card to anyone.<p> 
<p> 
Never leave your card or receipts lying around.<p> 
<p> 
Destroy all carbons and incorrect receipts.<p> 
<p> 
Never put your card number on a postcard or on the outside of 
an envelope.<p> 
<p> 
Never give your card number over the phone, unless you are certain 
the company or organization is highly reputable.<p> 
<p> 
Sign your credit card in ink as soon as it arrives.<p> 
<p> 
Keep a record of your card number, expiration date, and the phone 
number and address of the card company in a safe place, separate 
from your wallet.<p> 
<p> 
Do not sign a blank receipt, whenever possible.<p> 
<p> 
Draw a line through blank spaces on charge slips above the total 
so the amount cannot be changed.<p> 
<p> 
Open billing statements promptly and compare them with receipts 
you have saved.<p> 
<p> 
Write promptly to the credit card issuer if any questionable 
charges appear on your statement.<p> 
<p> 
<h4>"I've paid some of my credit card bills late. 
How can I find out if my credit record is still good?"</h4> <p> 
<p> 
You have the right to know every piece of information in your 
credit file under the Fair Credit Reporting Act. If you want 
to find out what your credit record looks like, take the following 
steps:<p> 
<p> 
1.  Call credit bureaus to find which one has your file. Look 
in your local Yellow Pages under "Credit" or "Credit Rating and 
Reporting." Call every credit bureau listed in your area and 
tell each one that you want to see your file.<p> 
<p> 
2.  Although the credit bureau is not required to give you a 
copy of the report, more and more are doing so -- often for a 
small fee. You'll be required to identify yourself -- by phone, 
in-person, or by mail -- before any information is disclosed.<p> 
<p> 
3.  If you were turned down for a credit card and you request 
your file within 30 days of the denial, you will not be charged 
for a copy of your file.<p> 
<p> 
<h4>"There seems to be a mistake on my credit 
file. How can I fix it?"</h4> <p> 
<p> 
If you find any inaccurate information in your credit file, you 
have the right to correct it. The following information may be 
useful:<p> 
<p> 
Tell the credit bureau, in writing, why you think the information 
is incorrect. Supply copies of any documents supporting your 
position.<p> 
<p> 
If the credit bureau cannot confirm the information you challenge, 
it must delete or change it.<p> 
<p> 
If you disagree with the credit bureau's findings, you may write 
a brief statement stating your side. This becomes a part of your 
credit bureau report.<p> 
<p> 
If negative information in your credit report is accurate, only 
time may erase it. Credit bureaus are permitted to report negative 
information for 7 years and bankruptcies for 10 years. In some 
cases, though, negative information may be reported indefinitely. 
Don't be misled by credit repair companies that promise to "repair" 
or "clean up" your credit history. They can correct errors -- 
but not change the past.<p> 
<p> 
<h4>"I spent too much shopping -- and now I'm 
having trouble paying back my credit card bills. What can I do?"</h4><p> 
<p> 
Sometimes, because of overspending, illness, or other difficulties, 
you may find it impossible to pay your bills on time. If you 
ever find yourself in that situation, consider the following 
information:<p> 
<p> 
Try to work out a modified payment plan as soon as possible with 
those you owe money to.<p> 
<p> 
If you're having trouble making car payments, know that financing 
contracts often let the financing company repossess your car 
with no advance notice. Try hard to work out car payment problems.<p> 
<p> 
Be cautious about turning to a debt counseling company to solve 
your debt problems. Avoid paying in advance until you find out 
what the company can really do. Before you sign any contract, 
check out the organization with the Better Business Bureau or 
your local consumer protection agency.<p> 
<p> 
You may want to contact a non-profit counseling service, such 
as the Consumer Credit Counseling Service (CCCS), for help. You 
can find CCCS listed in your telephone white pages. In addition, 
non-profit financial counseling programs are sometimes offered 
by universities, military bases, and credit unions.<p> 
<p> 
<h4>"This information is great -- but where can 
I get more help?"</h4> <p> 
<p> 
Different federal agencies regulate different kinds of cards, 
so check to see which company issued the card. For cards issued 
by:<p> 
<p> 
Department stores, oil companies, or other non-bank creditors, 
write: Credit Cards, Correspondence Branch, Federal Trade Commission, 
Washington, D.C. 20580.<p>

National banks, write: Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, 
Consumer Activities Division, Washington, D.C. 20219.<p> 
<p> 
Savings and loan institutions or federal savings banks, write:

<h3>Facts for Consumers from the Federal Trade Commission</h3>
<h2>Women and Credit Histories -- October 1993</h2>
<p>Mrs. Becker had been using her husband's department store charge card for several years. The charges were billed to her 
husband, but she took responsibility for paying the bills on time. Recently, she applied for her own credit card from the store and 
her application was denied. The reason? The store had no record of her bill-paying history on her husband's account. Louise 
Martin changed her name when she got divorced. Although she had several successful credit accounts in her married name, her 
applications for credit in her maiden name were repeatedly denied. Creditors told her: &quot;We cannot find a record of your credit 
history under the name you gave on your application form.&quot; Bess Fenton, a young single woman, recently moved to the West 
Coast to start a new job. She applied for her first credit card with a national oil company, but since she had no record with the 
local credit bureau, her application was denied. Her question: &quot;If it takes credit to get credit, how do I begin?&quot;</p>
<p>You may have faced similar problems when you have applied for credit. Each year, many women are denied credit because they 
cannot show how they have used it. A good credit history is the way most companies predict your future success using credit. 
The record of your payment on credit cards, charge accounts, installment loans, and other credit accounts is how you get a 
&quot;track record.&quot; It gives a creditor evidence that you are a good credit risk.</p>
<h4>Know Your Rights Under The Law</h4>
<p>Two federal laws give you specific rights that help protect your credit history and make it easier for you to obtain credit:</p>
<p>The Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) prohibits a creditor from discriminating against you on the basis of sex or marital 
status in any aspect of a credit transaction. The ECOA also forbids discrimination on the basis of your race, color, age, national 
origin, religion, because you receive public assistance payments, or because you exercised rights under the federal consumer 
credit protection laws.</p>
<p>The Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) protects consumer privacy and safeguards the accuracy of credit bureau reports.</p>
<h4>Ask The Credit Bureau To Help</h4>
<p>Credit bureaus gather and sell credit information about consumers and are a principal source of information about your credit 
history. Creditors usually rely on credit bureau reports before issuing a line of credit. So it makes sense to ask your local credit 
bureaus for your report. You can find them listed in the telephone Yellow Pages under &quot;Credit Bureaus&quot; or &quot;Credit Reporting 
Agencies.&quot; The bureaus will report whatever they have on file, which might include what kinds of credit accounts you have, how 
punctually you pay your bills, and whether you have ever filed for bankruptcy or were sued. The report may include other credit 
references that you can use in new credit applications to give a more complete picture of your financial situation.</p>
<p>Some credit references may not appear in your file simply because the creditor may not report the information to the credit 
bureaus. Credit bureaus obtain most of their information from those creditors who send them monthly reports. Some creditors 
only report delinquent accounts; accounts with good payment histories may go unreported. Most major national credit card 
companies report their accounts to credit bureaus, but many local creditors do not.</p>
<h4>Fill An Empty Credit File</h4>
<p>If creditors have failed to supply information to your credit file, or if you have never had credit in your own name, a &quot;no file&quot; 
report can cause your application to be rejected. For example, if you become separated, divorced, or widowed, or simply want 
credit in your own name, a credit bureau may report &quot;no file&quot; exists for you. You might have a great credit history, but all in your 
husband's name. You may have the same problem when you marry and change your name. Old accounts held in your maiden 
name may not automatically be transferred to a file listed under your married name. For all practical purposes your credit history 
is lost. Therefore, it is important to check with the credit bureau after a name change to ensure that old account information has 
transferred to a file under your new name.</p>
<p>For your own protection you should learn how to prevent credit history &quot;evaporation.&quot; There are steps you can take to fill an 
empty file with your past credit history or to build the file with new information.</p>
<h4>Kinds of Accounts</h4>
<p>To ensure that you are protected should you become separated, divorced, or widowed, find out now what kind of credit 
accounts you have. You can either check the application(s) or ask your creditor(s). There are two basic kinds of credit accounts.</p>
<p>An individual account. When you apply for an individual account, only your own income, assets, and credit history are 
considered by the creditor. Whether married or single, you alone are responsible for paying off the debt on this account. The 
account will appear on the individual's credit report.</p>
<p>A joint account. The income, financial assets, and credit history of both spouses are taken into consideration for a joint account. 
No matter who actually handles the household bills, both spouses are responsible for seeing that all debts are paid. A creditor 
who reports the credit history of a joint account to credit bureaus must report it in both names (if the account was opened after 
June 1, 1977).</p>
<p>If you are separating from or divorcing your spouse, you should immediately cancel your joint credit card account(s). While any 
account balance remains your mutual responsibility, canceling the account(s) will prevent further use or abuse of the card(s) that, 
if left unpaid, could damage both of your credit reports.</p>
<p>Under the ECOA, a creditor cannot automatically close or change the terms of a joint credit card account solely because of the 
death of your spouse. However, in some instances a creditor may ask you to update your application or reapply. This can 
happen if the account was initially granted based on all or part of your spouse's income and if the creditor has reason to suspect 
your income is inadequate to support the credit line.</p>
<h4>Build Your Credit File</h4>
<p>If you have never had credit, start building a good record now. A local bank or department store may approve your credit 
application even if you do not meet the standards of large creditors. But do not apply for too many accounts at one time. Credit 
bureaus keep a record of each creditor who inquires about you. Some creditors may deny your application if they think you are 
trying to open too many accounts and may exceed your ability to pay them.</p>
<p>If you have had credit before under a different name or in a different location, make sure your local credit bureau has complete 
and accurate information about you in a file under your current name. Most cities have two or three bureaus. Call each bureau to 
find out if they have a file on you. They may charge a small fee for checking your file.</p>
<p>If you are married, know that you have the right to apply for a credit account in your own name based on your own financial 
qualifications.</p>
<p>If you were married or divorced recently and changed your name, ask your creditors to change your name on your accounts. 
Once you verify that these accounts are in your new name, your complete credit history should be reported correctly to the 
credit bureau.</p>
<h4>Give Your Best Credit References</h4>
<p>List your best credit accounts, open and closed, on any credit application _ including accounts you shared with your husband or 
former husband.</p>
<p>Also ask the creditor to consider the credit history of accounts that are reported in your husband's or former husband's name 
only. The creditor must consider this information if you can show it reflects your ability to manage credit. For example, you may 
be able to show through cancelled checks that you made payments on an account, even though it is listed in your husband's or 
former husband's name only.</p>
<p>Offer to assist the creditor in providing verification of your credit references when an account history does not appear in a credit 
bureau report. If you can show a credit history applied to you, even though it was in your husband's or former husband's name, 
the creditor must consider it. Be aware, however, that if your husband's credit history on a shared account was bad, the 
company will consider that credit history yours as well. If any previous history was unfavorable but does not accurately reflect 
your creditworthiness, explain this to the creditor.</p>
<h4>Credit History For Married People</h4>
<p>The ECOA states that when creditors report histories to credit bureaus or to other creditors, they must report information on 
accounts shared by married couples in both names. This is true only for accounts opened after June 1, 1977. If you and your 
spouse opened an account before that time, ask the creditor to use both names.</p>
<h4>Ask Questions If Your Application Is Denied</h4>
<p>The ECOA gives you the right to know the specific reasons for denial if you receive a notice that your credit application was 
denied. If the denial was based on a credit report, you are entitled to know the specific information in the credit report that led to 
the denial. After you receive this information from the creditor, you should visit or telephone the local credit bureau to find out 
what information was reported. The bureau cannot charge for disclosure if you ask to see your file within 30 days of being 
notified of a denial based on a credit report. You may ask the bureau to investigate any inaccurate or incomplete information and 
correct its records.</p>
<p>If you live in a community property state*, a creditor may consider your husband's credit history even if you are applying for your 
own account. You still should make certain that your local credit bureau has a separate credit file in your name.</p>
<p>If you have questions about the ECOA and the FCRA or a complaint, write to: Correspondence Branch, Federal Trade 
Commission, Washington, D.C. 20580. While the FTC cannot intervene in individual disputes, the information you provide may 
indicate a pattern of practices requiring action by the Commission.</p>
<p>The FTC also provides brochures about credit laws. For a free copy of Equal Credit Opportunity, Fair Credit Reporting, Credit 
and Divorce, or Best Sellers, a listing of all the FTC's consumers publications, contact: Public Reference, Federal Trade 
Commission, Washington, D.C. 20580; (202) 326-2222.</p>
<p>*Community property states are Arizona, California, Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, and Washington.</p>

<h3>THE AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</h3>
<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>Barriers to employment, transportation, public accommodations, public services, and telecommunications have imposed 
staggering economic and social costs on American society and have undermined our well-intentioned efforts to educate, 
rehabilitate, and employ individuals with disabilities. By breaking down these barriers, the Americans with Disabilities Act will 
enable society to benefit from the skills and talents of individuals with disabilities, will allow us all to gain from their increased 
purchasing power and ability to use it, and will lead to fuller, more productive lives for all Americans.</p>
<p>The Americans with Disabilities Act gives civil rights protections to individuals with disabilities similar to those provided to 
individuals on the basis of race, color, sex, national origin, age, and religion. It guarantees equal opportunity for individuals with 
disabilities in public accommodations, employment, transportation, State and local government services, and telecommunications.</p>
<p>Fair, swift, and effective enforcement of this landmark civil rights legislation is a high priority of the Federal Government. This 
booklet is designed to provide answers to some of the most often asked questions about the new law.</p>
<p>This publication was printed with the generous support of the National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research</p>
<p>EMPLOYMENT Q. What employers are covered by title I of the ADA, and when is the coverage effective?</p>
<p>A. The title I employment provisions apply to private employers, State and local governments, employment agencies, and labor 
unions. Employers with 25 or more employees are covered as of July 26, 1992. Employers with 15 or more employees will be 
covered two years later, beginning July 26, 1994.</p>
<p>Q. What practices and activities are covered by the employment nondiscrimination requirements?</p>
<p>A. The ADA prohibits discrimination in all employment practices, including job application procedures, hiring, firing, 
advancement, compensation, training, and other terms, conditions, and privileges of employment. It applies to recruitment, 
advertising, tenure, layoff, leave, fringe benefits, and all other employment-related activities.</p>
<p>Q. Who is protected from employment discrimination?</p>
<p>A. Employment discrimination is prohibited against &quot;qualified individuals with disabilities.&quot; This includes applicants for 
employment and employees. An individual is considered to have a &quot;disability&quot; if s/he has a physical or mental impairment that 
substantially limits one or more major life activities, has a record of such an impairment, or is regarded as having such an 
impairment. Persons discriminated against because they have a known association or relationship with an individual with a 
disability also are protected.</p>
<p>The first part of the definition makes clear that the ADA applies to persons who have impairments and that these must 
substantially limit major life activities such as seeing, hearing, speaking, walking, breathing, performing manual tasks, learning, 
caring for oneself, and working. An individual with epilepsy, paralysis, HIV infection, AIDS, a substantial hearing or visual 
impairment, mental retardation, or a specific learning disability is covered, but an individual with a minor, nonchronic condition of 
short duration, such as a sprain, broken limb, or the flu, generally would not be covered.</p>
<p>The second part of the definition protecting individuals with a record of a disability would cover, for example, a person who has 
recovered from cancer or mental illness.</p>
<p>The third part of the definition protects individuals who are regarded as having a substantially limiting impairment, even though 
they may not have such an impairment. For example, this provision would protect a qualified individual with a severe facial 
disfigurement from being denied employment because an employer feared the &quot;negative reactions&quot; of customers or co-workers.</p>
<p>Q. Who is a &quot;qualified individual with a disability&quot;?</p>
<p>A. A qualified individual with a disability is a person who meets legitimate skill, experience, education, or other requirements of 
an employment position that s/he holds or seeks, and who can perform the &quot;essential functions&quot; of the position with or without 
reasonable accommodation. Requiring the ability to perform &quot;essential&quot; functions assures that an individual with a disability will 
not be considered unqualified simply because of inability to perform marginal or incidental job functions. If the individual is 
qualified to perform essential job functions except for limitations caused by a disability, the employer must consider whether the 
individual could perform these functions with a reasonable accommodation. If a written job description has been prepared in 
advance of advertising or interviewing applicants for a job, this will be considered as evidence, although not conclusive evidence, 
of the essential functions of the job.</p>
<p>Q. Does an employer have to give preference to a qualified applicant with a disability over other applicants?</p>
<p>A. No. An employer is free to select the most qualified applicant available and to make decisions based on reasons unrelated to 
a disability. For example, suppose two persons apply for a job as a typist and an essential function of the job is to type 75 words 
per minute accurately. One applicant, an individual with a disability, who is provided with a reasonable accommodation for a 
typing test, types 50 words per minute; the other applicant who has no disability accurately types 75 words per minute. The 
employer can hire the applicant with the higher typing speed, if typing speed is needed for successful performance of the job.</p>
<p>Q. What limitations does the ADA impose on medical examinations and inquiries about disability?</p>
<p>A. An employer may not ask or require a job applicant to take a medical examination before making a job offer. It cannot make 
any pre-employment inquiry about a disability or the nature or severity of a disability. An employer may, however, ask questions 
about the ability to perform specific job functions and may, with certain limitations, ask an individual with a disability to describe 
or demonstrate how s/he would perform these functions.</p>
<p>An employer may condition a job offer on the satisfactory result of a post-offer medical examination or medical inquiry if this is 
required of all entering employees in the same job category. A post-offer examination or inquiry does not have to be job-related 
and consistent with business necessity.</p>
<p>However, if an individual is not hired because a post-offer medical examination or inquiry reveals a disability, the reason(s) for 
not hiring must be job-related and consistent with business necessity. The employer also must show that no reasonable 
accommodation was available that would enable the individual to perform the essential job functions, or that accommodation 
would impose an unduehardship. A post-offer medical examination may disqualify an individual if the employer can demonstrate 
that the individual would pose a &quot;direct threat&quot; in the workplace (i.e., a significant risk of substantial harm to the health or safety 
of the individual or others) that cannot be eliminated or reduced below the &quot;direct threat&quot; level through reasonable 
accommodation. Such a disqualification is job-related and consistent with business necessity. A post-offer medical examination 
may not disqualify an individual with a disability who is currently able to perform essential job functions because of speculation 
that the disability may cause a risk of future injury.</p>
<p>After a person starts work, a medical examination or inquiry of an employee must be job-related and consistent with business 
necessity. Employers may conduct employee medical examinations where there is evidence of a job performance or safety 
problem, examinations required by other Federal laws, examinations to determine current &quot;fitness&quot; to perform a particular job, 
and voluntary examinations that are part of employee health programs.</p>
<p>Information from all medical examinations and inquiries must be kept apart from general personnel files as a separate, confidential 
medical record, available only under limited conditions.</p>
<p>Tests for illegal use of drugs are not medical examinations under the ADA and are not subject to the restrictions of such 
examinations.</p>
<p>Q. When can an employer ask an applicant to &quot;self-identify&quot; as having a disability?</p>
<p>A. Federal contractors and subcontractors who are covered by the affirmative action requirements of section 503 of the 
Rehabilitation Act of 1973 may invite individuals with disabilities to identify themselves on a job application form or by other 
pre-employment inquiry, to satisfy the section 503 affirmative action requirements. Employers who request such information must 
observe section 503 requirements regarding the manner in which such information is requested and used, and the procedures for 
maintaining such information as a separate, confidential record, apart from regular personnel records.</p>
<p>A pre-employment inquiry about a disability is allowed if required by another Federal law or regulation such as those applicable 
to disabled veterans and veterans of the Vietnam era. Pre-employment inquiries about disabilities may be necessary under such 
laws to identify applicants or clients with disabilities in order to provide them with required special services.</p>
<p>Q. Does the ADA require employers to develop written job descriptions?</p>
<p>A. No. The ADA does not require employers to develop or maintain job descriptions. However, a written job description that is 
prepared before advertising or interviewing applicants for a job will be considered as evidence along with other relevant factors. 
If an employer uses job descriptions, they should be reviewed to make sure they accurately reflect the actual functions of a job. 
A job description will be most helpful if it focuses on the results or outcome of a job function, not solely on the way it customarily 
is performed. A reasonable accommodation may enable a person with a disability to accomplish a job function in a manner that is 
different from the way an employee who is not disabled may accomplish the same function.</p>
<p>Q. What is &quot;reasonable accommodation&quot;?</p>
<p>A. Reasonable accommodation is any modification or adjustment to a job or the work environment that will enable a qualified 
applicant or employee with a disability to participate in the application process or to perform essential job functions. Reasonable 
accommodation also includes adjustments to assure that a qualified individual with a disability has rights and privileges in 
employment equal to those of employees without disabilities.</p>
<p>Q. What are some of the accommodations applicants and employees may need?</p>
<p>A. Examples of reasonable accommodation include making existing facilities used by employees readily accessible to and usable 
by an individual with a disability; restructuring a job; modifying work schedules; acquiring or modifying equipment; providing 
qualified readers or interpreters; or appropriately modifying examinations, training, or other programs. Reasonable 
accommodation also may include reassigning a current employee to a vacant position for which the individual is qualified, if the 
person is unable to do the original job because of a disability even with an accommodation. However, there is no obligation to 
find a position for an applicant who is not qualified for the position sought. Employers are not required to lower quality or 
quantity standards as an accommodation; nor are they obligated to provide personal use items such as glasses or hearing aids.</p>
<p>The decision as to the appropriate accommodation must be based on the particular facts of each case. In selecting the particular 
type of reasonable accommodation to provide, the principal test is that of effectiveness, i.e., whether the accommodation will 
provide an opportunity for a person with a disability to achieve the same level of performance and to enjoy benefits equal to 
those of an average, similarly situated person without a disability. However, the accommodation does not have to ensure equal 
results or provide exactly the same benefits.</p>
<p>Q. When is an employer required to make a reasonable accommodation?</p>
<p>A. An employer is only required to accommodate a &quot;known&quot; disability of a qualified applicant or employee. The requirement 
generally will be triggered by a request from an individual with a disability, who frequently will be able to suggest an appropriate 
accommodation. Accommodations must be made on an individual basis, because the nature and extent of a disabling condition 
and the requirements of a job will vary in each case. If the individual does not request an accommodation, the employer is not 
obligated to provide one except where an individual's known disability impairs his/her ability to know of, or effectively 
communicate a need for, an accommodation that is obvious to the employer. If a person with a disability requests, but cannot 
suggest, an appropriate accommodation, the employer and the individual should work together to identify one. There are also 
many public and private resources that can provide assistance without cost.</p>
<p>Q. What are the limitations on the obligation to make a reasonable accommodation?</p>
<p>A. The individual with a disability requiring the accommodation must be otherwise qualified, and the disability must be known to 
the employer. In addition, an employer is not required to make an accommodation if it would impose an &quot;undue hardship&quot; on the 
operation of the employer's business. &quot;Undue hardship&quot; is defined as an &quot;action requiring significant difficulty or expense&quot; when 
considered in light of a number of factors. These factors include the nature and cost of the accommodation in relation to the size, 
resources, nature, and structure of the employer's operation. Undue hardship is determined on a case-by-case basis. Where the 
facility making the accommodation is part of a larger entity, the structure and overall resources of the larger organization would 
be considered, as well as the financial and administrative relationship of the facility to the larger organization. In general, a larger 
employer with greater resources would be expected to make accommodations requiring greater effort or expense than would be 
required of a smaller employer with fewer resources.</p>
<p>If a particular accommodation would be an undue hardship, the employer must try to identify another accommodation that will 
not pose such a hardship. Also, if the cost of an accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the employer, the individual 
with a disability should be given the option of paying that portion of the cost which would constitute an undue hardship or 
providing the accommodation.</p>
<p>Q. Must an employer modify existing facilities to make them accessible?</p>
<p>A. The employer's obligation under title I is to provide access for an individual applicant to participate in the job application 
process, and for an individual employee with a disability to perform the essential functions of his/her job, including access to a 
building, to the work site, to needed equipment, and to all facilities used by employees. For example, if an employee lounge is 
located in a place inaccessible to an employee using a wheelchair, the lounge might be modified or relocated, or comparable 
facilities might be provided in a location that would enable the individual to take a break with co-workers. The employer must 
provide such access unless it would cause an undue hardship.</p>
<p>Under title I, an employer is not required to make its existing facilities accessible until a particular applicant or employee with a 
particular disability needs an accommodation, and then the modifications should meet that individual's work needs. However, 
employers should consider initiating changes that will provide general accessibility, particularly for job applicants, since it is likely 
that people with disabilities will be applying for jobs. The employer does not have to make changes to provide access in places 
or facilities that will not be used by that individual for employment-related activities or benefits.</p>
<p>Q. Can an employer be required to reallocate an essential function of a job to another employee as a reasonable 
accommodation?</p>
<p>A. No. An employer is not required to reallocate essential functions of a job as a reasonable accommodation.</p>
<p>Q. Can an employer be required to modify, adjust, or make other reasonable accommodations in the way a test is given to a 
qualified applicant or employee with a disability?</p>
<p>A. Yes. Accommodations may be needed to assure that tests or examinations measure the actual ability of an individual to 
perform job functions rather than reflect limitations caused by the disability. Tests should be given to people who have sensory, 
speaking, or manual impairments in a format that does not require the use of the impaired skill, unless it is a job-related skill that 
the test is designed to measure.</p>
<p>Q. Can an employer maintain existing production/performance standards for an employee with a disability?</p>
<p>A. An employer can hold employees with disabilities to the same standards of production/performance as other similarly situated 
employees without disabilities for performing essential job functions, with or without reasonable accommodation. An employer 
also can hold employees with disabilities to the same standards of production/performance as other employees regarding 
marginal functions unless the disability affects the person's ability to perform those marginal functions. If the ability to perform 
marginal functions is affected by the disability, the employer must provide some type of reasonable accommodation such as job 
restructuring but may not exclude an individual with a disability who is satisfactorily performing a job's essential functions.</p>
<p>Q. Can an employer establish specific attendance and leave policies?</p>
<p>A. An employer can establish attendance and leave policies that are uniformly applied to all employees, regardless of disability, 
but may not refuse leave needed by an employee with a disability if other employees get such leave. An employer also may be 
required to make adjustments in leave policy as a reasonable accommodation. The employer is not obligated to provide 
additional paid leave, but accommodations may include leave flexibility and unpaid leave.</p>
<p>A uniformly applied leave policy does not violate the ADA because it has a more severe effect on an individual because of 
his/her disability. However, if an individual with a disability requests a modification of such a policy as a reasonable 
accommodation, an employer may be required to provide it, unless it would impose an undue hardship.</p>
<p>Q. Can an employer consider health and safety when deciding whether to hire an applicant or retain an employee with a 
disability?</p>
<p>A. Yes. The ADA permits employers to establish qualification standards that will exclude individuals who pose a direct threat 
--i.e., a significant risk of substantial harm --to the health or safety of the individual or of others, if that risk cannot be eliminated 
or reduced below the level of a &quot;direct threat&quot; by reasonable accommodation. However, an employer may not simply assume 
that a threat exists; the employer must establish through objective, medically supportable methods that there is significant risk that 
substantial harm could occur in the workplace. By requiring employers to make individualized judgments based on reliable 
medical or other objective evidence rather than on generalizations, ignorance, fear, patronizing attitudes, or stereotypes, the ADA 
recognizes the need to balance the interests of people with disabilities against the legitimate interests of employers in maintaining a 
safe workplace.</p>
<p>Q. Are applicants or employees who are currently illegally using drugs covered by the ADA?</p>
<p>A. No. Individuals who currently engage in the illegal use of drugs are specifically excluded from the definition of a &quot;qualified 
individual with a disability&quot; protected by the ADA when the employer takes action on the basis of their drug use.</p>
<p>Q. Is testing for the illegal use of drugs permissible under the ADA?</p>
<p>A. Yes. A test for the illegal use of drugs is not considered a medical examination under the ADA; therefore, employers may 
conduct such testing of applicants or employees and make employment decisions based on the results. The ADA does not 
encourage, prohibit, or authorize drug tests.</p>
<p>If the results of a drug test reveal the presence of a lawfully prescribed drug or other medical information, such information must 
be treated as a confidential medical record.</p>
<p>Q. Are alcoholics covered by the ADA?</p>
<p>A. Yes. While a current illegal user of drugs is not protected by the ADA if an employer acts on the basis of such use, a person 
who currently uses alcohol is not automatically denied protection. An alcoholic is a person with a disability and is protected by 
the ADA if s/he is qualified to perform the essential functions of the job. An employer may be required to provide an 
accommodation to an alcoholic. However, an employer can discipline, discharge or deny employment to an alcoholic whose use 
of alcohol adversely affects job performance or conduct. An employer also may prohibit the use of alcohol in the workplace and 
can require that employees not be under the influence of alcohol.</p>
<p>Q. Does the ADA override Federal and State health and safety laws?</p>
<p>A. The ADA does not override health and safety requirements established under other Federal laws even if a standard adversely 
affects the employmentof an individual with a disability. If a standard is required by another Federal law, an employer must 
comply with it and does not have to show that the standard is job related and consistent with business necessity. For example, 
employers must conform to health and safety requirements of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration. However, 
an employer still has the obligation under the ADA to consider whether there is a reasonable accommodation, consistent with the 
standards of other Federal laws, that will prevent exclusion of qualified individuals with disabilities who can perform jobs without 
violating the standards of those laws. If an employer can comply with both the ADA and another Federal law, then the employer 
must do so.</p>
<p>The ADA does not override State or local laws designed to protect public health and safety, except where such laws conflict 
with the ADA requirements. If there is a State or local law that would exclude an individual with a disability from a particular job 
or profession because of a health or safety risk, the employer still must assess whether a particular individual would pose a 
&quot;direct threat&quot; to health or safety under the ADA standard. If such a &quot;direct threat&quot; exists, the employer must consider whether it 
could be eliminated or reduced below the level of a &quot;direct threat&quot; by reasonable accommodation. An employer cannot rely on a 
State or local law that conflicts with ADA requirements as a defense to a charge of discrimination.</p>
<p>Q. How does the ADA affect workers' compensation programs?</p>
<p>A. Only injured workers who meet the ADA's definition of an &quot;individual with a disability&quot; will be considered disabled under the 
ADA, regardless of whether they satisfy criteria for receiving benefits under workers' compensation or other disability laws. A 
worker also must be &quot;qualified&quot; (with or without reasonable accommodation) to be protected by the ADA. Work-related injuries 
do not always cause physical or mental impairments severe enough to &quot;substantially limit&quot; a major life activity. Also, many 
on-the-job injuries cause temporary impairments which heal within a short period of time with little or no long-term or permanent 
impact. Therefore, many injured workers who qualify for benefits under workers' compensation or other disability benefits laws 
may not be protected by the ADA. An employer must consider work-related injuries on a case-by-case basis to know if a 
worker is protected by the ADA.</p>
<p>An employer may not inquire into an applicant's workers' compensation history before making a conditional offer of employment. 
After making a conditional job offer, an employer may inquire about a person's workers' compensation history in a medical 
inquiry or examination that is required of all applicants in the same job category. However, even after a conditional offer has been 
made, an employer cannot require a potential employee to have a medical examination because a response to a medical inquiry 
(as opposed to results from a medical examination) shows a previous on-the-job injury unless all applicants in the same job 
category are required to have an examination. Also, an employer may not base an employment decision on the speculation that 
an applicant may cause increased workers' compensation costs in the future. However, an employer may refuse to hire, or may 
discharge an individual who is not currently able to perform a job without posing a significant risk of substantial harm to the health 
or safety of the individual or others, if the risk cannot be eliminated or reduced by reasonable accommodation.</p>
<p>An employer may refuse to hire or may fire a person who knowingly provides a false answer to a lawful post-offer inquiry about 
his/her condition or worker's compensation history.</p>
<p>An employer also may submit medical information and records concerning employees and applicants (obtained after a 
conditional job offer) to state workers' compensation offices and &quot;second injury&quot; funds without violating ADA confidentiality 
requirements.</p>
<p>Q. What is discrimination based on &quot;relationship or association&quot; under the ADA?</p>
<p>A. The ADA prohibits discrimination based on relationship or association in order to protect individuals from actions based on 
unfounded assumptions that their relationship to a person with a disability would affect their job performance, and from actions 
caused by bias or misinformation concerning certain disabilities. For example, this provision would protect a person whose 
spouse has a disability from being denied employment because of an employer's unfounded assumption that the applicant would 
use excessive leave to care for the spouse. It also would protect an individual who does volunteer work for people with AIDS 
from a discriminatory employment action motivated by that relationship or association.</p>
<p>Q. How are the employment provisions enforced?</p>
<p>A. The employment provisions of the ADA are enforced under the same procedures now applicable to race, color, sex, national 
origin, and religious discrimination under title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, and the Civil Rights Act of 1991. 
Complaints regarding actions that occurred on or after July 26, 1992, may be filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity 
Commission or designated State human rights agencies. Available remedies will include hiring, reinstatement, promotion, back 
pay, front pay, restored benefits, reasonable accommodation, attorneys' fees, expert witness fees, and court costs. 
Compensatory and punitive damages also may be available in cases of intentional discrimination or where an employer fails to 
make a good faith effort to provide a reasonable accommodation.</p>
<p>Q. What financial assistance is available to employers to help them make reasonable accommodations and comply with the 
ADA?</p>
<p>A. A special tax credit is available to help smaller employers make accommodations required by the ADA. An eligible small 
business may take a tax credit of up to $5,000 per year for accommodations made to comply with the ADA. The credit is 
available for one-half the cost of &quot;eligible access expenditures&quot; that are more than $250 but less than $10,250. A full tax 
deduction, up to $15,000 per year, also is available to any business for expenses of removing qualified architectural or 
transportation barriers. Expenses covered include costs of removing barriers created by steps, narrow doors, inaccessible 
parking spaces, restroom facilities, and transportation vehicles. Information about the tax credit and the tax deduction can be 
obtained from a local IRS office, or by contacting the Office of Chief Counsel, Internal Revenue Service.</p>
<p>Tax credits are available under the Targeted Jobs Tax Credit Program (TJTCP) for employers who hire individuals with 
disabilities referred by State or local vocational rehabilitation agencies, State Commissions on the Blind, or the U.S. Department 
of Veterans Affairs, and certified by a State Employment Service. Under the TJTCP, a tax credit may be taken for up to 40 
percent of the first $6,000 of first-year wages of a new employee with a disability. This program must be reauthorized each year 
by Congress, and currently is extended through June 30, 1993. Further information about the TJTCP can be obtained from the 
State Employment Services or from State Governors' Committees on the Employment of People with Disabilities. Q. What are 
an employer's recordkeeping requirements under the employment provisions of the ADA?</p>
<p>A. An employer must maintain records such as application forms submitted by applicants and other records related to hiring, 
requests for reasonable accommodation, promotion, demotion, transfer, lay-off or termination, rates of pay or other terms of 
compensation, and selection for training or apprenticeship for one year after making the record or taking the action described 
(whichever occurs later). If a charge of discrimination is filed or an action is brought by EEOC, an employer must save all 
personnel records related to the charge until final disposition of the charge.</p>
<p>Q. Does the ADA require that an employer post a notice explaining its requirements?</p>
<p>A. The ADA requires that employers post a notice describing the provisions of the ADA. It must be made accessible, as 
needed, to individuals with disabilities. A poster is available from EEOC summarizing the requirements of the ADA and other 
Federal legal requirements for nondiscrimination for which EEOC has enforcement responsibility. EEOC also provides guidance 
on making this information available in accessible formats for people with disabilities. Q. What resources does the Equal 
Employment Opportunity Commission have available to help employers and people with disabilities understand and comply with 
the employment requirements of the ADA? A. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has developed several 
resources to help employers and people with disabilities understand and comply with the employment provisions of the ADA. 
Resources include:</p>
<p>A Technical Assistance Manual that provides &quot;how-to&quot; guidance on the employment provisions of the ADA as well as a resource 
directory to help individuals find specific information.</p>
<p>A variety of brochures, booklets, and fact sheets.</p>
<p>STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS</p>
<p>Q. Does the ADA apply to State and local governments?</p>
<p>A. Title II of the ADA prohibits discrimination against qualified individuals with disabilities in all programs, activities, and services 
of public entities. It applies to all State and local governments, their departments and agencies, and any other instrumentalities or 
special purpose districts of State or local governments. It clarifies the requirements of section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 
1973 for public transportation systems that receive Federal financial assistance, and extends coverage to all public entities that 
provide public transportation, whether or not they receive Federal financial assistance. It establishes detailed standards for the 
operation of public transit systems, including commuter and intercity rail (AMTRAK).</p>
<p>Q. When do the requirements for State and local governments become effective?</p>
<p>A. In general, they became effective on January 26, 1992.</p>
<p>Q. How does title II affect participation in a State or local government's programs, activities, and services?</p>
<p>A. A state or local government must eliminate any eligibility criteria for participation in programs, activities, and services that 
screen out or tend to screen out persons with disabilities, unless it can establish that the requirements are necessary for the 
provision of the service, program, or activity. The State or local government may, however, adopt legitimate safety requirements 
necessary for safe operation if they are based on real risks, not on stereotypes or generalizations about individuals with 
disabilities. Finally, a public entity must reasonably modify its policies, practices, or procedures to avoid discrimination. If the 
public entity can demonstrate that a particular modification would fundamentally alter the nature of its service, program, or 
activity, it is not required to make that modification.</p>
<p>Q. Does title II cover a public entity's employment policies and practices?</p>
<p>A. Yes. Title II prohibits all public entities, regardless of the size of their work force, from discriminating in employment against 
qualified individuals with disabilities. In addition to title II's employment coverage, title I of the ADA and section 504 of the 
Rehabilitation Act of 1973 prohibit employment discrimination against qualified individuals with disabilities by certain public 
entities.</p>
<p>Q. What changes must a public entity make to its existing facilities to make them accessible?</p>
<p>A. A public entity must ensure that individuals with disabilities are not excluded from services, programs, and activities because 
existing buildings are inaccessible. A State or local government's programs, when viewed in their entirety, must be readily 
accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities. This standard, known as &quot;program accessibility,&quot; applies to facilities of a 
public entity that existed on January 26, 1992. Public entities do not necessarily have to make each of their existing facilities 
accessible. They may provide program accessibility by a number of methods including alteration of existing facilities, acquisition 
or construction of additional facilities, relocation of a service or program to an accessible facility, or provision of services at 
alternate accessible sites.</p>
<p>Q. When must structural changes be made to attain program accessibility?</p>
<p>A. Structural changes needed for program accessibility must be made as expeditiously as possible, but no later than January 26, 
1995. This three-year time period is not a grace period; all alterations must be accomplished as expeditiously as possible. A 
public entity that employs 50 or more persons must have developed a transition plan by July 26, 1992, setting forth the steps 
necessary to complete such changes.</p>
<p>Q. What is a self-evaluation?</p>
<p>A. A self-evaluation is a public entity's assessment of its current policies and practices. The self-evaluation identifies and corrects 
those policies and practices that are inconsistent with title II's requirements. All public entities must complete a self-evaluation by 
January 26, 1993. A public entity that employs 50 or more employees must retain its self-evaluation for three years. Other public 
entities are not required to retain their self-evaluations, but are encouraged to do so because these documents evidence a public 
entity's good faith efforts to comply with title II's requirements.</p>
<p>Q. What does title II require for new construction and alterations?</p>
<p>A. The ADA requires that all new buildings constructed by a State or local government be accessible. In addition, when a State 
or local government undertakes alterations to a building, it must make the altered portions accessible.</p>
<p>Q. How will a State or local government know that a new building is accessible?</p>
<p>A. A State or local government will be in compliance with the ADA for new construction and alterations if it follows either of two 
accessibility standards. It can choose either the Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards or the Americans with Disabilities Act 
Accessibility Guidelines for Buildings and Facilities, which is the standard that must be used for public accommodations and 
commercial facilities under title III of the ADA. If the State or local government chooses the ADA Accessibility Guidelines, it is 
not entitled to the elevator exemption (which permits certain private buildings under three stories or under 3,000 square feet per 
floor to be constructed without an elevator).</p>
<p>Q What requirements apply to a public entity's emergency telephone services, such as 911?</p>
<p>A. State and local agencies that provide emergency telephone services must provide &quot;direct access&quot; to individuals who rely on a 
TDD or computer modem for telephone communication. Telephone access through a third party or through a relay service does 
not satisfy the requirement for direct access. Where a public entity provides 911 telephone service, it may not substitute a 
separate seven-digit telephone line as the sole means for access to 911 services by nonvoice users. A public entity may, 
however, provide a separate seven-digit line for the exclusive use of nonvoice callers in addition to providing direct access for 
such calls to its 911 line.</p>
<p>Q. Does title II require that telephone emergency service systems be compatible with all formats used for nonvoice 
communications?</p>
<p>A. No. At present, telephone emergency services must only be compatible with the Baudot format. Until it can be technically 
proven that communications in another format can operate in a reliable and compatible manner in a given telephone emergency 
environment, a public entity would not be required to provide direct access to computer modems using formats other than 
Baudot.</p>
<p>Q. How will the ADA's requirements for State and local governments be enforced? A. Private individuals may bring lawsuits to 
enforce their rights under title II and may receive the same remedies as those provided under section 504 of the Rehabilitation 
Act of 1973, including reasonable attorney's fees. Individuals may also file complaints with eight designated Federal agencies, 
including the Department of Justice and the Department of Transportation.</p>
<p>PUBLIC ACCOMMODATIONS Q. What are public accommodations?</p>
<p>A. A public accommodation is a private entity that owns, operates, leases, or leases to, a place of public accommodation. Places 
of public accommodation include a wide range of entities, such as restaurants, hotels, theaters, doctors' offices, pharmacies, retail 
stores, museums, libraries, parks, private schools, and day care centers. Private clubs and religious organizations are exempt 
from the ADA's title III requirements for public accommodations.</p>
<p>Q. Will the ADA have any effect on the eligibility criteria used by public accommodations to determine who may receive 
services?</p>
<p>A. Yes. If a criterion screens out or tends to screen out individuals with disabilities, it may only be used if necessary for the 
provision of the services. For instance, it would be a violation for a retail store to have a rule excluding all deaf persons from 
entering the premises, or for a movie theater to exclude all individuals with cerebral palsy. More subtle forms of discrimination 
are also prohibited. For example, requiring presentation of a driver's license as the sole acceptable means of identification for 
purposes of paying by check could constitute discrimination against individuals with vision impairments. This would be true if such 
individuals are ineligible to receive licenses and the use of an alternative means of identification is feasible.</p>
<p>Q. Does the ADA allow public accommodations to take safety factors into consideration in providing services to individuals with 
disabilities?</p>
<p>A. The ADA expressly provides that a public accommodation may exclude an individual, if that individual poses a direct threat to 
the health or safety of others that cannot be mitigated by appropriate modifications in the public accommodation's policies or 
procedures, or by the provision of auxiliary aids. A public accommodation will be permitted to establish objective safety criteria 
for the operation of its business; however, any safety standard must be based on objective requirements rather than stereotypes 
or generalizations about the ability of persons with disabilities to participate in an activity.</p>
<p>Q. Are there any limits on the kinds of modifications in policies, practices, and procedures required by the ADA?</p>
<p>A. Yes. The ADA does not require modifications that would fundamentally alter the nature of the services provided by the 
publicaccommodation. For example, it would not be discriminatory for a physician specialist who treats only burn patients to 
refer a deaf individual to another physician for treatment of a broken limb or respiratory ailment. To require a physician to accept 
patients outside of his or her specialty would fundamentally alter the nature of the medical practice.</p>
<p>Q. What kinds of auxiliary aids and services are required by the ADA to ensure effective communication with individuals with 
hearing or vision impairments?</p>
<p>A. Appropriate auxiliary aids and services may include services and devices such as qualified interpreters, assistive listening 
devices, notetakers, and written materials for individuals with hearing impairments; and qualified readers, taped texts, and brailled 
or large print materials for individuals with vision impairments.</p>
<p>Q. Are there any limitations on the ADA's auxiliary aids requirements?</p>
<p>A. Yes. The ADA does not require the provision of any auxiliary aid that would result in an undue burden or in a fundamental 
alteration in the nature of the goods or services provided by a public accommodation. However, the public accommodation is 
not relieved from the duty to furnish an alternative auxiliary aid, if available, that would not result in a fundamental alteration or 
undue burden. Both of these limitations are derived from existing regulations and caselaw under section 504 of the Rehabilitation 
Act and are to be determined on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<p>Q. Will restaurants be required to have brailled menus?</p>
<p>A. No, not if waiters or other employees are made available to read the menu to a blind customer.</p>
<p>Q. Will a clothing store be required to have brailled price tags?</p>
<p>A. No, not if sales personnel could provide price information orally upon request.</p>
<p>Q. Will a bookstore be required to maintain a sign language interpreter on its staff in order to communicate with deaf customers?</p>
<p>A. No, not if employees communicate by pen and notepad when necessary.</p>
<p>Q. Are there any limitations on the ADA's barrier removal requirements for existing facilities?</p>
<p>A. Yes. Barrier removal need be accomplished only when it is &quot;readily achievable&quot; to do so.</p>
<p>Q. What does the term &quot;readily achievable&quot; mean?</p>
<p>A. Yes. Barrier removal need be accomplished only when it is &quot;readily achievable&quot; to do so.</p>
<p>Q. What does the term &quot;readily achievable&quot; mean?</p>
<p>A. It means &quot;easily accomplishable and able to be carried out without much difficulty or expense.&quot; Q. What are examples of the 
types of modifications that would be readily achievable in most cases?</p>
<p>A. Examples include the simple ramping of a few steps, the installation of grab bars where only routine reinforcement of the wall 
is required, the lowering of telephones, and similar modest adjustments.</p>
<p>Q. Will businesses need to rearrange furniture and display racks?</p>
<p>A. Possibly. For example, restaurants may need to rearrange tables and department stores may need to adjust their layout of 
racks and shelves in order to permit access to wheelchair users.</p>
<p>Q. Will businesses need to install elevators?</p>
<p>A. Businesses are not required to retrofit their facilities to install elevators unless such installation is readily achievable, which is 
unlikely in most cases.</p>
<p>Q. When barrier removal is not readily achievable, what kinds of alternative steps are required by the ADA? A. Alternatives may 
include such measures as in-store assistance for removing articles from inaccessible shelves, home delivery of groceries, or 
coming to the door to receive or return dry cleaning.</p>
<p>Q. Must alternative steps be taken without regard to cost?</p>
<p>A. No, only readily achievable alternative steps must be undertaken.</p>
<p>Q. How is &quot;readily achievable&quot; determined in a multisite business?</p>
<p>A. In determining whether an action to make a public accommodation accessible would be &quot;readily achievable,&quot; the overall size 
of the parent corporation or entity is only one factor to be considered. The ADA also permits consideration of the financial 
resources of the particular facility or facilities involved and the administrative or fiscal relationship of the facility or facilities to the 
parent entity.</p>
<p>Q. Who has responsibility for ADA compliance in leased places of public accommodation, the landlord or the tenant? A. The 
ADA places the legal obligation to remove barriers or provide auxiliary aids and services on both the landlord and the tenant. 
The landlord and the tenant may decide by lease who will actually make the changes and provide the aids and services, but both 
remain legally responsible. Q. What does the ADA require in new construction? A. The ADA requires that all new construction 
of places of public accommodation, as well as of &quot;commercial facilities&quot; such as office buildings, be accessible. Elevators are 
generally not required in facilities under three stories or with fewer than 3,000 square feet per floor, unless the building is a 
shopping center or mall; the professional office of a health care provider; a terminal, depot, or other public transit station; or an 
airport passenger terminal. Q. Is it expensive to make all newly constructed places of public accommodation and commercial 
facilities accessible? A. The cost of incorporating accessibility features in new construction is less than one percent of 
construction costs. This is a small price in relation to the economic benefits to be derived from full accessibility in the future, such 
as increased employment and consumer spending and decreased welfare dependency. Q. Must every feature of a new facility be 
accessible? A. No, only a specified number of elements such as parking spaces and drinking fountains must be made accessible 
in order for a facility to be &quot;readily accessible.&quot; Certain nonoccupiable spaces such as elevator pits, elevator penthouses, and 
piping or equipment catwalks need not be accessible.</p>
<p>Q. What are the ADA requirements for altering facilities?</p>
<p>A. All alterations that could affect the usability of a facility must be made in an accessible manner to the maximum extent feasible. 
For example, if during renovations a doorway is being relocated, the new doorway must be wide enough to meet the new 
construction standard for accessibility. When alterations are made to a primary function area, such as the lobby of a bank or the 
dining area of a cafeteria, an accessible path of travel to the altered area must also be provided.</p>
<p>The bathrooms, telephones, and drinking fountains serving that area must also be made accessible. These additional accessibility 
alterations are only required to the extent that the added accessibility costs do not exceed 20% of the cost of the original 
alteration. Elevators are generally not required in facilities under three stories or with fewer than 3,000 square feet per floor, 
unless the building is a shopping center or mall; the professional office of a health care provider; a terminal, depot, or other public 
transit station; or an airportpassenger terminal.</p>
<p>Q. Does the ADA permit an individual with a disability to sue a business when that individual believes that discrimination is about 
to occur, or must the individual wait for the discrimination to occur?</p>
<p>A. The ADA public accommodations provisions permit an individual to allege discrimination based on a reasonable belief that 
discrimination is about to occur. This provision, for example, allows a person who uses a wheelchair to challenge the planned 
construction of a new place of public accommodation, such as a shopping mall, that would not be accessible to individuals who 
use wheelchairs. The resolution of such challenges prior to the construction of an inaccessible facility would enable any necessary 
remedial measures to be incorporated in the building at the planning stage, when such changes would be relatively inexpensive.</p>
<p>Q. How does the ADA affect existing State and local building codes?</p>
<p>A. Existing codes remain in effect. The ADA allows the Attorney General to certify that a State law, local building code, or 
similar ordinance that establishes accessibility requirements meets or exceeds the minimum accessibility requirements for public 
accommodations and commercial facilities. Any State or local government may apply for certification of its code or ordinance. 
The Attorney General can certify a code or ordinance only after prior notice and a public hearing at which interested people, 
including individuals with disabilities, are provided an opportunity to testify against the certification.</p>
<p>Q. What is the effect of certification of a State or local code or ordinance?</p>
<p>A. Certification can be advantageous if an entity has constructed or altered a facility according to a certified code or ordinance. If 
someone later brings an enforcement proceeding against the entity, the certification is considered &quot;rebuttable evidence&quot; that the 
State law or local ordinance meets or exceeds the minimum requirements of the ADA. In other words, the entity can argue that 
the construction or alteration met the requirements of the ADA because it was done in compliance with the State or local code 
that had been certified.</p>
<p>Q. When are the public accommodations provisions effective? A. In general, they became effective on January 26, 1992. Q. 
How will the public accommodations provisions be enforced? A. Private individuals may bring lawsuits in which they can obtain 
court orders to stop discrimination. Individuals may also file complaints with the Attorney General, who is authorized to bring 
lawsuits in cases of general public importance or where a &quot;pattern or practice&quot; of discrimination is alleged. In these cases, the 
Attorney General may seek monetary damages and civil penalties. Civil penalties may not exceed $50,000 for a first violation or 
$100,000 for any subsequent violation. MISCELLANEOUS Q. Is the Federal government covered by the ADA? A. The ADA 
does not cover the executive branch of the Federal government. The executive branch continues to be covered by title V of the 
Rehabilitation Act of 1973, which prohibits discrimination in services and employment on the basis of handicap and which is a 
model for the requirements of the ADA. The ADA, however, does cover Congress and other entities in the legislative branch of 
the Federal government. Q. Does the ADA cover private apartments and private homes?</p>
<p>A. The ADA does not cover strictly residential private apartments and homes. If, however, a place of public accommodation, 
such as a doctor's office or day care center, is located in a private residence, those portions of the residence used for that 
purpose are subject to the ADA's requirements.</p>
<p>Q. Does the ADA cover air transportation?</p>
<p>A. Discrimination by air carriers in areas other than employment is not covered by the ADA but rather by the Air Carrier Access 
Act (49 U.S.C. 1374 (c)).</p>
<p>Q. What are the ADA's requirements for public transit buses?</p>
<p>A. The Department of Transportation has issued regulations mandating accessible public transit vehicles and facilities. The 
regulations include requirements that all new fixed-route, public transit buses be accessible and that supplementary paratransit 
services be provided for those individuals with disabilities who cannot use fixed-route bus service. For information on how to 
contact the Department of Transportation, see page 30.</p>
<p>Q. How will the ADA make telecommunications accessible?</p>
<p>A. The ADA requires the establishment of telephone relay services for individuals who use telecommunications devices for deaf 
persons (TDD's) or similar devices. The Federal Communications Commission has issued regulations specifying standards for the 
operation of these services.</p>
<p>Q. Are businesses entitled to any tax benefit to help pay for the cost of compliance?</p>
<p>A. As amended in 1990, the Internal Revenue Code allows a deduction of up to $15,000 per year for expenses associated with 
the removal of qualified architectural and transportation barriers. The 1990 amendment also permits eligible small businesses to 
receive a tax credit for certain costs of compliance with the ADA. An eligible small business is one whose gross receipts do not 
exceed $1,000,000 or whose workforce does not consist of more than 30 full-time workers. Qualifying businesses may claim a 
credit of up to 50 percent of eligible access expenditures that exceed $250 but do not exceed $10,250. Examples of eligible 
access expenditures include the necessary and reasonable costs of removing architectural, physical, communications, and 
transportation barriers; providing readers, interpreters, and other auxiliary aids; and acquiring or modifying equipment or devices.</p>

<h4>Compliance Guide to the Family and Medical Leave Act</h4>
<p>The &quot;Family and&quot; Medical Leave Act (FMLA) becomes effective on August 5, 1993. The Secretary of Labor has issued 
regulations to implement the FMLA.1 This &quot;Guide to Compliance&quot; begins by summarizing those regulations, explaining the basic 
provisions of the new law, and the rights and responsibilities of affected employers and employees. After this summary of the 
FMLA's requirements; specific questions are addressed. The information provided in response to the questions posed below, or 
the regulations themselves, will provide greater detail on how the law works.</p>
<p>1 See the Federal Register dated June 4, 1993, Vol 58, No. 106, pages 31794- 31839. Similar provisions also apply to most 
federal and Congressional employees, which are administered by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) or the 
Congress.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>The Family and Medical Leave Act was enacted on February 5, 1993.</p>
<p>The new law is in effective on August 5, 1993, for most employers. If a collective bargaining agreement (CBA) is in effect on that 
date, the Act becomes effective on the expiration date of the CBA or February 5, 1994, whichever is earlier. This delay in the 
effective date applies only to employees covered by a CBA in effect on August 5, 1993, and not - - for example - - to non- 
bargaining unit employees.</p>
<p>The Wage and Hour Division of the U.S. Department of Labor's Employment Standards Administration administers and 
enforces FMLA for all private, State and local government employees, and some federal employees.</p>
<p>FMLA entitles eligible employees to take up to 12 weeks of unpaid, job- protected leave each year for specified family and 
medical reasons. An eligible employee's right to FMLA leave begins on August 5, 1993. Any leave taken before that date does 
not count as FMLA leave. However, events qualifying under the Act for FMLA leave purposes (e.g., the birth of a child) 
occurring before August 5, 1993, still entitle eligible employees to the benefits of FMLA on and after August 5, 1993.</p>
<p>The new law contains provisions relating to employer coverage; employee eligibility for the benefits of the law; entitlement to 
leave, maintenance of health benefits during leave, and job restoration after leave; notice and certification of the need for FMLA 
leave; and protections for employees who request or take FMLA leave. In addition, the law includes certain employer 
recordkeeping requirements.</p>
<h4>Purposes of the FMLA</h4>
<p>The FMLA allows employees to balance their work and family life by taking reasonable unpaid leave for certain reasons. The 
FMLA is intended to balance the demands of the workplace with the needs of families, to promote the stability and economic 
security of families, and to promote national interests in preserving family integrity. The FMLA seeks to accomplish these 
purposes in a manner that accommodates the legitimate interests of employers, and which minimizes the potential for employment 
discrimination on the basis of sex, while promoting equal employment opportunity for men and women.</p>
<p>The enactment of the FMLA was predicated on two fundamental concerns - - the needs of the U.S. workforce and the 
development of high- performance organizations. Increasingly, American children and growing numbers of the elderly are 
dependent on working family members who spend long hours on the job. When family emergencies arise, requiring employees to 
attend to their seriously- ill children or parents, or to newly- born or adopted infants, or even to their own serious illness, workers 
need reassurance that they will not need to choose between their job security and meeting their personal and family obligations or 
tending to vital needs at home.</p>
<h4>Employer Coverage</h4>
<p>FMLA applies to all:</p>
<pre>

   * public agencies, including State, local and federal
     employers, and local education agencies (schools); and,
   * private sector employers who employ 50 or more employees
     for at least 20 workweeks in the current or preceding
     calendar year and who are engaged in commerce or in any
     industry or activity affecting commerce - -  including joint
     employers and successors of covered employers.</pre>
<p>For FMLA purposes, most federal and Congressional employees are under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Office of Personnel 
Management (OPM) or the Congress.</p>
<h4>Employee Eligibility</h4>
<p>To be eligible for FMLA benefits, an employee must:</p>
<p>(1) work for a covered employer;</p>
<p>(2) have worked for the employer for at least a total of 12 months;</p>
<p>(3) have worked at least 1,250 hours over the prior 12 months; and,</p>
<p>(4) work at a location where at least 50 employees are employed by the employer within 75 miles.</p>
<h4>Leave Entitlement</h4>
<p>A covered employer must grant an eligible employee up to a total of 12 workweeks of unpaid leave during any 12- month period 
for one or more of the following reasons:</p>
<pre>
   * for the birth or placement of a child for adoption or
     foster care;
   * to care for an immediate family member (spouse, child, or
     parent) with a serious health condition; or,
   * to take medical leave when the employee is unable to work
     because of a serious health condition.</pre>
<p>Spouses employed by the same employer are jointly entitled to a combined total of 12 workweeks of family leave for the birth or 
placement of a child for adoption or foster care, and to care for parent (but not a parent &quot;inlaw&quot;) who has a serious health 
condition.</p>
<p>Leave for birth or adoption (including foster care placement) must conclude within 12 months of the birth or placement.</p>
<p>Intermittent Leave - - Under some circumstances, employees may take FMLA leave intermittently - - which means taking leave 
in blocks of time, or by reducing their normal weekly or daily work schedule.</p>
<p>Where FMLA leave is for birth or placement for adoption or foster care, use of intermittent leave is subject to the employer's 
approval.</p>
<p>FMLA leave may be taken intermittently whenever it is medically necessary to care for a seriously ill family member, or because 
the employee is seriously ill and unable to work. If the need for intermittent leave is foreseeable based on planned medical 
treatment, the employee is responsible for scheduling the treatment in a manner that does not unduly disrupt the employer's 
operations, subject to the approval of the health care provider.</p>
<p>In such cases, the employer may also transfer the employee temporarily to an alternative job with equivalent pay and benefits that 
better accommodates recurring periods of leave than the employee's regular job.</p>
<p>Substitution of Paid Leave - - Subject to certain conditions, employees or employers may choose to use or require the use of 
accrued paid leave (such as sick or vacation leave) to cover some or all of the otherwise unpaid FMLA leave.</p>
<p>The employer is responsible for designating if paid leave used by an employee counts as FMLA leave, based on information 
provided by the employee. In no case can an employee's paid leave be credited as FMLA leave after the leave has been 
completed.</p>
<p>Serious Health Condition - - &quot;Serious health condition&quot; means an illness, injury, impairment, or physical or mental condition that 
involves:</p>
<pre>
   * any period of incapacity or treatment connected with
     inpatient care (i.e., an overnight stay) in a hospital,
     hospice, or residential medical care facility;
   * any period of incapacity requiring absence of more than
     three calendar days from work, school, or other regular
     daily activities that also involves continuing treatment
     by (or under the supervision of) a health care provider;
     or,
   * continuing treatment by (or under the supervision of) a
     health care provider for a chronic or long- term health
     condition that is incurable or so serious that, if not
     treated, would likely result in a period of incapacity of
     more than three calendar days, and for prenatal care.
</pre>
<p>Health Care Provider - - Health care providers who qualify under the regulations to provide certification of a serious health 
condition for an employee or an immediate family member include:</p>
<pre>
   * doctors of medicine or osteopathy authorized to practice
     medicine or surgery (as appropriate) by the State in which
     the doctor practices; or,
   * podiatrists, dentists, clinical psychologists,
     optometrists, and chiropractors (limited to treatment
     consisting of manual manipulation of the spine to correct
     a subluxation as demonstrated by X- ray to exist)
     authorized to practice in the State and performing within
     the scope of their practice under State law; or,
   * nurse; practitioners and nurse- midwives authorized to
     practice under State law and performing within the scope
     of their practice as defined under State law; or,
   * Christian Science practitioners listed with the First
     Church of Christ, Scientist in Boston,  Massachusetts.
</pre>
<h4>Maintenance of Health Benefits</h4>
<p>A covered employer is required to maintain group health insurance coverage for an employee on FMLA leave whenever such 
insurance was provided before the leave was taken, and on the same terms as if the employee had continued to work.</p>
<p>Where appropriate, arrangements will need to be made for employees taking unpaid FMLA leave to pay their share of health 
insurance premiums while on leave. For example, if the group health plan involves co- payments by the employer and the 
employee, an employee on FMLA leave must continue making insurance premium payments to maintain insurance coverage, as 
must the employer. The employee and employer need to work out the method for the employee to pay his; or her share of health 
insurance premiums while on unpaid FMLA leave.</p>
<p>An employer's obligation to maintain health benefits under FMLA will stop if and when an employee informs the employer of an 
intent not to return to work at the end of the leave period, or if the employee fails to return to work when the FMLA leave 
entitlement is used up.</p>
<p>In some instances, the employer may recover premiums it paid to maintain health insurance coverage for an employee who fails 
to return to work from FMLA leave.</p>
<p>Other Benefits - - Certain types of earned benefits, such as seniority, need not continue to accrue during periods of unpaid 
FMLA leave. For other benefits, such as elected life insurance coverage, the employer and the employee need to make 
arrangements so that the benefits may be maintained during periods of unpaid FMLA leave. Except for accrued or earned 
benefits (such as seniority), the employee must be restored to the same benefits upon return from FMLA leave as if the employee 
had continued to work the entire FMLA leave period. Use of FMLA leave cannot result in the loss of any benefit that accrued 
before the employee's leave began. Accordingly, an FMLA leave period cannot be counted as a break in service for purposes of 
vesting or eligibility to participate in benefit programs.</p>
<h4>Job Restoration</h4>
<p>Upon return from FMLA leave, an employee must be restored to his or her original job, or to an equivalent job with equivalent 
pay, benefits, and other employment terms and conditions.</p>
<p>In addition, an employee's use of FMLA leave cannot result in the loss of any employment benefit that the employee earned or 
was entitled to before using FMLA leave.</p>
<p>&quot;Key&quot; Employee Exception - - Under specified and limited circumstances where restoration to employment will cause substantial 
and grievous economic injury to its operations, the employer may refuse to reinstate certain highly- paid &quot;key&quot; employees after 
using FMLA leave during which health benefits are maintained. In order to do so, the employer must:</p>
<p>* notify the employee of his/her status as a &quot;key&quot; employee in response to the employee's notice of intent to take FMLA leave;</p>
<p>* notify the employee as soon as the employer decides it will deny job restoration and explain the reasons for this decision;</p>
<p>* offer the employee a reasonable opportunity to return to work from FMLA leave after giving this notice; and,</p>
<p>* make a final determination as to whether reinstatement will be denied at the end of the leave period if the employee then 
requests restoration.</p>
<p>A &quot;key&quot; employee is a salaried &quot;eligible&quot; employee who is among the highest paid ten percent of employees within 75 miles of the 
work site.</p>
<h4>Notice and Certification</h4>
<p>Employees seeking to use FMLA leave may be required to provide:</p>
<p>* 30- day advance notice of the need to take FMLA leave when the need is foreseeable;</p>
<p>* medical certifications supporting the need for leave due to a serious health condition affecting the employee or an immediate 
family member;</p>
<p>* second or third medical opinions and periodic recertification, at the employer's expense;</p>
<p>* periodic reports during FMLA leave on the employee's status and intent to return to work; and,</p>
<p>* a &quot;fitness- for- duty&quot; certification to return to work. </p>
<p>When leave is needed to care for an immediate family member or the employee's own illness and is for planned medical 
treatment, the employee must attempt to schedule treatment so that it will not unduly disrupt the employer's operation.</p>
<p>Employer Notices - - Covered employers must post a notice approved by the Secretary of Labor explaining rights and 
responsibilities under FMLA. An employer that willfully violates this posting requirement may be subject to a fine of up to $100 
for each separate offense.</p>
<p>In addition, covered employers are obliged to provide information to their employees about their rights and responsibilities under 
FMLA, including specific information- in response to an employee's notice of the need for FMLA leave - - regarding just what 
will be required of the employee and what might happen in certain circumstances, such as if the employee fails to return to work 
from FMLA leave.</p>
<h4>Unlawful Acts</h4>
<p>FMLA makes it unlawful for any employer to interfere with, restrain, or deny the exercise of any right provided by this law. It is 
also unlawful for an employer to discharge or discriminate against any individual for opposing any practice, or because of 
involvement in any proceeding, related to FMLA.</p>
<h4>Enforcement</h4>
<p>FMLA will be enforced by the Wage and Hour Division of the U.S. Labor Department's Employment Standards Administration. 
This agency will investigate complaints of violations. If violations cannot be satisfactorily resolved, the Department may bring 
action in court to compel compliance.</p>
<p>An eligible employee may bring a private civil action against an employer for violations.</p>
<h4>Other Provisions</h4>
<p>Special rules apply to employees of local education agencies. Generally, these rules provide for FMLA leave to be taken in 
blocks of time when the leave is needed intermittently or when leave is required near the end of a school term (semester).</p>
<p>Salaried executive, administrative, and professional employees of covered employers who meet the Fair Labor Standards Act 
(FLSA) criteria for exemption from minimum wage and overtime under Regulations, 29 CFR Part 541, do not lose their FLSA- 
exempt status by using any unpaid FMLA leave. This special exception to the &quot;salary basis&quot; requirements for FLSA's exemption 
extends only to &quot;eligible&quot; employees' use of leave required by FMLA;</p>
<p>The FMLA does not affect any other federal or State law which prohibits discrimination. It does not supersede any State or local 
law which provides more generous family or medical leave protection. Nor does it affect an employer's obligation to provide 
greater leave rights under a collective bargaining agreement or employment benefit plan. The FMLA also encourages employers 
to provide more generous leave rights.</p>
<h4>Questions</h4>
<p>Q: Does the law guarantee paid time off?.</p>
<p>No. FMLA leave is generally unpaid leave. However, in certain circumstances the use of accrued paid leave - - such as vacation 
or sick leave - - may be substituted for the unpaid leave required by the law.</p>
<p>Q. How much unpaid leave am I entitled to?</p>
<p>If you are an &quot;eligible&quot; employee of a covered employer, you are entitled to 12 weeks of leave for certain family and medical 
reasons during a 12- month period.</p>
<p>Q: Am I entitled to any paid leave while on FMLA leave? </p>
<p>The law permits you to substitute accrued paid leave under certain conditions, or your employer may require you to substitute 
paid leave.</p>
<p>Q: What if an employer already provides paid leave for the purposes covered by FMLA?</p>
<p>FMLA is intended to encourage generous family and medical leave policies. For this reason, the law does not diminish more 
generous existing leave policies or laws, though employers are entitled to conform their employment policies and practices with 
the FMLA's requirements.</p>
<p>Q: Who is considered a &quot;family member&quot; for purposes of taking FMLA leave?</p>
<p>An employee's spouse, son or daughter, and parents are immediate family members for purposes of FMLA. The term &quot;parent&quot; 
does not include a parent &quot;inlaw.&quot;</p>
<p>Q: Does FMLA leave have to be taken in whole days or whole weeks, or in one continuous block of time?</p>
<p>The FMLA permits leave for birth or placement for adoption or foster care to be taken intermittently - - that is, in blocks of time 
or by reducing the normal weekly or daily work schedule - - subject to approval by the employer. Leave for a serious health 
condition may be taken intermittently when &quot;medically necessary.</p>
<p>Q: Is there a limit to the number of times FMLA leave can be taken in one year?</p>
<p>No. An employee is entitled to take up to 12 weeks of leave in a 12- month period for any of the family and medical reasons that 
qualify for FMLA leave, without limitation. </p>
<p>Q: Can I take FMLA leave for visits to a therapist, if my doctor prescribes the therapy?</p>
<p>Yes. FMLA permits you to take leave to receive &quot;continuing treatment by a health care provider,&quot; which can include recurring 
absences for therapy treatments ordered by a doctor such as, for example, physical therapy after a hospital stay, or for treatment 
of severe arthritis. &quot;Continuing treatment&quot; includes a single visit W a health care provider that results in a regimen of continuing 
therapy under the supervision of the health care provider. </p>
<p>Q: Are there any employees who are not covered by this law? </p>
<p>Yes It's been estimated that about 60 percent of U.S. workers (and about 95 percent of U.S. employers) are not covered by the 
law. To be eligible for FMLA benefits, an employee must: (1) work for a covered employer; (2) have worked for the employer 
for at least a total of 12 months; (3) have worked at least 1,250 hours over the prior 12 months; and, (4) work at a location 
where at least 50 employees are employed by the employer within 75 miles.</p>
<p>Q: What about spouses who work for the same employer?</p>
<p>If a husband and wife work for the same employer, they may be limited to a combined total of 12 weeks of FMLA leave in a 
12- month period for the birth of a child, placement of a child for adoption or foster care, or the care of a parent with a serious 
health condition.</p>
<p>Q: What do I have to do to request FMLA leave from my employer?</p>
<p>You may be required to provide your employer with 30 days advance notice when the need for leave is &quot;foreseeable.&quot; When 
such an advance notice is not possible or the need for the leave cannot be foreseen, you must give your employer notice as soon 
as &quot;practicable.&quot;</p>
<p>Q: What kind of proof is required for my illness or that of an immediate family member?</p>
<p>You may be required to submit documentation - - called a medical certification - - from the health care provider who is treating 
you or your immediate family member.</p>
<p>Q: Can my employer require additional proof?.</p>
<p>Your employer may require you to obtain additional medical certification from a health care provider of the employer's choice, 
and at the employer's expense.</p>
<p>Q: Can my employer require me to return to work before I exhaust my leave?</p>
<p>Subject to certain limitations, your employer may deny the continuation of FMLA leave due to a serious health condition if you 
fail to fulfill obligations to provide supporting medical certification as required by the law.</p>
<p>Q: Are there any restrictions on how I spend my time while on leave?</p>
<p>Generally no, provided the leave is taken for a legitimate family or medical reason and all appropriate notice and certification 
requirements are met. However, employers with established policies regarding outside employment while on paid or unpaid leave 
may uniformly apply this policy to employees on FMLA leave.</p>
<p>Q: Can my employer make inquiries about my leave during my absence?</p>
<p>Yes, but only to you. Your employer may have reason to confirm whether the leave needed or being taken qualifies for FMLA 
purposes, and may require periodic reports on your status and intent to return to work after leave. Also, if the employer has 
reason to doubt the validity of a medical certification or wishes to obtain another opinion, you may be required to obtain 
additional medical certification at the employer's expense, or recertification during a period of unpaid FMLA leave.</p>
<p>Q: Can my employer refuse to grant me FMLA leave?</p>
<p>If you are an &quot;eligible&quot; employee who has met FMLA's notice and certification requirements (and you have not exhausted your 
FMLA leave entitlement for the year) you may not be denied FMLA leave.</p>
<p>Q: Will I lose my job if I take FMLA leave?</p>
<p>Generally, no. It is unlawful for any employer to interfere with or restrain or deny the exercise of any right provided under the 
law. However, an employer may deny reinstatement to work - - but not the use of FMLA leave or maintenance of health 
insurance coverage during the leave - - to certain highly- paid salaried (&quot;key&quot;) employees under certain circumstances.</p>
<p>Q. Are there other circumstances in which my employer can deny me my job after using FMLA leave?</p>
<p>In addition to denying reinstatement in certain circumstances to &quot;key&quot; employees, employers are not required to reinstate 
employees who would have been laid off or otherwise had their employment terminated had they continued to work during the 
period leave was used (for example, employees hired for a specific term of employment that expires). Also, under certain 
circumstances, employers who advise employees experiencing a serious health condition that they will require a medical 
certificate of fitness for duty to return to work may deny reinstatement to an employee who fails to provide such a certificate until 
it is provided.</p>
<p>Q: Can my employer fire me for complaining about a violation of FMLA?</p>
<p>No, nor can the employer take any other adverse employment action on this basis~ It is unlawful for any employer to discharge 
or otherwise discriminate against an employee for opposing a practice made unlawful under FMLA.</p>
<p>Q: Will I be allowed to return to my same job after my leave? </p>
<p>Generally, yes. Ordinarily you will be restored to the same position you held prior to the leave, with the same pay and benefits, if 
the position remains available. You may be restored to an &quot;equivalent position&quot; rather than the position you held before taking 
leave if the previous position is not available. An equivalent position must have equivalent pay, benefits, and terms and conditions 
of employment as the original job.</p>
<p>Q: Do I lose all my benefits when I take unpaid FMLA leave? </p>
<p>Your employer is required to maintain health insurance coverage on the same terms it was provided before the leave 
commences, as if you continued to work.</p>
<p>In addition, the use of FMLA leave cannot result in the loss of any employment benefit that accrued prior to the start of your 
leave. Certain other earned benefits, such as seniority, do not need to continue to accrue during a period of unpaid FMLA leave. 
And for still other kinds of benefits, such as elected life insurance coverage, arrangements may need to be made between you 
and your employer so that they are continued during a period of FMLA leave. With the sole exception of accrued or earned 
benefits such as seniority, unless you elect otherwise, you must be restored to the same benefits upon return from FMLA leave 
as if you had continued to work during the period of the leave.</p>
<p>Q: Are there any differences in how the law applies to private and public sector employees or employers?</p>
<p>The 50- employee coverage test does not apply to public sector employers or to public or private education agencies (schools). 
However, the public agency or school system must employ 50 employees within a 75- mile area around the work site in order 
for an employee to be &quot;eligible&quot; and entitled to FMLA benefits.</p>
<p>Q: Are there any special rules that apply to any groups of employees?</p>
<p>Special rules apply to instructional employees of &quot;local educational agencies,&quot; including public school boards and elementary and 
secondary schools under their jurisdiction, and private elementary and secondary schools. Generally, these rules provide for 
FMLA leave to be taken in blocks of time when the leave is needed intermittently or is required near the end of a school term.</p>
<p>Q: What if my employer does not know about the Family and Medical Leave Act?</p>
<p>Your employer may contact the nearest office of the Wage and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, of the 
U.S. Department of Labor for information and guidance.</p>
<p>Q: What if I believe my employer is violating the law? </p>
<p>You have the choice of filing, or having another person file on your behalf, a complaint with the Employment Standards 
Administration, Wage and Hour Division, or you can elect to</p>
<p>file a private lawsuit. </p>
<p>For more information, please contact the nearest office of the Wage and Hour Division, listed in most telephone directories under 
U.S. Government, Department of Labor, Employment Standards Administration. </p>

<h3>Facts for Consumers from the Federal Trade Commission</h3>
<h2>Choosing a Career or Vocational School -- April 1993</h2>
<p>Whether you are entering the job market for the first time, or changing careers, you may need to learn a special skill to qualify for 
the job you want. To help you reach your goal, you may need to attend a private career or vocational school. Such schools offer 
a wide variety of training programs: dental assistant; hair stylist; automotive technician; machinist; truck driver; paralegal; interior 
designer, to list a few. These programs usually take less time to complete than the degree programs offered by two or four-year 
institutions. Some career or vocational schools also may help you in locating prospective employers and submitting job 
applications.</p>
<p>While many private career or vocational schools are reputable and teach skills necessary to get a good job, others make 
promises they do not deliver. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has brought charges against several schools for false 
advertising.</p>
<p>This brochure describes some deceptive practices found by the FTC in its investigations. It also recommends some precautions 
to take before enrolling in a career or vocational school. Further, it suggests questions you might ask school representatives in an 
early interview.</p>
<h4>Common Deceptive Practices</h4>
<p>The FTC has received complaints and ordered some private schools to correct the way they represent training and employment 
opportunities. For example, some schools:</p>
<ul>
<li>misrepresented chances of future employment in certain industries.<p>misrepresented earning levels for certain careers.</p>
<p>failed to tell students about cancellation and refund policies or failed to make refunds in keeping with their policies</p>
<p>misrepresented the thoroughness of their job training.</p>
<p>misrepresented their business connections with specific industries.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Some Considerations</h4>
<p>Before enrolling in a career or vocational school, the FTC offers the following suggestions.</p>
<p>Investigate several types of training programs before committing yourself to a career or vocational school.</p>
<p>Community colleges often offer programs at lower costs than private schools, although the college programs may take longer to 
complete. Businesses also may offer educational programs through apprenticeships or on-the-job-training.</p>
<p>Learn about the school's faculty and classroom facilities.</p>
<p>Ask about the qualifications of the instructors and the size of most classes. Look at the school's facilities and check the 
equipment to find out if it is the type you are likely to use on the job after graduation.</p>
<p>Ask the school's administrator about the success rate of the programs.</p>
<p>Find out what percentage of the students graduate. A high dropout rate could mean that students were not satisfied with the 
program. Also, ask for a list of recent graduates and talk to them about their experiences with the school.</p>
<p>Investigate the job placement aspect of the program and ask about job placement rates.</p>
<p>If a school says it will help you find a job, what does this include? Will the school contact potential employers and set up 
interviews? Will you receive counseling on how to interview, obtain, and keep a job? What percentage of the graduates are 
placed in promised jobs? According to the U.S. Department of Education, if the school advertises its job placement rates, it also 
must publish the most recent available data about employment statistics, graduation statistics, and any other information 
necessary to support its claims.</p>
<p>Contact the personnel offices of appropriate companies. Ask if they have hired, or would be willing to hire, graduates of the 
school(s) you are considering. If the company will respond, their answers may be useful.</p>
<p>Find out about financial assistance.</p>
<p>Try to get information on all Federal, state, local, private, and institutional financial aid programs. Ask the school about the 
procedures for submitting applications. Remember, you likely will be obligated to pay at least part of a loan back to the lending 
institution regardless of whether you complete your training at the school or find a job.</p>
<p>Most financial aid programs are backed by, or available through, the U.S. Department of Education. This agency can provide 
information about Federal student financial-aid programs and help you complete a financial-aid application. Their toll-free 
number is (800) 433-3243.</p>
<p>Know the tuition costs and understand the school's cancellation and refund policies. The school must explain its refund policy in 
writing. Also, it must tell students about any changes in that policy.</p>
<p>Ask for the names of the school's licensing and accrediting organizations.</p>
<p>Accreditation means a private educational agency or association has evaluated the school and found it meets certain minimum 
requirements. In most states, private career schools are licensed through the state's department of education. However, in some 
states, truck driver training schools are licensed through the state's transportation department.</p>
<p>Check out the school with consumer protection offices before enrolling.</p>
<p>You can contact your local consumer office and Better Business Bureau to learn if they have any complaints against the school 
you are considering.</p>
<p>Ask to review a copy of the school's contract. Read the contract carefully before you sign it. This is important because the 
contract explains your rights and responsibilities in dealing with the school. Make sure all the school's promises are in writing.</p>
<h4>Regarding Information and Problems</h4>
<p>If you are dissatisfied with the quality of instruction provided by your school, talk to faculty members, the school administration, 
or contact your state board of education. If you experience a problem related to your contract with the school, try to resolve the 
dispute with the school, but if you do not succeed, report your problem to your local or state consumer protection office.</p>
<p>You also may file a complaint with the FTC. Write: Correspondence Branch, Federal Trade Commission, Washington, DC 
20580. Although the FTC generally cannot intervene in individual disputes, the information you provide may indicate a pattern of 
possible law violations requiring action by the Commission.</p>
<p>If you received Federally-backed financial assistance funds to pay for private career school training, you also can call the 
Department of Education to report your problem. The toll-free number is (800) MIS-USED, or in the Washington, D.C. area, 
call 202-205-5770.</p>

<h3>Facts for Consumers from the Federal Trade Commission</h3>
<h2>Franchise and Business Opportunities -- December 1993</h2>
<p>Buying a franchise or a business opportunity may be appealing if you want to be your own boss, but have limited capital and 
business experience. However, without carefully investigating a business before you purchase, you may make a serious mistake. 
It is important to find out if a particular business is right for you and if it has the potential to yield the financial return you expect. 
The FTC's Franchise and Business Opportunity Rule requires that franchise and business opportunity sellers provide certain 
information to help you in your decision.</p>
<h4>Use the FTC Rule</h4>
<p>Under the FTC rule, a franchise or business opportunity seller must give you a detailed disclosure document at least 10 business 
days before you pay any money or legally commit yourself to a purchase. This document gives 20 important items of information 
about the business, including:</p>
<p>the names, addresses, and telephone numbers of other purchasers;</p>
<p>a fully-audited financial statement of the seller;</p>
<p>the background and experience of the business's key executives;</p>
<p>the cost required to start and maintain the business; and</p>
<p>the responsibilities you and the seller will have to each other once you buy.</p>
<h4>Ask for the Disclosure Document</h4>
<p>The disclosure document is a valuable tool that not only helps you obtain information about a proposed business, but assists you 
in comparing it with other businesses. If you are not given a disclosure document, ask why you did not receive one. Some 
franchise or business opportunity sellers may not be required to give you a disclosure document. If any franchise or business 
opportunity says it is not covered by the rule, you may want to verify it with the FTC, an attorney, or a business advisor. Even if 
the business is not legally required to give the document, you still may want to ask for the data to help you make an informed 
investment decision.</p>
<h4>Get all the Facts</h4>
<p>Here are some important things to do before buying a business:</p>
<p>Study the disclosure document and proposed contract carefully.</p>
<p>Talk to current owners. The disclosure document must list the names and addresses of other people who currently own and 
operate the franchise or business opportunity. These people are likely to be important sources of information. Try to call a 
number of owners to find out about the company. Ask them how the information in the disclosure document matches their 
experiences with the company. Remember, a list of company-selected references cannot be substituted for the list of franchises 
or business opportunity owners required under the FTC rule.</p>
<p>Investigate earnings claims. Earnings claims are only estimates. The FTC rule requires companies to have in writing the facts on 
which they base their earnings claims. Make sure you understand the basis for a seller's earnings claims.</p>
<p>Sellers also must tell you in writing the number and percentage of other owners who have done as well as they claim you will do. 
Remember broad sales claims about a successful areas of business such as, &quot;Be a part of our four billion dollar industry&quot; may 
have no bearing on the likelihood of your own success. Keep in mind that once you buy the business, you may be competing 
with other franchise owners or independent business people with more experience.</p>
<p>Shop around: compare franchises with other available business opportunities. You may discover that other companies offer 
benefits not available from the first company you considered. The Franchise Opportunities Handbook, published annually by the 
U.S. Department of Commerce, describes more than 1,400 companies that offer franchises. Contact other companies and ask 
for their disclosure documents. Then you can compare offerings.</p>
<p>Listen carefully to the sales presentation. Some sales tactics should signal caution. For example, if you are pressured to sign 
immediately &quot;because prices will go up tomorrow,&quot; or &quot;another buyer wants this deal,&quot; you should slow down, not accelerate, 
your purchase decision. A seller with a good offer does not have to use this sort of pressure. Remember, under the FTC rule, the 
seller must wait at least 10 business days after giving you the required documents before you may pay any money or sign any 
agreement. Be on guard if the salesperson makes the job sound too easy. The thought of &quot;easy money&quot; may be appealing, but, as 
we all know, success usually requires hard work.</p>
<p>Get the seller's promises in writing. Any important promises you get from a salesperson should be written into the contract you 
sign. If the salesperson says one thing but the contract says nothing about it or says something different, your contract is what 
counts. Whatever the reasons, if a seller balks at putting verbal promises in writing, you should be alert to potential problems. 
You might want to look for another business.</p>
<p>Consider getting professional advice. Unless you have had considerable business experience, you may want to get a lawyer, an 
accountant, or a business advisor to read the disclosure document and proposed contract to counsel you and help you get the 
best deal. Remember, the initial money and time you spend on getting professional assistance verifying facts, such as making 
phone calls to owners, could save you from a major loss on a bad investment.</p>
<h4>For More Information</h4>
<p>Although the FTC cannot resolve individual disputes, information about your experiences and concerns is vital to the enforcement 
of the Franchise and Business Opportunities Rule. Send questions, complaints, or requests for more detailed information to: 
Correspondence Branch, Federal Trade Commission, Washington, D.C. 20580. For a free copy of Best Sellers, a complete list

<h2>Handy Reference Guide to the Fair Labor Standards Act </h2>
<p>The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) establishes minimum wage, overtime pay, record-keeping, and child labor standards 
affecting more than 80 million full-time and part-time workers in the private sector and in Federal, State, and local governments.</p>
<p>The Wage and Hour Division (Wage-Hour) administers and enforces FLSA with respect to private employment, State and local 
government employment, and Federal employees of the Library of Congress, U.S. Postal Service, Postal Rate Commission, and 
the Tennessee Valley Authority. The Office of Personnel Management is responsible for enforcement with regard to all other 
Federal employees.</p>
<p>Special rules apply to State and local government employment involving fire protection and law enforcement activities, volunteer 
services, and compensatory time off in lieu of cash overtime pay.</p>
<h4>Basic Wage Standards</h4>
<p>Covered nonexempt workers are entitled to a minimum wage of not less than $4.25 an hour. Overtime pay at a rate of not less 
than one and one-half times their regular rates of pay is required after 40 hours of work in a workweek.</p>
<p>Wages required by FLSA are due on the regular payday for the pay period covered. Deductions made from wages for such 
items as cash or merchandise shortages, employercrequired uniforms, and tools of the trade, are not legal to the extent that they 
reduce the wages of employees below the minimum rate required by FLSA or reduce the amount of overtime pay due under 
FLSA.</p>
<p>The FLSA contains some exemptions from these basic standards. Some apply to specific types of businesses; others apply to 
specific kinds of work.</p>
<p>While FLSA does set basic minimum wage and overtime pay standards and regulates the employment of minors, there are a 
number of employment practices which FLSA does not regulate.</p>
<p>For example, FLSA does not require:</p>
<p>(1) vacation, holiday, severance, or sick pay;</p>
<p>(2) meal or rest periods, holidays off, or vacations;</p>
<p>(3) premium pay for weekend or holiday work;</p>
<p>(4) pay raises or fringe benefits; and</p>
<p>(5) a discharge notice, reason for discharge, or immediate payment of final wages to terminated employees.</p>
<p>The FLSA does not provide wage payment or collection procedures for an employee's usual or promised wages or commissions 
in excess of those required by the FLSA. However, some states do have laws under which such claims (sometimes including 
fringe benefits) may be filed.</p>
<p>Also, FLSA does not limit the number of hours in a day or days in a week an employee may be required or scheduled to work if 
the employee is at least 16 years old.</p>
<p>These matters are for agreement between the employer and the employees or their authorized representatives.</p>
<h4>Who is Covered?</h4>
<p>All employees of certain enterprises having workers engaged in interstate commerce, producing goods for interstate commerce, 
or handling, selling, or otherwise working on goods or materials that have been moved in or produced for such commerce by any 
person are covered by FLSA.</p>
<p>A covered enterprise is the related activities performed through unified operation or common control by any person or persons 
for a common business purpose and -- (1) whose annual gross volume of sales made or business done is not less than $500,000 
(exclusive of excise taxes at the retail level that are separately stated); or</p>
<p>(2) is engaged in the operation of a hospital, an institution primarily engaged in the care of those who are physically or mentally ill 
or disabled or aged, and who reside on the premises, a school for children who are mentally or physically disabled or gifted, a 
preschool, an elementary or secondary school, or an institution of higher education (whether operated for profit or not for profit); 
or</p>
<p>(3) is an activity of a public agency.</p>
<p>Construction and laundry/dry cleaning enterprises, which were previously covered regardless of their annual dollar volume of 
business, are now subject to the $500,000 test.</p>
<p>Any enterprise that was covered by FLSA on March 31, 1990, and that ceased to be covered because of the increase in the 
enterprise coverage dollar volume test must continue to pay its employees not less than $3.35 an hour, and continues to be 
subject to the overtime pay, child labor and record-keeping provisions of FLSA.</p>
<p>Employees of firms which are not covered enterprises under FLSA may still be subject to its minimum wage, overtime pay, and 
child labor provisions if they are individually engaged in interstate commerce or in the production of goods for interstate 
commerce. Such employees include those who: work in communications or transportation; regularly use the mails, telephones, or 
telegraph for interstate communication, or keep records of interstate transactions; handle, ship, or receive goods moving in 
interstate commerce; regularly cross State lines in the course of employment; or work for independent employers who contract 
to do clerical, custodial, maintenance, or other work for firms engaged in interstate commerce or in the production of goods for 
interstate commerce.</p>
<p>Domestic service workers such as day workers, housekeepers, chauffeurs, cooks, or full-time babysitters are covered if they (1) 
receive at least $50 in cash wages in a calendar quarter from their employers, or (2) work a total of more than 8 hours a week 
for one or more employers.</p>
<h4>Tipped Employees</h4>
<p>Tipped employees are those who customarily and regularly receive more than $30 a month in tips. The employer may consider 
tips as part of wages, but such a wage credit must not exceed 50 percent of the minimum wage.</p>
<p>The employer who elects to use the tip credit provision must inform the employee in advance and must be able to show that the 
employee receives at least the minimum wage when direct wages and the tip credit allowance are combined. Also, employees 
must retain all of their tips, except to the extent that they participate in a valid tip pooling or sharing arrangement.</p>
<h4>Employer-Furnished Facilities</h4>
<p>The reasonable cost or fair value of board, lodging, or other facilities customarily furnished by the employer for the employee's 
benefit may be considered part of wages.</p>
<h4>Industrial Homework </h4>
<p>The performance of certain types of work in an employee's home is prohibited under the law unless the employer has obtained 
prior certification from the Department of Labor. Restrictions apply in the manufacture of knitted outerwear, gloves and mittens, 
buttons and buckles, handkerchiefs, embroideries, and jewelry (where safety and health hazards are not involved). The 
manufacture of women's apparel (and jewelry under hazardous conditions) is generally prohibited. If you have questions on 
whether a certain type of work is restricted, or who is eligible for a certificate, or how to obtain a certificate, you may contact the 
local Wage-Hour office.</p>
<h4>Subminimum Wage Provisions</h4>
<p>The FLSA provides for the employment of certain individuals at wage rates below the statutory minimum. Such individuals 
include student-learners (vocational education students), as well as full-time students in retail or service establishments, 
agriculture, or institutions of higher education. Also included are individuals whose earning or productive capacity is impaired by 
a physical or mental disability, including those related to age or injury, for the work to be performed. Employment at less than the 
minimum wage is provided for in order to prevent curtailment of opportunities for employment. Such employment is permitted 
only under certificates issued by Wage-Hour.</p>
<h4>Training Wage Provisions</h4>
<p>Under certain conditions, employers may pay a training wage of at least 85% of the applicable minimum wage, or $3.35 an hour, 
whichever is greater, for up to 90 days, to employees under age 20, except for migrant or seasonal agricultural workers and 
H-2A nonimmigrant agricultural workers performing work of a temporary or seasonal nature.</p>
<p>An employee who has been paid at the training wage for 90 days may be employed at the training wage for 90 additional days 
by a different employer, if that employer provides on-the-job training in accordance with rules issued by the Department of 
Labor.</p>
<p>Employers are prohibited from displacing employees (or reducing their wages or benefits) in order to hire employees at the 
training wage. In addition, employers are prohibited from hiring employees at the training wage when other employees have been 
laid off in the previous six months from the positions to be filled at the training wage, or from substantially equivalent positions.</p>
<p>The number of hours of work paid at the training wage cannot exceed 25% of all the hours worked by employees of an 
establishment in any month.</p>
<p>The training wage provisions expire March 31, 1993.</p>
<h4>Exemptions</h4>
<p>Some employees are excluded from the overtime pay provisions or both the minimum wage and overtime pay provisions by 
specific exemptions.</p>
<p>Because exemptions are generally narrowly defined under FLSA, an employer should carefully check the exact terms and 
conditions for each. Detailed information is available from local Wage-Hour offices. Following are examples which are illustrative 
but do not spell out the conditions for each exemption.</p>
<h4>Exemptions from Both Minimum Wage and Overtime Pay</h4>
<p>(1) Executive, administrative, and professional employees (including teachers and academic administrative personnel in 
elementary and secondary schools), outside sales persons, and persons in certain computer-related occupations (as defined in 
Department of Labor regulations);</p>
<p>(2) Employees of certain seasonal amusement or recreational establishments, employees of certain small newspapers, 
switchboard operators of small telephone companies, seamen employed on foreign vessels, and employees engaged in fishing 
operations;</p>
<p>(3) Farm workers employed by anyone who used no more than 500 &quot;man-days&quot; of farm labor in any calendar quarter of the 
preceding calendar year;</p>
<p>(4) Casual babysitters and persons employed as companions to the elderly or infirm.</p>
<p>Exemptions from Overtime Pay Provisions Only</p>
<p>(1) Certain highly-paid commissioned employees of retail or service establishments; auto, truck, trailer, farm implement, boat, or 
aircraft salesworkers, or parts-clerks and mechanics servicing autos, trucks, or farm implements, and who are employed by 
nonmanufacturing establishments primarily engaged in selling these items to ultimate purchasers;</p>
<p>(2) Employees of railroads and air carriers, taxi drivers, certain employees of motor carriers, seamen on American vessels, and 
local delivery employees paid on approved trip rate plans;</p>
<p>(3) Announcers, news editors, and chief engineers of certain nonmetropolitan broadcasting stations;</p>
<p>(4) Domestic service workers residing in the employers' residences;</p>
<p>(5) Employees of motion picture theaters; and</p>
<p>(6) Farmworkers.</p>
<p>Partial Exemptions from Overtime Pay</p>
<p>(1) Partial overtime pay exemptions apply to employees engaged in certain operations on agricultural commodities and 
employees of certain bulk petroleum distributors.</p>
<p>(2) Hospitals and residential care establishments may adopt, by agreement with their employees, a 14-day work period in lieu of 
the usual 7-day workweek, if the employees are paid at least time and one-half their regular rates for hours worked over 8 in a 
day or 80 in a 14-day work period, whichever is the greater number of overtime hours.</p>
<p>(3) Employees who lack a high school diploma, or who have not attained the educational level of the 8th grade, can be required 
to spend up to 10 hours in a workweek engaged in remedial reading or training in other basic skills without receiving time and 
one-half overtime pay for these hours. However, the employees must receive their normal wages for hours spent in such training 
and the training must not be job specific.</p>
<h4>Child Labor Provisions</h4>
<p>The FLSA child labor provisions are designed to protect the educational opportunities of minors and prohibit their employment in 
jobs and under conditions detrimental to their health or well-being. The provisions include restrictions on hours of work for 
minors under 16 and lists of hazardous occupations orders for both farm and nonfarm jobs declared by the Secretary of Labor 
as being too dangerous for minors to perform. Further information on prohibited occupations is available from local Wage-Hour 
offices.</p>
<h4>Nonagricultural Jobs (Child Labor)</h4>
<p>Regulations governing youth employment in nonfarm jobs differ somewhat from those pertaining to agricultural employment. In 
nonfarm work, the permissible jobs and hours of work, by age, are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Youths 18 years or older may perform any job, whether hazardous or not, for unlimited hours;</p>
<p>(2) Youths 16 and 17 years old may perform any nonhazardous job, for unlimited hours; and</p>
<p>(3) Youths 14 and 15 years old may work outside school hours in various nonmanufacturing, nonmining, nonhazardous jobs 
under the following conditions: no more than 3 hours on a school day, 18 hours in a school week, 8 hours on a nonschool day, 
or 40 hours in a nonschool week. Also, work may not begin before 7 a.m., nor end after 7 p.m., except from June 1 through 
Labor Day, when evening hours are extended to 9 p.m. Under a special provision, youths 14 and 15 years old enrolled in an 
approved Work Experience and Career Exploration Program (WECEP) may be employed for up to 23 hours in school weeks 
and 3 hours on school days (including during school hours.)</p>
<p>Fourteen is the minimum age for most nonfarm work. However, at any age, youths may deliver newspapers; perform in radio, 
television, movie, or theatrical productions; work for parents in their solely-owned nonfarm business (except in manufacturing or 
on hazardous jobs); or, gather evergreens and make evergreen wreaths.</p>
<h4>Farm Jobs (Child Labor)</h4>
<p>In farm work, permissible jobs and hours of work, by age, are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Youths 16 years and older may perform any job, whether hazardous or not, for unlimited hours;</p>
<p>(2) Youths 14 and 15 years old may perform any nonhazardous farm job outside of school hours;</p>
<p>(3) Youths 12 and 13 years old may work outside of school hours in nonhazardous jobs, either with parent's written consent or 
on the same farm as the parents;</p>
<p>(4) Youths under 12 years old may perform jobs on farms owned or operated by parents or, with parents' written consent, 
outside of school hours in nonhazardous jobs on farms not covered by minimum wage requirements.</p>
<p>Minors of any age may be employed by their parents at any time in any occupation on a farm owned or operated by their 
parents.</p>
<h4>Recordkeeping</h4>
<p>The FLSA requires employers to keep records on wages, hours, and other items, as specified in Department of Labor 
recordkeeping regulations. Most of the information is of the kind generally maintained by employers in ordinary business practice 
and in compliance with other laws and regulations. The records do not have to be kept in any particular form and time clocks 
need not be used. With respect to an employee subject to both minimum wage and overtime pay provisions, the following 
records must be kept:</p>
<p>(1) personal information, including employee's name, home address, occupation, sex, and birth date (if under 19 years of age);</p>
<p>(2) hour and day when workweek begins;</p>
<p>(3) total hours worked each workday and each workweek;</p>
<p>(4) total daily or weekly straightctime earnings;</p>
<p>(5) regular hourly pay rate for any week when overtime is worked;</p>
<p>(6) total overtime pay for the workweek;</p>
<p>(7) deductions from or additions to wages;</p>
<p>(8) total wages paid each pay period; and</p>
<p>(9) date of payment and pay period covered.</p>
<p>Records required for exempt employees differ from those for nonexempt workers, and special information is required for 
homeworkers, for employees working under uncommon pay arrangements, for employees to whom lodging or other facilities are 
furnished, or for employees receiving remedial education.</p>
<h4>Terms Used in FLSA</h4>
<p>Workweek -- A workweek is a period of 168 hours during 7 consecutive 24-hour periods. It may begin on any day of the week 
and any hour of the day established by the employer. Generally, for purposes of minimum wage and overtime payment each 
workweek stands alone; there can be no averaging of 2 or more workweeks. Employee coverage, compliance with wage 
payment requirements, and the application of most exemptions are determined on a workweek basis.</p>
<p>Hours Worked -- Covered employees must be paid for all hours worked in a workweek. In general, &quot;hours worked&quot; includes all 
time an employee must be on duty, or on the employer's premises or at any other prescribed place of work. Also included is any 
additional time the employee is suffered or permitted to work.</p>
<h4>Computing Overtime Pay</h4>
<p>Overtime must be paid at a rate of at least one and one-half times the employee's regular rate of pay for each hour worked in a 
workweek in excess of the maximum allowable in a given type of employment. Generally, the regular rate includes all payments 
made by the employer to or on behalf of the employee (excluding certain statutory exceptions). The following examples are 
based on a maximum 40-hour workweek.</p>
<p>(1) Hourly rate -- (regular pay rate for an employee paid by the hour). If more than 40 hours are worked, at least one and 
one-half times the regular rate for each hour over 40 is due.</p>
<p>Example: An employee paid $4.80 an hour works 44 hours in a workweek. The employee is entitled to at least one and one-half 
times $4.80, or $7.20, for each hour over 40. Pay for the week would be $192 for the first 40 hours, plus $28.80 for the four 
hours of overtime--a total of $220.80</p>
<p>(2) Piece rate -- The regular rate of pay for an employee paid on a piecework basis is obtained by dividing the total weekly 
earnings by the total number of hours worked in the same week.</p>
<p>The employee is entitled to an additional one-half times this regular rate for each hour over 40, plus the full piecework earnings.</p>
<p>Example: An employee paid on a piecework basis works 45 hours in a week and earns $207. The regular rate of pay for that 
week is $207 divided by 45, or $4.60 an hour. In addition to the straightctime pay, the employee is entitled to $2.30 (half the 
regular rate) for each hour over 40.</p>
<p>Another way to compensate pieceworkers for overtime, if agreed to before the work is performed, is to pay one and one-half 
times the piece rate for each piece produced during the overtime hours.</p>
<p>The piece rate must be the one actually paid during nonovertime hours and must be enough to yield at least the minimum wage 
per hour.</p>
<p>(3) Salary -- the regular rate for an employee paid a salary for a regular or specified number of hours a week is obtained by 
dividing the salary by the number of hours for which the salary is intended to compensate.</p>
<p>If, under the employment agreement, a salary sufficient to meet the minimum wage requirement in every workweek is paid as 
straight time for whatever number of hours are worked in a workweek, the regular rate is obtained by dividing the salary by the 
number of hours worked each week. To illustrate, suppose an employee's hours of work vary each week and the agreement 
with the employer is that the employee will be paid $300 a week for whatever number of hours of work are required. Under this 
agreement, the regular rate will vary in overtime weeks. If the employee works 50 hours, the regular rate is $6 ($300 divided by 
50 hours). In addition to the salary, half the regular rate, or $3 is due for each of the 10 overtime hours, for a total of $330 for 
the week. If the employee works 60 hours, the regular rate will be $5 ($300 divided by 60). In that case, an additional $2.50 is 
due for each of the 20 overtime hours, for a total of $350 for the week.</p>
<p>In no case may the regular rate be less than the minimum wage required by FLSA.</p>
<p>If a salary is paid on other than a weekly basis, the weekly pay must be determined in order to compute the regular rate and 
overtime. If the salary is for a half month, it must be multiplied by 24 and the product divided by 52 weeks to get the weekly 
equivalent. A monthly salary should be multiplied by 12 and the product divided by 52.</p>
<h4>Enforcement</h4>
<p>Wage-Hour's enforcement of FLSA is carried out by investigators stationed across the U.S. As Wage-Hour's authorized 
representatives, they have the authority to conduct investigations and gather data on wages, hours, and other employment 
conditions or practices, in order to determine compliance with FLSA. Where violations are found, they also may recommend 
changes in employment practices, in order to bring an employer into compliance with FLSA.</p>
<p>It is a violation of FLSA to fire or in any other manner discriminate against an employee for filing a complaint or for participating 
in a legal proceeding under FLSA.</p>
<p>Willful violations may be prosecuted criminally and the violator fined up to $10,000. A second conviction may result in 
imprisonment.</p>
<p>Violators of the child labor provisions are subject to a civil money penalty of up to $10,000 for each employee who was the 
subject of a violation.</p>
<p>Employers who willfully or repeatedly violate the minimum wage or overtime pay requirements are subject to civil money 
penalties of up to $1,000 per violation.</p>
<p>The FLSA prohibits the shipment of goods in interstate commerce which were produced in violation of the minimum wage, 
overtime pay, child labor, or special minimum wage provisions.</p>
<h4>Recovery of Back Wages</h4>
<p>Listed below are methods which FLSA provides for recovering unpaid minimum and/or overtime wages.</p>
<p>(1) Wage-Hour may supervise payment of back wages.</p>
<p>(2) The Secretary of Labor may bring suit for back wages and an equal amount as liquidated damages.</p>
<p>(3) An employee may file a private suit for back pay and an equal amount as liquidated damages, plus attorney's fees and court 
costs.</p>
<p>(4) The Secretary of Labor may obtain an injunction to restrain any person from violating FLSA, including the unlawful 
withholding of proper minimum wage and overtime pay.</p>
<p>An employee may not bring suit if he or she has been paid back wages under the supervision of Wage-Hour or if the Secretary 
of Labor has already filed suit to recover the wages.</p>
<p>A 2-year statute of limitations applies to the recovery of back pay, except in the case of willful violation, in which case a 3-year 
statute applies.</p>
<h4>Other Labor Laws</h4>
<p>In addition to FLSA, Wage-Hour enforces and administers a number of other labor laws. Among these are:</p>
<p>(1) the Davis-Bacon and Related Acts (require payment of prevailing wage rates and fringe benefits on federallycfinanced or 
assisted construction);</p>
<p>(2) the Walsh-Healey Public Contracts Act (requires payment of minimum wage rates and overtime pay on contracts to provide 
goods to the Federal government);</p>
<p>(3) the Service Contract Act (requires payment of prevailing wage rates and fringe benefits on contracts to provide services to 
the Federal government);</p>
<p>(4) the Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act (sets overtime standards for service and construction contracts);</p>
<p>(5) the Immigration and Nationality Act (Wage-Hour is authorized to review the Immigration and Naturalization Service forms 
(I-9) required under the Act; employers must verify the employment eligibility of all individuals hired, and must keep I-9s on file 
for at least 3 years and for one year after an employee is terminated);</p>
<p>(6) the Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act (protects farm workers by imposing certain requirements on 
agricultural employers and associations; and by requiring the registration of crewleaders who must also provide the same worker 
protections);</p>
<p>(7) the H-2A provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act (provide for the enforcement of contractual obligations of job 
offers which have been certified to by employers of temporary alien nonimmigrant agricultural workers);</p>
<p>(8) the Wage Garnishment Law (limits amount of an individual's income that may be legally garnished and prohibits the firing of 
an employee whose pay is garnished for payment of a single debt);</p>
<p>(9) the Employee Polygraph Protection Act (prohibits most private employers from using any type of lie detector test either for 
pre-employment screening of job applicants or for testing current employees during the course of employment);</p>
<p>(10) the Immigration Nursing Relief Act of 1989 (provides for the enforcement of employment conditions attested to by 
employers of H-1A temporary alien nonimmigrant registered nurses);</p>
<p>(11) the Immigration Act of 1990 (provides for the enforcement of employment conditions attested to by employers seeking to 
employ alien crewmembers to perform specified longshore activity at U.S. ports);</p>
<p>(12) the H-1B provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act (govern enforcement of labor condition applications filed by 
employers wishing to employ aliens in specialty occupations and as fashion models of distinguished merit and ability, on H-1B 
visas); and (13) section 221 of the Immigration Act of 1990 (governs the filing and enforcement of attestations by employers 
seeking to use aliens admitted as students on F-1 visas in offccampus work).</p>
<p>More detailed information on FLSA and other laws administered by Wage-Hour is available from local Wage-Hour offices, 
which are listed in most telephone directories under U.S. Government, Department of Labor, Wage and Hour Division.</p>
<h4>Equal Pay Provisions</h4>
<p>The equal pay provisions of FLSA prohibit wage differentials based on sex, between men and women employed in the same 
establishment, on jobs that require equal skill, effort, and responsibility and which are performed under similar working 
conditions. These provisions, as well as other statutes prohibiting discrimination in employment, are enforced by the Equal 
Employment Opportunity Commission. More detailed information is available from its offices which are listed in most telephone 
directories under U.S. Government.</p>

<h3>Facts for Consumers from the Federal Trade Commission</h3>
<h2>Modeling Agency Scams -- January 1993</h2>
<p>****MODELS****</p>
<p>Earn $100 per hour or $500 per day as a fashion or commercial model. Full or part time. No experience necessary. Real people 
types, such as children, grandmothers, college students, and construction workers welcome. No fee.</p>
<p>If you have dreams of becoming a model, this ad may be tempting. But before you sign a contract, learn how to sort out the 
legitimate modeling agencies from the scams.</p>
<p>This brochure will give you tips on how to detect and avoid fraudulent modeling schemes and tell you where you can go for help 
if you become a victim of a scam.</p>
<h4>How the Scam Works</h4>
<p>The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) recently took action against two modeling agencies that placed ads in newspapers to 
encourage potential models, both men and women, to interview with the agency. Many of the ads stated &quot;No fee.&quot; However, the 
models who were &quot;selected&quot; by these agencies were asked to sign a contract agreeing to pay several hundred dollars for classes 
or photographs that the agency required before they could work as models. In the end, most of these would-be models received 
no job assistance from the agencies, no job leads, and no modeling employment. In numerous instances, the potential models did 
not even receive the photographs they had paid for. The companies simply packed up and left town.</p>
<h4>How To Spot the Scam</h4>
<p>It may not be easy to recognize a modeling scam because many of the advertising claims and practices may resemble those used 
by legitimate modeling agencies. However, listed below are some common advertising claims that should make you suspicious.</p>
<p>&quot;No fee.&quot; If a modeling agency advertises that there is no fee for its services, you should be wary any time you are asked to pay. 
Most legitimate agencies make money only by taking a commission from their models' work. An exception, however, is that you 
may be charged for your picture to be in an agency book that they send to clients who hire models. Make sure you pay only 
your portion of the printing costs. But before you pay any money, ask to see a copy of the agency's previous books and the list 
of clients to whom they were sent. Most legitimate agencies will provide you with this information. It is a good idea to check with 
some of the agency's clients to determine whether they have hired any of the company's models.</p>
<p>&quot;Earn high salaries.&quot; Only experienced, top models can expect to receive large salaries.</p>
<p>&quot;Work full or part time.&quot; The hours of a model are uneven and sporadic. You will not have the flexibility to choose your own 
hours.</p>
<p>&quot;Real people types should apply.&quot;Some ads encourage people of all shapes, sizes, and ages to apply for commercial modeling 
work that involves the sale of a product. Remember, modeling opportunities are limited even in large cities. Opportunities do 
exist for &quot;real people&quot; models, but they are rare. Because it may be difficult to recognize a modeling agency scam only from 
advertising claims, watch if agencies use any of the following tactics.</p>
<p>Charge you money to take their classes, before you are eligible for modeling work. A legitimate modeling agency may provide 
instruction on applying makeup or walking, but most do not charge you for classes. An exception to this is when a modeling 
agency also serves as a modeling school. A modeling school does charge for classes, but that is a separate function from finding 
you work as a model.</p>
<p>Conduct an unprofessional photo shoot. Once a modeling agency agrees to represent you, you will need photographs for your 
portfolio. In the larger modeling markets, such as New York or Los Angeles, the photographs typically are taken in separate 
photo sessions, each using different clothes, makeup, and hairstyles. And often a model's portfolio is put together with 
photographs from more than one photographer. In smaller markets, all photographs may be shot in one session by one 
photographer, but you should still look different in all your photographs by wearing a variety of cosmetics, clothes, and hairstyles. 
You may want to shop around for a photographer that best suits your portfolio needs.</p>
<p>Require a particular photographer. If the modeling agency requires you to work with a particular photographer, chances are the 
photographer is working with the modeling agency and they are splitting the fee. A legitimate modeling agency may recommend 
that you work with a certain photographer, but be skeptical if they are insistent.</p>
<h4>How to Protect Yourself</h4>
<p>The best protection against losing money to a phony modeling agency is to take precautions. The following list may help you 
reduce your chances of losing money.</p>
<p>Realistically assess your chances for being a model. Ask yourself: was I chosen by the agency because they believe I can make 
money for them -- or just because I can afford to pay money to them?</p>
<p>If you cannot verify the agency's credentials and the agency is asking for money in advance, you are better off saying no.</p>
<p>Check out all claims made in agency advertisements, sales presentations, and literature. For example, if they say they are the 
largest modeling agency in the country, contact other modeling agencies and ask if this is true.</p>
<p>Ask for the names, addresses, and phone numbers of models who work through the agency and clients who have used its 
models. Contact the models and clients to verify the information.</p>
<p>Ask if the agency is licensed or bonded as an employment agency, if that is required by your state. Your local consumer 
protection agency can answer this question or direct you to the proper agency to get an answer.</p>
<p>Keep copies of all important papers, such as your contract and agency literature. Be sure to get all verbal promises in writing. 
You may need these if you have a dispute with the agency.</p>
<p>Be suspicious of agencies that require models to pay fees, including fees for agency books, by cash or money order only. This is 
a strong signal that the agency is interested in taking your money not in representing you as a model.</p>
<h4>Where to Go For Help</h4>
<p>If you have paid money to a modeling agency, and believe they are involved in a scam, first contact the company and request a 
refund. If you are not satisfied, register a complaint with your local consumer protection agency, Better Business Bureau, and 
state Attorney General's office. Also, contact the advertising manager of the newspaper that ran the ad you answered. For ethical 
and practical reasons, the advertising manager may be interested to learn about any problems you have had with the agency.</p>
<p>You also should write to : Correspondence Branch, Federal Trade Commission, Washington, D.C. 20580. Although the FTC 
cannot represent you directly in a dispute with a company, if the Commission finds evidence of a pattern of deceptive or unfair 
practices, it can take action.</p>

<h3>Facts for Consumers from the Federal Trade Commission</h3>
<h2>Job Ads, Job Scams, and &quot;900&quot; Numbers -- September 1992</h2>
<p>I saw an ad in the newspaper for a construction job. The ad said to dial an &quot;800&quot; toll-free number for an application. When I 
called, I was told to dial a &quot;900&quot; number to find out about job openings in my area. When I called that number, a recording told 
me to send a stamped self-addressed envelope to have a job application mailed to me. All I got was a one page generic job 
application and a &quot;900&quot; number charge for $39.00 on my phone bill. ... paraphrased from a sample complaint letter to the FTC.</p>
<p>Beware of employment ads directing applicants to call &quot;900&quot; telephone numbers. You will be charged either a flat fee or a 
per-minute charge for each &quot;900&quot; call, and the charge usually is much greater than the toll for an ordinary long-distance call. The 
Federal Trade Commission (FTC) recently sued two companies advertising jobs in the U.S. using &quot;900&quot; numbers. These 
companies not only failed to disclose the cost of each call, which ranged between $10 and $18 per call, they also provided little, 
if any, information that would lead to a job. Some consumers had to call back several times to write down the recorded 
information and were billed for each call.</p>
<p>The FTC also sued two other firms that advertised they would find overseas jobs for upfront fees of as much as $600. One of 
the companies claimed it had information on more than 10,000 currently available overseas jobs and that its customers would be 
matched with at least three prospective employers. The FTC charged that few, if any, of the company's job seekers received 
even an interview, much less a job.</p>
<h4>How to Protect Yourself</h4>
<p>The FTC suggests the following precautions before you spend money to respond to job ads or sign job placement contracts.</p>
<p>Know what a &quot;900&quot; number call will cost before you make the call. Reputable employment-service companies will state these 
costs upfront. If you have problems with charges on your phone bill for &quot;900&quot; numbers because of calls made to a fraudulent 
business, contact your telephone company immediately. You can ask your phone company to delete the charges, although it is 
not legally obligated to do so. AT&amp;T cannot disconnect your phone for failure to pay. For policy information related to other 
carriers, call the carrier or the Federal Communications Commission.</p>
<p>Realize that employment-service firms can only promise to help you find a job; they cannot guarantee that they will find you a 
suitable one.</p>
<p>Check with your local consumer protection agency and the state Attorney General's Office to see if they have received any 
complaints about an employment company with whom you intend to sign a contract. Ask for a company's references and call 
them.</p>
<p>Most important, read your contract carefully before you sign it. If the employment-service representative makes claims that are 
not in the contract, remember the contract is what counts.</p>

<h3>Facts for Consumers from the Federal Trade Commission</h3>
<h2>Job-Hunting: Should You Pay? -- July 1992</h2>
<p>If you are looking for a job in the U.S. or overseas, you may come across ads that promise results placed by employment 
assistance businesses. Although many of these firms may be legitimate and helpful, others may misrepresent their services, 
promote fictitious and out-dated job offerings, or charge large upfront fees for services that often may not lead to a job. Some 
ads may direct you to call a '900' telephone number for job information. You will be charged either a flat fee or a per-minute 
charge for each '900' call, and the charge usually is much greater than the toll for an ordinary long-distance call. Other ads may 
ask you to visit the company's place of business for assistance in resume preparation, letter writing, and interviewing skills.</p>
<p>Before you contact any employment service firm, follow the suggestions at the end of this brochure for choosing a firm that is 
right for you. Also, before you pay or commit to pay for domestic or overseas job information or placement -- whether by calling 
a '900' number or by signing an employment services contract -- know what you will get for your money. This brochure explains 
how different types of employment firms operate and what questions you should ask when considering their services.</p>
<h4>Types of Employment Service Firms</h4>
<p>Do not judge an employment firm by its name. Classified advertising and telephone book listings do not always make clear the 
differences among employment services. Many names are used loosely and interchangeably, such as &quot;employment agency,&quot; 
&quot;personnel placement service,&quot; &quot;executive search firm,&quot; or &quot;executive counseling service.&quot; What is important to find out is what 
services the firm offers, how much those services cost, and who pays. If you, rather than an employer, are required to pay the 
fee, find out if you must pay even if the employment service does not find you a job.</p>
<p>This publication discusses six basic types of service companies/agencies that offer assistance in obtaining employment. They 
include: public employment services; employment agencies; executive search services; temporary help services; executive 
counseling services; and job listing services. Here are some descriptions to help you identify each type.</p>
<p>The federally-funded and state-operated public Employment Service, also known as the Job Service, operates in all fifty states, 
the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. There are some 2,300 points of service nationwide, of 
which approximately, 1,700 are considered full-time, full service offices. The Employment Service provides its services free of 
charge to both employers and job seekers. Openings range from entry level positions to technical and professional positions. The 
Employment Service provides access to the Interstate Job Bank -- a nationwide source of job opportunities. It also provides 
links to numerous employment and training programs in each state, including programs for the disabled, minorities, older 
workers, veterans, welfare recipients, and young people.</p>
<p>Employment agencies or personnel placement services work to fill specific positions available within companies. Their purpose is 
to bring applicants and employers together. In many cases, the placement fee is paid by the hiring company, but in some 
instances, where state law permits, the fee may be shared by you and your employer are billed to you, usually after a job is 
secured. Employment agencies are commonly licensed in the state in which they do business.</p>
<p>Executive search firms or executive recruiters are hired by businesses to find the &quot;right&quot; person for a particular job within a 
company. (These recruiters are sometimes referred to as &quot;headhunters.&quot;) The executive who is hired does not pay the fee; fee 
payment is part of the agreement between the hiring business and the search firm. Executive search firms usually subscribe to a 
code of ethics established by industry members, and some are licensed by the states in which they do business, as required by 
state law.</p>
<p>Temporary help services are companies who provide workers to businesses on a temporary basis. Businesses pay an agreed 
upon wage to the temporary service for work performed by its employees. Workers are then paid by the temporary service firm, 
not by the temporary employer.</p>
<p>Executive counseling services or career counseling services assist job seekers with career decisions more than job placement. 
They may provide such services as skill identification and self evaluation, resume preparation and letter writing, and general 
information about companies in a particular geographical area or job field. Fees can range up to $4,000, and payment is often 
required before services are provided. You probably will have to pay this fee even if you do not find a job. Placement is not 
guaranteed. Executive counseling firms may or may not be licensed, depending on state law.</p>
<p>Job listing services or advisory services sell information, sometimes through '900' telephone numbers, about obtaining 
employment in the U.S. or abroad. Information may include lists of job openings, general tips on conducting a successful job 
search or interview, and broad guidance in resume writing. Advisory firms often require an upfront fee, which usually is charged 
even if you do not find a job through the firm. Be aware that some listing services and advisory firms may place ads that appear 
to offer jobs when, in fact, the firms are selling only employment information.</p>
<h4>Choosing the Right Employment Service Firm</h4>
<p>Consider your needs carefully. What type of employment assistance do you want and what will it cost?</p>
<p>Know what a '900' number call to an employment listing service will cost before you make the call. Reputable companies will 
state these costs upfront. If you have fraudulent '900' number charges on your telephone bill, ask your phone company to delete 
them, although the company is not legally obligated to do so.</p>
<p>Ask any employment assistance company you contact who pays for its services, you or the employer, before you sign a contract.</p>
<p>When you are required to pay, ask the company if payment must be made before services are given and if you are required to 
pay even though you do not find a job.</p>
<p>Look for an employment service that regularly fills the sort of position you are seeking. If you are a writer, look for a firm that 
hires people with that skill. Classified ads in newspapers or trade magazines are a good source for finding specialized 
employment agencies as well as positions.</p>
<p>Realize that employment service firms only can promise to help you find a job; they cannot guarantee that they will find you a 
suitable one.</p>
<p>Check with your local consumer protection agency and the state Attorney General's Office to find if they have received any 
complaints about an employment company with whom you intend to sign a contract. You also can ask these agencies about any 
state laws concerning employment.</p>
<p>Most important, read the contract carefully before you sign it. If the sales representative makes claims that are not in the contract, 
remember the contract is what counts.</p>
<h4>Free Resources</h4>
<p>There are a number of free sources of employment information, in addition to the newspaper classified ad section.</p>
<p>Job Service offices post job vacancies. They also provide some counseling and referrals to other job resources.</p>
<p>Local and county human resources offices and information referral services offer some placement assistance. They can give you 
the names of other groups that can help, such as labor unions or federally-funded vocational programs.</p>
<p>University and college career service offices usually limit their assistance to students and alumni, but some may let you look at 
their job listings. They may be a good reference for free job information.</p>
<p>Local libraries also can be a good source of information. Ask the librarian to direct you to material that can help you write a 
resume, conduct an interview, or compile a list of companies whom you might contact about job openings.</p>
<h4>For More Information</h4>
<p>To learn more about employment service firms, write to your local Better Business Bureau. You also can send for the free FTC 
brochure '900' Numbers by writing to: Public Reference, Federal Trade Commission, Washington, D.C. 20580.</p>
<p>If you have a problem with a firm, contact your local consumer protection office, Better Business Bureau, the appropriate state 
licensing board, or your state Attorney General. Although the FTC cannot intervene in individual cases, the staff monitors job 
placement practices and would appreciate copies of your correspondence. Write to: &quot;Job Scams&quot;, Correspondence Branch, 
Federal Trade Commission, Washington, D.C. 20580.</p>

<h3>Facts for Consumers from the Federal Trade Commission</h3>
<h2>Truck-Driving Schools -- April 1993</h2>
<p>When you see recruitment ads for truck-driving schools, you should know that advertising claims made by some schools may not 
be true. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has brought charges against several truck-driving schools for false advertising. 
This fact sheet describes what deceptive practices the FTC has found, suggests questions to ask when talking to a sales agent or 
visiting a truck-driving school, mentions alternatives to private truck-driver training, and recommends precautions to take before 
applying.</p>
<h4>Common Deceptive Practices</h4>
<p>The FTC has investigated complaints and ordered some private truck-driving schools to correct the way they represent training 
and employment opportunities in their ads. For example: Some schools misrepresented the thoroughness of the job training. The 
FTC found that some courses did not provide enough hours of road instruction or driving experience to qualify students for a 
truck-driving job.</p>
<p>Some schools failed to tell students about cancellation and refund policies or failed to make refunds in keeping with their policies.</p>
<p>Many students who paid substantially for a course, sometimes more than $2,000, received no tuition refund when they dropped 
out of training.</p>
<p>Some schools misrepresented chances of future employment in the industry.</p>
<p>These schools misled students into believing there was a demand for their graduates as well-trained truck drivers -- that there 
would be jobs when they completed the course. But most schools provided only basic training and could not assure jobs, nor 
offer employment.</p>
<p>Some schools misrepresented their business connections with the industry.</p>
<p>They claimed to have special ties with trucking companies when, in fact, they did not.</p>
<h4>Questions to Ask School Representatives</h4>
<p>After answering an ad for a truck-driving school, you may be invited to see a school representative, a sales agent, or an 
instructor. Use the school's advertising claims as the basis for your questions and call others to verify the information. Below are 
six claims frequently made by truck-driving school representatives.</p>
<p>&quot;Fast training -- only four weeks.&quot;</p>
<p>Ask the school's representative how much on-the-road training you get in the course and if that amount of time meets state 
licensing requirements. Then call the state trucking authority where you want to be licensed and ask if the state has any basic 
requirements. Compare whether the course meets the licensing requirements of the state. Often the first half of the training course 
consists of a home-study program of reading materials and &quot;tests&quot; that cost hundreds of dollars. Only the last half of the course -- 
10 days to 2 weeks -- is the &quot;hands-on&quot; or &quot;resident training.&quot; That part of the course may be too short and inadequate to qualify 
a student for an entry-level job as a truck driver.</p>
<p>&quot;No previous driving experience necessary.&quot;</p>
<p>Ask the school's representative how many of their former students go directly from training school to truck-driving jobs. Then 
call local people in the trucking industry to find out their hiring requirements for newly-trained drivers. Many times, newcomers 
start out as dockworkers and freight loaders until a driver position opens up in a company.</p>
<p>&quot;Earn high wages.&quot;</p>
<p>Ask the school's representative about starting salaries for newly-trained truck drivers the school has helped place. You can verify 
these entry-level salaries by calling your state trucking association or a local trucking business.</p>
<p>&quot;Receive placement assistance.&quot;</p>
<p>Ask the school's representative how their job placement works. Ask where the school has placed drivers after training. 
Sometimes &quot;placement services&quot; amount to little more than providing you with clippings from newspaper &quot;Help Wanted&quot; ads.</p>
<p>''Financial Assistance Available.''</p>
<p>Ask the school's representative for a written list of all the fees and costs. If you need financial assistance, find out what costs will 
be covered by your loan and whether refunds are available if you cancel.</p>
<p>''Anyone Can Qualify.''</p>
<p>Ask the representative what qualifications are needed to become a truck driver. Requirements may vary according to the type of 
truck and the nature of the company's business. You may have to be at least 18 years of age and, under most state laws, have a 
chauffeur's license.</p>
<p>You can call your state motor vehicle department to find out what is required to get this license. You also can consult the 
Occupational Outlook Handbook, published by the U.S. Department of Labor, found in any library. The handbook provides 
current information about industry employment trends, training requirements, and qualifications necessary to enter any industry, 
including truck-driving.</p>
<h4>State-Supported Truck-Driver Training</h4>
<p>As an alternative to a relatively expensive truck-driving school, you may be able to attend truck-driving courses offered through 
tax-supported community colleges, technical institutes, or vocational schools in your state. These schools also can qualify you for 
job opportunities in the trucking industry.</p>
<p>To find the names of such schools, contact a state educational authority, a state trucking association, local trucking companies, or 
nationally recognized accrediting organization, such as the Career College Association (CCA). You can write to CCA at 750 
First Street, N.E., Washington, DC 20002, or call (202) 336-6700.</p>
<h4>Some Suggestions</h4>
<p>Before signing up for truck-driver training, ask several schools for written information about their programs. This will help you 
choose the best school for you and save both time and money in the long run. The following suggestions also might be helpful.</p>
<p>Talk to the management of local trucking firms about the school you are interested in attending. Find out if they hire graduates 
from that school.</p>
<p>Ask counselors at your high school, community college, vocational school, or technical institute if your state offers training for 
truck drivers.</p>
<p>Inquire whether a truck-driving school is accredited by your state's accrediting or licensing board before you apply. Each state is 
different, so call your state government's general information operator, who can direct you to the state agency with that 
information.</p>
<p>Check with the Professional Truck Driving Institute of America (PTDIA) to see if the truck-driving course meets the U.S. 
Department of Transportation's (DOT) voluntary standards. Not all truck-driving courses have volunteered to be evaluated by 
PTDIA. But if a course has undergone evaluation, PTDIA can tell you if it meets, exceeds, or does not meet DOT's standards. 
You can contact PTDIA at 8788 Elk Grove Boulevard, Suite 20, Elk Grove, California 95624, (916) 686-5146.</p>
<p>Read any school's application carefully before you sign it. Understand your rights and responsibilities under the contract. Make 
sure all promises are in writing.</p>
<p>Know the tuition costs and your cancellation and refund rights in case you do not finish the training.</p>
<p>Get a loan, if you need it for tuition, through a reliable source and understand the terms. Financial aid may be available to you 
through the U.S. Department of Education. This agency can provide you with information about Federal student financial-aid 
programs and help you complete a financial-aid application. Their toll-free number is (800) 433-3243.</p>
<p>Be wary of truck-driving schools that claim immediate employment upon graduation.</p>
<p>Contact your local or state consumer protection office and Better Business Bureau to learn if any complaints have been made 
against the school you are considering.</p>
<h4>To Report Problems</h4>
<p>If you enroll in a truck-driving course and a problem occurs that you cannot resolve with the school, send a letter describing your 
problem to your local or state consumer protection office. Send a copy of your letter to: Correspondence Branch, Federal Trade 
Commission, Washington, D.C. 20580. Although the FTC cannot represent you directly in a dispute with a company, it can act 
if there is evidence of a pattern of deceptive or unfair sales practices.</p>
<p>If you borrowed Federal funds to pay for truck-driver training, you can also call the Department of Education to report your 
problem. The toll-free number is: (800) MIS-USED, or in Washington, D.C., call 205-5770.</p>

<h3>Facts for Consumers from the Federal Trade Commission</h3>
<h2>Work-at-Home Schemes -- March 1993</h2>
<p>In newspapers and magazines around the country you may see ads like this:</p>
<p>Would you like to earn hundreds of dollars a week at home, in your leisure time? Many people are supplementing their income in 
a very easy way. Let us tell you how...</p>
<p>An offer like this may sound very attractive, particularly if you are unable to leave your home to work. But, be cautious about 
work-at-home ads, especially ones that promise you large profits in a short period of time. While some work-at-home plans are 
legitimate, many are not. Home employment schemes are among the oldest kinds of classified advertising fraud.</p>
<p>What many of these ads do not say is that you may have to work many hours without pay. There also may be hidden costs. 
Many work-at-home schemes require you to spend your own money to place ads in newspapers, make photocopies, or buy the 
envelopes, paper, stamps, and other supplies or equipment needed to do the job. The company also may demand that you pay a 
membership fee or make regular payments in order to get continued instructions or materials. Consumers deceived by these ads 
have lost thousands of dollars and have wasted their time and energy.</p>
<h4>Common Work-at-Home Schemes</h4>
<p>Work-at-home ads may advertise these types of employment:</p>
<p>Envelope-Stuffing. Work-at-home schemes come in many varieties, but the most common type is envelope-stuffing. Promoters 
of these programs usually advertise that, for a &quot;small&quot; fee, they will tell you how to earn money stuffing envelopes at home. Only 
when it is too late do you find out the promoter really has no employment to offer. What you are likely to receive for your fee is a 
letter telling you to place that same &quot;envelope-stuffing&quot; ad in newspapers or magazines, or to send the ad to friends and relatives. 
The only way you will earn money is from the people who respond to your work-at-home ad.</p>
<p>Assembly or Craft Work. Assembly or craft work is another common type of work-at-home scheme. These programs often 
require you to invest hundreds of dollars in equipment or supplies or many hours of time to produce goods for a company who 
has promised to buy them. For example, you might be required to buy from the company a sewing machine, a sign-making 
machine, or materials to make items such as aprons, baby shoes, or plastic signs. However, in fraudulent schemes, after you have 
purchased the supplies or equipment and performed the required tasks, the company does not pay you for your efforts. Many 
consumers, for example, have had companies refuse to pay for their work because it did not meet &quot;quality standards.&quot; 
Unfortunately, no work is ever &quot;up to standard.&quot; Thus you are left with relatively expensive equipment and supplies, and no 
income. In reality, those who produce goods in response to such ads must usually find their own customers.</p>
<h4>Precautions Against Fraudulent Schemes</h4>
<p>If a work-at-home program is legitimate, its sponsor should readily tell you -- in writing and for free -- what is involved. Here are 
some questions you might ask a potential employer:</p>
<p>What tasks will I be required to perform? (Ask the program sponsor to list every step of the job.)</p>
<p>Will I be paid on salary or commission?</p>
<p>Who will pay me?</p>
<p>When will I get my first paycheck?</p>
<p>What is the total cost of the work-at-home program, including supplies, equipment, and membership fees? What will I get for my 
money?</p>
<p>The answers to these questions may enable you to detect whether a work-at-home scheme is legitimate and to guard against the 
loss of your money and time.</p>
<p>You also might wish to investigate the company's reputation by checking with the consumer protection agency and the Better 
Business Bureau in the area where the company is located. These organizations can tell you if they have received any complaints 
about the work-at-home program that interests you.</p>
<h4>Where To Complain</h4>
<p>If you already have spent your money and time in a work-at-home program that you now have reason to believe may not be 
legitimate, contact the company and ask for your money back. Let the company know that you plan to notify officials about your 
experience. If you cannot resolve the dispute with the company, here are some organizations that may be able to assist you:</p>
<p>The Attorney General's office in your state or in the state where the company is located. That office will be able to advise you if 
you are protected by any state law that may regulate work-at-home programs.</p>
<p>Your local consumer protection offices.</p>
<p>Your local Better Business Bureau.</p>
<p>Your local Postmaster. The U.S. Postal Service investigates fraudulent mail practices.</p>
<p>The advertising manager of the publication that ran the ad you answered. The advertising manager may be interested to learn 
about the problems you have had with the company.</p>
<p>The Federal Trade Commission. While the FTC cannot help resolve individual disputes, the agency can take action if there is 
evidence of a pattern of deceptive or unfair practices. To register a complaint, write to: Correspondence Branch, Federal Trade 
Commission, Washington, D.C. 20580.</p>

<h3>Facts for Consumers from the Federal Trade Commission</h3>
<h2>Funerals: A Consumer Guide -- September 1991</h2>
<p>Each year, Americans arrange more than 2 million funerals for family and friends. Initially consumers may not be concerned about 
funeral expenses. Yet, at a potential cost of more than $3,000, consumers may want to be aware of regulations that help protect 
them.</p>
<p>The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) developed a trade regulation rule concerning funeral industry practices, which went into 
effect April 30, 1984. It is called the Funeral Rule; its purpose is to enable consumers to obtain information about funeral 
arrangements.</p>
<p>In general, the rule makes it easier for you to select only those goods and services you want or need and to pay for only those 
you select. Now, for example, you can find out the cost of individual items over the telephone. Also, when you inquire in person 
about funeral arrangements, the funeral home will give you a written price list of the goods and services available. When arranging 
a funeral, you can purchase individual items or buy an entire package of goods and services. If you want to purchase a casket, 
the funeral provider will supply a list that describes all the available selections and their prices. Thus, as described in greater detail 
in the following section, the FTC's Funeral Rule helps you obtain information about the cost and availability of individual funeral 
goods and services.</p>
<h4>Telephone Price Disclosures</h4>
<p>When you call a funeral provider and ask them about terms, conditions, or prices of funeral goods or services, the funeral 
provider will:</p>
<p>tell you that price information is available over the telephone.</p>
<p>give you prices and any other information from the price lists to reasonably answer your questions.</p>
<p>give you any other information about prices or offerings that is readily available and reasonably answers your questions.</p>
<p>By using the telephone, you can compare prices among funeral providers. Getting price information over the telephone may thus 
help you select a funeral home and the arrangements you want.</p>
<h4>General Price List</h4>
<p>If you inquire in person about funeral arrangements, the funeral provider will give you a general price list. This list, which you can 
keep, contains the cost of each individual funeral item and service offered. As with telephone inquiries, you can use this 
information to help select the funeral provider and funeral items you want, need, and are able to afford.</p>
<p>The price list also discloses important legal rights and requirements regarding funeral arrangements. It must include information 
about embalming, cash advance items (such as newspaper notices or flowers), caskets for cremation, and required purchases.</p>
<h4>Embalming Information</h4>
<p>The Funeral Rule requires funeral providers to give consumers information about embalming that may help you decide whether to 
purchase this service. Under the Rule, a funeral provider:</p>
<p>may not falsely state that embalming is required by law.</p>
<p>must disclose in writing that, except in certain special cases, embalming is not required by law.</p>
<p>may not charge a fee for unauthorized embalming unless it is required by state law.</p>
<p>will disclose in writing that you usually have the right to choose a disposition such as a direct cremation or immediate burial if you 
do not want embalming.</p>
<p>will disclose to you in writing that certain funeral arrangements, such as a funeral with a viewing, may make embalming a practical 
necessity and, thus, a required purchase.</p>
<h4>Cash Advance Sales</h4>
<p>The Funeral Rule requires funeral providers to disclose to you in writing if they charge a fee for buying cash advance items. Cash 
advance items are goods or services that are paid for by the funeral provider on your behalf. Some examples of cash advance 
items are flowers, obituary notices, pallbearers, and clergy honoraria. Some funeral providers charge you their cost for these 
items. Others add a service fee to their cost. The Funeral Rule requires the funeral provider to inform you when a service fee is 
added to the price of cash advance items, or if the provider gets a refund, discount, or rebate from the supplier of any cash 
advance item.</p>
<h4>Caskets for Cremation</h4>
<p>Some consumers may want to select direct cremation, which is cremation of the deceased without a viewing or other ceremony 
at which the body is present. If you choose a direct cremation, the funeral provider will offer you either an inexpensive alternative 
container or an unfinished wood box. An alternative container is a non-metal enclosure used to hold the deceased. These 
containers may be made of pressboard, cardboard, or canvas. Because any container you buy will be destroyed during the 
cremation, you may wish to use an alternative container or an unfinished wood box for a direct cremation. These could lower 
your funeral cost since they are less expensive than traditional burial caskets.</p>
<p>Under the Funeral Rule, funeral directors who offer direct cremations:</p>
<p>may not tell you that state or local law requires a casket for direct cremations.</p>
<p>must disclose in writing your right to buy an unfinished wood box (a type of casket) or an alternative container for a direct 
cremation.</p>
<p>must make an unfinished wood box or alternative container available for direct cremation.</p>
<h4>Required Purchases</h4>
<p>You do not have to purchase unwanted goods or services as a condition of obtaining those you do want unless you are required 
to do so by state law. Under the Funeral Rule:</p>
<p>you have the right to choose only the funeral goods and services you want, with some disclosed exceptions.</p>
<p>the funeral provider must disclose this right in writing on the general price list.</p>
<p>the funeral provider must disclose on your itemized statement of goods and services selected the specific state law that requires 
you to purchase any particular item.</p>
<h4>Statement of Funeral Goods and Services Selected</h4>
<p>The funeral provider will give you an itemized statement of the total cost of the funeral goods and services you select. This 
statement will also disclose any legal, cemetery, or crematory requirements that compel you to purchase any specific funeral 
goods or services.</p>
<p>The funeral provider must give you this statement after you select the funeral goods and services that you would like. The 
statement combines in one place the prices of the individual items you are considering for purchase, as well as the total price. 
Thus, you can decide whether to add or subtract items to get what you want. If the cost of cash advance items is not known at 
this time, the funeral provider must write down a &quot;good faith estimate&quot; of their cost. The Rule does not require any specific form 
for this information. Therefore, funeral providers may include this information in any document they give you at the end of your 
discussion about funeral arrangements.</p>
<h4>Preservative and Protective Claims</h4>
<p>Under the Funeral Rule, funeral providers are prohibited from telling you a particular funeral item or service can indefinitely 
preserve the body of the deceased in the grave. The information gathered during the FTC's investigation indicated these claims 
are not true. For example, funeral providers may not claim embalming or a particular type of casket will indefinitely preserve the 
deceased's body.</p>
<p>The Rule also prohibits funeral providers from making claims that funeral goods, such as caskets or vaults, will keep out water, 
dirt, and other gravesite substances when that is not true.</p>
<h4>Other Considerations</h4>
<p>Most decisions about purchasing funeral goods and services are made by people when they are grieving and under time 
constraints. Thinking ahead may help you make informed and thoughtful decisions about funeral arrangements. In this way, you 
can carefully choose the specific items you want and need and can compare prices offered by one or more funeral providers.</p>
<p>If you decide to make advance plans about funeral arrangements either for yourself or a loved one, you can choose among 
several types of dispositions and ceremonies. The type of disposition you choose may affect the cost. Some people prefer a 
ceremonial service, religious or secular, with the body present. Others choose an immediate burial and hold a memorial or other 
ceremony with no body present. Another service is cremation which may be performed either directly or after a ceremony. In 
addition, the deceased body may be donated (either directly or after a ceremony) to a medical or educational institution. To help 
ensure that your wishes are carried out, you may want to write down your preferences. It may also be helpful to tell relatives and 
other responsible persons what you have decided.</p>
<h4>For More Information</h4>
<p>Most states have a licensing board that regulates the funeral industry. You may contact the licensing board in your state for 
information or help. You may also contact the Conference of Funeral Service Examining Boards, 15 Northeast 3rd Street, P.O. 
Box 497, Washington, Indiana 47501, (812) 254-7887. The Conference, which represents licensing boards in 47 states,

<h3>Facts for Consumers from the Federal Trade Commission</h3>
<h2>Caskets and Burial Vaults -- August 1992</h2>
<p>When a loved one dies, difficult and sometimes costly decisions about a funeral have to be made quickly, often under great 
emotional stress. Your emotional state may dictate decisions not in your best interest. You may want to consult with a 
disinterested person, perhaps a clergyman or an experienced friend, if you feel unable to objectively evaluate a funeral provider's 
products and services.</p>
<p>For example, sometimes manufacturers of caskets and burial vaults give to the funeral providers promotional materials that may 
appeal to the desire to protect the physical remains of the deceased. They may do this by making false or exaggerated claims 
about the durability of their products. They may make insupportable claims that their products are &quot;waterproof&quot; or impermeable 
to the elements. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has issued orders against some manufacturers, prohibiting them from 
making such false or deceptive durability claims.</p>
<p>This brochure discusses caskets and burial vaults, their use, and their protective claims. It also briefly discusses the option of 
funeral pre-planning, and lists organizations you may contact for further information.</p>
<h4>Caskets</h4>
<p>A casket, also called a coffin, is frequently the single most expensive funeral item you may have to buy if you are planning a 
traditional funeral. A casket is not required for a direct cremation or an immediate burial. With the latter, the body is generally 
buried without viewing or embalming and is generally placed in an alternative container made of unfinished wood, pressboard, 
cardboard, or canvas.</p>
<p>Caskets vary widely in style and price and typically are sold for their visual appeal. They generally are made of metal or wood, 
although some are constructed of fiberglass or plastic. Most metal caskets are made from rolled steel in different gauges -- the 
lower the gauge, the thicker the steel. Wooden caskets come in hardwood, softwood and plywood.</p>
<p>The terms &quot;gasketed,&quot; &quot;protective,&quot; and &quot;sealer&quot; are frequently used to describe a metal casket. These terms mean that the casket 
has a rubber gasket or other features that delay the penetration of water and prevent rust. Some metal caskets come with a 
warranty for longevity. Protective features in caskets add to their cost.</p>
<p>Unlike metal caskets, wooden caskets generally are not gasketed and do not carry a warranty for longevity. However, 
manufacturers of both wooden and metal caskets usually warrant workmanship and materials.</p>
<h4>Burial Vaults or Grave Liners</h4>
<p>Often, cemeteries require a burial vault or a grave liner to enclose the casket in a grave. The casket is placed into either a vault or 
a liner to prevent the ground from caving in as the casket deteriorates. A grave liner, also called a &quot;rough box,&quot; is made of 
reinforced concrete and lowered into the grave prior to burial. A burial vault is more substantial and expensive than a grave liner, 
is typically sold for its visual appeal, and is usually gasketed. Most vaults are constructed of steel-reinforced concrete and lined 
with other materials, including plastic. Like some caskets, the vault may be sold with a warranty of protective strength.</p>
<h4>Preservative and Protective Claims</h4>
<p>Under the FTC's Funeral Rule, funeral providers are prohibited from making claims that funeral goods, such as caskets or vaults, 
will keep out water, dirt, and other gravesite substances when that is not true. The Rule also prohibits funeral providers from 
telling you a particular funeral item or service can indefinitely preserve a body in the grave. Such claims are untrue.</p>
<h4>Pre-planning Funerals</h4>
<p>Decisions about purchasing funeral goods and services are often made when people are grieving and under time constraints. For 
this reason, some people choose to prearrange a funeral. If you are considering prearranging a funeral for yourself or for a loved 
one, ask funeral directors about the different types of dispositions and ceremonies available. At the same time, scrutinize claims 
made by the manufacturers of such products as caskets and burial vaults.</p>
<p>The FTC's Funeral Rule requires funeral directors to itemize prices and provide consumers with price lists, and price information 
over the phone, which are essential for comparing costs.</p>
<p>If you are considering pre-paying for funeral goods and services, there are a number of issues to consider and questions to ask 
before pre-paying for funeral arrangements.</p>
<p>Be sure you know what you are paying for. Are you buying only merchandise, such as a casket and vault, or are you purchasing 
funeral services as well?</p>
<p>What happens to money you have pre-paid? Some states have different requirements concerning the handling of funds paid for 
pre-arranged funeral services.</p>
<p>What happens to the interest income on money that is pre-paid and put into a trust account?</p>
<p>Are you protected if the firm with which you are doing business should go out of business?</p>
<p>Can you cancel the contract and get back any money you have pre-paid if you should change your mind about the pre-planned 
funeral?</p>
<p>What if you should move to a different area or death occurs away from home? Some pre-paid funeral plans can be transferred, 
but often there is an added cost in doing so.</p>
<p>In addition, it is important to keep copies of any documents that you sign or that are given to you at the time pre-arrangements 
are made. It also is especially important to inform family members about such plans and arrangements and the whereabouts of 
these documents.</p>
<h4>For More Information</h4>
<p>Most states have a licensing board that regulates the funeral industry. You may contact the licensing board in your state for 
information or help. You also may contact the Conference of Funeral Service Examining Boards, 15 Northeast 3rd Street, P.O. 
Box 497, Washington, Indiana 47501, (812) 254-7887. The Conference, which represents licensing boards in 47 states,

also may contact the Funeral Service Consumer Assistance Program (FSCAP). This is a program designed to assist consumers 
and funeral directors in resolving disagreements about funeral service contracts. FSCAP is a service of the National Research

grief, and funeral service. You may contact FSCAP at 2250 E. Devon Avenue, Suite 250, Des Plaines, Illinois 60018, 
1-800-662-7666.</p>

organization dedicated to helping older Americans achieve lives of independence, dignity and purpose. AARP publishes Funeral

<h3>FEDERAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY FIA-2/March 1992</h3>
<h2>Answers to Questions About The National Flood Insurance Project</h2>
<p>This pamphlet is intended to acquaint the public with the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). Despite the highly technical 
nature of the Program, there has been a deliberate effort to minimize the use of technical terms, This publication is designed for 
readers who do not need a detailed history or refined technical or legal explanations, but do need a basic understanding of the 
program and the answers to some frequently asked questions. Readers who need legal definitions should refer to the Standard 
Flood Insurance Policy and to Federal regulations.</p>
<p>The information provided is as current as possible, but changes in the NFIP are made periodically. Readers can obtain the most 
up-to-date insurance information by using the telephone and address directory at the back of the pamphlet. Use of acronyms and 
initials has been limited, but some terms are used so often that acronyms and initials are practical and of assistance to the reader. 
The term will be spelled out at its first use in the text with the acronym or initials following in parentheses. For readers' 
convenience, following is a listing of acronyms and initials that appear in Answers to Questions About the National Flood 
Insurance Program:</p>

Introduction to the NFIP
</pre>
<h4>1. What is the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)?</h4>
<p>The NFIP is a federal program enabling property owners to purchase insurance protection against losses from flooding. This 
insurance is designed to provide an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the escalating costs of repairing damage to 
buildings and their contents caused by floods. Until recently, such coverage was generally unavailable from private-sector 
insurance companies.</p>
<p>Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local communities and the federal government which states that if a 
community will implement and enforce measures to reduce future flood risks to new construction in special flood hazard areas, 
the federal government will make flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection against flood losses 
which do occur.</p>
<h4>2. Why was the NFIP established by Congress?</h4>
<p>For decades, the national response to flood disasters was generally limited to constructing flood control works such as dams, 
levees, sea walls, and the like and providing disaster relief to flood victims. This approach did not reduce losses or discourage 
unwise development and, in some instances, may have actually encouraged additional development. To compound the problem, 
the public could not buy flood coverage from insurance companies, and building techniques to reduce flood damage were often 
overlooked.</p>
<p>In the face of mounting flood losses and escalating costs to the general taxpayers of disaster relief, Congress created the NFIP. 
The intent was to mitigate future damage and provide protection for property owners against potential losses through an 
insurance mechanism that allows a premium to be paid for the protection by those most in need of this protection.</p>
<h4>3. How was the NFIP established and who administers it?</h4>
<p>Congress established the NFIP with the passage of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968. The NFIP was broadened and 
modified with the passage of the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973 and other legislative measures. The NFIP is 
administered by the Federal Insurance Administration (FIA), a component of the Federal Emergency Management Agency 
(FEMA), an independent agency. </p>
<h4>4. What is a flood? </h4>
<p>&quot;Flood&quot; is defined in the Standard Flood Insurance Policy (SFIP), in part, as:</p>
<p>A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from overflow of inland or tidal 
waters or from the unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source.</p>
<h4>5. Do the state insurance regulators have any jurisdiction over the NFIP in their respective slates? </h4>
<p>As established by Congress, the NFIP is subject to the rules and regulations of the Federal Insurance Administration. FIA has 
elected to have state-licensed insurance companies' agents and brokers sell flood insurance to consumers. State regulators hold 
the insurance companies' agents and brokers accountable for providing NFIP customers with the same standards and level of 
service that the states require of them in selling their other lines of insurance.</p>
<p>Private insurance companies participating in the Write Your Own (WYO) program must be licensed and regulated by states to 
engage in the business of property insurance in those states in which they wish to sell flood insurance.</p>
<h4>6. What is the NFIP's &quot;Write Your Own&quot; (WYO) program?</h4>
<p>In 1981, a strong effort was begun by the Federal Insurance Administrator to reinvolve the private-sector insurance companies in 
the NFIP. Representatives of major insurance companies and insurance trade associations met with FIA officials to determine 
the best way to achieve this reinvolvement, and the company representatives outlined conditions under which the voluntary sector 
would become involved in the WYO program. FIA obtained the necessary clearances from other federal agencies to meet these 
conditions.</p>
<p>Over the next several months, FIA, working with insurance company executives, addressed and resolved the financial control 
issues that prevented the development of a WYO program in the past. The goals of the WYO program are:</p>
<p>* Increase the NFIP policy base and the geographic distribution of policies</p>
<p>* Improve service to NFIP policyholders through the infusion of insurance industry knowledge</p>
<p>* Provide the insurance industry with direct operating experience with flood insurance.</p>
<p>In August 1983, the Administrator extended an invitation to all licensed property and casualty insurance companies to participate 
in the WYO, and as of October 1988, over 200 insurance companies had signed arrangements with FIA to sell and service 
flood insurance under their own names.</p>
<h4>7. How does the NFIP benefit properly owners? Taxpayers? Communities?</h4>
<p>Through the NFIP, property owners in participating communities are able to insure against flood losses. By employing wise 
floodplain management, a participating community can protect its citizens against much of the devastating financial loss resulting 
from future flood disasters. More careful local management of development in the floodplains results in construction practices that 
can reduce flood loss and the high costs associated with flood disasters to all levels of government.</p>
<h4>8. What is the definition of a community?</h4>
<p>A &quot;community,&quot; as defined for NFIP's purposes, is any state, area, or political subdivision; any Indian tribe, authorized tribal 
organization, or Alaska native village, or authorized native organization which has the authority to adopt and enforce floodplain 
management ordinances for the area under its jurisdiction. In most cases, a community is an incorporated city, town, township, 
borough, or village or an unincorporated area of a county or parish. However, some states have statutory authorizes which vary 
from this description.</p>
<h4>9. Why is participation in the NFIP on a community basis rather than on an individual basis?</h4>
<p>The National Flood Insurance Act allows FIA to make flood insurance available only in those areas where the appropriate public 
body has adopted adequate floodplain management regulators for its flood-prone areas. Individual citizens cannot regulate 
building or establish construction priorities for communities. Without community oversight of building activities in the floodplain, 
the best efforts of some to reduce future flood losses could be undermined or nullified by the careless building of others. Unless 
the community as a whole is practicing adequate flood hazard mitigation, the potential for loss cannot be reduced sufficiently to 
affect disaster relief costs. Insurance rates also would reflect the probable higher losses that would result without local floodplain 
management enforcement activities.</p>
<h4>10. Is community participation mandatory?</h4>
<p>No. Community participation in the NFIP is voluntary (although some states require NFIP participation as part of their state 
floodplain management program). Each identified flood-prone community must assess its floodhazard and determine whether 
flood insurance and floodplain management would benefit the community's residents and economy. However, a community that 
chooses not to participate within one year after the flood hazard has been identified and a flood risk map has been provided is 
subject to the ramifications explained in the answer to Question #18.</p>
<p>Because a community's participation status can significantly affect current and future owners of property located in Special Flood 
Hazard Areas (SFHA)and the availability of federal financial assistance in the flood-prone areas of the community, the decision 
should be made with a full awareness of the consequence of each action.</p>
<h4>11. What is the emergency program?</h4>
<p>The emergency program is the initial phase of a community's participation in the NFIP and is designed to provide a limited 
amount of insurance at federally subsidized rates prior to the effective date of the community's initial Flood Insurance Rate Map 
(FIRM). A community participating in the emergency program is usually provided with a Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM) 
and is required to adopt limited measures aimed at controlling future use of its floodplains. Relatively few of the 18,000 
communities participating in the NFIP remain in the emergency program, and all of them will be converted to the regular program 
by the end of FY 1991. (For additional information on mapping, see Question #61.)</p>
<h4>12. What is the regular program?</h4>
<p>The regular program is the phase of a community's participation in the NFIP under which more comprehensive floodplain 
management requirements are imposed and higher amounts of insurance are available based on risk zones and elevations 
determined in the flood insurance study of the community. A FIRM is used in this phase of NFIP participation.</p>
<h4>13. What is probation?</h4>
<p>Probation is the formal notification by FEMA to a community that its floodplain management compliance program does not meet 
NFIP criteria. It is an action authorized under federal regulations.</p>
<h4>14. When can a community be placed on probation?</h4>
<p>A community can be placed on probation 90 days after FEMA provides written notice to community officials of specific 
deficiencies. Probation generally is imposed only after FEMA has consulted with the community and has not been able to resolve 
deficiencies. The FEMA Regional Director has the authority to place communities on probation.</p>
<h4>15. How long will probation last?</h4>
<p>Probation may be continued for up to one year after the community corrects all program deficiencies and remedies all violations 
to the maximum extent possible.</p>
<h4>16. What penalties are imposed when a community is placed on probation?</h4>
<p>An additional $25 charge is added to the premium for each flood insurance policy sold or renewed in the community. The 
additional charge is effective for at least one year after the community's probation period begins. The surcharge is intended to 
focus the attention of policyholders on the community's non-compliance to help avoid suspension of the community which has 
serious adverse impacts on those policyholders. Probation does not affect the availability of flood insurance.</p>
<h4>17. What is suspension?</h4>
<p>Suspension of a participating community (usually after a period of probation) occurs when the community fails to solve its 
compliance problems. The community is provided written notice of the impending suspension and granted 30 days in which to 
show cause why it should not be suspended. Suspension is imposed by the Federal Insurance Administrator. If suspended, the 
community becomes non-participating and flood insurance policies cannot be written or renewed. Policies in force at the time of 
suspension continue in force for the policy term. Three-year policies, which are written only by Write Your Own (WYO) 
companies, remain in force until the next annual anniversary date of the policy.</p>
<h4>18. What happens if a community does not participate in the NFIP?</h4>
<p>Flood insurance under the NFIP or WYO program is not available within that community. (See Question #27 on mandatory 
purchase requirements.) If a Presidentially declared disaster due to flooding occurs in a non-participating community, no federal 
financial assistance can be provided for the permanent repair or reconstruction of insurable buildings in Special Flood Hazard 
Areas (SFHAs). Eligible applicants may receive those forms of disaster assistance that are not related to permanent repair and 
reconstruction of buildings.</p>
<h4>Flood Insurance Information for Prospective Buyers</h4>
<h4>19. Who may purchase a flood insurance policy?</h4>
<p>NFIP coverage is available to all owners and occupants of insurable property (a building and/or its contents) in a community 
participating in the NFIP. Owners and renters may insure their personal property against flood loss. Builders of buildings in the 
course of construction, condominium associations, and owners of residential condominium units in participating communities all 
may purchase flood insurance.</p>
<p>Condominium associations may purchase a condominium master policy that covers both the common elements of the building 
and the individual units owned by the members of the association. Residential condominium unit owners may purchase building 
and contents (personal property) flood insurance to supplement any insurance purchased by the condominium owners' 
association. Owners of non-residential condominium units may purchase only contents coverage in their own name. The 
non-residential condominium building must be insured in the name of the association.</p>
<h4>20. How can I find out if I am eligible to purchase flood insurance?</h4>
<p>NFIP coverage is available only in participating communities. Almost all of the nation's communities with serious flooding 
potential have joined the NFIP. To learn if a community is participating in the NFIP, contact a property insurance agent or 
broker or community officials.</p>
<h4>21. How can a property owner determine if the property is in a Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA)?</h4>
<p>FEMA publishes maps indicating communities' flood hazard areas and the degree of risk in those areas. Flood insurance maps 
usually are on file in a local repository in the community such as the town hall or county building. A property owner may consult 
these maps to determine if the property is in a SFHA. A toll-free telephone number and mailing address for the Flood Map 
Distribution Center are listed in the Flood Insurance Address and Telephone Directory at the back of this publication (Page 33), 
and may be used to order maps. Delivery is usually within two to four weeks. There is a charge for maps for some users, so it is 
advisable to call for detailed information.</p>
<h4>22. What types of property may be insured against flood loss?</h4>
<p>Almost every type of walled and roofed building that is principally above ground and not entirely over water may be insured if it 
is in a participating community. In most cases, this includes manufactured (i.e., mobile) homes that are anchored to permanent 
foundations, but does not include travel trailers or converted buses or vans. Contents within insurable walled and roofed buildings 
also may be insured under separate coverage.</p>
<h4>23. What kinds of property are not insurable under the NFIP?</h4>
<p>Buildings over water or principally below ground, gas and liquid storage tanks, animals, birds, fish, aircraft, wharves, piers, 
bulkheads, growing crops, shrubbery, land, livestock, roads, machinery or equipment in the open, and motor vehicles are not 
insurable. Most contents and finishing materials located in a basement or in enclosures below the lowest elevated floor of an 
elevated Post-FIRM building are not covered. (See Question #41 for coverage limitations in basements and below lowest 
elevated floors.) Information on the insurability of any special property may be obtained by contacting a property insurance agent 
or a Write Your Own company agent.</p>
<h4>24. Are there certain buildings that cannot be covered?</h4>
<p>Flood insurance is not available for buildings which the Federal Insurance Administrator determines have been declared by a 
state or local zoning or other authorized authority to be in violation of state or local floodplain management regulations or 
ordinances. No new policies can be written to cover such buildings, nor can an existing policy be renewed.</p>
<p>Buildings constructed or substantially improved since October 1, 1983, and located in designated undeveloped coastal barrier 
portions or communities are not eligible for flood insurance. These areas are located in over 100 communities on the Atlantic and 
Gulf coasts and are delineated on the communities' flood maps.</p>
<h4>25. How is flood insurance purchased?</h4>
<p>After a community joins the NFIP, a policy may be purchased from any licensed property insurance agent or broker who is in 
good standing in the state in which the agent is licensed or through any agent representing a Write Your Own company (WYO) 
(see Question #6), including an employee of the company authorized to issue the coverage. The steps leading to the purchase of 
a flood insurance policy are:</p>
<p>* A property owner perceives a risk of flooding to an insurable building and elects to purchase flood insurance or a lender 
making a mortgage informs the builder or potential buyer that the building is in a Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA) and that 
flood insurance must be purchased as required by the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973. The builder or borrower contacts 
an insurance agent or broker or Write Your Own (WYO) company.</p>
<p>* The insurance agent completes the necessary forms for the builder or buyer. In the case of a building constructed in a SFHA 
after the issuance of a Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) (see Question #53), the builder or buyer must obtain an elevation 
certificate completed by a licensed engineer, architect, surveyor, or appropriate community official.</p>
<p>* The insurance agent submits the application, necessary elevation certification, and full premium to the NFIP or to a participating 
WYO company.</p>
<p>* The property owner may choose to purchase a flood insurance policy through a company that sells property insurance (e.g., 
homeowners) if that company is participating in the WYO program. In this case, the company's agent goes through the same 
process as an agent in obtaining coverage directly with the NFIP, except the property owner must submit the full premium to the 
company, not the NFIP. The policy is then serviced by the company under its customary business practices.</p>
<h4>26. How are flood insurance premiums calculated? </h4>
<p>A number of factors determine the premium rates for flood insurance coverage. They include the amount of coverage purchased, 
location, age of the building, building occupancy, the design of the building, and, for buildings in SFHAs, the elevation. The only 
buildings in Zones B, C, and X which are eligible for preferred risk coverage at a pre-determined, reduced premium rate are 
single-family and 1-4 family dwellings. For these exceptions, there are certain loss limitations depending on the amount of 
insurance purchased.</p>
<h4>27. Is the purchase of flood insurance mandatory?</h4>
<p>The Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973 as amended mandates the purchase of flood insurance as a condition of receipt of 
federal or federally related financial assistance for acquisition and/or construction of buildings in SFHAs of any community. The 
purchase of flood insurance on a voluntary basis is frequently prudent even outside of SFHAs.</p>
<p>The Act prohibits federal agencies, such as FHA, VA and SBA, from making or guaranteeing a loan secured by a building in a 
SFHA unless flood insurance has been purchased. The prohibition applies in all communities which FEMA has identified as 
having SFHAs, including those communities that are not participating in the NFIP. Flood insurance cannot be purchased for 
buildings in non-participating communities.</p>
<p>The prohibition of the Act applies to federal regulatory instrumentalities, such as Office of Comptroller of the Currency, Federal 
Deposit Insurance Corporation, Federal Savings and Loan Institution, and Federal Home Loan Bank Board Lending institutions 
regulated, or whose deposits are insured, by a Federal instrumentality, must require the purchase of flood insurance according to 
the regulations of the federal instrumentality.</p>
<p>The purchase of flood insurance does not apply for conventional loans from federally regulated lenders when the community in 
which the building is located is not participating in the NFIP. In these cases, the lending institution is required to notify the 
borrower that, in the event of a flood-related Presidentially declared disaster, Federal disaster assistance will not be available for 
the permanent repair or restoration of the building. Federally regulated or insured lending institutions are required in all cases to 
notify the borrower when the building being used to secure a loan is in a SFHA.</p>
<p>The amount of flood insurance required by a lending institution cannot exceed the amount of coverage which the Congress has 
made available and should not exceed the insurable value of the building, whichever is less. A lending institution is not required by 
statute to make the borrower purchase flood insurance for more than the amount of the loan or for more than twice the amount 
of insurance available under the Emergency Program ($35,000 times 2 = $70,000), whichever is less. A lending institution may, 
however, as part of its lending policy, require the borrower to purchase flood insurance in a greater amount than required by 
statute, and for buildings outside SFHAs.</p>
<h4>28. Why is there a requirement to purchase flood insurance in communities which have not suffered flooding in many 
years or ever?</h4>
<p>A major purpose of the NFIP is to alert communities to the danger of flooding and to assist them in reducing potential property 
losses before a flood occurs, not when it is too late. Therefore, FEMA determines flood risk through the use of all available 
information for each community. Historical flood data are only one element used in determining flood risk. More critical 
conclusions can be made by evaluating the community's rainfall and river-flow data, topography, wind velocity, tidal surge, flood 
control measures, development (existing and planned), community maps, and other data.</p>
<h4>29. How many buildings or locations (and their contents) may be insured on each policy?</h4>
<p>Normally, only one building and its contents can be insured on each policy. The Dwelling Form of the Standard Flood Insurance 
Policy does provide coverage for up to 10 percent of policy amount for appurtenant garages and carports, but not for tool and 
storage sheds and the like. In addition, up to buildings and/or their contents may be insured on one policy on a scheduled building 
basis, if the application to schedule buildings under one policy is presented on a form or in a format approved by the Federal 
Insurance Administrator.</p>
<h4>30. What is the flood insurance policy term?</h4>
<p>Flood insurance coverage written directly with the NFIP is available only on a one-year, prepaid basis. Write Your Own 
companies may offer three-year policies at their discretion.</p>
<h4>31. Is them a minimum premium for a flood insurance policy?</h4>
<p>There is a minimum premium for all flood insurance policies. Property insurance agents who write flood insurance coverage 
should know the current minimum premium.</p>
<h4>32. Is there a waiting period for flood insurance to become effective?</h4>
<p>There is normally a five-day waiting period. During the 30-day period following a community's initial entry into the emergency 
program or following the community's conversion to the regular program, the effective date and time of any new or added 
amount of flood insurance coverage is 12:01 a.m. of the day following the application date and the presentment of payment of 
premium. When title to a property is conveyed, any new or added flood insurance coverage on the property is effective when the 
title is transferred.</p>
<h4>33. What is &quot;presentment of payment?&quot;</h4>
<p>&quot;Presentment of payment&quot; is the receipt of premium and is considered to be the time that payment is actually received by the 
NFIP. Delivery to an insurance agent or broker or mailing a premium by ordinary mail with placement of a postmark does not 
constitute presentment to the NFIP.</p>
<p>A premium mailed in a timely manner by certified mail and received by the NFIP is considered to have been delivered to and 
received by the NFIP as of the date of the certification by the post office. If time is shod and coverage is needed, the certified 
mail transmittal of payment should be considered.</p>
<h4>34. Is there any difference in the wailing period and presentment of payment for policies written with a Write Your 
Own (WYO) company?</h4>
<p>The waiting period for policies written with WYO companies is the same as detailed in Question #32. The presentment of 
payment is determined from the time the agent or authorized employee of the WYO company received the application and 
premium, or from the time the application and premium are received in a central office or processing facility. Property owners 
should check with individual WYO company agents for details about specific companies.</p>
<h4>35. Is there a special rating procedure applicable to V zones (coastal high hazard areas)?</h4>
<p>In calculating the applicable rates for buildings which were constructed or substantially improved in V zones after October 1, 
1981, the actuarial formula takes into account the ability of the building to withstand the impact of wave action. The agent must 
follow the special instructions in the Flood Insurance Manual in preparing an application for coverage for buildings located in any 
V zone. (See Question #63 for a further explanation of V zones.)</p>
<h4>36. Can flood insurance be cancelled at the request of the insured with a refund of premium? </h4>
<p>Yes, but only in certain circumstances, since all of the premium is fully earned on the first day of the policy term. Premium will be 
refunded on a pro-rata basis when the policyholder no longer owns or has an insurable interest in the insured property, provided 
that no claim has been paid or is pending. There are other limited cancellation provisions for the refunding of premium. 
Policyholders wishing to cancel a policy should contact the insurance agent who wrote the policy to discuss cancellation criteria. 
Additional information on cancellations may be obtained by calling the appropriate toll-free number shown in the &quot;Flood 
Insurance Address and Telephone Directory&quot; section. </p>
<h4>37. Is there a &quot;grace period&quot; for an insured under the NFIP policy conditions? </h4>
<p>All policies expire at 12:01 a.m. on the last day of the effective term. (For the ease and convenience of insurance agents and 
brokers, lenders, and policyholders, NFIP rules allow for &quot;renewal&quot; of expiring policies and no new application is required.) 
Coverage remains in force for 30 days after the expiration of the policy, and claims for losses that occur in that period will be 
honored providing that full renewal premium is received by the end of the 30-day period. A coverage &quot;grace period&quot; also 
remains in force for 30 days after written notice to the mortgagee of the expiration of a policy for any mortgagee named in the 
policy. </p>
<h4>Coverage </h4>
<h4>38. How much flood insurance coverage is available?</h4>

     and Guam.
</pre>
<h4>39. Are there limitations on the amount of insurance available for certain types of properly?</h4>
<p>General coverage limitations are explained in the answer to Question #38 above. In addition, items such as paintings, etchings, 
pictures, tapestries, other works of art, jewelry, articles of gold, silver or platinum, and furs are limited to $250 coverage in the 
aggregate. This limitation does not apply to other items that are personal property or household contents usual or incidental to the 
occupancy of the building as a residence. For other limitations under the Standard Flood Insurance Policy, see the current policy 
or contact a property insurance agent or broker.</p>
<h4>40. What flood losses are covered? </h4>
<p>The Standard Flood Insurance Policy (SFIP) contains a complete definition of the coverage it provides. Direct physical losses by 
&quot;flood&quot; are covered. Also covered are losses resulting from flood-related erosion caused by waves or currents of water activity 
exceeding anticipated cyclical levels and accompanied by a severe storm, flash flood, abnormal tidal surge, or the like, which 
result in flooding, as defined. Damages caused by mudslides (i.e., mudflows), as specifically defined in the policy, are covered.</p>
<p>In certain cases, NFIP will pay claims on insured buildings that are subject to imminent collapse or subsidence as a result of 
erosion so the building can be demolished or relocated before the damage occurs. Specific requirements must be met for such 
claims to be paid, and the amounts of payment are defined by statute.</p>
<h4>41. What coverage is available in basements and enclosed areas beneath the lowest elevated floor? </h4>
<p>Coverage is provided for foundation elements, including posts, pilings, piers, or other support systems for elevated buildings. 
Coverage also is available for basement and enclosure utility connections, mechanical equipment necessary for the habitability of 
the building, such as furnaces, hot water heaters, clothes washers and dryers, food freezers, air conditioners, heat pumps, 
electrical junctions and circuit breaker boxes. Finished structural elements such as paneling and linoleum and contents items such 
as rugs and furniture are not covered. The SFIP has a complete list of covered elements and equipment.</p>
<h4>42. What is a basement?</h4>
<p>The NFIP's definition of &quot;basement&quot; includes any part of a building where all sides of the floor are located below ground level. 
Even though a room may have windows and constitute living quarters, it is still considered to be a basement if the floor is below 
ground level on all sides.</p>
<h4>43. Are losses from water seepage, sewer backup, or hydrostatic pressure covered?</h4>
<p>These losses are covered only when they occur in conjunction with a general condition of flooding in which the insured property 
has been, at the same time, physically damaged by surface floodwaters.</p>
<h4>44. Does the NFIP apply a deductible to losses?</h4>
<p>A minimum deductible is applied separately to a building and its contents, although both may be damaged in the same flood. 
Higher deductibles are available, and an insurance agent can detail the range of specific amounts of available deductibles. 
Optional higher deductibles reduce policy premiums but will have to be approved by the any lienholder.</p>
<h4>45. Are costs of preventive measures covered under the SFIP?</h4>
<p>Some are. When an insured building is in imminent danger of being flooded, the reasonable expenses incurred by the insured for 
removal of insured contents to a safe location and return and the purchase of sandbags, sand to fill them, plastic sheeting and 
lumber used in connection with them, the cost of pumps, fill for temporary levees, and wood will be reimbursed up to the amount 
of the minimum standard deductible ($500). No deductible is applied to this coverage.</p>
<h4>46. Does insurance under the SFIP provide coverage at replacement cost?</h4>
<p>Only for one type of building, and if several criteria are met. Replacement cost coverage is available for a single-family dwelling 
that is the policyholder's principal residence and is insured for at least 80 percent of the building's replacement cost at the time of 
the loss up to the maximum amount of insurance available at the inception of the policy term (see #38 and #39 for coverage 
limitations). Replacement cost coverage does not apply to manufactured (i.e. mobile) homes smaller than certain dimensions 
specified in the policy or to condominium units not contiguous to the ground.</p>
<p>Contents losses are always adjusted on an actual cash value basis. If the replacement cost conditions are not met, the building 
loss also is adjusted on an actual cash value basis.</p>
<h4>Filing a Flood Insurance Claim</h4>
<h4>47. How does a policyholder file a claim for flood loss?</h4>
<p>A flood insurance policyholder should immediately report any flood loss to the insurance agent who wrote the policy. A claims 
adjuster will be assigned the loss, and the policyholder must file a &quot;proof of loss&quot; within 60 days of the date of loss. A 
policyholder whose policy is with a Write Your Own (WYO) company must follow the company's claim procedures. The 
60-day time limit for filing a proof of loss remains the same. When the anticipated number of claims exceeds a predetermined 
number after widespread flooding, an Integrated Flood Insurance Claims Office is established at the site to assist insurance 
agents and adjusters in providing prompt service to policyholders.</p>
<h4>48. What is a &quot;proof of loss?&quot;</h4>
<p>A proof of loss -- the policyholder's valuation of claimed damages -- is a sworn statement made by the policyholder that 
substantiates the insurance claim and is required to be submitted to the NFIP or WYO company within 60 days of the loss. A 
printed form usually is available from the adjuster assigned to the claim.</p>
<h4>49. What is a &quot;loss in progress?&quot;</h4>
<p>A loss in progress occurs when actual flood damage to a building or its contents started before the inception of the policy.</p>
<h4>50. Is a loss in progress covered?</h4>
<p>The Standard Flood Insurance Policy does not cover damage caused by a loss in progress.</p>
<p>51. What is the maximum that can be collected for a loss under the NFIP policy?</p>
<p>An insured will never be paid more than the value of the covered loss, less deductible, up to the amounts of insurance purchased, 
so purchasing insurance to value is an important consideration. The amount of insurance a property owner needs should be 
discussed with an insurance agent or broker.</p>
<h4>The Community's Role in Floodplain Management</h4>
<h4>52. What is the role of the community in NFIP participation?</h4>
<p>When the community chooses to join the NFIP, it then must adopt and enforce minimum floodplain management standards for 
participation. FEMA works closely with states and local communities to identify flood hazard areas and flooding risks. The 
floodplain management requirements within the SFHA are designed to prevent new development from increasing the flood threat 
and to protect new and existing buildings from anticipated flood events.</p>
<p>When a community chooses to join the NFIP, it then must require permits for all development in the SFHA and ensure that 
construction materials and methods used will minimize future flood damage. Permit files must contain documentation to 
substantiate how buildings were actually constructed. In return, the federal government makes flood insurance available for 
almost every building and its contents within the community.</p>
<p>Communities must ensure that their adopted floodplain management regulations and enforcement procedures meet program 
requirements. Local regulations must be updated when additional data are provided by FEMA or when federal or state 
standards are revised.</p>
<h4>53. What is the difference between a FHBM and a FIRM?</h4>
<p>A FHBM is based on approximate data and identifies, in general, the SFHAs within a community. It is used in the emergency 
program of the NFIP for conversion to the regular program. If a detailed Flood Insurance Study has been performed, the FIRM 
will show base flood elevations and insurance risk zones in addition to floodplain boundaries. The FIRM may also show a 
delineation of the floodway. (See Question #64 for a description of &quot;floodway.&quot;) After the effective data of the FIRM, the 
community's floodplain management ordinances must be in compliance with appropriate regular program requirements. Actuarial 
rates, based on the risk zone designations shown on the FIRM, are then applied for newly constructed and substantially 
improved buildings.</p>
<h4>54. Do state governments assist in implementing the NFIP?</h4>
<p>At the request of the Federal Insurance Administrator, each governor has designated an agency of state or territorial government 
to coordinate that state's or territory's NFIP activities. These agencies often assist communities in developing and adopting 
necessary floodplain management measures. Some states require more stringent measures than those of the NFIP. A list of state 
coordinating agencies and their telephone numbers is provided starting on page 35 of this booklet.</p>
<h4>55. Do federal requirements take precedence over state requirements? </h4>
<p>The regulatory requirements set forth by FIA are the minimum measures acceptable for NFIP participation. More stringent 
requirements adopted by the local community or state would take precedence over the minimum regulatory requirements 
established for flood insurance availability.</p>
<h4>56. What is meant when FEMA uses the phrase, &quot;floodplain management measures&quot;?</h4>
<p>The phrase, &quot;floodplain management measures,&quot; refers to an overall community program of corrective and preventive measures 
for reducing future flood damage. These measures take a variety of forms and generally include zoning, subdivision, or building 
requirements, and special-purpose floodplain ordinances.</p>
<h4>57. Do the floodplain management measures required by the NFIP affect existing buildings?</h4>
<p>They affect existing buildings only when an existing building is substantially improved.</p>
<h4>58. What constitutes &quot;substantial improvement&quot; or &quot;substantial damage?&quot;</h4>
<p>&quot;Substantial improvement&quot; means any rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a building when the cost of the 
improvement equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the building before start of construction of the improvement. 
The term includes buildings which have incurred &quot;substantial damage,&quot; or damage of any origin sustained by a building when the 
cost of restoring the building to its pre-damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the building 
before the damage occurred. Substantial damage is determined regardless of the actual repair work performed.</p>
<p>Substantial improvement or damage does not, however, include any project for improvement of a building to correct existing 
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement 
official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions. Also excluded from the substantial improvement 
requirement are alterations to historic structures as defined by the NFIP.</p>
<h4>59. Do FEMA requirements apply to construction taking place outside the Specific Flood Hazard Areas (SFHA) 
within the community?</h4>
<p>No. The local floodplain management regulations required by the NFIP apply only in the SFHAs.</p>
<h4>60. Can modifications be made to the basic floodplain management requirements?</h4>
<p>In developing their floodplain management ordinances, participating communities must meet at least the minimum regulatory 
standards issued by FEMA. NFIP standards and policies are reviewed periodically and revised whenever appropriate.</p>
<h4>MAPPING</h4>
<h4>61. What is the role of the local community in its flood hazard assessment? </h4>
<p>Before the flood hazard assessment is initiated, FEMA considers all available existing information for use in the study. Public 
meetings may be conducted at which interested parties may present relevant facts to help ensure accurate results. FEMA also 
works closely with each community's officials before and during the study to describe the technical procedures and to obtain 
community input before publication of the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) and Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM). Before the FIS 
is initiated, community officials, FEMA representatives, and the study contractor meet to discuss the areas that need to be 
studied. This is called the time and cost estimate meeting. </p>
<h4>62. How are flood hazard areas and flood levels determined? </h4>
<p>Flood hazard areas are determined using statistical analyses of records of river flow, storm tides, and rainfall; information 
obtained through consultation with the community; floodplain topographic surveys; and hydrologic and hydraulic analysis. The 
detailed FIS covers those areas that are subject to flooding from rivers and streams, along coastal areas and lake shores, or in 
shallow flooding areas, but do not include areas of less than one square mile.</p>
<h4>63. What are flood hazard zones and what do they mean?</h4>
<p>The Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) shows areas within the 100-year flood boundary, which are termed &quot;Special Flood 
Hazard Areas (SFHAs).&quot; A &quot;100-year flood&quot; does not refer to a flood that occurs once every 100 years, but refers to a flood 
level with a 1 percent or greater chance of being equalled or exceeded in any given year. The SFHAs may be further subdivided 
into insurance risk rate zones (see below). Areas between the 100-year and 500-year flood boundaries are termed &quot;moderate 
flood hazard areas.&quot; The remaining areas are above the 500-year flood level and are termed &quot;minimal flood hazard areas.&quot;</p>
<p>Historically, about one-third of claims paid by the NFIP are for flood damage tin areas identified as having only &quot;moderate&quot; and 
&quot;minimal&quot; risk of flood. Flooding in these often is the result of inadequate local drainage 25 systems, and such flooding sources 
with small drainage areas are generally not identified on FIRMS. The SFHAs are subdivided into flood hazard zones (insurance 
risk rate zones) according to the following criteria:</p>
<p>Zone V: SFHAs along coasts subject to inundation by the 100-year flood with the additional hazards associated with storm 
waves. Because detailed hydraulic analyses have not been performed, no base flood elevations or depths are shown. Mandatory 
flood insurance purchase requirements apply.</p>
<p>Zones VE and V1-30: SFHAs along coasts subject to inundation by the 100-year flood with additional hazards due to velocity 
(wave action). Base flood elevations derived from detailed hydraulic analyses are shown within these zones. Mandatory flood 
insurance purchase requirements apply. (Zone VE is used on new and revised maps in place of Zones V1-30.)</p>
<p>Zone A: SFHAs subject to inundation by the 100-year flood. Because detailed hydraulic analyses have not been performed, no 
base flood elevation or depths are shown. Mandatory flood insurance purchase requirements apply.</p>
<p>Zones AE and A1-30: SFHAs subject to inundation by the 100-year flood determined in a Flood Insurance Study by detailed 
methods. Base flood elevations are shown within these zones. Mandatory flood insurance purchase requirements apply. (Zone 
AE is used on new and revised maps in place of Zones A1-30.)</p>
<p>Zone AH: SFHAs subject to inundation by 100-year shallow flooding (usually areas of ponding) where average depths are 
between one and three feet. Base flood elevations derived from detailed hydraulic analyses are shown in this zone. Mandatory 
flood insurance purchase requirements apply.</p>
<p>Zone AO: SFHAs subject to inundation by 100-year shallow flooding(usually sheet flow on sloping terrain) where average 
depths are between one and three feet. Average flood depths derived from detailed hydraulic analyses are shown within this 
zone. Mandatory flood insurance purchase requirements apply.</p>
<p>Zone A99: SFHAs subject to inundation by the 100-year flood which will be protected by a federal flood protection system 
when construction has reached specified statutory progress toward completion. No base flood elevations or depths are shown. 
Mandatory flood insurance purchase requirements apply.</p>
<p>Zones B, C, and X: These areas have been identified in the community flood insurance study as areas of moderate or minimal 
hazard from the principal source of flood in the area. However, buildings in these zones could be flooded by severe, 
concentrated rainfall coupled with inadequate local creates areas of high flood risk within these rate zones. Flood insurance is 
available in participating communities but is not required by regulation in these zones. (Zone X is used on new and revised maps 
in place of Zones B and C.)</p>
<p>Zone D: Unstudied areas where flood hazards are undetermined but flooding is possible. No mandatory flood insurance 
purchase requirements apply, but coverage is available in participating communities.</p>
<h4>64. What is a floodway and who designates it?</h4>
<p>The floodway includes the channel of a river and the adjacent floodplain that state standards specify smaller allowable increases. 
FEMA requires the community to designate a floodway to avoid the possibility of significantly additional rise in base flood 
elevations.</p>
<h4>65. If a FIRM is believed to be incorrect, what can be done to change it? </h4>
<p>Three procedures have been established for changing or correcting a flood map. They are: Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA), 
Letter of Map Revision (LOMR), and physical map revision.</p>
<h4>66. What is a LOMA?</h4>
<p>A LOMA is the result of an administrative procedure in which the Federal Insurance Administrator reviews scientific or technical 
data submitted by the owner or lessee of property who believes the property has incorrectly been included in a designated 
SFHA. A LOMA amends the currently effective FEMA map and establishes that a property is not located in a SFHA.</p>
<p>Although FEMA may issue a LOMA, it is the lending institution'$ prerogative to require flood insurance as a condition of its own 
beyond the provisions of the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973 before granting a loan or mortgage. Those seeking a LOMA 
should first confer with the affected lending institution to determine whether the institution will waive the requirement for flood 
insurance if a LOMA is issued. If so, the policyholder may cancel flood insurance coverage and obtain a premium refund.</p>
<h4>67. What comprises technical or scientific data?</h4>
<p>In general, the scientific or technical data needed to effect a map amendment include certified topographic data and/or hydrologic 
and hydraulic analyses to support the request for amendment or revision.</p>
<h4>68. What is a LOMR?</h4>
<p>A LOMR is an official revision to the currently effective FEMA map. It is used to change flood zones, floodplain and floodway 
delineations, flood elevations, and planimetric features. All requests for LOMRs must be made to FEMA through the chief 
executive officer of the community, since it is the community that must adopt any changes and revisions to the map. A LOMR is 
usually followed by a physical map revision.</p>
<h4>69. What is a conditional map revision? </h4>
<p>Communities, developers, and property owners often undertake improvement projects intended to reduce the flood hazard in 
their communities and usually want FEMA maps to recognize the effects of these projects. Similarly, property owners and 
developers who intend to place structures in the 100-year floodplain usually must demonstrate to lending institutions and local 
officials that these structures will be above base flood elevation.</p>
<p>Those who are planning such actions may submit design plans and other engineering data to FEMA and request that FEMA 
evaluate them. The response to such requests describe the changes that may eventually be made to the effective flood map and 
are called &quot;conditional letters of map revision.&quot;</p>
<p>FIA charges a fee to defray the costs associated with the evaluation of proposed projects. Information on these fees may be 
obtained from the appropriate FEMA Regional Office (see pp. 35-37).</p>
<h4>70. What is a physical map revision?</h4>
<p>A physical map revision is an official republication of a map to effect changes to flood insurance zones, floodplain delineations, 
flood elevations, floodways, and planimetric features. These changes typically occur as a flood insurance risk zones.</p>
<p>The community's chief executive officer can submit scientific and technical data to FEMA to support the request for a map 
revision. The data will be analyzed, and the map will be revised if warranted. The executive officer is afforded a review period. 
When base flood elevations are changed, a 90-day appeal period is provided, followed by a period for formal approval.</p>
<h4>71. Who should be contacted in FEMA to initiate a LOMA, LOMR, or physical map revision?</h4>
<p>Requests for multiple-lot or multiple-building determinations that do not involve changes to base flood elevations or floodways 
should be addressed to FIA's Office of Risk Assessment at the address given in the Flood Insurance Address and Telephone 
Directory (Page 33).</p>
<p>All other requests should be sent to the appropriate FEMA Regional Office (see pp. 35-37).</p>
<h4>72. How long does it take to obtain a LOMA, LOMR, or physical map revision?</h4>
<p>For single-building or single-lot determinations that do not involve changes to base flood elevations or floodways, a LOMA or 
LOMR generally can be issued within four weeks. LOMAs and LOMRs involving multiple lots or multiple buildings require up to 
eight weeks to process. Times are specified from the date of receipt of all technical, scientific, or legal documentation. LOMRs 
involving decreases in Base Flood Elevations (BFEs) or floodways take approximately 90 days for processing. If changes in 
flooding conditions are extensive or if BFEs increase, a physical map revision will be required, which may take 12 months or 
longer.</p>
<h4>73. If a LOMA or LOMR is granted and the lender waives the requirement for flood insurance, how can a flood 
insurance policy be cancelled? </h4>
<p>To effect a cancellation of a flood insurance policy, the policyholder must supply a copy of the LOMA or LOMR and a waiver 
for the flood insurance purchase requirement from the lending institution to the insurance agent or broker who services the policy. 
A completed a cancellation form with the LOMA or LOMR and the waiver must be submitted by the agent to the NFIP or the 
appropriate Write Your Own company. When a LOMA or LOMR is issued and cancellation requested, the policyholder may 
be eligible for a refund of the premium paid for the current policy year only if no claim is pending and no claim has been paid 
during the current policy year.</p>
<h4>74. Why is the burden of proof on the person requesting a map change?</h4>
<p>Government agencies and private engineering firms are contracted at considerable cost to perform analyses of flood risks and 
prepare flood maps for the community. The analysis and Flood Insurance Study findings are then reviewed by FEMA and 
community officials. FEMA has no justification for changing a study determination without sufficient evidence that a change is 
appropriate.</p>
<h4>75. How can the technical data that is the basis for the flood hazard information shown on the published FEMA maps 
be obtained?</h4>
<p>By writing to the address shown in the Flood Insurance Address and Telephone Directory (page 33) for the EDSP Repository 
and requesting the technical data. Requesters' letters should give the name of the community for which the data are sought, 
provide specific information as to the portion of the community and type of data needed, and should give the requester's name 
and telephone number. Before the request is serviced, the repository staff will call to discuss the request. If a charge will be 
necessary for the service, the extent of the service and the costs will be discussed during the call.</p>

<h2 align=center>Antitrust Enforcement and the Consumer</h2>
<p>Many consumers have never heard of antitrust laws, but when these laws are effectively and responsibly enforced, they can save 
consumers millions and even billions of dollars a year in illegal overcharges. Most states have antitrust laws, and so does the 
federal government. Essentially, these laws prohibit business practices that unreasonably deprive consumers of the benefits of 
competition, resulting in higher prices for inferior products and services.</p>
<p>This pamphlet was prepared to alert consumers to the existence and importance of antitrust laws and to explain what you can do 
for antitrust enforcement and for yourself.</p>
<p>Charles F. Rule<br>
Assistant Attorney General<br>
Antitrust Division</p>
<h4>1. What Do The Antitrust Laws Do For The Consumer?</h4>
<p>Antitrust laws protect competition. Free and open competition benefits consumers by ensuring lower prices and new and better 
products. In a freely competitive market, each competing business generally will try to attract consumers by cutting its prices and 
increasing the quality of its product or services. Competition and the profit opportunities it brings also stimulate businesses to find 
new, innovative and more efficient methods of production.</p>
<p>Consumers benefit from competition through lower prices, better products and services. Inefficient firms or companies that fail to 
understand or react to consumer needs may soon find themselves losing out in the competitive battle.</p>
<p>When competitors agree to fix prices, rig bids, or allocate customers, consumers lose the benefits of competition. The prices that 
result when competitors agree in these ways are artificially high; such prices do not accurately reflect cost and therefore distort 
the allocation of society's resources. The result is a loss not only to U.S. consumers and taxpayers, but also the U.S. economy.</p>
<p>When the competitive system is operating effectively, there is no need for government intrusion. The law recognizes that certain 
arrangements between firms--such as competitors cooperating to perform joint research and development projects --may benefit 
consumers by allowing the firms that have reached the agreement to compete more effectively against other firms. The 
government therefore does not prosecute all agreements between companies, but only those that threaten to raise prices to 
consumers or to deprive them of new and better products.</p>
<p>But when competing firms get together to fix prices, to limit output, to divide business between them, or to make other 
anticompetitive arrangements that provide no benefits to consumers, the government will act promptly to protect the interest of 
American consumers and taxpayers.</p>
<h4>2. What Are The Federal Antitrust Laws, And What Do They Prohibit? </h4>
<p>There are three major federal antitrust laws: The Sherman Antitrust Act, the Clayton Act and the Federal Trade Commission 
Act.</p>
<p>The Sherman Antitrust Act has stood since 1890 as the principal law expressing our national commitment to a free market 
economy in which competition free from private and governmental restraints leads to the best results for the consumers. 
Congress felt so strongly about this commitment that there was only one dissenting vote to the Act.</p>
<p>The Sherman Act outlaws all contracts, combinations, and conspiracies that unreasonably restrain interstate trade. This includes 
agreements among competitors to fix prices, rig bids and allocate consumers. The Sherman Act also makes it a crime to 
monopolize any part of interstate commerce. An unlawful monopoly exists when only one firm provides a product or service, and 
it has become the only supplier not because its product or service is superior to others, but by suppressing competition with 
anticompetitive conduct. The Act is not violated simply when one firm's vigorous competition and lower prices take sales from its 
less efficient competitors; rather, that is competition working properly.</p>
<p>Sherman Act violations are punished as criminal felonies. The Department of Justice alone is empowered to bring criminal 
prosecutions under the Sherman Act. Individual violators can be fined up to $350,000 and sentenced to up to 3 years in federal 
prison for each offense; corporations can be fined up to $10 million for each offense. Under some circumstances, the fines can 
go even higher.</p>
<p>The Clayton Act is a civil statute (it carries no criminal penalties) that was passed in 1914 and significantly amended in 1950. The 
Clayton Act prohibits mergers or acquisitions that are likely to lessen competition. Under the Act, the government challenges 
those mergers that a careful economic analysis shows are likely to increase prices to consumers. All persons considering a 
merger or acquisition above a certain size must notify both the Antitrust Division and the Federal Trade Commission. The Act 
also prohibits certain other business practices that under certain circumstances may harm competition.</p>
<p>The Federal Trade Commission Act prohibits unfair methods of competition in interstate commerce, but carries no criminal 
penalties. It also created the Federal Trade Commission to police violations of the Act.</p>
<p>The Department of Justice also often uses other laws to fight illegal activities, including laws that prohibit false statements to 
federal agencies, perjury, obstruction of justice, conspiracies to defraud the United States and mail and wire fraud. Each of these 
crimes carries its own fines and imprisonment terms which may be added to the fines and imprisonment terms for antitrust law 
violations.</p>
<h4>3. How Are Antitrust Laws Enforced?</h4>
<p>There are three main ways in which the federal antitrust laws are enforced: criminal and civil enforcement actions brought by the 
Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice, civil enforcement actions brought by the Federal Trade Commission and lawsuits 
brought by private parties asserting damage claims.</p>
<p>The Department of Justice uses a number of tools in investigating and prosecuting criminal antitrust violations. Department of 
Justice attorneys often work with agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) or other investigative agencies to obtain 
evidence. In some cases, the Department may use court&#169;authorized searches of business, consensual monitoring of phone calls 
and informants equipped with secret listening devices. The Department may grant immunity to individuals or corporations who 
provide timely information that is needed to prosecute antitrust violations, such as bid&#169;rigging or price fixing.</p>
<p>A provision in the Clayton Act also permits private parties injured by an antitrust violation to sue in federal court for three times 
their actual damages plus court costs and attorneys' fees. State attorneys general may bring civil suits under the Clayton Act on 
behalf of injured consumers in their states, and groups of consumers often bring suits on their own. Such follow&#169;on civil suits to 
criminal enforcement actions can be a very effective additional deterrent to criminal activity.</p>
<p>Most states also have antitrust laws closely parallelling the federal antitrust laws. The state laws generally apply to violations that 
occur wholly in one state. These state laws are enforced similarly to federal laws through the offices of state attorneys general.</p>
<h4>4. How Do Antitrust Violators Cheat The Consumer?</h4>
<p>The worst antitrust offenses are price-fixing and bid-rigging. Price-fixing occurs when two or more sellers agree that they will 
increase prices a certain amount, or that they won't sell below a certain price. Bid-rigging most commonly occurs when two or 
more firms agree not to bid against each other to supply products or services to local, state or federal government agencies, or 
when they agree on the level of their individual bids. Such price-fixing and bid-rigging agreements, unlike joint research 
agreements for example, provide no plausible offsetting benefits to consumers. Also, these agreements are generally secret, and 
the participants mislead and defraud customers by continuing to hold themselves out as competitors despite their agreement not 
to compete.</p>
<p>There can be no doubt that price-fixing and bid-rigging harms consumers and taxpayers by causing them to pay more for 
products and services and by depriving them of other byproducts of true competition. Nor is there usually any question in the 
minds of violators that their conduct is unlawful. It has been estimated that such practices can raise the price of a product or 
service by more than 10 percent, and that American consumers and taxpayers pour billions of dollars each year into the pockets 
of price-fixers and bid-riggers. People who take consumer and taxpayer money this way are thieves.</p>
<h4>5. What Kinds Of Cases Has The Justice Department Brought? </h4>
<p>Because of the harm that bid-rigging and price-fixing cause, the Justice Department's number one antitrust priority is criminal 
prosecution of those activities. The Department already has obtained price-fixing and bid-rigging convictions in the soft drink, 
motion picture, trash-hauling, road-building, electrical contracting and dozens of other industries involving tens of millions of 
dollars in commerce. And in recent years, grand juries throughout the country have been investigating possible violations with 
respect to retail gasoline, industrial laundries, school buses, concrete pipe, automobile engines, steel drums, industrial diamonds, 
treasury securities, steel woold, scouring padsand many more products and services. The Department also has recently been 
investigating and prosecuting bid-rigging in connection with Defense Department and other government procurement. In addition, 
the Department has initiated a program to use the antitrust laws against organized crime when it attempts to infiltrate legitimate 
business activities.</p>
<p>Consider one important example of successful antitrust enforcement-the Antitrust Division's criminal cases against milk and dairy 
products suppliers. The Division has uncovered evidence that dairy companies have been conspiring since at least the early 
1980's to rig bids to supply milk and other dairy products to public school districts and other public institutions in several states. 
The Florida Attorney General's Office first noticed suspicious-looking bid patterns by milk suppliers, and brought this information 
to the attention of the Antitrust Division's Atlanta field office in 1986. The Division began a grand jury investigation, which 
uncovered a state-wide conspiracy to rig bids to public school districts in Florida, and evidence of similar conspiracies in other 
states. Since May 3, 1988, the Division has filed 109 milk bid-rigging cases, involving 61 corporations and 68 individuals. 
Criminal fines totalling more than $53.7 million have been imposed on corporations and individuals, and 26 individuals have been 
sentenced to jail. The Division has reached civil damage settlements with defendants in excess of $8 million.</p>
<p>The scope of the Antitrust Division's investigation of bid rigging by dairy firms has expanded beyond public schools to include bid 
rigging to the military and other public institutions (such as jails), as well as possible bid rigging on wholesale prices, affecting all 
consumers. The Division's investigations of this industry are continuing, as 27 grand juries are currently pending.</p>
<h4>6. What Can You Do For Antitrust Enforcement And For Yourself?</h4>
<p>Because they are by their nature secret, price-fixing and bid-rigging conspiracies are difficult to detect and prove. For that reason 
law enforcement officials rely on complaints and information from consumers and competitors. A very large percentage of all 
federal antitrust investigations result from complaints received from consumers or businessmen by phone, mail or in person.</p>
<p>On the federal level, you can contact the Antitrust Division at its Washington office or any of its field offices, which were 
established in major metropolitan areas to encourage people with complaints to come forward. You can also reach the Antitrust 
Division through any of the offices of the United States Attorney, which are found in most cities throughout the United States. 
The Antitrust Division's home offices are in the Main Justice Building at Tenth Street and Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., in 
Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>The Federal Trade Commission also has a Washington office, as well as regional offices. The FTC is headquartered at Sixth 
Street and Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W. in Washington, D.C. FTC and Antitrust Division field office addresses and telephone 
numbers are listed at the end of this pamphlet.</p>
<p>On the state level, you can contact your state attorney general or your state representative.</p>
<h4>7. How Can You Know If The Antitrust Laws Are Being Violated? </h4>
<p>If any person knows or suspects that competitors, suppliers or even an employer are violating the antitrust laws, that person 
should alert the antitrust agencies so that they can determine whether to investigate. If you suspect your own company, remember 
that antitrust violations can be a federal felony; if you know about a violation and you say nothing, in certain circumstances you 
yourself could later be held criminally responsible and, in addition to losing your job and your reputation in your community, you 
could be subject to substantial fines and even imprisonment.</p>
<p>Price-fixing and bid-rigging conspiracies are most likely to occur where there are relatively few sellers that have to get together to 
agree. The larger the group of sellers, the more difficult it is to come to an agreement and enforce it.</p>
<p>Keep an eye out for tell-tale signs. For example:</p>
<p>-- generally, any evidence that two sellers of similar products have agreed to price their products a certain way, to sell only a 
certain amount of their product, or to sell only in certain areas or to certain customers;</p>
<p>-- large price changes involving more than one seller of very similar products of different brands, particularly if the price changes 
are of equal amount and occur at the same time;</p>
<p>-- a seller's statement that &quot;We can't sell to you; according to our agreement, so-and-so (the seller's competitor) is the only firm 
that can sell to you;&quot;</p>
<p>-- fewer competitors than normal submit bids on a project;</p>
<p>-- competitors submit identical bids;</p>
<p>-- the same company repeatedly has been the low bidder who has been awarded contracts for a certain service or in a particular 
area</p>
<p>-- bidders seem to win bids on a fixed rotation;</p>
<p>-- there is an unusual and unexplainable large dollar difference between the winning bid and all other bids;</p>
<p>-- the same bidder bids substantially higher on some bids than on others, and there is no logical cost reason to explain the 
difference.</p>
<p>These signs are by no means conclusive evidence of antitrust violations. More investigation by trained lawyers and economists 
would be required to determine that. But they may be indications, and the people who enforce the antitrust laws want to hear 
about them.</p>
<h4>8. What Is The Public's Role In Antitrust Enforcement?</h4>
<p>Effective antitrust enforcement requires public support. Public ignorance and apathy can weaken antitrust enforcement more than 
anything else. Whether you are a business person or a consumer, if you encounter business behavior that seems to violate the 
antitrust laws, do not hesitate to inform the enforcement agencies of your suspicions. That is often the only way violations can be 
uncovered, and failing to uncover and punish antitrust violations not only penalizes consumers and taxpayers but also penalizes 
the vast majority of honest businesspeople who scrupulously observe the antitrust laws. If you detect an antitrust violation, you 
can perform a triple public service: (1) you can help put an end to unlawful conduct that is costing consumers millions or even 
billions of dollars; (2) you can put money in the form of criminal penalties into the federal treasury; and (3) you can help recover 
other unlawful charges, because the government or affected consumers may bring an antitrust action to collect damages.</p>

<h3 align=center>U.S. DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE/Patent and Trademark Office</h3>
<p align=center>Revised November 1989 </p>
<h2 align=center>BASIC FACTS ABOUT TRADEMARKS</h2>
<p><strong>NOTICE: CHANGES IN THE LAW PERTAINING TO FEDERAL TRADEMARK REGISTRATION TAKE 
EFFECT ON NOVEMBER 16, 1989. THE INFORMATION CONTAINED HEREIN INCORPORATES THESE 
CHANGES.</strong> </p>
<h4>BASIC FACTS ABOUT TRADEMARKS</h4>
<p>A TRADEMARK may be a word, symbol, design or combination word and design, a slogan or even a distinctive sound which 
identifies and distinguishes the goods or services of one party from those of another. Used to identify a service, it can be called a 
service mark. In general, throughout this pamphlet the term trademark will refer to both trademarks and service marks. 
Normally, a trademark for goods appears on the product or on its packaging, while a service mark is usually used in advertising 
to identify the owner' s services.</p>
<p>A trademark is different from a copyright or a patent. A copyright gives protection for an artistic or literary work and a patent 
gives protection for an invention. </p>
<p>Unlike a copyright or patent, trademark rights can last indefinitely if the mark continues to perform a source -indicating function. 
The term of the Federal trademark registration is 10 years, with 10 year renewal terms. However, between the fifth and sixth 
year after the date of the registration, the registrant must file an affidavit stating the mark is currently in use in commerce. If no 
affidavit is filed, the registration will be cancelled. </p>
<p>Trademark fights arise from either (1) use of the mark, or (2) a bona fide intention to use a mark, along with the filing of an 
application to Federally register that mark on the Principal Register. A Federal trademark registration is not required in order for 
a trademark to be protected, and a trademark may be used without obtaining a registration. </p>
<p>Before a trademark owner may file an application for a Federal registration, the owner must either (1) use the mark on goods 
which are shipped or sold, or services which are rendered, in commerce regulated by Congress (e.g., interstate commerce or 
commerce between the U.S. and a foreign country), or (2) have a.bona fide intention to use the mark in such commerce in 
relation to specific goods or services. </p>
<h4>BENEFITS OF REGISTRATION</h4>
<p>WHILE Federal registration is not necessary for trademark certain advantages: </p>
<ol>
<li>The filing date of the application is a constructive date of first use of the mark in commerce (this gives registrant nationwide 
priority as of that date, except as to certain prior users or prior applicants); </li>
<li>The right to sue in Federal court for trademark infringement; </li>
<li>Recovery of profits, damages and costs in a Federal court infringement action and the possibility of treble damages and 
attorneys' fees; </li>
<li>Constructive notice of a claim of ownership (which eliminates a good faith defense for a party adopting the trademark 
subsequent to the registrant's date of registration); </li>
<li>The right to deposit the registration with Customs in order to stop the importation of goods bearing an infringing mark; </li>
<li>Prima facie evidence of the validity of the registration, registrant's ownership of the mark and of registrant's exclusive right 
to use the mark in commerce in connection with the goods or services specified in the certificate; </li>
<li>The possibility of incontestability, in which case the registration constitutes conclusive evidence of the registrant's exclusive 
right, with certain limited exceptions, to use the registered mark in commerce; </li>
<li>Limited grounds for attacking a registration once it is five years old; </li>
<li>Availability of criminal penalties and treble damages in an action for counterfeiting a registered trademark; </li>
<li>A basis for filing trademark applications in foreign countries.</li>
</ol>
<h4>NOTICE</h4>
<p>ONCE a Federal registration is issued, the registrant may give notice of registration by using the symbol, or the phrase 
&quot;Registered in U.S. Patent and Trademark Office&quot; or &quot;Reg. U.S. Pat. &amp; Tm. Off.&quot; Although registration symbols may not be 
lawfully used prior to registration, many trademark owners use a TM or SM (if the mark identifies a service) symbol to indicate a 
claim of ownership, even if no Federal trademark application is pending. </p>
<h4>THE REGISTRATION PROCESS</h4>
<p>THE Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) is responsible for the Federal registration of trademarks. When an application is filed, 
it is reviewed to determine if it meets the requirements for receiving a filing date (see page 4). If the filing requirements are riot 
met, the entire mailing, including the fee, is returned to the applicant. If the application meets the filing requirements, it is assigned 
a serial number, and the applicant is sent a filing receipt. </p>
<p>The first part of the registration process is a determination by the Trademark Examining Attorney as to whether the mark may be 
registered. An initial determination of registrability, listing any statutory grounds for refusal as well as any procedural informalities 
in the application, is issued about three months after filing. The applicant must respond to any objections raised within six months, 
or the application will be considered abandoned. If, after reviewing the applicant's response, the Examining Attorney makes a 
final refusal of registration, the applicant may appeal to the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board, an administrative tribunal within 
the PTO. </p>
<p>Once the Examining Attorney approves the mark, the mark will be published in the Trademark Official Gazette, a weekly 
publication of the PTO. Any other party then has 30 days to oppose the registration of the mark, or request an extension of time 
to oppose. An opposition is similar to a proceeding in the Federal district courts, but is held before the Trademark Trial and 
Appeal Board. If no opposition is filed, the application enters the next stage of the registration process. </p>
<p>If the mark published based upon its actual use in commerce, a registration will issue approximately 12 weeks from the date the 
mark was published. </p>
<p>If, instead, the mark published based upon applicant's statement of a bona fide intention to use the mark in commerce, a notice of 
allowance will issue approximately 12 weeks from the date the mark was published. The applicant then has six months from the 
date of the notice of allowance to either (1) use the mark in commerce and submit a statement of use, or (2) request a six -month 
extension of time to file a statement of use (see forms and instructions at back of booklet). The applicant may request additional 
extensions of time only as noted in the instructions on the back of the form. </p>
<h4>STATUTORY GROUNDS FOR REFUSAL</h4>
<p>THE Examining Attorney will refuse registration if the mark or term applied for: </p>
<ol>
<li>Does not function as a trademark to identify the goods or services as coming from a particular source;for example, the 
matter applied for is merely ornamentation; </li>
<li>Is immoral, deceptive or scandalous; </li>
<li>May disparage or falsely suggest a connection with persons, institutions, beliefs or national symbols, or bring them into 
contempt or disrepute; </li>
<li>Consists of or simulates the flag or coat of arms or other insignia of the United States, or a State or municipality, or any 
foreign nation; </li>
<li>Is the name, portrait or signature of a particular living individual, unless he has given written consent; or is the name, 
signature or portrait of a deceased President of the United States during the life of his widow, unless she has given her 
consent; </li>
<li>So resembles a mark already registered in the PTO as to be likely, when used on or in connection with the goods of the 
applicant, to cause confusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive; </li>
<li>Is merely descriptive or deceptively misdescriptive of the goods or services; </li>
<li>Is primarily geographically descriptive or deceptively misdescriptive of the goods or services of the applicant; </li>
<li>Is primarily merely a surname.</li>
</ol>
<p>A mark will not be refused registration on the grounds listed in numbers 7, 8 and 9 if the applicant can show that, through use of 
the mark in commerce, the mark has become distinctive so that it now identifies to the public the applicant's goods or services. 
Marks which are refused registration on the grounds listed in numbers 1, 7, 8 and 9 may be registrable on the Supplemental 
Register, which contains terms or designs considered capable of distinguishing the owner's goods or services, but that do not yet 
do so. A term or design cannot be considered for registration on the Supplemental Register unless it is in use in commerce in 
relation to all the goods or services identified in the application, and an acceptable allegation of use has been submitted. If a mark 
is registered on the Supplemental Register, the registrant may bring suit for trademark infringement in the Federal courts, or may 
use the registration as a basis for filing in some foreign countries. None of the other benefits of Federal registration listed on page 
1 apply. An applicant may file an application on the Principal Register and, if appropriate, amend the application to the 
Supplemental Register for no additional fee. </p>
<h4>TRADEMARK SEARCH LIBRARY</h4>
<p>A RECORD of all active registrations and pending applications is maintained by the PTO to help determine whether a previously 
registered mark exists which could prevent the registration of an applicant's mark. (See ground for refusal No. 6, above.) The 
search library is located near Washington, D.C. at Crystal Plaza 2, 2nd Floor, 2011 Jefferson Davis Highway, Arlington, VA 
22022, and is open to the public free of charge Monday through Friday, 8:00 am to 5:30 pm. The PTO cannot advise 
prospective applicants of the availability of a particular mark prior to the filing of an application. The applicant may hire a private 
search company or law firm to perform a search if a search is desired before filing an application and the applicant is unable to 
visit the search library. The PTO cannot recommend any such companies, but the applicant may wish to consult listings for 
&quot;Trademark Search Services&quot; in the telephone directories or contact local bar associations for a list of attorneys specializing in 
trademark law. </p>
<h4>WHO MAY FILE AN APPLICATION</h4>
<p>THE owners of marks may file and prosecute their own applications for registration, or be represented by an attorney. The 
Patent and Trademark Office cannot help select an attorney. </p>
<h4>FILING REQUIREMENTS</h4>
<p>AN application consists of (1) a written application form; (2) a drawing of the mark; (3) the required filing fee; and, only if the 
application is filed based upon prior use of the mark in commerce, (4) three specimens showing actual use of the mark on or in 
connection with the goods or services. A separate application must be filed for each mark for which registration is requested. </p>
<p>Following is a description of each of these elements of a complete application. The written application form is the first form of 
four forms at the back of the booklet and is titled &quot;Trademark/Service Mark Application, Principal Register, with Declaration.&quot; 
[The back page of the form is printed upside down so that it may be affixed to the application file at the top and still be easily 
read.] </p>
<p><strong>Written Application Form</strong></p>
<p>THE application must be written in English. The enclosed form may be used for either a trademark or service mark application. 
Additional forms may be photocopied. The following explanation covers each blank, beginning at the top. </p>
<p>Heading. Identify (a) the mark (e.g. &quot;ERGO&quot; or &quot;ERGO and design&quot;) and (b) the class number(s) of the goods or services for 
which registration is sought. Classification is part of the PTO's administrative processing. The International Classification of 
Goods and Services is used (see inside back cover of this booklet). The class may be left blank if the appropriate class number 
is not known. </p>
<p>Applicant. The application must be filed in the name of the owner of the mark. Specify, if an individual, applicant's name and 
citizenship; if a partnership, the names and citizenship of the general partners and the domicile of the partnership; if a corporation 
or association, the name under which it is incorporated and the state or foreign nation under the laws of which it is organized. 
Also indicate the applicant's post office address. </p>
<p>Identification of Goods or Services. State briefly the specific goods or services for which the mark is used or intended to be used 
and for which registration is sought. Use clear and precise language, for example, &quot;women's clothing namely, blouses and skirts,&quot; 
or &quot;computer programs for use by accountants,&quot; or &quot;retail food store services.&quot; Note that the identification of goods or services 
should describe the goods the applicant sells or the services the applicant renders, not the medium in which the mark appears, 
which is often advertising. &quot;Advertising&quot; in this context identifies a service rendered by advertising agencies. For example, a 
restaurateur would identify his service as &quot;restaurant services,&quot; not &quot;menus, signs, etc.&quot; which is the medium through which the 
mark is communicated. </p>
<p>Basis for Application. The applicant must check at least one of four boxes to specify the basis for filing the application. Usually 
an application is based upon either (1) prior use of the mark in commerce (the first box), or (2) a bona fide intention to use the 
mark in commerce {the second box), but not both. If both the first and second boxes are checked, the Patent and Trademark 
Office will not accept the application and will return it to the applicant without processing. </p>
<p>The last two boxes pertain to applications filed in the United States pursuant to international agreements, based upon applications 
or registrations in foreign countries. These bases are asserted relatively infrequently. For further information about foreign -based 
applications, the applicant may call the trademark information number listed in this booklet or contact a private attorney. </p>
<p>If the applicant is using the mark in commerce in relation to all the goods or services listed in the application, check the first box 
and state each of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The date the trademark was first used anywhere in the U.S. on the goods, or in connection with the services, specified in 
the application; </li>
<li>The date the trademark was first used on the specified goods, or in connection with the specified services, sold or shipped 
(or rendered) in a type of commerce which may be regulated by Congress; </li>
<li>The type of commerce in which the goods were sold or shipped or services were rendered [for example, &quot;interstate 
commerce&quot; or &quot;commerce between the United States and (specify foreign country)&quot;]; and </li>
<li>How the mark is used on the goods, or in connection with the services [for example, &quot;the mark is used on labels which are 
affixed to the goods,&quot; or &quot;the mark is used in advertisements for the services&quot;].</li>
</ul>
<p>If the applicant has a bona fide intention to use the mark in commerce in relation to the goods or services specified in the 
application, check the second box. This would include situations where the mark has not been used at all or where the mark has 
been used on the specified goods or services only within a single state (intrastate commerce). </p>
<p>Execution. The application form must be dated and signed. (See back of form.) The declaration and signature block appear on 
the back of the form. The Patent and Trademark Office will not accept an unsigned application and will return it to the applicant 
without processing. By signing the form, the applicant is sweating that all the information in the application is believed to be true. 
If the applicant is an individual, the individual must execute it; if joint applicants, all must execute; if a partnership, one general 
partner must execute the application; and if a corporation or association, one officer of the organization must execute the 
application. </p>
<p><strong>2. Drawing</strong></p>
<p>THE drawing is a representation of the mark as actually used or intended to be used on the goods or services. There are two 
types; (a) typed drawings and (b) special form drawings. All drawings must be made upon pure white durable nonshiny paper 8 
1/2&quot; wide by 11&quot; long. One of the shorter sides of the sheet should be regarded as its top. There must be a margin of at least one 
inch on the sides and bottom of the paper and at least one inch between the drawing of the mark and the heading.</p>
<p>The drawing is different than the specimens, which are the actual tags or labels (for goods) or advertisements (for services) which 
evidence use of the mark in commerce. The drawing is a black and white, or typed, rendition of the mark which is used in 
printing the mark in the Official Gazette and on the registration certificate. A copy of the drawing is also fried in the paper records 
of the Trademark Search Library to provide notice of the pending application. </p>
<p>Heading. Across the top of the drawing, beginning one inch from the top edge and not exceeding one third of the sheet, list on 
separate lines:</p>
<ul>
<li>Applicant's name; </li>
<li>Applicant's post office address; </li>
<li>The goods or services specified in the application (or typical items of the goods or services if there are many goods or 
services listed); </li>
<li>Only in an application based on use in commerce - -the date of first use of the mark anywhere in the U.S. and the date of 
first use of the mark in commerce; </li>
<li>Only in an application based on a foreign application - -the filing date of the foreign application.</li>
</ul>
<p>Typed drawing. If the mark is only words, or words and numerals, and the applicant does not wish the registration to be issued 
for a particular depiction of the words and/or numerals, the mark may be typed in capital letters in the center of the page. </p>
<p>Special form drawing. This form must be used if the applicant wishes the registration for the mark to be issued in a particular 
style, or if the mark contains a design element. The drawing of the mark must be done in black ink, either with an india ink pen or 
by a process which will give satisfactory reproduction characteristics. Every line and letter, including words, must be black. This 
applies to all lines, including lines used for shading. Half -tones and gray are not acceptable. All lines must be clean, sharp, and 
solid, and not be fine or crowded. A photolithographic reproduction, printer's proof or camera ready copy may be used if 
otherwise suitable. Photographs are not acceptable. Photocopies are acceptable only if they produce an unusually clear and 
sharp black and white rendering. The use of white pigment to cover lines is not acceptable. </p>
<p>The preferred size of the drawing of the mark is 2 1/2&quot; x 2 1/2&quot;, and in no case may it be larger than 4&quot; x 4&quot;. The Patent and 
Trademark Office will not accept an application with a special form drawing depicted larger than 4&quot; by 4&quot; and will return the 
application without processing. If the amount of detail in the mark precludes clear reduction to the required 4&quot; x 4&quot; size, such 
detail should not be shown in the drawing but should be verbally described in the body of the application. </p>
<p>Where color is a feature of a mark, the color or colors may be designated in the drawing by the linings shown in the following 
chart: </p>
<p><strong>3. Specimens (Examples of Use) </strong></p>
<p>TRADEMARKS may be placed on the goods; on the container for the goods; on displays associated with the goods; on tags or 
labels attached to the goods; or, if the nature of the goods makes such placement impractical, then on documents associated with 
the goods or their sale. Service marks may appear in advertisements for the services, or in brochures about the services, or on 
business cards or stationary used in connection with the services. </p>
<p>For an application based on actual use of the mark in commerce, the applicant must furnish three examples of use, as described 
in the paragraph above, when the application is filed. The Patent and Trademark Office will not accept an application based on 
use in commerce without at least one &quot;specimen&quot; and will return it to the applicant without processing. </p>
<p>The three &quot;specimens&quot; may be identical or they may be examples of three different types of uses. The three specimens should be 
actual labels, tags, containers, displays, etc. for goods; and actual. advertisements, brochures, store signs or stationary (if the 
nature of the services is clear from the letterhead or body of the letter), etc. for services. Specimens may not be larger than 8 
1/2&quot; by 11&quot; and must be capable of being arranged flat. Three -dimensional or bulky material is not acceptable. Photographs or 
other reproductions clearly and legibly showing the mark on the goods, or on displays associated with the goods, may be 
submitted if the manner of affixing the mark to the goods, or the nature of the goods, is such that specimens as described above 
cannot be submitted. </p>
<p><strong>4. Filing Fee </strong></p>
<p>THE fee, effective April 17, 1989, is $175 for each class of goods or services for which the application is made. (See 
International Classification of Goods and Services on inside back cover.) At least $175 must be submitted for the application to 
be given a filing date. All payments should be made in United States specie, treasury notes, national bank notes, post office 
money orders, or certified checks. Personal or business checks may be submitted. The Patent and Trademark Office will cancel 
credit if payment cannot be collected. Money orders and checks should be made payable to the Commissioner of Patents and 
Trademarks. Money sent by mail to the Patent and Trademark Office will be at the risk of the sender; letters containing cash 
should be registered. Remittances made from foreign countries must be payable and immediately negotiable in the United States 
for the full amount of the fee required. Application fees are non -refundable. </p>
<h4>FURTHER REQUIREMENTS FOR INTENT -TO -USE APPLICANTS</h4>
<p>AN applicant who alleges only a bona fide intention to use a mark in commerce must make use of the mark in commerce before 
a registration will be issued. After use begins, the applicant must submit, along with specimens evidencing use (see page 8) and a 
fee of $100 per class of goods or services in the application, either (1) an Amendment to Allege Use or (2) a Statement of Use. 
The difference between the two filings is the timing of the filing. Copies of each of these forms appear in the back of this booklet 
behind the application form. See the instructions and information concerning the filing of these forms on the back of each form. </p>
<p>Also in the back of this booklet is a form entitled &quot;Request for Extension of Time under 37 CFR 2.89 to File a Statement of Use, 
with Declaration.&quot; This form is intended for use only when. an applicant needs to request an extension of time to file a statement 
of use. See the instructions and information concerning the use of this form on the back of the form. </p>
<h4>FOREIGN APPLICANTS</h4>
<p>DOMESTIC REPRESENTATIVE. Applicants not living in the United States must designate by a written document the name 
and address of some person resident in the United States on whom notices of process in -proceedings affecting the mark may be 
served. This person will also receive all official communications unless the applicant is represented by an attorney in the United 
States. </p>
<h4>COMMUNICATIONS WITH THE PTO</h4>
<p>THE application and all other communications should be addressed to &quot;The Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks, 
Washington, D.C., 20231.&quot; It is preferred that the applicant indicate its telephone number on the application form. Once a serial 
number is assigned to the application the applicant should refer to this number in all telephone and written communications 
concerning the application. </p>
<h4>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION</h4>
<p>The Federal registration of trademarks is governed by the Trademark Act of 1946, 15 U.S.C. See. 1051 et seq.; the Rules, 37 
C.F.R. Part 2; and the Trademark Manual of Examining Procedure. </p>

<h3>Facts for Consumers from the Federal Trade Commission</h3>
<h2>Charitable Giving -- August 1993</h2>
<p>When you read or hear an emotional appeal from a charity, you may decide to give generously. This may be especially true when 
help is needed for victims of a natural disaster or some other crisis. While most charitable organizations are legitimate operations, 
it pays to be careful.</p>
<p>It's bad enough when your contribution goes to a well-intentioned charity that inefficiently spends its funds or uses its money 
primarily on more fundraising appeals.</p>
<p>It's far worse when you contribute to a group that unbeknown to you misrepresents its fundraising intentions or solicits charitable 
funds for phony causes.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it happens.</p>
<p>How can you make sure your contribution is well-spent? The staff at the Federal Trade Commission offers the following 
suggestions.</p>
<p>Carefully check out any organization to whom you plan to make donations. For information about a particular national charity's 
activities, finances, and fund-raising practices, contact:</p>
<p>Philanthropic Advisory Service Council of Better Business Bureaus 4200 Wilson Boulevard Arlington, VA 22203-1804 (703) 
276-0100</p>
<p>National Charities Information Bureau 19 Union Square West, Dept. FT, New York, NY 10003-3395 (212) 929-6300</p>
<p>Don't fall for appeals, especially over the telephone, that insist you send money right away. Be wary of charities that harass you 
to contribute or use strongly emotional appeals that may distort the charity's purpose. Always ask for printed material so you can 
more carefully evaluate any requests for money.</p>
<p>Don't give your credit card number over the telephone to anyone soliciting your contribution. Telephone scams for all kinds of 
causes and products are widespread.</p>
<p>Contact your state Attorney General's office, consumer protection agency, or local Better Business Bureau to see if complaints 
have been filed against a particular charity. Be aware, however, there could still be problems with a charity -- even with no 
complaints on file.</p>
<p>If you believe a particular organization may not be operating for charitable purposes or is making misleading solicitations, please 
contact us. Write: Correspondence Branch, Federal Trade Commission, Washington, DC 20580.</p>
<p>You also may contact the National Fraud Information Center's Consumer Assistance Hotline: 1-800-876-7060 (9 a.m.- 5 p.m. 
EST, Monday-Friday).</p>

<h3>Facts for Consumers from the Federal Trade Commission</h3>
<h2>Consumer Quiz -- June 1994</h2>
<p>The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) receives many letters from consumers asking various questions about their rights under 
FTC-enforced laws and rules. Here are some of the most frequently-asked questions. See how much you know about your 
consumer rights.</p>
<p>1. Your new washing machine spills water on the floor. The dealer's mechanics have repaired it several times under the warranty, 
but it still is not working right. Your warranty runs out, and two weeks later it spills water again. Do you have to pay for the 
repairs now?</p>
<p>No. If you complained about the problem during the warranty period and it was not fixed properly, you are entitled to get it 
repaired. Your warranty rights do not run out for problems you complained about during the warranty period.</p>
<p>2. The used car you bought less than one month ago developed transmission trouble. You consult your sales contract and 
discover you purchased the car &quot;as is.&quot; What is &quot;as is.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;As is&quot; means that the seller makes no promises to fix the item later. If you want warranty protection, make sure the seller puts 
repair promises in writing.</p>
<p>3. Your credit card is stolen. Before you can report it to the card company, the thief charges $1,000 worth of goods on your 
card. What is the most you will have to pay?</p>
<p>$50. If a credit card is lost or stolen and the card is used before you report it missing, the maximum you owe is $50. After you 
report the card missing, you are not liable for any purchases made by the unauthorized user.</p>
<p>4. You lost your electronic fund transfer (EFT) card that lets you withdraw money using a teller machine. You report the card 
lost a week after discovering it was missing. How much money can you lose?</p>
<p>$500. If your EFT card is lost or stolen, and you do not notify your bank within two business days after discovering it is missing, 
you may lose as much as $500. If you notify the bank within two business days, your liability is limited to $50.</p>
<p>5. A debt collection agency keeps calling you at home about a bill you owe. You want to pay the bill but you lost your job two 
months ago. Can you stop the collector from calling?</p>
<p>Yes. If you write the debt collector a letter saying &quot;stop bothering me,&quot; the collector must stop calling. However, this does not 
erase your debt; you still owe the money.</p>
<p>6. There is a mistake on your monthly credit card bill. To correct the error, should you write or call the company?</p>
<p>Write a letter and use the special billing error address provided by the company. While a phone call may resolve the problem 
quickly, sending a letter is the only way to trigger your rights under the Fair Credit Billing Act, a federal law that requires the card 
issuer to correct billing errors or justify the charges.</p>
<p>7. You just had your eyes examined. What should you do if you want to shop around and buy your glasses somewhere else?</p>
<p>Ask the examiner for a copy of your prescription. An FTC rule requires ophthalmologists and optometrists to give patients their 
eyeglasses prescription after an examination at no extra charge.</p>
<p>8. This morning a salesperson knocked on your door and sold you $200 worth of encyclopedias. Now you decide you do not 
want the books. Can you cancel the sales contract?</p>
<p>Yes. You have three days to cancel most door-to-door transactions of $25 or more. The seller is required to give you a 
cancellation form at the time of sale. Sign and mail it to the address given for cancellation any time before midnight of the third 
business day after the day of sale.</p>
<p>9. Last night you visited a health spa and signed a membership contract. Do you have three days to cancel the contract?</p>
<p>No. You usually do not get three days to cancel sales made at a merchant's regular place of business. However, a few state and 
local laws provide extra protection on some contracts like health spas. Check with your local consumer protection agency if you 
have questions.</p>
<p>10. To help finance your new car, you need to take out a loan. What is the most important question to ask about financing?</p>
<p>Ask for the Annual Percentage Rate (APR). The rates charged for loans may vary significantly. The APR is a unit price for credit 
which takes into account all the finance costs of the loan. Use the APR to compare loans and shop around for the best deal.</p>
<p>11. You sent a mail-order company $30 for a new pair of shoes. Shipment was promised in two weeks. Six weeks later you 
have not heard from the company, and your shoes have not arrived. Are you entitled to get your money back?</p>
<p>Yes. The FTC's Mail or Telephone Order Rule allows you to cancel most orders and get a complete refund if you did not get 
delivery in the time period promised.</p>
<p>12. You ordered some cookware using a credit card and an 800 telephone number. The ad said the merchandise would be 
shipped in six weeks. It is three months later and you never received your order. You have not been billed for the merchandise 
but wish to cancel the order because of the delay, and avoid being billed. Can you use the FTC's Mail or Telephone Order Rule 
to cancel your order?</p>
<p>Yes. Effective March 1, 1994, telephone sales are covered by the rule.</p>
<p>13. You were recently divorced. Now you realize all your credit cards are in your ex-husband's name. How can you establish 
your own credit rating by using your past credit history?</p>
<p>Apply for credit in your own name and list the accounts you shared with your former husband. If the creditor has trouble 
verifying these references because they were listed only in your husband's name, offer to provide additional information that 
would confirm your participation in payment of those bills. This might include cancelled checks where your name would show 
that you either paid the bills or that you shared the account with your former husband.</p>
<p>14. Where can you get information about other consumer matters?</p>
<p>Contact Public Reference, Federal Trade Commission, Washington, DC 20580; 202-326-2222.</p>
<p>Ask for a free copy of 'Best Sellers,' which lists all the FTC's consumer publications. You also may contact an FTC regional 
office near you.</p>

<a name="right3"><strong>3</strong></a><strong>. CORRECT! - Answer c:</strong> Oven cleaners are regulated by the Consumer Product Safety Commission. </p>
<p>Canned tomatoes and spaghetti are regulated as foods by the Food and Drug Administration. Tolerances for pesticide residues 
in foods are established by EPA, but the Food and Drug Administration is responsible for ensuring that these tolerances are not 
exceeded on foods (except for meat, poultry and certain egg products, which are under the U.S. Department of Agriculture's 
jurisdiction). </p>

<a name="right4"><strong>4</strong></a><strong>. CORRECT! - Answer d:</strong> Smoke detectors - both photoelectric and ionization chamber types - are regulated by the 
Consumer Product Safety Commission. The radioactive source used in the ionization chamber detector is naturally occurring, not 
electronic and, therefore, it not a substance that would be regulated by the Food and Drug Administration. (The level of radiation 
exposure to home occupants from ionization chamber detectors is much less than that received from the low level of natural 
background radiation.) </p>
<p>Under the Food Drug &amp; Cosmetic Act, the Food and Drug Administration is responsible for protecting consumers from 
unnecessary exposure to radiation emitted from electronic products. (These provisions were originally separate from the Food 
Drug &amp; Cosmetic Act and were referred to as the Radiation Control for Health and Safety Act. They were later incorporated 
into the Food Drug &amp; Cosmetic Act when the Safe Medical Devices Act of 1990 was enacted). Airport security x-ray machines 
and microwave ovens must be properly shielded so that the radiation generated by these products (x-radiation and microwave 
radiation, respectively) does not harm anyone. MRI diagnostic equipment is regulated as a medical device under the Food Drug 
&amp; Cosmetic Act. It is also subject to enforcement as an electronic product emitting radiation because it uses radio waves and a 
strong magnetic field to produce its images. Laser products used in lumber mills must conform to a Food and Drug 
Administration standard that ensures their safety. This standard applies to all laser products, whether medical, industrial or 
consumer. </p>

those for prescription drugs. The Federal Trade Commission oversees advertising for other Food and Drug Administration

<p>TV sets are regulated under the radiological health provisions of the Food Drug &amp; Cosmetic Act. All televisions must comply 
with a performance standard that ensures their safety. This standard also applies to video display terminals used with computers.

<a name="right7"><strong>7</strong></a><strong>. CORRECT! - Answer a:</strong> Illegal use of heroin is the responsibility of the Drug Enforcement Administration, the key federal 
agency that polices illicit, or &quot;street,&quot; drugs. (If heroin were being studied for medical uses, Food and Drug Administration would 
regulate it as an investigational drug.) </p>
<p>Barbiturates are subject to abuse and thus may, potentially, wind up on the &quot;street,&quot; bringing them under DEA's purview. 
However, barbiturates have legitimate medical uses, and the Food and Drug Administration is responsible for ensuring they are 
properly manufactured and labeled. The Food and Drug Administration regulates methadone as a drug, and methadone 
maintenance treatment programs are monitored under regulation promulgated by both the Food and Drug Administration and the 
National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA). Medicinal oxygen is regulated by the Food and Drug Administration as a drug. 
Animal drugs, including veterinary tetracycline, are regulated by Food and Drug Administration. </p>

<p>The Food and Drug Administration's jurisdiction includes the facilities where the products it regulates are stored, such as food 
and drug warehouses. Hearing aid dispensing establishments are bound by specific Food and Drug Administration regulations 
that impose conditions for the sale of hearing aids. The regulations attempt to prevent misrepresentation and ensure adherence to 
proper medical standards. Regarding exporting drugs, the Food and Drug Administration continues to have authority over its

not have jurisdiction over veterinary biologics. The Virus, Serum, and Toxin Act gives this responsibility to the U. S.Department 
of Agriculture. </p>
<p>The Food Drug &amp; Cosmetic Act gives the Food and Drug Administration authority over pet foods and drugs, which would 
include veterinary penicillin, medicated feeds, and bird feed. The Public Health Service Act confers on the Food and Drug 
Administration the authority to regulate the interstate movement of psittacine birds (parrots, cockatoos, macaws, parakeets, and 
other birds in the psittacine family). These birds are potential carriers of psittacosis, a disease that can be transmitted to people. 
Psittacosis, which is also known as parrot fever, can range in severity from a mild respiratory infection to a protracted illness. </p>

delegated to the Consumer Product Safety Commission. </p>
<p>Tamper-resistant packaging, which is required for certain over the counter drugs, cosmetics, and medical devices, is the Food 
and Drug Administration's responsibility. Food packaging materials, such as plastic containers and candy boxes, are subject to 
regulation as food additives under the Food Drug &amp; Cosmetic Act because of the possibility that they may leach their chemical 
constituents into the food product. These potential additives are referred to as indirect food additives. A container bearing a drug 
product is considered to be a component of that drug, and the Food and Drug Administration, therefore, requires that it be 
appropriate for that drug. </p>

<a name="right15"><strong>15</strong></a><strong>. CORRECT! - Answer a:</strong> The animal counterpart of a cosmetic is commonly referred to as a &quot;grooming aid.&quot; Cosmetics, as 
defined in the Food Drug &amp; Cosmetic Act, apply only to human use. Therefore, products intended for cleansing or promoting 
attractiveness of animals are not subject to the Food and Drug Administration's control. </p>
<p>An artificial limb for dogs is regulated as a veterinary medical device. While such products do not require Food and Drug 
Administration approval, they do come under the purview of the Food Drug &amp; Cosmetic Act. They may not bear labeling that is 
false or misleading, nor may they be otherwise misbranded or adulterated. The laser scanner must comply with the standard. 
Mercury vapor lamps, most often used to light streets, gymnasiums, sports arenas, banks, and stores, must be maintained 
properly to be safe. With some types of mercury vapor lamps, if the outer envelope is broken and the lamp continues to operate, 
intense, harmful ultraviolet radiation is emitted. A Food and Drug Administration standard ensures that this lighting is safe. Finally, 
the Food and Drug Administration regulates vitamin C tablets as food supplements. </p>

<h3>Facts for Consumers from the Federal Trade Commission</h3>
<h2>The Cooling-Off Rule -- November 1992</h2>
<p>When you buy something at a store and later change your mind, you may not be able to return the merchandise. But if you buy 
an item in your home or at a location that is not the main or permanent place of business or local address of the seller, the 
Federal Trade Commission's (FTC's) Cooling-Off Rule gives you three days to cancel purchases of $25 or more. With the 
Cooling-Off Rule, your opportunity to cancel for a full refund extends until midnight of the third business day following the sale.</p>
<p>Locations not considered the seller's place of business include temporarily rented rooms, restaurants, and home &quot;parties.&quot; The 
Cooling-Off Rule applies even if you invite the salesperson to make a presentation in your home, unless the sale is covered under 
the exemptions noted below.</p>
<p>Under the Cooling-Off Rule, the salesperson must orally inform you of your cancellation rights at the time of sale. The 
salesperson also must give you two copies of a cancellation form (one to keep and one to send) and a copy of your contract or 
receipt. The contract or receipt should be dated, show the name and address of the seller, and explain your right to cancel. The 
contract or receipt must be in the same language as that used in the sales presentation.</p>
<h4>Some Exceptions</h4>
<p>Some types of sales cannot be cancelled even if they do occur in your home. The Cooling-Off Rule does not cover sales that:</p>
<ul>
<li>are under $25;<p>are not goods or services primarily intended for personal, family or household purposes. (The Rule does apply to courses 
of instruction or training regardless of the purpose for which they are taken);</p>
<p>are made entirely by mail or telephone;</p>
<p>are the result of prior negotiations made by you at the seller's permanent business location where the goods are regularly 
sold;</p>
<p>are needed to meet an emergency, such as the sudden appearance of insects in your home, and you write and sign an 
explanation waiving your right to cancel;</p>
<p>are made as part of your request for the seller to perform repairs or maintenance on your personal property (although, any 
purchase made beyond the maintenance or repair request is covered);</p>
<p>involve real estate, insurance, or securities;</p>
<p>are of automobiles sold at temporary locations, provided the seller has at least one permanent place of business;</p>
<p>involve arts and crafts sold at fairs or other locations, such as shopping malls, civic centers, and schools.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>How to Cancel</h4>
<p>To cancel a sale, sign and date one copy of the cancellation form. Then mail it to the address given for cancellation so that the 
envelope is post-marked before midnight of the third business day after the contract date. (Saturday is considered a business day 
but Sundays and most federal holidays are not.) Because proof of the mailing date and proof of receipt are important, consider 
sending the cancellation form by certified mail so you can get a return receipt. If you prefer, you may hand deliver the cancellation 
notice before midnight. Keep the other copy of the cancellation form for your records.</p>
<p>If you are not given cancellation forms, you can write your own cancellation letter, but remember it also must be post-marked 
within three business days of the sale. Again, for proof of mailing, consider sending your letter by certified mail. Further, let the 
FTC know that you were not given the required cancellation forms.</p>
<p>You do not have to give a reason for canceling your purchase. Under the law, you have a right to change your mind.</p>
<h4>What the Seller Must Do If You Cancel</h4>
<p>If you cancel your purchase, the seller must, within ten days:</p>
<ul>
<li>cancel and return any papers you signed;<p>refund all your money and tell you whether any product left with you will be picked up; and return any trade-in.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Within twenty days, the seller must either pick up the items left with you, or, if you agree to send back the items, reimburse you 
for mailing expenses. If you do not make the items available to the seller or if you agree to return the items but fail to do so, then 
you remain obligated under the contract.</p>
<h4>What To Do About Problems</h4>
<p>One of the best safeguards against problems in this area is to take your time when you buy and to make sure you really want 
what you purchase. However, if you have a complaint about sales practices that involve the Cooling-Off Rule, write: 
Correspondence Branch, Federal Trade Commission, Washington, D.C. 20580.</p>
<p>You also may wish to contact a consumer protection office in your city, county, or state. Some state laws give you even more 
rights than the FTC's Cooling-Off Rule, and some local consumer offices can help you with your complaint.</p>
<p>In addition, if you paid for your purchase with a credit card and a billing dispute arises about the purchase (for example, if the 
merchandise shipped was not what you ordered, or if you cancelled the purchase within three days under the FTC's Cooling-Off 
Rule), you can notify the credit card company that you have a dispute over the purchase. Under the Fair Credit Billing Act, the 
credit card company must acknowledge your dispute in writing and conduct a reasonable investigation of your problem. You 
may withhold payment of the amount in dispute, until the dispute is resolved. (You are still required to pay any part of your bill 
that is not in dispute.) To protect your rights under the Fair Credit Billing Act, you must send a written notice about the problem 
to the credit card company at the address for billing disputes specified on your billing statement within 60 days after the first bill 
containing the disputed amount is mailed to you.</p>
<p>If the 60-day period has expired or if your dispute concerns the quality of the merchandise purchased, you may have other rights 
under the Act. If you have questions about the Fair Credit Billing Act, write for the free brochure Fair Credit Billing. Write: 
Public Reference, Federal Trade Commission, Washington, D.C. 20580.</p>

<h3>U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development<br>
Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity</h3>
<h2>Fair Housing It's Your Right</h2>
<p>The Fair Housing Act</p>
<p>The Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination in housing because of:</p>
<p>* Race or color</p>
<p>* National origin</p>
<p>* Religion</p>
<p>* Sex</p>
<p>* Familial status (including children under the age of 18 living with parents or legal custodians; pregnant women and people 
securing custody of children under 18)</p>
<p>* Handicap</p>
<h4>What Housing Is Covered?</h4>
<p>The Fair Housing Act covers most housing. In some circumstances, the Act exempts owneroccupied buildings with no more than 
four units, single-family housing sold or rented without the use of a broker and housing operated by organization and private 
clubs that limit occupancy to members.</p>
<h4>What Is Prohibited?</h4>
<p>In the Sale and Rental of Housing: No one may take any of the following actions based on race, color, national origin, religion, 
sex, familial status or handicap:</p>
<p>* Refuse to rent or sell housing</p>
<p>* Refuse to negotiate for housing</p>
<p>* Make housing unavailable</p>
<p>* Deny a dwelling</p>
<p>* Set different terms, conditions or privileges for sale or rental of a dwelling</p>
<p>* Provide different housing services or facilities</p>
<p>* Falsely deny that housing is available for inspection, sale or rental</p>
<p>* For profit, persuade owners to sell or rent (blockbusting) or</p>
<p>* Deny anyone access to or membership in a facility or service (such as a multiple listing service) related to the sale or rental of 
housing.</p>
<p>In Mortgage Lending: No one may take any of the following actions based on race, color, national origin, religion, sex, familial 
status or handicap:</p>
<p>* Refuse to make a mortgage loan</p>
<p>* Refuse to provide information regarding loans</p>
<p>* Impose different terms or conditions on a loan</p>
<p>* Discriminate in appraising property. Refuse to purchase a loan or</p>
<p>* Set different terms or conditions for purchasing a loan.</p>
<p>In Addition: It is illegal for anyone to:</p>
<p>* Threaten, coerce, intimidate or interfere with anyone exercising a fair housing right or assisting others who exercise that right</p>
<p>* Advertise or make any statement that indicates a limitation or preference based on race, color, national origin, religion, sex, 
familial status or handicap. This prohibition against discriminatory advertising applies to single-family and owner-occupied 
housing that is otherwise exempt from the Fair Housing Act.</p>
<h4>Additional Protection If You Have A Disability</h4>
<p>If you or someone associated with you:</p>
<p>* Have a physical or mental disability (including hearing, mobility and visual impairments, chronic alcoholism, chronic mental 
illness, AIDS, AIDS Related Complex and mental retardation) that substantially limits one or more major life activities</p>
<p>* Have a record of such a disability or</p>
<p>* Are regarded as having such a disability</p>
<p>your landlord may not:</p>
<p>* Refuse to let you make reasonable modifications to your dwelling or common use areas, at your expense, if necessary for the 
handicapped person to use the housing (Where reasonable, the landlord may permit changes only if you agree to restore the 
property to its original condition when you move.)</p>
<p>* Refuse to make reasonable accommodations in rules, policies, practices or services if necessary for the handicapped person to 
use the housing.</p>
<p>Example: A building with a &quot;no pets&quot; policy must allow a visually impaired tenant to keep a guide dog.</p>
<p>Example: An apartment complex that offers tenants ample, unassigned parking must honor a request from a mobility&#169;impaired 
tenant for a reserved space near her apartment if necessary to assure that she can have access to her apartment.</p>
<p>However, housing need not be made available to a person who is a direct threat to the health or safety of others or who currently 
uses illegal drugs.</p>
<p>Requirements for New Buildings: In buildings that are ready for first occupancy after March 13, 1991, and have an elevator and 
four or more units:</p>
<p>* Public and common areas must be accessible to persons with disabilities</p>
<p>* Doors and hallways must be wide enough for wheelchairs</p>
<p>* All units must have:</p>
<p>An accessible route into and through the unit</p>
<p>Accessible light switches, electrical outlets, thermostats and other environmental controls</p>
<p>Reinforced bathroom walls to allow later installation of grab bars and</p>
<p>Kitchens and bathrooms that can be used by people in wheelchairs.</p>
<p>If a building with four or more units has no elevator and will be ready for first occupancy after March 13, 1991, these standards 
apply to ground floor units.</p>
<p>These requirements for new buildings do not replace any more stringent standards in State or local law.</p>
<h4>Housing Opportunities For Families</h4>
<p>Unless a building or community qualifies as housing for older persons, it may not discriminate based on familial status. That is, it 
may not discriminate against families in which one or more children under 18 live with:</p>
<p>* A parent</p>
<p>* A person who has legal custody of the child or children or</p>
<p>* The designee of the parent or legal custodian, with the parent or custodian's written permission.</p>
<p>Familial status protection also applies to pregnant women and anyone securing legal custody of a child under 18.</p>
<p>Exemption: Housing for older persons is exempt from the prohibition against familial status discrimination if:</p>
<p>* The HUD Secretary has determined that it is specifically designed for and occupied by elderly persons under a Federal, State 
or local government program or</p>
<p>* It is occupied solely by persons who are 62 or older or</p>
<p>* It houses at least one person who is 55 or older in at least 80 percent of the occupied units; has significant services and 
facilities for older persons; and adheres to a published policy statement that demonstrates an intent to house persons who are 55 
or older. The requirement for significant services and facilities is waived if providing them is not practicable and the housing is 
necessary to provide important housing opportunities for older persons.</p>
<p>A transition period permits residents on or before September 13, 1988 to continue living in the housing, regardless of their age, 
without interfering with the exemption.</p>
<h4>If You Think Your Rights Have Been Violated</h4>
<p>HUD is ready to help with any problem of housing discrimination. If you think your rights have been violated, you may fill out the 
Housing Discrimination Complaint Form in this brochure, write HUD a letter or telephone the HUD Hotline. You have one year 
after an alleged violation to file a complaint with HUD, but you should file it as soon as possible.</p>
<h4>What to Tell HUD:</h4>
<p>* Your name and address</p>
<p>* The name and address of the person your complaint is against (the respondent)</p>
<p>* The address or other identification of the housing involved</p>
<p>* A short description of the alleged violation (the event that caused you to believe your rights were violated)</p>
<p>* The date(s) of the alleged violation</p>
<p>Where to Write: Send the Housing Discrimination Complaint Form or a letter to the HUD regional office nearest you (addresses 
on the Complaint Form) or to:</p>
<p>Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity<br>
U.S. Department of Housing and<br>
Urban Development<br>
Room 5204<br>
Washington, D.C. 20410-2000</p>
<p>Where to Call: if you wish, you may use the toll-free Hotline number: 1-800-669-9777. (In Washington, D.C. call 708-0836.)</p>
<p>If You Are Disabled: HUD also provides:</p>
<p>* A toll-free TDD phone for the hearing impaired: 1-800-927-9275. (In Washington, D.C., call 708-0836.)</p>
<p>* Interpreters</p>
<p>* Tapes and braille materials</p>
<p>* Assistance in reading and completing forms</p>
<h4>What Happens When You File A Complaint? </h4>
<p>HUD will notify you when it receives your complaint. Normally, HUD also will:</p>
<p>* Notify the alleged violator of your complaint and permit that person to submit an answer</p>
<p>* Investigate your complaint and determine whether there is reasonable cause to believe the Fair Housing Act has been violated</p>
<p>* Notify you if it cannot complete an investigation within 100 days of receiving your complaint</p>
<p>Conciliation: HUD will try to reach an agreement with the person your complaint is against (the respondent). A conciliation 
agreement must protect both you and the public interest. If an agreement is signed, HUD will take no further action on your 
complaint. However, if HUD has reasonable cause to believe that a conciliation agreement is breached, HUD will recommend 
that the Attorney General file suit.</p>
<p>Complaint Referrals: If HUD has determined that your State or local agency has the same fair housing powers as HUD, HUD 
will refer your complaint to that agency for investigation and notify you of the referral. That agency must begin work on your 
complaint within 30 days or HUD may take it back.</p>
<h4>What If You Need Help Quickly?</h4>
<p>If you need immediate help to stop a serious problem that is being caused by a Fair Housing Act violation, HUD may be able to 
assist you as soon as you file a complaint. HUD may authorize the Attorney General to go to court to seek temporary or 
preliminary relief, pending the outcome of your complaint, if:</p>
<p>* Irreparable harm is likely to occur without HUD's intervention</p>
<p>* There is substantial evidence that a violation of the Fair Housing Act occurred</p>
<p>Example: A builder agrees to sell a house but, after learning the buyer is black, fails to keep the agreement. The buyer files a 
complaint with HUD. HUD may authorize the Attorney General to go to court to prevent a sale to any other buyer until HUD 
investigates the complaint.</p>
<h4>What Happens After A Complaint Investigation?</h4>
<p>If, after investigating your complaint, HUD finds reasonable cause to believe that discrimination occurred, it will inform you. Your 
case will be heard in an administrative hearing within 120 days, unless you or the respondent want the case to be heard in 
Federal district court. Either way, there is no cost to you.</p>
<p>The Administrative Hearing: If your case goes to an administrative hearing HUD attorneys will litigate the case on your behalf. 
You may intervene in the case and be represented by your own attorney if you wish. An Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) will 
consider evidence from you and the respondent. If the ALJ decides that discrimination occurred, the respondent can be ordered:</p>
<p>* To compensate you for actual damages, including humiliation, pain and suffering.</p>
<p>* To provide injunctive or other equitable relief, for example, to make the housing available to you.</p>
<p>* To pay the Federal Government a civil penalty to vindicate the public interest. The maximum penalties are $10,000 for a first 
violation and $50,000 for a third violation within seven years.</p>
<p>* To pay reasonable attorney's fees and costs.</p>
<p>Federal District Court: If you or the respondent choose to have your case decided in Federal District Court, the Attorney 
General will file a suit and litigate it on your behalf. Like the ALJ, the District Court can order relief, and award actual damages, 
attorney's fees and costs. In addition, the court can award punitive damages.</p>
<h4>In Addition</h4>
<p>You May File Suit: You may file suit, at your expense, in Federal District Court or State Court within two years of an alleged 
violation. If you cannot afford an attorney, the court may appoint one for you. You may bring suit even after filing a complaint, if 
you have not signed a conciliation agreement and an Administrative Law Judge has not started a hearing. A court may award 
actual and punitive damages and attorney's fees and costs.</p>
<h4>Other Tools to Combat Housing Discrimination</h4>
<p>* If there is noncompliance with the order of an Administrative Law Judge, HUD may seek temporary relief, enforcement of the 
order or a restraining order in a United States Court of Appeals.</p>
<p>* The Attorney General may file a suit in Federal District Court if there is reasonable cause to believe a pattern or practice of 
housing discrimination is occurring.</p>

<h3>Facts for Consumers from the Federal Trade Commission</h3>
<h2>Grocery Store Rain Checks -- October 1992</h2>
<p>Produced in cooperation with the Food Marketing Institute</p>
<p>Are you trying to cut your food bill? Do you regularly shop for advertised special-sale items in grocery stores? If you answer 
&quot;yes,&quot; then you know that advertised specials sometimes can disappear quickly.</p>
<p>If you cannot find an advertised sale item on the grocery shelf, ask for it. If the store has run out, you can ask about a rain check. 
Unless the ad says quantities are limited, the grocer probably will offer you some form of compensation. The Federal Trade 
Commission's (FTC) &quot;Unavailability Rule&quot; says how, and if, you and other customers should be compensated.</p>
<h4>The &quot;Unavailability Rule&quot;</h4>
<p>The FTC issued the Retail Food Store Advertising and Marketing Practices Rule in 1971 and amended it in 1989. Known as the 
Unavailability Rule, it helps protect consumers against food stores that advertise bargains to attract customers but fail to have 
adequate stock available.</p>
<p>Under the 1989 amended Rule, grocers may offer rain checks to customers if they run out of advertised items. However, rain 
checks are not required if the ad clearly and adequately says &quot;quantities are limited&quot; or that products are available only at some 
stores. This gives grocery stores the flexibility to advertise items that they cannot stock in large quantities or at certain outlets. 
Such items may be seasonal products, like holiday cakes, or perishables, such as fruits and vegetables.</p>
<p>If a store does not disclose the limited availability of an advertised item and runs out of that item, the &quot;Unavailability Rule&quot; excuses 
the store only when it can show (to the FTC) that advertised items were ordered in adequate time for delivery and in quantities to 
meet reasonably anticipated demand OR it offers customers one of three alternatives:</p>
<p>A &quot;rain check&quot; that allows customers to buy the item later at the lower price</p>
<p>A substitute item of comparable value to the sale item</p>
<p>Some kind of compensation that is at least equal in value to the advertised item</p>
<p>If a store runs out of advertised specials, ask for a rain check, a substitute, or other compensation. Chances are you will get 
something because most grocers want to satisfy their customers.</p>
<h4>If a Store Does Not Comply</h4>
<p>If you know of a grocery store that routinely runs out of &quot;advertised specials,&quot; fails to say when &quot;specials&quot; are limited, and does 
not provide you with a rain check, a substitute item, or some other compensation, write to: Correspondence Branch, Federal 
Trade Commission, Washington, D.C. 20580. Letters from shoppers can help the FTC identify food retailers who may not be 
complying with the Rule.</p>

<h2 align=center>GUIDE TO SINGLE FAMILY HOME MORTGAGE INSURANCE</h2>
<h4>Becoming a Homeowner</h4>
<p>Many Americans dream of owning their own homes, but few families are able to pay cash for them. Many people who could not 
otherwise afford to own a house become homeowners with the help of FHA mortgage insurance programs.</p>
<p>Helping people obtain financing for their homes is one of the chief purposes of FHA. FHA is the Federal Housing Administration. 
It is part of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).</p>
<p>Once you have found the home you want to buy, you must decide how to finance your dream. This booklet gives you 
information about FHA programs to help you meet that challenge. It explains:</p>
<pre>
     *    How FHA mortgage insurance works.
     *    How to shop for a HUD- approved lender.
     *    How to apply for an FHA- insured loan.
     *    How your payment schedule will
          operate.
     *    What restrictions apply to FHA- insured mortgages.
     *    Which specific FHA program can best help you.

</pre>
<h4>How FHA Mortgage Insurance Works</h4>
<p>FHA mortgage insurance allows a homebuyer to make a modest downpayment and obtain a mortgage for the balance of the 
purchase price.</p>
<p>The mortgage loan is made by a bank, savings and loan association, mortgage company, credit union, or other FHA- approved 
lender. FHA (HUD) insures the loan and pays the lender if the borrower defaults on the mortgage. Because the lender is 
protected by this insurance, it can offer more liberal mortgage terms than the prospective homeowner might otherwise obtain.</p>
<p>HUD does not make direct loans to help people build or buy homes.</p>
<p>Who Can Get an FHA- Insured Mortgage?</p>
<p>Almost any individual who has a satisfactory credit record, enough cash to close the loan, and sufficient steady income to make 
monthly mortgage payments without difficulty can be approved for an FHA- insured mortgage.</p>
<p>Generally, only people who will reside in the property are eligible for FHA- insured mortgages. However, investors can 
participate in FHA's Section 203(k) rehabilitation insurance program.</p>
<p>HUD sets no upper age limit for the borrower, nor does HUD require that the borrower have a certain income level to buy a 
home at a certain price. Income is simply one of several factors that help a lender and HUD determine whether the borrower will 
be able to repay the mortgage.</p>
<p>FHA mortgages are available to individuals regardless of race, creed, religion, sex, or marital status.</p>
<p>Special terms are available to qualified veterans purchasing a single- family home. The veteran must present a Certificate of 
Veterans Status from the Department of Veterans Affairs. There is no limit on the number of times an eligible veteran can use 
his/her eligibility in HUD programs.</p>
<h4>Types of Mortgages FHA Insures</h4>
<p>HUD insures mortgages to buy existing homes, to improve homes, to purchase a newly built home, and to refinance existing 
indebtedness. FHA- insured mortgages are available for many types of properties, including:</p>
<pre>
     -    One- family residences.
     -    Two- , three- , and four- unit properties.
     -    Condominium units.
     -    Houses needing rehabilitation.</pre>
<pre>The terms of FHA- insured mortgages can also be structured in
different ways, such as:</pre>
<pre>
     -    Fixed rate, level payment mortgages.
     -    Graduated payment mortgages.
     -    Growing equity mortgages.
     -    Adjustable rate mortgages.</pre>
<p>Each of these mortgages is explained later in this brochure.</p>
<h4>Shopping for an FHA- Insured Loan</h4>
<p>After you have found the home you want to buy, you should call various lenders listed under &quot;Mortgages&quot; in the Yellow Pages to 
find the lender offering the best terms.</p>
<p>The costs associated with a loan can vary significantly from one lender to another. It pays to comparison shop for a mortgage. 
The most important factors to consider in comparing loans are:</p>
<pre>
     -    Interest Rate.
     -    Discount points.
     -    Closing costs and other fees, such as charges to
          originate the loan, commitment fees to &quot;lock in&quot; the
          mortgage terms you and the lender have agreed to for a
          certain period, and mortgageinsurance premiums(MIP).
     -    Annual Percentage Rate.</pre>
<p>All of these factors are negotiated between you and your lender. HUD does not establish minimum or maximum amounts for the 
interest rate, discount points, or most processing fees you pay the lender.</p>
<p>Interest Rate</p>
<p>The interest rate a borrower pays for the mortgage is negotiated between the borrower and the lender. Interest rates fluctuate 
daily, depending on conditions in the mortgage market. It is always a good idea to check with several mortgage lenders to make 
sure you are getting the best interest rate available.</p>
<p>The following chart shows how the principal and interest on your mortgage will vary according to the interest rate.</p>

     $50,000   333.00    367.00    402.50    439.00

     $80,000*  532.80    587.20    644.00    702.40

     $90,000*  599.40    660.60    724.50    790.20

*The maximum FHA- insured mortgage is $67,500.
In areas where the cost of housing is high, the limit may go up
to $151,725.</pre>
<p>Initial Investment (Downpayment)</p>
<p>The borrower's initial cash investment is the difference between the amount of the mortgage and the total cost of the home. The 
total cost includes the purchase price plus closing costs, but it does not include prepaid items that you have to pay at settlement, 
such as real estate taxes and hazard insurance. Most FHA programs require the borrower to invest a minimum of between 3 and 
5 percent of the total cost of the home.</p>
<p>Discount Points</p>
<p>Lenders can charge discount points to borrowers. A point is $1 for every $100 of the mortgage amount. Points are charged 
when the interest rate is lower than the yield required by investors who buy mortgage securities. (Yield is the ratio of investment 
income to the total amount invested over a given period of time.) Securities are &quot;packaged,&quot; usually in portfolios of $1 million 
dollars or more, and bought and sold in the financial markets. This creates additional mortgage money to lend to other 
homebuyers.</p>
<p>The numbers of points charged varies in different places at different times and among different lenders.Discount points for an 
FHA- insured mortgage may be paid by homebuyer, the builder of the house, or the person selling the house. Discount points 
may not be financed as part of the mortgage amount (unless you are refinancing your mortgage and you have sufficient equity in 
the home to cover the points).</p>
<p>HUD does not control the number of points you agree to pay your lender. HUD does not set the points that a lender may 
require, and HUD does not receive any of this money.</p>
<p>Closing Costs and Prepaid Items</p>
<p>When your loan is finalized, you will have to pay closing costs. These fees may include a lender's service charge or origination 
fee, cost of the title search, fees for preparing, notarizing, and recording the deed and the mortgage, and other items. You will 
also be asked to make payments in advance for such items as taxes, property insurance, and interest to the end of the month.</p>
<p>Certain closing costs, such as recording fees and taxes, title examination, and credit reports, may be paid by the seller, or they 
may be shared between the borrower and the seller, depending on the terms of the sales contract. Most of the closing costs paid 
by the borrower may be financed as part of the mortgage.</p>
<p>The Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA) requires that your lender give you an information booklet and a Good 
Faith Estimate of your closing costs within 3 days of receiving your written loan application. RESPA also requires that at closing 
or shortly afterward, you must receive a Uniform Settlement Statement , which is a permanent record of all the final settlement 
charges. You are entitled to review the Settlement Statement 1 business day before you close on your loan.</p>
<p>Origination Fees</p>
<p>Lenders may charge a service charge (called an origination fee) when you submit your mortgage application. In most cases, this 
charge cannot exceed 1 percent of the mortgage amount. However, if you are buying and rehabilitating your purchase under the 
Section 203(k) Program, a lender can charge an additional $350 or 2 1/2 percent of the portion of the mortgage that is 
escrowed for the rehabilitation.</p>
<p>Commitment Fees</p>
<p>The lender may charge a fee to &quot;lock in&quot; the interest rate, number of discount points, and other terms you have agreed to, or to 
limit the extent to which the terms may be changed. Lenders may agree to offer the loan terms for a definite period of time (30 
days, 60 days, 90 days, etc.), or they may refuse to do so. The terms of your commitment agreement will determine to what 
extent, if any, the interest rate and discount points may change before your loan closes. Any increase in the number of discount 
points or a 1- percent increase in the interest rate requires that your mortgage application be reprocessed. </p>
<h4>Mortgage Insurance Premium</h4>
<p>HUD charges a premium to insure mortgages. The premiums are used to pay claims to lenders when a borrower defaults on an 
FHA- insured mortgage.</p>
<p>Most borrowers with FHA- insured mortgages currently pay an up- front mortgage insurance premium (MIP) and an annual 
MIP as well. The up- front MIP can be financed into the mortgage. Your lender can provide you with more information about 
MIP charges.</p>
<p>Annual Percentage Rate</p>
<p>The Truth in Lending Act requires lenders to disclose to borrowers the annual percentage rate charged on a mortgage to finance 
the purchase of residential real estate. The annual percentage rate is calculated by adding the interest rate, the discount points, the 
initial service charge, the premium paid to insure the mortgage, and certain other charges collected by the lender. The Truth in 
Lending Act is administered by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.</p>
<p>Your monthly payment will be determined by the amount of your mortgage, the interest rate, and the length of the loan. A longer 
mortgage term will lower your monthly pay- ment, but it will increase the total amount of interest you pay. For example, if you 
borrow $50,000 with an interest rate of 10 percent, your payment to principal and interest will be:</p>
<pre>

     Monthly   Term    Total Payment

     $537.50   15 years  $96,750

     $439.00   30 years  $158,040
</pre>
<h4>Applying for the Loan</h4>
<p>When you have selected a lender, arrange a meeting with the loan officer to fill out the application forms. At the interview, you 
will have to provide the lender with your most recent bank statement and pay stub, picture identification, and proof of your social 
security number. You will also have to pay fees for an appraisal and a credit report.</p>
<p>The lender will take care of processing the loan for FHA insurance and will arrange to close the loan. Many lenders are 
authorized to approve mortgage applications without submitting any paperwork to HUD. These companies are called Direct 
Endorsement lenders. Most FHA- insured loans are handled by these lenders. In some cases, however, HUD reviews 
information submitted by the lender and determines whether the property and the borrower are acceptable risks for an FHA- 
insured mortgage. Regardless of the type of loan you select, you will deal only with the lender, and the lender will handle all 
transactions with HUD.</p>
<h4>Payments on an FHA- Insured Mortgage</h4>
<p>Monthly Payments</p>
<p>The amount of your monthly payment will depend on how much money you borrow and the interest rate on your loan. Your 
monthly mortgage payment will include money to repay the principal amount you borrowed, the interest on that money, your 
FHA mortgage insurance premium, and amounts for taxes and property insurance. Typically, your combined monthly payment 
for principal, interest, taxes, and insurance should be no more than 29 percent of your gross (total) monthly income (before 
taxes.)</p>
<p>Advance Payments</p>
<p>With an FHA- insured mortgage, you can make extra payments toward the principal when you make your regularly monthly 
payment. By making extra payments, you can repay the loan faster and save on interest. However, extra payments do not relieve 
you from continuing to make regular payments every month.</p>
<p>You can also pay off the entire balance of your FHA- insured mortgage at any time.</p>
<h4>Limits on FHA- Insured Mortgages</h4>
<p>Amount of the Mortgage</p>
<p>There is a limit on the maximum mortgage HUD will insure. Generally, for a single family home, HUD insures mortgages up to 
$67,500. If you live in an area where the cost of housing is high, HUD may insure a mortgage up to $151,725. Information about 
the mortgage limits for the area you live in may be obtained from HUD- approved lending institutions or the local HUD Field 
Office.</p>
<p>Property Appraisal</p>
<p>For an existing home, HUD's estimate of the appraised value is based on the condition of the house and recent sales of 
comparable properties in the neighborhood. If there are obvious, serious defects, the house must be repaired before HUD 
insures the mortgage.</p>
<p>If your house has not yet been built, HUD will base the estimate of its value on the plans and specifications for the house and the 
value of the land where it will be built.</p>
<p>Existing houses are generally sold &quot;as is&quot; unless the buyer and seller agree, usually in writing, to repairs. Since there may be 
hidden defects in a home, the homebuyer should carefully examine the house or have the house inspected by a professional home 
inspection firm and be satisfied of its soundness before purchasing. An appraisal is not an inspection, and HUD does not warrant 
the condition of the house you buy.</p>
<h4>The Most Frequently Used FHA Mortgage Insurance Programs</h4>
<p>Section 203(b) Home Mortgage Insurance (Federal Domestic Assistance Codes 14.117 and 14.118)</p>
<p>Section 203(b) of the National Housing Act is the most commonly used HUD single family program. This program is available in 
all areas of the country, provided a market exists for the property and the home meets HUD's Minimum Property Standards. 
You may use the Section 203(b) Program to purchase a new or existing one- to four- family home in both urban and rural 
areas.A Section 203(b) mortgage may be repaid in monthly payments over 10, 15, 20, 25, or 30 years.</p>
<p>Section 234(c) Condominium Units (Federal Domestic Assistance Code 14.133)</p>
<p>Section 234(c) provides mortgage insurance for buyers who wish to purchase a unit in a condominium project. The condominium 
may consist of more than one building, such as a group of row apartments, high- rise buildings, townhouses, or any combination 
of these structures.</p>
<p>When you buy a unit in a condominium, you will own one unit in a multi- unit project, and you will have a voting interest in the 
condominium association that governs the day- to- day operation of the project.</p>
<p>You will share an undivided interest with other owners in the common areas and facilities that serve the project and share the 
obligation to maintain them. All owners pay a monthly condominium fee to the association to maintain the shared common areas 
and facilities, including common land areas, roofs, floors, main walls, stairways, lobbies, halls, and parking spaces. This payment 
is separate from the regular monthly mortgage payment.</p>
<p>Any condominium project must be approved by HUD before you can purchase a unit using an FHA- insured mortgage. HUD 
requires that 51 percent of the units in the project must be owner- occupied before FHA will offer mortgage insurance for 
individual units in the project.</p>
<p>Section 203(k) Rehabilitation Home Mortgage Insurance (Federal Domestic Assistance Code 14.108)</p>
<p>Section 203(k) mortgages allow you to purchase or refinance and rehabilitate a home at least 1 year old. A portion of the loan 
proceeds are used to pay off the existing mortgage, and the remaining funds are placed in an escrow account and released as 
rehabilitation is completed.</p>
<p>The loan may be used to purchase a home and the land on which it is located and rehabilitate it; purchase a home on one site and 
move it onto a new foundation at another site and rehabilitate it; or refinance an existing mortgage to rehabilitate the home. In 
addition, a Section 203(k) mortgage may be used to allows you to have smaller initial monthly payments. The deferred interest is 
added to the loan balance in later years.</p>
<p>FHA offers five GPM payment plans, which vary in the rate of payment increases and the number of years over which the 
payments will increase. The greater the rate of increase or the longer the period of increase, the lower the mortgage payments in 
the early years. For example:</p>
<pre>
          Increase in    Frequency of
     GPM Plan  Monthly Payments    Increase

     Plan 1    2.5 percent    First 5 years

     Plan 2    5 percent      First 5 years

     Plan 3    7.5 percent    First 5 years

     Plan 4    2 percent      First 10 years

     Plan 5    3 percent      First 10 years

</pre>
<p>To give you an idea of how a 245(a) GPM works, the following table compares the monthly payment schedule of a 203(b) 
FHA- insured loan with Plan 3, the most frequently used GPM plan. In Plan 3, payments increase 7.5 percent each year for 5 
years before leveling off. The example uses a 30- year, $60,000 mortgage, with an interest rate of 10 percent:</p>
<pre>
     Year 203(b)    GPM Loan

     1    526.80    400.22

     2    526.80    430.24

     3    526.80    462.50

     4    526.80    497.20

     5    536.80    534.49

     6    526.80    574.57

     Remaining
     Payments  526.80    574.57</pre>
<p>____________________________________________________________<br>
During the life of the loan, the interest rate may not increase or decrease more than 5 percent from the initial interest rate. </p>
<p>Your lender must explain how the Adjustable Rate Mortgage is calculated when you apply for your loan. Your lender must 
inform you at least 25 days in advance if there is an adjustment to your monthly payment.</p>
<h4>Other FHA Mortgage Insurance Programs</h4>
<p>Although the following FHA mortgage insurance programs are still active, they are not used as much as the six major FHA 
programs, because they were designed to serve certain specific purposes.</p>
<p>Section 203(h) Mortgage Insurance for Disaster Victims (Federal Domestic Assistance Code 14.119)</p>
<p>You may use this program to finance the purchase of a home if your home was damaged or destroyed because of a major 
disaster. The President of the United States must designate the area a major disaster area. The loan may be used to purchase an 
existing home or a newly built home.</p>
<p>Disaster victims are not required to meet minimum investment requirements, and a downpayment is not required.</p>
<p>Section 203(i) Mortgage Insurance for Outlying Area Properties (Federal Domestic Assistance Code 14.121)</p>
<p>You may use Section 203(i) to purchase a home in a rural area. You may also use it to purchase a new farm house on 2.5 or 
more acres of land adjacent to an all- weather road.</p>
<p>Section 220 Urban Renewal Mortgage Insurance (Federal Domestic Assistance Code 14.122)</p>
<p>This program is used in conjunction with local governments to rehabilitate existing dwellings for up to 11 families or to build new 
dwellings in redevelopment areas where concentrated housing, physical development, and public service activities are being 
carried out. If the building houses more than four families, the mortgage limit increases $9,165 for each additional unit.</p>
<p>Section 220(h) Insured Improvement Loans in Urban Areas</p>
<p>These loans are used to finance alterations, repairs, or improvements to existing dwellings housing up to 11 families in a 
redevelopment area as defined in Section 220. The mortgage limit is the lessor of:</p>
<pre>
     *    HUD's estimate of the cost of
          improvements;</pre>
<p>* $40,000; or</p>
<p>* $12,000 for each family unit ($17,400 in high cost areas).</p>
<p>Section 221(d)(2) Home Mortgage Insurance for Low and Moderate Income Families (Federal Domestic Assistance Code 
14.120)</p>
<p>This program may be used by low- to moderate- income families to finance the purchase of a home. It may also be used by 
families displaced by urban renewal, code enforcement, condemnation, etc., or as a result of the President declaring an area a 
major disaster. The mortgage limit for a one- family unit is $31,000. This amount may be increased up to $36,000 in high cost 
areas determined by the Department. </p>
<p>Section 222 Mortgage Insurance for Service Members (Federal Domestic Assistance Code 14.166)</p>
<p>You may use Section 222 to purchase a home if you are on active duty with the Department of Transportation (Coast Guard) or 
the Department of Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration). While there is no upfront mortgage insurance premium, the 
employing agency pays the monthly mortgage insurance premium directly to HUD as long as you remain in active service. The 
employing agency must issue a certificate of eligibility.</p>
<p>Section 223(e) Miscellaneous Housing Insurance (Federal Domestic Assistance Code 14.123)</p>
<p>You may use Section 223(e) to purchase a property in an older, declining urban area where normal requirements for mortgage 
insurance cannot be met. Only HUD can determine whether a property is eligible for Section 223(e) mortgage insurance. This 
program is intended to supplement other HUD mortgage insurance programs.</p>
<p>Section 237 Mortgage Insurance for Special Credit Risks (Federal Domestic Assistance Code 14.140)</p>
<p>Low- and moderate- income families who are unable to meet the normal underwriting standards of HUD's other single family 
programs because of their credit history may use Section 237 to finance the purchase of new, existing, or substantially 
rehabilitated single- family homes or condominiums.</p>
<p>To qualify for a Section 237 mortgage, you must obtain counseling assistance from a HUD- approved counseling agency. These
