JusticeOliver Wendell Holmes put it best in his memorable observation that it seemedto him "perfectly logical"-- if nonetheless unconstitutional-- forgovernment to punish speech that it believed would lead to harmful conduct bythose who listened to it.  "If you have no doubt of your premises and yourpower," Holmes wrote, "and want a certain result with all your heart, younaturally express your wishes in law and sweep away all opposition."</tt>"0" [1<p>	Just that natural inclination is evident here.2  If FDA's aim is, as it says,to protect the health of children and if the speech it seeks to suppress isdrafted by and in the interests of ]<tt>cigarette manufacturers,must we really think about the First Amendment at all?</tt><p><tt>	To which the answer is:  yes.  In fact, the more one reviews FDA'sposition, the clearer still is that answer.  Consider that position.  Cigaretteadvertising is to be "stringently" limited because it is "pervasive" and"ubiquitous," because it creates a "friendly familiarity" with those who viewit, and because "advertising and labeling play an important role in shaping ayoung person's attitude towards, and willingness to experiment with, cigarettesand smokeless tobacco products."  60 Fed. Reg. 41,329.  To change that"attitude", FDA now claims authority to virtually ban cigarette advertising, torequire cigarette companies to establish and maintain an antismoking campaignand to limit adult audiences to fare deemed fit for children.</tt><p><tt>	In a country with no First Amendment, such an effort by any governmentalagency would surely give rise to extended debate (and perhaps litigation) aboutthe powers of government vis-&agrave;-vis the rights of its citizens.But we already have a First Amendment.  It does not allow the mere incantationof the words "children," "cigarettes" and "health" to overcome deeply rootedrights of adults.</tt>"4" [3  It does not allowspeech to be limited as part of a new process of delegitimization of lawfulconduct or disfavored social customs.  It does not begin to permit the mix ofviewpoint discrimination, compelled speech and total disdain for commercialspeech that the proposed FDA regulations reflect.<p>	Consider what appears to be the primary justification offered by FDA for itsproposed regulations.  To change the attitude of children towards smoking, FDAmaintains, cigarette advertising must be virtually banned and cigarettecompanies must fund antismoking campaigns.  These proposals are not made in alegal vacuum.  There is ]<tt>law, well-established First Amendmentlaw, that is facially inconsistent with any such efforts.</tt><p><tt>	The Supreme Court ruling in Careyv. Population ServicesInternational, 431 U.S. 677 (1977), illustrates the virtuallyinsurmountable barrier the FDA must scale to defend its proposal.  InCarey, the Court held unconstitutional a law which banned theadvertising of contraceptives that the government had defended on the same"legitimization" basis offered here:  allowing the advertisements to persist,the government argued, would "legitimize sexual activity of young people."Id. at 701.  There, as here, the government's restriction on speech wasjustified, inter alia, as an indirect means of preventing harmfulactivity thought to be urged by the proscribed speech.  Declaring that this is"classically not [a] justification[] validating the suppression ofexpression protected by the First Amendment," id., the Court held that"[a]s for the possible `legitimation' of illicit sexual behavior, whatevermight be the case if the advertisements directly incited illicit sexualactivity among the young, none of the advertisements in this record can evenremotely be characterized as `directed to inciting or producing imminentlawless action and ... likely to incite or produce such action.'"Id. (citing Brandenburgv. Ohio, 395 U.S. 444, 447(1969)).  </tt><p><tt>	The Court's citation to Brandenburg-- the Supreme Court'sclassic and still binding ruling on what constitutes "incitement to imminentlawless action"-- is telling.  In Brandenburg, the Court held thateven direct advocacy of violence cannot be actionable unless it is bothintended to cause "imminent" violence and is likely to do so.Brandenburg, 395 U.S. at447.  That test could not be met inCarey.  Nor can it be met here.</tt><p><tt>	There is not the slightest suggestion in the FDA proposal that it isdesigned to combat any direct advocacy in cigarette advertising urging youthsto begin smoking before it is lawful for them to do so.  There has been no suchadvertising-- no such "direct incitement," as Carey putsit-- and FDA does not suggest otherwise.</tt><p><tt>	The whole thrust of FDA's proposal is, in fact, to the contrary--the supposed need to dispel the general "atmosphere" created by cigaretteadvertising; to "combat the effects of the pervasive and positive imagery"created by "decades" of cigarette advertising; to counter the "important role"of cigarette advertising "in shaping a young person's attitude" toward tobacco.What this all amounts to is no more than a complaint that cigarette advertisingprovides background noise supportive of smoking.  But none of this-- andall of it is at the heart of FDA's proposals-- begins to meet the sternlegal tests established by cases such as Carey or Brandenburg.The emphasis on atmosphere, imagery and the long-term development of attitudesis the polar opposite of what the First Amendment requires to make evenconstitutionally conceivable the sort of steps FDA is advocating.</tt><p><tt>	We deal in more depth with Carey and similar rulings later in thismemorandum.  For present purposes, it should suffice to say that Careyitself puts at issue whether any of the proposed FDA regulations--rooted, as they are, in an effort to delegitimize smoking in Americanlife-- can survive First Amendment scrutiny.</tt>"5" [4  <p>	The same is true of FDA's attempt to require cigarette companies to fund anantismoking campaign and to be required to offer the government's attacks onsmoking as their own.  Once again, there is clear First Amendment authoritywhich makes any such compelled speech unconstitutional.  ]<tt>SeePacific Gas&amp; Elec. Co.v. Public Util. Comm'n, 475U.S. 1, 15 (1986).  And once again, FDA proposes to set the government on acourse which could only be deemed constitutional by the reversal ofwell-established Supreme Court case law-- without regard to, or evenreference to, that law.</tt><p><tt>	A similar sort of analysis-- or deliberate nonanalysis--occurs with sufficient frequency in the FDA proposals that a basic principleembodied in the FDA proposals may be gleaned:  when speech of cigarettecompanies is concerned, anything goes. </tt><p><tt>	How else can one explain FDA's justification of its proposals on theground that cigarette advertising "conflicts" with "the anti-smokingmessages issued by Federal and State authorities" (60 Fed. Reg. 41,356) and"overwhelms the government's health messages" (id. at 41,329)?  It couldhardly be clearer that "the concept that government may restrict the speech ofsome elements of our society in order to enhance the relative voice of othersis wholly foreign to the First Amendment."  Buckleyv.Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 48-49 (1976) (per curiam).  See alsoFirst Nat'l Bankv. Bellotti, 435 U.S. 765, 791 (1978) ("thepeople in our democracy are entrusted with the responsibility for judging andevaluating the relative merits of conflicting arguments").  The propositionthat material which is at least presumptively protected by the First Amendmentcan be "stringently" regulated for the purpose of increasing the impact of agovernment message makes the threat to the First Amendment posed byFDA's proposals all the more self-evident.</tt>"6" [5<p>	Equally cavalier in its disregard of basic First Amendment law is FDA'sdefense of banning all cigarette advertising utilizing images and colors on theground that the line-drawingnecessary to fashion a more narrowly tailored restriction is too "difficult"(60 Fed. Reg. 41,335) and presents too many "complexities" (]<tt>id.at 41,336).  This, too, must be a position crafted for cigarette companiesonly.  As the Supreme Court repeatedly has stated, "the free flow of commercialinformation is valuable enough to justify imposing on would-beregulators the costs of distinguishing the truthful from the false, the helpfulfrom the harmful."  Zauderer v. Office of Disciplinary Counsel,471 U.S. 626, 646 (1985).  Accord Ibanez v. Florida Bd. ofAccountancy, 114 S. Ct. 2084, 2089 (1994) (quoting same).</tt><p><tt>	It is not as if the scope of the new regulations is ambiguous.  That theregulations, if adopted, would all but ban cigarette advertising should beindisputable.  The FDA's own summary of the proposal is more than a littleeuphemistic:  far from merely "limit[ing] advertising and labeling to whichchildren and adolescents are exposed", (60 Fed. Reg. 41,314)</tt>"7" [6 the regulations would effectively bar cigaretteadvertising directed at adults.  <p>	The scope of the regulations tells the story.  All cigarette advertising wouldbe banned in any media other than "permissible outlets" such as newspapers,magazines, periodicals and billboards ([[section]]897.30(a)).  Those"outlets" would, in turn, be liable to criminal prosecution and the entry ofcivil injunctions if they publish any cigarette advertisements other than oneswith text only-- with the text itself in black on a white background andthe advertisement containing a second warning statement in addition to thecurrent Surgeon General's warning and the phrase "CIGARETTES-- A NICOTINEDELIVERY DEVICE" ([[section]]897.32).7<p>	The advertising that would be permitted would thus be, at one and the sametime, dull and grim.  As the Supreme Court has remarked on the impact of ananalogous restriction, "an advertising diet limited to such spartan fare wouldprovide scant nourishment."  ]<tt>Batesv. State Bar,433 U.S. 350, 367 (1977) (rejecting argument that attorneys could be limited toadvertising their names and addresses in phone books).  By leaving cigaretteadvertisers unable to break through visual clutter, catch consumers' attentionor distinguish one brand from another, the regulations' effect-- theirobviously intended effect-- would be tantamount to a complete ban, makingcigarette brand advertising ineffective and ultimately nonexistent.</tt><p><tt>	But once again, there is First Amendment law that FDA ignores.  As theSupreme Court has made clear, a state "may claim no substantial interest inrestricting truthful and nondeceptive [commercial] solicitations to those leastlikely to be read by the recipient."  Shaperov. Kentucky BarAss'n, 486 U.S. 466, 479 (1988).</tt><p><tt>	But that is precisely what these regulations seek to do.  What else can besaid of the proposed regulation ([[section]]897.30(b)) which would banall outdoor advertising within 1,000 feet-- over three footballfields in every direction-- from any playground or school?  In Seattle,to take one example, the effect would be to ban outdoor advertising in 87.7percent of the city (under a broad definition of "playground").  Even if theregulation applied only to areas within 1000 feet of schools, the effect wouldbe to ban advertising in 83 percent of the city's land area.  In Manhattan, tocite another example, 94.8 percent of the city would be off-limitsto outdoor advertising-- 88.4 percent if the regulation applied to areassurrounding schools only.  In Boston, 90 percent of the city's land area wouldbe off-limits--82 percent if the ban applied only to schools.  The 1,000-footrule seems particularly gratuitous in view of the fact that it would banadvertising that FDA, by virtue of its proposed text-onlyrequirement, already has stripped of the features FDA deems make it appealingto young people.  See 60 Fed. Reg. 41,336 (text-onlylimitation would "effectively reduce the appeal of tobacco products to childrenand adolescents").</tt><p><tt>	Or consider the limitation to black text on a white background of logos orbrand names on race cars and driver uniforms-- the only logos and brandnames on those uniforms so limited([[section]][[section]]897.30(a)(2)&amp; 897.32).  And the totalban the regulations would impose on brand-name sponsorships of all sporting andcultural events ([[section]]897.34(c)).  And the ban on the use oftobacco brand names on nontobacco products such as T-shirts, caps and lighters([[section]]897.34(a)); and the ban on the use of brand names associatedwith nontobacco products on any tobacco product([[section]]897.16(a)).</tt><p><tt>	*      *      *</tt><p><tt>	The unbridled sweep of these restrictions is in no manner tailored totheir supposed aim.  FDA asserts that their purpose is to reduce by "roughlyhalf" the use of tobacco by children and adolescents in seven years "withoutaffecting informational messages conveyed to adults."  60 Fed. Reg. 41,315-16. But this is pure sophistry-- and unconstitutional sophistry at that.  Noclaim has been made by FDA that the overwhelming majority of individuals whonow see the advertisements that the regulations would ban or restrict arechildren; they are, of course, adults.  Nor can FDA seriously quarrel with thereality that by so severely limiting the placement and the nature of"informational messages" that advertise tobacco products to adults, thosemessages will no longer reach them.  That result, as we demonstrate in thismemorandum, is itself unconstitutional.  So, as we also show, is the verynotion of dealing with the genuine problem of smoking by youths not by seekingto prevent them from buying cigarettes, but by criminalizing protected speechabout cigarettes.</tt><p><tt>	It is, in a sense, ironic that these regulations should be proposed soshortly after the Federal Trade Commission, after a lengthy study of the JoeCamel advertising campaign, determined (as the majority of the FTC put it)that:</tt><p><tt>	"Although it may seem intuitive to some that the Joe Camel advertisingcampaign would lead more children to smoke or lead children to smoke more, theevidence to support that intuition is not there....  TheCommission has spent a great deal of time and effort reviewing the difficultfactual and legal questions raised by this case, including a comprehensivereview of relevant studies and statistics.  Because the evidence in the recorddoes not provide reason to believe that the law has been violated, we cannotissue a complaint.</tt><p><p><tt>	"If intuition and concern for children's health were a sufficient basisunder the law for bringing a case, we have no doubt that a unanimous Commissionwould have taken that action long ago.  The dispositive issue here, however,was whether the record showed a link between the Joe Camel advertising campaignand increased smoking among children, not whether smoking has an effect onchildren or whether the health of children is important.  Indeed, our concernabout the health of children led us to consider every possible avenue to alawsuit before reaching today's decision."  R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co.,FTC File No.9323162 (released June7, 1994) (joint statementof Commissioners Azcuenaga, Owen, Starek).  </tt><p><p><tt>Despite this determination, the Joe Camel advertisements are repeatedlycited as a basis for the regulations-- as if there had been no FTCconsideration of the matter at all.</tt>"15" [8<p>	In fact, much of what FDA has proposed reads as if no serious First Amendmentconsideration at all was given to the regulations-- as if, that is, lawthat binds FDA and the rest of the government in all other areas simply doesnot bind it at all when speech of tobacco companies is involved.  It is atruism that regrettably needs repeating that what the government is permittedto do today to cigarette advertising, it may do tomorrow to other forms ofadvertising.  And that what government may do today to advertising in the nameof altering "attitudes" and notions of what is "socially acceptable,"government may do tomorrow to speech that does not comprise advertising atall.<p>]<h1>I.	THE PROPOSED REGULATIONS UNCONSTITUTIONALLY</h1><tt><b>	DEPRIVE ADULTS OF ACCESS TO ADVERTISING IN A</b></tt><p><tt><b>	MANNER WHICH UNCONSTITUTIONALLYDISCRIMINATES</b></tt><p><tt><b>	ON THE BASIS OF VIEWPOINT                    </b></tt><p><p><tt>	At the heart of FDA's defense of its proposed regulations is the notionthat they are constitutional because they are intended to prevent children fromsmoking.  No governmental interest is asserted in support of depriving adultsof access to the cigarette advertisements.  In fact, the regulations are saidto have been drafted in an effort to ensure that adults do not lose theinformation conveyed by the advertisements.  See 60 Fed. Reg. 41,335;41,336.</tt><p><tt>	But since the regulations limit speech that is primarily seen by adults,they do just that.  It has long been plain that "[t]he use of illustrations orpictures in advertisements serves important communicative functions:  itattracts the attention of the audience to the advertiser's message, and it mayalso serve to impart information directly.  Accordingly, commercialillustrations are entitled to the First Amendment protections afforded verbalcommercial speech."  Zaudererv. Office of DisciplinaryCounsel, 471 U.S. 626, 647 (1985).</tt>"16" [9Yet the regulations mount a frontal attack on just such material.<p>	In doing so, they ignore the long-standing First Amendment principle that arestriction on speech that is promulgated in the service of protecting childrenmust be narrowly tailored so as not to infringe upon the rights of adults.]<tt>Butlerv. Michigan, 352 U.S. 380, 383-84(1957).  As Butler concludes, in language much quoted through the years,the government may not "reduce the adult population ... to readingonly what is fit for children."  Id. at 383.</tt><p><tt>	It has thus long been established that the government may not prevent thegeneral public from reading or having access to materials solely on the groundthat the materials would be objectionable if read or seen by children.Id.; Sable Communications, Inc.v. FCC, 492 U.S. 115(1989).  This principle applies with equal force to commercial speech as itdoes to other types of protected speech.  Bolgerv. Youngs DrugProds. Corp., 463 U.S. 60, 71-72 (1983).</tt><p><tt>	The government may restrict speech in the service of protecting childrenonly in the most limited circumstances and only after the most exacting reviewto ensure that adults have sufficient access to the speech under consideration.As in Butler, the cases that have followed in this area deal invariablywith laws enacted in the service of protecting children from sexually orientedmaterials and indecent expression.</tt>"21" [10The obscenity and indecency restrictions at issue in these cases were aimed atspeech considered to be harmful in itself-- speech believed to coarsen,corrupt and harm minors simply by virtue of being heard or seen.<p>	Because the speech at issue in those cases was said to be a source of directharm (and because the speech itself, in many of these cases, lay at the outeredges of the First Amendment's protections), courts struck a balance in thesecases in favor of limiting children's access to indecent speech to whateverextent they could without burdening adult access.  By contrast, FDA's proposedrestrictions are ]<tt>not aimed at speech considered to be harmfulin itself but rather at speech that FDA claims has the effect of promotingharmful conduct; and the speech in question is not at the margin but enjoyssubstantial First Amendment protection.  The purpose of FDA's proposedrestrictions is not to prevent any harm that occurs the instant the proscribedspeech comes into the view of minors; it is to prevent harm that is caused onlyif and when a young reader heeds the call to action claimed to be urged by thespeech.</tt><p><tt>	Thus, unlike regulations of X-rated movies or sexually oriented magazines,the regulation of cigarette advertising does not strike directly at theperceived problem-- in this case, cigarette smoking by underage people.Instead, the regulations seek to inhibit the undesirable activity indirectly,by shielding minors from expression that supposedly makes smoking appealing.That sort of regulation is constitutionally impermissible.</tt><p><tt>	The teaching of Butler and its progeny is that the constitutionallysanctioned way to deal with a perceived harm to children from written materialsis to address the harm directly, using the least speech-restrictive meansavailable.  352 U.S. at383.  Thus, in cases dealing with obscene orindecent speech, where it is the very sight of the speech that is deemedharmful to a youthful audience, access to such speech may be restricted toadults.  And in the most extreme of cases dealing with child pornography, wherethe very publication necessarily involves the exploitation of the childrenshown in the film, the speech may be proscribed at its source.  NewYorkv. Ferber, 458 U.S. 747 (1982).</tt>"31" [11  In each instance the appropriate response isto go to the source of the harm and to deal with it directly.  Thus, where, ashere, the perceived harm lies not in the speech itself but in the activitybelieved to be urged by the speech, the most direct and leastspeech-restrictive manner to alleviate the harm is to regulate the harm at itssource by restricting children from purchasing tobacco.  It is far fromimpossible to do.  Here, as in ]<tt>Butler, there already existmyriad laws which criminalize the sale of that which FDA seeks to keep out ofthe hands of minors.  Better enforcement of those laws and the adoption, ifnecessary, of additional laws of the same sort raise no First Amendmentproblems.  But there is no constitutional justification for a far broaderproscription against speech itself.  The seminal ruling of the Supreme Court inCareyv. Population Services, 431 U.S. 678 (1977), discussedearlier, makes the point even more clearly.</tt><p><tt>	As with the advertisements for contraceptives at issue in Carey,there is absolutely no constitutionally justifiable basis for restrictingcigarette advertising directed at adults for the purpose of avoiding the"legitimization" of smoking in the eyes of children.  It is simply outside therealm of the permissible exercise of government power to suppress speech forthe purpose of instilling values the government believes are appropriate.See Kingsley Int'l Pictures Corp.v. Regents ofUniversity, 360 U.S. 684, 688-89(1959).  Yet that, in the end, is what FDA's proposals are all about.According to FDA:</tt><p><tt>	"Tobacco product brand names, logos, and advertising messages arepervasive, appearing on billboards, on buses and trains, in magazines andnewspapers, and on clothing and other goods.  These ubiquitous images andmessages convey to young people that tobacco use is desirable, sociallyacceptable, safe, healthy, and prevalent in society."  60 Fed. Reg. 41,315.</tt><p><p><tt>And:</tt><p><tt>	"The pervasiveness and magnitude of the labeling and advertising for theseproducts create an atmosphere of `friendly familiarity' that affects and shapesa young person's views towards tobacco products."  Id.at41,329.</tt>"38" [12 <p><p>And so forth.<p>	The very notion that cigarette advertising may be restricted because itlegitimizes or favorably "shapes a young person's views toward tobaccoproducts" is precisely what the Supreme Court rejected in ]<tt>Careyas a basis for regulation.  It is no basis at all for overcoming FirstAmendment protections.</tt><p><tt>	There is another way to characterize, in well-established First Amendmentterms, FDA's proposal.  What FDA seeks to do is based upon nothing more or lessthan viewpoint discrimination:  smoking, FDA claims, must be made sociallyunacceptable.  To accomplish that end, FDA seeks to regulate "stringently" whatwould otherwise be constitutionally protected speech.  That is precisely whatthe First Amendment does not allow.</tt><p><tt>	In R.A.V.v. City of St. Paul, 505 U.S. 377 (1992), theSupreme Court held that even those regulations that are limited in their reachto cover only traditionally "unprotected" or lesser protected categories ofspeech must undergo a heightened strict scrutiny analysis when theydiscriminate on the basis of viewpoint.  The Court held facially invalid inthat case an ordinance prohibiting bias-motivated disorderly conduct because itimposed special prohibitions on those speakers who expressed disfavored viewson the subjects of "race, color, creed, religion or gender."  Id.at391.  The Court reasoned that even traditionally unprotected "fightingwords" could not be selectively silenced on the basis of the underlying messageexpressed.  Id.  The Court also made clear that the same strict scrutinyanalysis would also apply to other categories of speech which customarilyreceive lesser protection, expressly including commercial speech regulationsthat go beyond mere content regulation to actual viewpoint discrimination.Id. at 388-89.</tt><p><tt>	The effect of the FDA regulations would be to suppress truthful speechpromoting particular brands of cigarettes, while permitting, and evencompelling, speech which disparages all smoking.  The ultimate target of FDA'srestrictions is not the cigarette advertisements themselves, but the underlyingsocial norm-- the societal viewpoint-- that tolerates smoking andthus the advertising of cigarettes.  Indeed, FDA's regulations are themselvesunmistakably intended to send a counter-messagedenouncing the very legitimacy of cigarette smoking in American life.  Thus,restrictions against the use of imagery, color and certain media bind thecigarette companies but fall away when voices are raised against smoking, or,as the FDA's proposed regulations would require, when cigarette manufacturersthemselves are required to do so.  Critics of smoking-- including thegovernment itself-- also would remain unfettered by the restrictions,free to speak out in their efforts to persuade people not to smoke.  In sum,the regulations favor non-commercial speakers over commercial speakers,antismoking messages over messages of cigarette companies, advocates of asmoke-free society over those they disdain.  That choice of viewpoints, whenimposed by law, is irreconcilable with the First Amendment.</tt><p><h1>II.	FDA'S REQUIREMENT THAT CIGARETTE</h1><tt><b>	MANUFACTURERS FINANCE ANTISMOKING</b></tt><p><tt><b>	CAMPAIGNS COMPELS SPEECH IN</b></tt><p><tt>	<b>VIOLATION OF THE FIRST AMENDMENT</b></tt><p><p><tt>	Viewpoint discrimination by the government is one of the clearest types ofunconstitutional limitations on speech.  Just as clearly banned under the FirstAmendment is any government requirement of compelled speech.  And that, too, isa central feature of the FDA proposal.</tt><p><tt>	FDA seeks to require tobacco product manufacturers to undertake a $150million-a-year television-based antismoking campaign in order to "combat theeffects of the pervasive and positive imagery that has for decades helped tofoster a youth market for tobacco products."  60 Fed. Reg. 41,326.  Theregulations would not merely require manufacturers to publicize statementsattributed to the Surgeon General or the Secretary of Health and HumanServices, but to offer government opinions as their own.</tt><p><tt>	Once again, it is worth pausing on the nature of these requirements beforeaddressing them legally.  On its face, the notion that public self-criticismand self-abasement may be compelled by governmental fiat is, quite simply,contrary to our deepest democratic values.  It is far more reminiscent ofChairman Mao's requirements for repentant Chinese intellectuals during theCultural Revolution than it is of any American approach.  It is so plainlyunconstitutional as to cast doubt on the bona fides of the entireset of FDA's proposed regulations.</tt><h2>A.		FDA's Compelled Antismoking</h2><tt><b>		Campaign Requirement Violates</b></tt><p><tt><b>		the First Amendment                    </b></tt><p><p><tt>	The First Amendment guarantees "both the right to speak freely and theright to refrain from speaking at all."  Wooleyv. Maynard,430 U.S. 705, 714 (1977).  "Mandating speech that a speaker would not otherwisemake necessarily alters the content of the speech."  Rileyv.National Fed'n of the Blind, 487 U.S. 781, 795 (1988).</tt><p><tt>	The First Amendment protection against compelled speech applies tocommercial speech of corporations as well as to the speech of individuals."For corporations as for individuals," the Supreme Court stated in PacificGas and Elec. Co.v. Public Util. Comm'n, 475 U.S. 1 (1986),"the choice to speak includes within it the choice of what not to say."Id. at 16 (citing Miami Herald Publishing Co.v.Tornillo, 418 U.S. 241, 258 (1974)).  Because </tt><p><tt>"`[t]he essential thrust of the First Amendment is to prohibit improperrestraints on the voluntary public expression ofideas....  There is necessarily... aconcomitant freedom not to speak publicly, one which serves the sameultimate end as freedom of speech in its affirmative aspect.'"  </tt><p><p><tt>Pacific Gas, 475 U.S. at 11 (quoting Harper&amp; RowPublishers, Inc.v. Nation Enterprises, 471 U.S. 524, 559(1985) (quoting Estate of Hemingwayv. Random House, 23N.Y.2d 341, 348 (1968))).</tt><p><tt>	The Supreme Court's decision in Pacific Gas is controlling.  InPacific Gas, the Court held unconstitutional a state regulationrequiring a privately owned utility company to include in its monthly billingenvelopes messages of a consumer organization with which the utility disagreed.Even though the regulation required a disclaimer stating that the message wasnot endorsed by the company, the Court held that the order impermissiblyrequired the company to "assist in disseminating the speaker's message" or to"associate with speech with which [it] may disagree."  Id.at 15."Compelled access like that ordered in this case both penalizes the expressionof particular points of view and forces speakers to alter their speech toconform with an agenda they do not set."  Id. at 9.  Acorporation,the Court stated, "does not, of course, have the right to be free from vigorousdebate.  But it does have the right to be free from governmentrestrictions that abridge its own rights in order to `enhance the relativevoice' of its opponents."  Id. at 14 (quoting Buckleyv.Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 49 &amp; n.55 (1976)).</tt><p><tt>	As Pacific Gas thus demonstrates, the assertion in the regulationsthat they are based on FDA's "concerns" that "the amount of advertising, itsattractive imagery, and the fact that it appears in so many forums, overwhelmsthe government's health messages" (60 Fed. Reg. 41,329) is a whollyinsufficient-- and unconstitutional-- basis for their adoption.  Sotoo is FDA's professed desire to "reduce the conflict between the anti-smokingmessages issued by Federal and State authorities and the pro-tobacco messagesseen in advertising."  60 Fed. Reg. 41,356.</tt><p><tt>	Compelling a private corporation to provide a forum for opposingviewpoints similarly infringes the corporation's freedom of speech.  InTornillo, the Court held unconstitutional a Florida law that providedthat where a newspaper assailed a political candidate's character or record,the candidate could demand that the newspaper print a reply of equal prominenceand space.  418 U.S. at258.  The Court found that by forcing thenewspaper to disseminate opponents' views, the statute penalized thenewspapers' own expression.  Id. at256-57.  The Court concludedthat a "[g]overnment-enforcedright of access inescapably `dampens the vigor and limits the variety of publicdebate.'"  Id. at 257 (quoting New York Timesv.Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254, 279 (1964)).  The Court also cited as a basisfor its decision the fact that the statute forced the newspaper to tailor itsspeech to an opponent's agenda and to respond to candidates' arguments wherethe newspaper might prefer to be silent.  Id. at256.  This, theCourt held, was impermissible.  </tt><p><tt>	As in Pacific Gas and Tornillo, the regulations here compelexpression of a particular viewpoint chosen by the government.  They thusviolate the First Amendment, just as the regulations did in those cases.</tt><p><tt>	But the FDA requirement goes much further than the regulations struck downin those cases.  The unconstitutional regulations in those cases compelled thecompanies to serve as a vehicle for the views of political candidates and aconsumer organization.  It did not force the speakers to express those views astheir own.  Here, the regulations do just that:  they would compel cigarettemanufacturers to speak in their own voice, requiring them not just tocommunicate a governmental message, but to personally identify themselves withan antismoking viewpoint.  As the Supreme Court stated in Wooley, "wherethe State's interest is to disseminate an ideology, no matter how acceptable tosome, such interest cannot outweigh an individual's First Amendment right toavoid becoming the courier for such message."  430 U.S. at 717; seealso Central Ill. Light Co.v. Citizens Util. Bd.,827 F.2d 1169, 1173 (7th Cir. 1987) ("[C]ompanies [cannot] be made intoinvoluntary solicitors for their ideological opponents.").</tt><p><tt>	The constitutional deficiency inherent in the FDA's regulations is in noway mitigated because the antismoking messages may contain statements of fact.The First Amendment protects companies from the compelled dissemination of bothhostile ideologies and facts.  See Ibanezv. FloridaDep't of Business and Professional Regulation, 114 S. Ct. 2084 (1994)(holding that state cannot require a Certified Financial Planner ("CFP") toinclude in advertisements the (truthful) statement that CFP designation wasgranted by an organization not affiliated with government);Rileyv. National Fed'n of the Blind, 487 U.S. 781 (1988)(holding unconstitutional a state requirement that professional fundraisersdisclose the percentage of funds they paid to charities); seealso Hurleyv. Irish-AmericanGay, Lesbian&amp; Bisexual Group, 115 S. Ct. 2338, 2347 (1995)("[O]ne important manifestation of the principle of free speech is that one whochooses to speak may also decide `what not to say'... [T]hisgeneral rule ... applies not only to expressions of value, opinion,or endorsement, but equally to statements of fact the speaker would ratheravoid").</tt>"39" [13]<h2>B.	Cigarette Advertisements Are</h2><tt><b>	Not an Appropriate Target for</b></tt><p><tt>	<b>a Corrective Advertising Remedy</b></tt><p><p><tt>	FDA has sought to defend its proposed regulations by treating them as asort of "corrective advertising."  See 60 Fed. Reg. 41,326-27.  But theyare well outside the bounds of anything that has ever been socharacterized.</tt><p><tt>	As an initial matter, there is no indication that FDA has the authority toorder corrective advertising, which has long been the province of the FederalTrade Commission.  It is the FTC, not FDA, that "is the expert body todetermine what remedy is necessary to eliminate the unfair or deceptive tradepractices which have been disclosed."  Warner-Lambert Co.v.FTC, 562 F.2d 749, 762 (D.C. Cir. 1977) (quoting Jacob SiegelCo.v. FTC, 327 U.S. 608, 612-13 (1946)), cert.denied, 435 U.S. 950 (1978).  Indeed, cases in which correctiveadvertising has been ordered have involved almost exclusively the FTC, notFDA.</tt>"40" [14<p>	But even if FDA did have the authority to order corrective advertising,corrective advertising is an appropriate remedy ]<tt>only wherethere has been a finding of deceptive advertising.  That certainly isnot the case here, where what FDA wants is to alter a social climate itcontends cigarette advertising has fostered "over decades," to negate"attitudes" toward smoking the Agency claims cigarette advertising promotes andreinforces.</tt><p><tt>	Moreover, even where deception is found, corrective advertising isinappropriate if it would put the advertiser in the position of having to argueagainst its own product.</tt>"59" [15  This was theholding of the court in ]<tt>National Comm'n on EggNutritionv. FTC, 570 F.2d 157, 160 (7th Cir. 1977),cert. denied, 439 U.S. 821 (1978), where the court held that anegg industry group was not required to state that numerous medical expertsbelieved that increased consumption of eggs may increase the risk of heartdisease.  The court reasoned that requiring the egg group to "argue the otherside of the controversy" would "interfer[e] unnecessarily with the effectivepresentation of the pro-egg position."  Id. at 164.  Applying thatreasoning here, cigarette manufacturers certainly may not be required to arguethe "other" side of the current controversy over smoking.</tt><p><tt>	The "corrective advertising" defense of the FDA's proposed regulations isno defense at all.  The regulations violate the First Amendment in a mannerthat is as stark as it is indefensible.</tt><p><h1>III.	THE PROPOSED REGULATIONS ARE AN UNJUSTIFIED</h1><tt><b>	AND IMPERMISSIBLE RESTRICTION ON COMMERCIAL</b></tt><p><tt><b>	SPEECH WHICH VIOLATES THE FIRST AMENDMENT   </b></tt><p><p><tt>	We have thus far addressed constitutional deficiencies of the proposed FDAregulations which are not dependent upon any legal principles relating to thecommercial nature of cigarette advertising.  Although the speech in cases suchas Carey and Pacific Gas is commercial in nature, more generalFirst Amendment case law was applied to conclude that the conduct at issue wasunconstitutional.  So too here.  Without regard to commercial speech principlesat all, the regulations fail on First Amendment grounds.  This section of thismemorandum demonstrates that they fail, as well, under the standard applicationof the law relating to commercial speech.  </tt><p><tt>	The First Amendment protection of commercial speech is far moresubstantial than FDA has recognized.  According to the FDA submission insupport of the regulations, commercial speech was "traditionally" provided noFirst Amendment protection and now receives only "limited" constitutionalprotection.  60 Fed. Reg. 41,353.  That crabbed articulation falls far short ofacknowledging the Supreme Court's most recent description, inRubinv. Coors Brewing Co., 115 S. Ct. 1585 (1995), of thehistory and nature of First Amendment protection of commercial speech.  Assummarized by the Court:</tt><p><tt>"Though we once took the position that the First Amendment does not protectcommercial speech, see Valentinev. Chrestensen, 316 U.S. 52 (1942), werepudiated that position in Virginia State Bd. of Pharmacyv. VirginiaCitizens Consumer Council, Inc., 425 U.S. 748 (1976).  There we noted that thefree flow of commercial information is `indispensable to the proper allocationof resources in a free enterprise system' because it informs the numerousprivate decisions that drive the system.  Id., at 765.  Indeed, weobserved that a `particular consumer's interest in the free flow of commercialinformation ... may be as keen, if not keener by far, than hisinterest in the day's most urgent political debate.'  Id., at763.</tt><p><p><tt>	"Still, Virginia Board of Pharmacy suggested that certain types ofrestrictions might be tolerated in the commercial speech area because of thenature of such speech.  See id., at 771-772, n. 24.  In laterdecisions we gradually articulated a test based on "`the `commonsense'distinction between speech proposing a commercial transaction, which occurs inan area traditionally subject to government regulation, and other varieties ofspeech.'"  Central Hudson Gas &amp; Electric Corp.v. PublicServ. Comm'n of N.Y., 447 U.S. 557, 562 (1980) (quotingOhralikv. Ohio State Bar Assn., 436 U.S. 447, 455-456(1978))."</tt><p><p><tt>Coors, 115 S. Ct. at 1589.</tt><p><tt>	The Court's seminal opinion in Virginia State Board of Pharmacy iswell worth the emphasis recently given it by the court in Coors.  In it,Justice Blackmun spelled out the interests vindicated by protection ofcommercial speech.  It was not only the public interest "in the free flow ofcommercial information" but the proposition that, "[s]o long as we preserve apredominantly free enterprise economy, the allocation of our resources in largemeasure will be made through numerous private economic decisions."  425 U.S. at764-65. And it was the concept that those decisions are not only not forgovernment to make but that the constitutional protection of commercial speechis itself bottomed upon the concept that "information is not in itself harmful,that people will perceive their own best interests if only they are well enoughinformed, and that the best means to that end is to open the channels ofcommunications rather than to close them."  Id. at 770.</tt><p><tt>	The "commonsense distinctions" between commercial and other varieties ofspeech have long been recognized.  See, e.g., CentralHudson, 447 U.S. at 562; Virginia Bd. of Pharmacy, 425 U.S. at 771n.24.  Because an advertiser presumably knows about its product, it is often ina position to verify the truth of its assertions, and since commercialadvertisements are motivated by commercial profits, they are less likely to bechilled by regulation.  See, e.g., Central Hudson,447 U.S. at 564 n.6; Virginia Bd. of Pharmacy, 425 U.S. at 771 n.24.  Asa consequence, it is "less necessary to tolerate inaccurate statements for fearof silencing the speaker."  Virginia Bd. of Pharmacy, 425 U.S. at 771n.24.  Further, because commercial speech is linked to the transaction itproposes, "the State's interest in regulating the underlying transaction maygive it a concomitant interest in the expression itself."Edenfieldv. Fane, 113 S. Ct. 1792, 1798 (1993).  As aconsequence, commercial speech receives, at times, less protection than otherforms of speech.</tt><p><tt>	But the protection commercial speech receives remains substantial.Contrary to FDA's suggestion that courts will "defer to the `common-sensejudgments'" of regulatory agencies "as long as they are not unreasonable" (60Fed. Reg. 41,354, citing Metromedia, Inc.v. City of SanDiego, 453 U.S. 490, 509 (1981)), the Supreme Court recently made clearthat when considering governmental limitations on commercial speech, courts arenot to apply "mere rational basis review"-- a legal test applied toconstitutional challenges to most statutes or regulations which leads courts todefer to virtually any "rational" legislative judgment.Cincinnativ. Discovery Network, Inc., 113 S. Ct. 1505, 1510n.13 (1993).  The review actually applied, though somewhat less exacting thanthe strict scrutiny routinely applied to regulations of political speech, isnonetheless demanding.  Unless the speech in question is misleading or relatesto an unlawful activity, the government's power to suppress commercial speechis severely circumscribed.  See, e.g., CentralHudson, 447 U.S. at 564.  "The State must assert a substantial interest tobe achieved by restrictions on commercial speech."  Id.  Therestrictions "must be designed carefully to achieve the State's goal."Id.  If the government's regulation does not directly advance itsinterest or if it suppresses more speech than is reasonably necessary, theregulation violates the First Amendment and is unconstitutional.</tt>"68" [16  That, as we show throughout this memorandum,is the constitutional reality that leads inexorably to the conclusion thatthese regulations cannot begin to pass First Amendment muster.17]<h2>A.		Cigarette Advertisements Are Entitled</h2><tt><b>		to First Amendment Protection        </b></tt><p><p><tt>	That cigarette advertisements are protected by the First Amendment is notdisputed by FDA.  60 Fed. Reg. 41,354.  There is no suggestion in the proposedregulations that the targeted advertisements are false, deceptive ormisleading.  Id.  Nor is there any suggestion that they propose anillegal transaction.  Id.18  Rather, their overriding vice according toFDA is simply that their images and messages are "pervasive" and "convey toyoung people that tobacco use is desirable, socially acceptable, safe, healthy,and prevalent in society."  Id. at 41,315.</tt>"89" [19  <p>	Because FDA cannot and has not even attempted to show that tobaccoadvertisements are outside the scope of First Amendment protection, it mustbear an exceptionally heavy burden of proof with respect to the other elementsof the ]<tt>Central Hudson test in order to justify the proposedregulations' restrictions.  Coors, 115 S.Ct. at 1592;Ibanez, 114 S.Ct. at 2089; Edenfield, 113 S.Ct. at1800; Cincinnati, 113 S.Ct. at 1510.  See alsoZaudererv. Office of Disciplinary Counsel, 471 U.S. 626, 641(1985); Bolgerv. Youngs Drug Prods. Corp., 463 U.S. at 71n.20.  But as will be seen, FDA cannot begin to meet that burden.</tt><h2>B.		FDA's Asserted Interest</h2><tt><b>		Is Not Plainly Substantial    </b></tt><p><p><tt>	FDA broadly articulates the interest it seeks to advance by means of itsproposed restrictions on advertising as protecting public health by helpingprevent young people from starting to smoke.  60 Fed. Reg. 41,354.  In anattempt to portray this interest and the regulations proposed in its service asreasonable, FDA offers its reassurance that it seeks to accomplish thisobjective "without affecting the informational message conveyed to adults" andwhile "preserv[ing] [adults'] access" to tobacco products.  Id. at41,335.  See Butler, 352 U.S. at 383 (recognizing overridingFirst Amendment interests of adults vis-&agrave;-vis limitations onspeech in service of minors).  FDA's articulated interestin protectingminors from physical harm clearly is substantial.  See Sable, 492U.S. at 126 (recognizing a "compelling interest in protecting the physical andpsychological well-being of minors"). </tt><p><tt>	This, however, is hardly an interest directly served by the regulations.Notwithstanding FDA's citation to the goal of protecting health, the only aimthese regulations can be said to serve in any direct way is that ofhelping to delegitimize smoking.  The regulations strive to acculturatecitizens to abandon the notion that smoking is socially acceptable and toembrace the ideals of a smoke-free society.  This shift in the nation'scollective consciousness is sought to be accomplished by preventing cigaretteadvertising from presenting any depiction of smoking in a positive light, as apleasurable experience, and by confining brand advertising to black and white"tombstone" text, while simultaneously requiring sophisticatedcounteradvertising to "reverse the image appeal" and "combat the effects of thepervasive and positive imagery" that has been associated with cigarette smoking"for decades."  60 Fed. Reg. 41,326.  Whatever the motivation of thispaternalistic campaign to alter consciousness,</tt>"110" [20 the government's interest in delegitimizinga lawful product by restricting truthful speech and otherwise manipulating thepublic's information flow cannot even be deemed a legitimate, let alone asubstantial one.  ]<tt>See supra.</tt><h2>C.		The Proposed Regulations Do Not Directly</h2><tt><b>		Advance the State's Asserted Interest in</b></tt><p><tt><b>		Preventing Children from Beginning To Smoke</b></tt><p><p><tt>	FDA's burden affirmatively to demonstrate the direct advancement ofits goals has repeatedly and ever more forcefully been emphasized by theSupreme Court in recent years:  "mere speculation or conjecture" or conclusorystatements of government officials will not do.  Ibanez, 114 S. Ct. at2089; Edenfield, 113 S. Ct. at 1800.  "[R]ather, a governmental bodyseeking to sustain a restriction on commercial speech must demonstrate that theharms it receives are real and that its restriction will in fact alleviate themto a material degree."  Edenfield, 113 S. Ct. at 1800.  AccordCincinnativ. Discovery Network, 113 S. Ct. at 1514-16.Most recently, the Supreme Court emphasized in Coors that therequirement that the government justify its statute with real evidence "wascritical."  115 S. Ct. at 1592.</tt><p><tt>	FDA has failed to come close to satisfying its burden.  It endeavors tojustify its restrictions with the conclusion "that stringent restrictions onadvertising are essential if smoking by adolescents is to be reduced."  60 Fed.Reg. 41,334.  In support, FDA cites its finding "that the preponderance ofquantitative and qualitative studies of cigarette advertising suggests:(1)A causal relationship between advertising and youth smoking behavior,and (2)a positive effect of stringent advertising measures on smokingrates and on youth smoking."  Id.  Bald administrative findings such asthese cannot satisfy the government's burden.  Edenfield, 113S.Ct. at 1800-01.</tt><p><tt>	Determining whether the regulations "directly advance" the FDA'sarticulated goal requires close focus on the relationship between the interestsasserted and the regulations' prohibition on truthful speech.  CentralHudson Gas &amp; Elec. Corp.v. Public Serv. Comm'n, 447 U.S.at 569.  In order for the regulations to be sustained, there must be an"immediate connection" between the prohibition and the government's assertedends.  Id.  If the means-ends connection is tenuous, that is,"[i]neffective or remote," the regulations cannot survive constitutionalscrutiny.  Id. at 564, 569.  Courts "review with special careregulations that entirely suppress commercial speech in order to pursue anonspeech-related policy."  Central Hudson, 447 U.S. at 566 n.9;see also, e.g., City of Los Angelesv.Preferred Communications, Inc., 476 U.S. 488, 496 (1986).  Here, ofcourse, the policies of delegitimizing smoking and reducing its incidence amongyoung people have nothing to do with any speech-related policy, such as curingfalse, misleading or deceptive advertising.  It has to do with changingperceptions and, FDA hopes, behavior. </tt><p><tt>	Passing the efficacy of the studies momentarily, FDA's mere "suggestion"that there exists "a causal relationship between advertising and youthsmoking" hardly amounts in any event to real evidence that the proposedrestrictions "will in fact alleviate [the problem of youth smoking] to amaterial degree."  Edenfield, 113 S. Ct. at 1800.  FDA has presented noreliable evidence demonstrating either that the "pervasiveness" of cigaretteadvertising harms minors by causing them to take up smoking in the first place,or that its restrictions on advertising will "directly advance" FDA's statedgoal of preventing young people from starting to smoke while preservinginformation about cigarettes for adults.</tt><h3>1.		The Asserted Harm Has Not Been Shown</h3><tt><b>			To Be Real:  Cigarette Advertisements</b></tt><p><tt><b>			Do Not Cause Minors To Take up Smoking</b></tt><p><p><tt>	As a threshold matter, FDA has the burden of showing that the recitedharms are real, and not merely conjectural.  Edenfield, 113 S. Ct. at1800.  Without evidence of real harm, the FDA's efforts to protect children areunwarranted and its restrictions cannot withstand scrutiny.  See,e.g., Home Box Office, Inc.v. FCC, 567 F.2d9, 36 (D.C. Cir. 1977) ("[A] regulation perfectly reasonable and appropriate inthe face of a given problem may be highly capricious if that problem does notexist."), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 829 (1977).  While FDA claimsrepeatedly that cigarette advertising is a significant influence on smokinginitiation by adolescents, it is utterly unable to demonstrate by real evidencethat is so.</tt><p><tt>	To begin with, FDA does not claim that cigarette advertising is thecause of youth smoking or that it is even the predominant reason that minorstake up smoking.  Instead, FDA has acknowledged that "[m]any behavioral andpersonal characteristics influence an adolescent's decision to use cigarettesor smokeless tobacco products, including:  rebelliousness; risk-takingpersonality; use of other legal or illegal drugs; belief in the perceivedutility of smoking (to cope with stress, control weight, or improve one'sself-image); low self-esteem or depression; disbelief of or discounting healthrisks; and poor academic achievement."  60 Fed. Reg. 41,330 (footnoteomitted).</tt>"111" [21<p>	Cigarette advertising and promotional activities, the Agency furtheracknowledges, at most merely "contribute to the multiple and convergentpsychosocial influences that lead children and youths to begin using theseproducts."  ]<tt>Id. at 41,329 (quoting Institute of Medicine Reportp.131).  The precise nature and extent of this "contributory" influencethe FDA attributes to cigarette advertising is never defined or explainedbeyond FDA's amorphous references to the "friendly familiarity" cigarette adspurportedly engender.  See note12, supra.  What remains isnothing other than FDA's vague psychosocial guesswork.  But this falls farshort of proof by real evidence that the alleged "pervasiveness" of tobaccoadvertising amounts to a real harm visited upon minors--i.e., that it causes them to begin smoking.  See,e.g., Edenfield, 113 S. Ct. at 1800.</tt><p><tt>	FDA's inability even to begin to demonstrate such a causal relationshipshould come as no surprise.  The very ad campaign cited by FDA (60 Fed. Reg.41,333) as providing "compelling evidence that promotional campaigns can beextremely effective with young people"-- the "Joe Camel" campaign--has already been reviewed by the Federal Trade Commission, the agencyspecifically charged with prosecuting unfair advertising, and was found notguilty of causing children to smoke.  Antismoking advocates insist that if everthere were a case to be made that cigarette advertising can be so appealing andso seductive in the eyes of children as to cause them to begin smoking, thiswas it.  And yet last year the FTC concluded after a searching and"comprehensive" three-year investigation of the "Joe Camel" advertisingcampaign that the purported link between cigarette advertising and underagesmoking is no more than mere speculation which is not supported by any realevidence.</tt><p><tt>	After "consider[ing] every possible avenue to a lawsuit" to ban the ads, amajority of FTC commissioners concluded that "[a]lthough it may seem intuitiveto some that the Joe Camel advertising campaign would lead more children tosmoke more, the evidence to support that intuition is not there."R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., F.T.C. Release (statement of CommissionersAzcuenaga, Owen and Starek) (emphasis added) (the "FTC Release").  The FTCreached this conclusion only after "spen[ding] a great deal of time and effortreviewing the difficult factual and legal questions raised by th[e] case,including a comprehensive review of the relevant studies and statistics."Id.22  As one commentator has noted, "it was the law that won theday"-- the FTC realized that it could not withstand a First Amendmentchallenge to a ban on the Joe Camel ads.</tt>"112" [23  FDA should heed the determination of theFTC.  Because many of the studies cited by FDA in support of its regulationshave already been put to the test by the FTC, the FTC proceedings areparticularly instructive.<p>	Joe Camel advertisements first appeared in 1988.  The FTC issued its proposedcomplaint to R.J. Reynolds ("Reynolds") seeking to prohibit Reynolds fromcontinuing the Joe Camel advertising campaign in 1991.  In its complaint, theFTC alleged that the Joe Camel advertising campaign was so appealing to minorsthat it caused "many" of them to begin smoking and that Reynolds "knew orshould have known" the ads would have such appeal.  Proposed complaint[[paragraph]][[paragraph]]5-6.<p>	In response, Reynolds submitted a factual statement with appendices (the"Reynolds White Paper") rebutting the FTC's allegation that the Joe Camel adsin particular, and cigarette advertisements generally, caused minors to beginsmoking.24  The evidence consisted primarily of private andgovernment-sponsored studies which showed that the decision to smoke is basedon factors other than advertising.  The actual determinants of underage smokingbehavior, the studies found, were the smoking behavior of family and friendsand perceptions of the risks and benefits of smoking--]<tt>not cigarette advertisements.  Other empirical evidence beforethe FTC included its own earlier findings on the negligible impact of cigaretteadvertising; the findings of the President's Council of EconomicAdvisors</tt>"113" [25; former Surgeon GeneralKoop's finding that no causal link had been shown between cigaretteadvertisements and smoking26; the findings of the Canadian courts in an actionchallenging the legality of Canada's ban on cigarette advertising27; andeconometric survey and demographic evidence.  ]<tt>See ReynoldsWhite Paper.  </tt><p><tt>	Nearly a year after receiving Reynolds' factual materials, the FTC issueda press release stating that it had closed its investigation of a possibleviolation of the Federal Trade Commission Act through the use of unfairadvertising practices and had determined that "no further action [was]warranted."  FTC Release, supra p.IX-11. In a separate joint statement, the majority of Commissioners who voted toclose the investigation stated that "[a]lthough it is unusual to comment on ourreasons for taking such action, we have decided to explain our decision inlight of the statements of our dissenting colleagues and the widespread publicinterest the matter has generated."  Id.  After stating, as quotedabove, that there exists no evidence to support the "intuition" that attractivecigarette advertisements lead children to smoke, the Commissioners concludedthat "[b]ecause the evidence in the record does not provide reason to believethat the law has been violated, we cannot issue a complaint."Id.</tt><p><tt>	The Commission further explained:</tt><p><tt>"If intuition and concern for children's health were a sufficient basisunder the law for bringing a case, we have no doubt that a unanimous Commissionwould have taken that action long ago.  The dispositive issue here, however,was whether the record showed a link between the Joe Camel advertising campaignand increased smoking among children, not whether smoking has an effect onchildren or whether the health of children is important.  Indeed, our concernabout the health of children led us to consider every possible avenue to alawsuit before reaching today's decision."  Id.</tt><p><p><tt>	Here, too, concern for children may not be permitted to cloud thedispositive factual and constitutional issues.  It certainly has not in thecourts.  Consider, for example, the court's ruling in Sterling DoubledayEnterprises, L.P.v. City of New York, No.6855/94 (N.Y.Sup. Queens Cty. Dec.8, 1994).  There, the court denied New York City'smotion for a preliminary injunction directing the removal of a Marlborobillboard facing the center field playing area in New York's Shea Stadium.  Thecourt concluded that the City was unlikely to succeed on the merits and hadfailed to establish irreparable injury given the lack of evidence "to establishthat the particular sign in issue is `aimed' at children, or has in the past,or will in the future, induce children to smoke cigarettes."  Slip op.at2.</tt>"120" [28<p>	FDA relies on many of the same studies and statistics that were evaluated andrejected by the FTC as justification for its proposed regulations.  Thosestudies, which purportedly show that cigarette advertisements cause adolescentsto begin smoking, in fact do no such thing.  Nor do ]<tt>any of theother studies relied on by FDA demonstrate a causal link between cigaretteadvertising and teen smoking decisions.  The authors of those studies concedeas much; each acknowledges its methodological limitations; none concludes thatcigarette advertising in fact induces teen smoking.</tt>"136" [29  FDA's reliance on the Surgeon General's1994 Report is misplaced as well-- it simply cites to the same studies asdoes FDA.30  And FDA cites no evidence whatsoever to show that promotionalitems cause minors to begin smoking.  ]<tt>See 60 Fed. Reg.41,336.</tt><p><tt>	This inability to demonstrate causation is certainly not for any lack ofstudies addressing cigarette advertising and underage smoking.  Rather, as theSurgeon General herself observed, it is because there simply does not exist any"longitudinal study of the direct relationship of cigarette advertising tosmoking initiation."  1994 Surgeon General's Report at 188.</tt>"150" [31  A newly released study32 that has beenwidely hailed in the media as greatly advancing FDA's position33 adds nothingto the cacophony.  Though it reports a correlation between "receptivity" totobacco marketing and "susceptibility" to smoking, it does not even begin toshow that marketing is responsible for such "susceptibility."34<p>	Perhaps most telling of FDA's complete inability to show that cigaretteadvertising causes young people to begin smoking is its citation to the "fact"that tobacco products "are among the most heavily advertised products inAmerica" as the "first and most compelling piece of evidence supportingrestrictions on cigarette and smokeless tobacco product labeling, advertising,and promotion."  60Fed. Reg. 41,329.  This observation is no "evidence"at all.  Like FDA's other asserted justifications for its restrictions onadvertising, it fails to provide the ballast necessary to show that cigaretteadvertising ]<tt>causes minors to smoke.</tt>"160" [35]<h3>2.		The Proposed Regulations Do Not Advance</h3><tt><b>			FDA's Stated Objective Because They</b></tt><p><tt><b>			Will Not Prevent Minors from Taking</b></tt><p><tt><b>			up Smoking to a Material Degree</b></tt><p><p><tt>	Even if the FDA could demonstrate some real harm to children caused bytobacco advertising, it would still have to affirmatively demonstrate that itsproposed regulations would directly advance its goals by alleviating the harmto a material degree.  This is a showing FDA cannot make.  The overwhelmingevidence shows that a ban on cigarette advertising would not impact minors'decisions to begin smoking.  As the author of one recent review of empiricalresearch on the subject has stated, "[t]here is no evidence in any of thestudies to suggest that, if advertising were banned, it would make the leastdifference in the propensity of children to smoke."</tt>"178" [36  Because it has not been demonstrated thatcigarette advertising causes minors to start smoking, it necessarily followsthat restricting such advertising will not prevent minors from starting tosmoke, certainly not to a material degree.  This conclusion is borne out by theexperience of foreign countries that have restricted tobacco advertising in aneffort to curb smoking.  Numerous studies measuring the impact of suchrestrictions in Europe and elsewhere have concluded that they not only fail tobring about a decrease in smoking among teenagers, but in some instances arefollowed by an ]<tt>increase in tobacco use.  </tt><p><tt>	Canada's recently invalidated 1989 ban on tobacco advertising was followedby just such an increase in smoking among 15- to 19-year-oldsbetween 1990 and 1994.</tt>"179" [37  Analogously,a Canadian province's 58-year ban on liquor advertising was also shown not todecrease consumption.38  Following legislation in Saskatchewan that permittedhard liquor to be advertised in print media and beer and wine to be advertisedboth in print and on television, there was no impact on wine and total alcoholsales from before.  The only effect was a shift from sales of hard liquor,which decreased, to sales of beer, which increased.  Consequently, it seemsthat all that can be said about the ban is that it had produced a substitutioneffect, leading Canadians to drink distilled spirits rather than beer.  As theauthors of a study on the ban concluded, "alcohol advertising is not acontributory force that influences the overall level of alcoholconsumption."39]<h2>D.		The Regulations Are Not Narrowly Tailored</h2><tt><b>		To Accomplish FDA's Asserted Goal of</b></tt><p><tt><b>		"Helping Prevent Persons Under 18 from</b></tt><p><tt><b>		Becoming Addicted to Nicotine"</b></tt><p><p><tt>	Under Central Hudson, regulations must be "narrowly tailored" andtheir costs "carefully calculated" to accomplish their asserted purpose.Cincinnati, 113 S. Ct. at 1510, n.12.  That requirement has, in turn,been held to require affirmative proof by the proponent of a statute thatlimits commercial speech that there is a "reasonable fit" between theregulatory means and their asserted ends.  Board of Trusteesv.Fox, 492 U.S. 469, 480 (1989).  Regulations which disregard far lessrestrictive and more precise means of achieving the government's assertedobjectives are not narrowly tailored.  Coors, 115 S. Ct. at 1593-94;Cincinnati, 113 S.Ct. at 1510 n.13.</tt><p><tt>	Here, the most obvious less burdensome means to advance the government'sobjectives is putting more teeth into those laws already in force which addressthe problem of underage smoking directly without burdening any speechdirected at adults-- namely, state laws prohibiting the sale ofcigarettes to minors.  Through better enforcement of current laws and stifferpenalties for offenders, child access laws can have a significant direct impactwithout burdening speech at all.  This fact has not escaped the notice of theFDA, which itself concluded:</tt><p><tt>"Youth access restrictions have been found to be effective in reducingillegal sales and some studies have demonstrated that efforts to reduce accesshave led to a decrease in tobacco use by young people.  In Woodbridge, IL,for example, a comprehensive community intervention involving retailerlicensing, regular compliance checks, and penalties for merchant violationssignificantly reduced illegal sales from 70 percent to less than 5 percentalmost 2 years later.  Further, rates of experimentation and regular smokingdropped by more than 50 percent among seventh and eighth graders."</tt><p><p><tt>60 Fed. Reg. 41,322 (citing Jason L.A. et al.  <i>Active Enforcement ofCigarette Control Laws in the Prevention of Cigarette Sales to Minors</i>. JAMA266(22): 3159-3161 (Dec.11, 1991)) (emphasis added).</tt><p><tt>	Nor has it gone unnoticed by the Department of Health and Human Services,which in 1993 concluded that "responsible implementation" of effectivecigarette access restrictions "is the single most important reform to improve"its citizens' health that government "could undertake in . . . the1990s."</tt>"182" [40  The Department furtherconcluded that "[e]liminating virtually all sales [of tobacco products] tominors does not even present particularly difficult enforcement problems."41If that is true, the ]<tt>least that First Amendment case lawrequires is that before speech-destructive methods of allegedly preventingyouths from smoking are attempted, stricter enforcement of nonspeechthreatening laws be carried out first.  Id.</tt><p><tt>	Another less restrictive alternative would be for the government to seekto reduce underage demand for cigarettes by engaging in still more"counter-speech" of its own that would be narrowly focused on discouragingchildren from starting to smoke.  Government-sponsored public educationcampaigns specifically targeted at minors provide a reasonable means ofadvancing the government's aims without encroaching upon First Amendment rightsof others, unlike FDA's proposed advertising restrictions and its compulsion ofcorporate-sponsored, antismoking messages.  See 60 Fed. Reg. 41,326-27.</tt><p><tt>	FDA's blanket restrictions on nearly all cigarette advertising in the hopeof shielding such advertising from a minority of viewers is just the sort ofsweepingly overbroad rule that cannot possibly be justified as providing a"reasonable fit."  FDA understands and continues to wrestle with this fact,specifically seeking comments on how it might narrow its broad ban of imageadvertising.  60 Fed. Reg. 41,335.  It concedes that its prophylacticprohibition of all image advertising was born from the difficulty it hashad in drawing "the line between advertising that should be restricted orregulated and advertising that does not pose an unreasonable risk ofinfluencing young people."  Id.  FDA has found that it is easier whenfaced with such burdensome tasks to err on the side of suppressing more speech,even if it sweeps in protected speech that did not need to be restricted evenon FDA's own rationale (which, as we have shown, is insufficient to justify anyrestriction of cigarette advertising).</tt><p><tt>	Of course, it is easier to ban speech.  It is also more expedient.  But itis also unconstitutional.  Zauderer, 471 U.S. at 644 (rejecting state'sargument that a prophylactic rule may be applied to ads that have "none of thevices that allegedly justify the rule").  The premise of the narrow-tailoringrequirement is that commercial speech is valuable and that it may thus only berestricted when it is necessary to do so.  "`Precision of regulation must bethe touchstone in an area so closely touching our most precious freedoms.'"Edenfield, 113 S.Ct. at 1803-04 (citing NAACPv.Button, 371 U.S. 415, 438 (1963)).  Yet the FDA's blunderbussregulations concededly are not tailored at all and therefore fail to satisfythe First Amendment.</tt><p><p><tt>	<b>CONCLUSION</b></tt><p><tt>	More than once in this submission, we have referred to theextraordinary gap between long-established requirements of First Amendment lawand the justifications proffered by FDA for its proposed regulations.  FirstAmendment law routinely rejects limitations on what adults may read simplybecause the information may be misused by children; it rejects governmentalefforts to compel corporations or individuals to articulate views with whichthey differ; it condemns governmental restrictions on speech based onviewpoint; it protects against governmental restrictions on even purelycommercial speech in the absence of affirmative and definite proof by thegovernment that it can meet legal burdens that are by no meansperfunctory.</tt><p><tt>	For the most part, FDA's proposals simply ignore these legal constraints.It is as if FDA believes that it bears no legal burden, that the FirstAmendment creates no legal barriers-- at least where cigaretteadvertising is concerned.  So sure seems FDA that all normal rules areinapplicable here that it goes so far as to cite the "Joe Camel" advertisementsas demonstrating a need for these regulations without even mentioning, letalone responding to, the determination of the Federal Trade Commission that theevidence did not warrant the issuance of a complaint in connection with thoseadvertisements.</tt><p><tt>	The First Amendment, it should not be necessary to say, not only protectscigarette advertisements to the same degree it protects others but limits FDAto the same degree it limits other government entities.  Given those twounexceptionable propositions, there is no way FDA's proposals can be deemedconsistent with the First Amendment.</tt><p><tt>Floyd Abrams</tt><p><tt>Jonathan Donnellan</tt><p><tt>Cahill Gordon &amp; Reindel</tt><p><tt>(a partnership including</tt><p><tt>a professional corporation)</tt><p><tt>Eighty Pine Street</tt><p><tt>New York, New York  10005</tt><p><p><H3><a href=vol10.htm><I>Next Volume</I></a></H3><H3><a href="contents.htm#start"><I>Table of Contents</I></a></H3><hr><IMG WIDTH=50 HEIGHT=48 ALIGN=LEFT SRC=../../lcc.gif ALT=*> Released through <a href="/inside/about.html">COUNSEL CONNECT</a>.

Reg. 41,340.  Infact, the statute does not require such submissions, and FDA has never beforetaken that position.  Indeed, Section897.40(a) is inconsistent with FDA'sprior construction of Section510(j).  The proposed requirement is adeparture from the procedures established in FDA's current regulations --a departure that FDA has not even explained, much less justified.</tt><p><tt>	Section 510(j)(1)(B)(i) of the FDCA provides that copies of labeling and arepresentative sampling of advertisements are required to be submitted for arestricted device at the time of registration and device listing by amanufacturer.  21 U.S.C. [[section]]360(j)(1)(B)(i).Section510(j)(2)(D) provides that, at the time of annual device listing,the manufacturer is required only to submit "[a]ny material change in anyinformation previously submitted" pursuant to the requirements of Section510(j).  21 U.S.C. [[section]]360(j)(2)(D).  These provisions togetherwould authorize FDA to require copies of all labeling and representativeadvertisements only at the initial establishment registration andlisting of restricted devices, with that information to be updated andsupplemented as appropriate.  Under the plain language of the applicablestatutory provisions, annual submissions are simply not required.</tt><p><tt>	FDA's assertion here that annual submissions of labeling and advertisingare mandated by Section 510(j) is at odds with FDA's regulations implementingthat statutory provision.  FDA's existing regulations were promulgated in 1978to implement the Medical Device Amendments of 1976, 43 Fed. Reg. 37,990 (1978),and thus reflect the Agency's contemporaneous construction of the statute.  Thepertinent regulations require only that the manufacturer "maintain a historicalfile" containing all labeling and advertisements for a restricted device in useon the date of initial listing.  21 C.F.R. [[section]]807.31(a)(2)(1995).  The manufacturer also must "maintain in the historical file anylabeling or advertisements in which a material change has been made anytimeafter initial listing."  Id<i>.</i> [[section]]807.31(b).Manufacturers of restricted devices are required to submit all labeling andrepresentative advertisements to FDA "only upon specific request"; and therequirement is further qualified as follows:</tt><p><tt>"For a device that is a restricted device, a copy of all labeling for thedevice, a representative sampling of advertisements for the device, and forgood cause, a copy of all advertisements for a particular device.  A requestfor all advertisements will, where feasible, be accompanied by an explanationof the basis for such request."  Id<i>.</i> [[section]]807.31(e),(e)(2).</tt><p><p><tt>	As is apparent, this provision specific to restricted devices does notrequire routine annual submissions.</tt><p><tt>	FDA, of course, is legally obligated to follow its own regulations.See United Statesv. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683, 695-96(1974); Servicev. Dulles, 354 U.S. 363, 372-73,388-89(1957); Clean Ocean Actionv. York, 57 F.3d 328, 332-33(3d Cir. 1995); Orengo Caraballov. Reich, 11 F.3d 186, 193(D.C. Cir. 1993).  FDA has not presented any reason for departing from theprocedures established in its current regulations.</tt><p><tt>	The proposal for annual submissions is also inconsistent with theinterpretation of Section 510(j) embodied in FDA's regulations making hearingaids restricted devices.  See 21 C.F.R.[[section]][[section]]801.420, 801.421 (1995).  FDA required submissionof all labeling for hearing aids by a specified date following publication ofthe regulations.  Id<i>.</i> [[section]]801.420(d).  Thoseregulations do not contain a requirement for annual submissions oflabeling.  FDA's proposal to require annual submissions for cigarettes but notfor hearing aids --the only product FDA has, by regulation, declared to be a restricted device --is discriminatory, arbitrary, and capricious.</tt> [2<p>]<p><tt><b>	[[section]]897.40(c)--Inspections</b></tt><p><tt>	This proposed rule provides as follows:</tt><p><tt>"Manufacturers, distributors, and retailers shall, uponthepresentation by an FDA representative of official credentials, make all recordsand other information collected under this part and all records and otherinformation related to the events and persons identified in such recordsavailable to the FDA representative for purposes of inspection, review,copying, or any other use related to the enforcement of the Federal Food, Drug,and Cosmetic Act and this part."</tt><p><p><p><tt><b>COMMENT</b></tt><p><tt>	Section 897.40(c) exceeds FDA's statutory authority.  It would(1)authorize greater access to records and other documents than the FDCAitself permits, even for restricted devices, (2)authorize access to othernonrecord "information," and (3)authorize access regarding events andpersons apart from the search for noncompliance with the law.</tt><p><tt>	FDA is authorized under Section 704(a) of the FDCA to inspect facilities,equipment, and labeling.  For restricted devices, FDA's establishmentinspection authority also extends</tt><p><tt>"to all things therein (including records, files, papers, processes,controls, and facilities) bearing on whether . . . restricted devices which areadulterated or misbranded . . ., or which may not be manufactured, . . . orsold, or offered for sale by reason of any provision of this Act, have been orare being manufactured, processed, packed, transported, or held in any suchplace, or otherwise bearing on violation of this Act."  21 U.S.C.[[section]]374(a)(1).  </tt><p><p><tt>	Under this provision, FDA may inspect records and other "things"only for the purpose of determining whether the FDCA has been, or isbeing, violated.  Under Section704, FDA may have access to "things,"including records, papers, files, and other documents.  It does not authorizeaccess to "information," as Section897.40(c) would do.</tt><p><tt>	Section 704(a)(1) imposes limitations on FDA's inspectionauthority:</tt><p><tt>"No inspection authorized by [the records access provision] shall extend tofinancial data, sales data other than shipment data, pricing data, personneldata (other than data as to qualifications of technical and professionalpersonnel performing functions subject to this Act, and research data (otherthan data relating to new drugs, antibiotic drugs, and devices and subject toreporting and inspection . . . ."  21 U.S.C. [[section]]374(a)(1).</tt><p><p><tt>These limits are not carried forward into the proposed regulation.  To thecontrary, Section897.40(c) would overrule, or at best ignore, thosestatutory limits.  </tt><p><tt>	Given the statutory limitations, FDA has no authority to go on a fishingexpedition on manufacturers' premises, as the proposed rule apparently wouldauthorize.  It may not demand to inspect "all records and other informationrelated to the events and persons identified in suchrecords... for any... use relatedto the enforcement of" the FDCA.  60 Fed. Reg. 41,375 (emphasisadded).  Such boundless authority flies in the face of the Supreme Court'sadmonition that "[d]elineating the scope of a search with some care isparticularly important where documents are involved."  Marshallv.Barlow's Inc., 436 U.S. 307, 324 n.22 (1978).  Section897.40(c)does not adequately delineate the scope of the search.  Literally interpreted,it could subject manufacturers, at any time, to open-ended,highly intrusive scrutiny, by federal agents unconstrained by any clearlimitations.</tt> [3<p>	The proposed rule also violates the Fourth Amendment which precludes a searchwithout a warrant based on probable cause to believe a violation of law hasoccurred.  Generally, its protections apply to, and constrain, administrativesearches and inspections.  "[T]he Fourth Amendment protects commercialbuildings as well as private homes."  ]<tt>Barlow's Inc., 436 U.S.at 311 (1978).  </tt><p><tt>	Ordinarily, the Fourth Amendment requires a warrant even for health andsafety inspections of commercial premises, except for "pervasively regulatedbusinesses."  The Supreme Court has explained the rationale for this exception:"Certain industries have such a history of government oversight that noreasonable expectation of privacy could exist for a proprietor over the stockof such an enterprise."  Barlow's Inc., 436 U.S. at 313 (citationomitted).  Companies in such industries are presumed to have consented toinspection as a predictable aspect of their doing business.  Certainly, thecigarette manufacturers cannot be said to have impliedly consented toinspections by FDA, a government agency that has repeatedly announced that itlacks authority to regulate them.  Therefore, this exception to the warrantrequirement does not apply to cigarette manufacturers, and warrantless FDAsearches would be unconstitutional.</tt><p><tt>	Moreover, warrantless inspections of commercial property have beenpermitted only when they are reasonable, and reasonableness requires that "thestatute's inspection program, in terms of the certainty and regularity of itsapplication, [must] provid[e] a constitutionally adequate substitute for awarrant."  Donovan v. Dewey, 452 U.S. 594, 603 (1981).  Thismeans that the regulatory statute "must perform the two basic functions of awarrant:  it must advise the owner of the commercial premises that the searchis being made pursuant to the law and has a properly defined scope, and itmust limit the discretion of the investigating officers."  NewYorkv. Burger, 482 U.S. 691, 703 (1987) (emphasis added).Section 897.409(c), by contrast, does neither.</tt><p><tt>	Section 897.40(c) would also overrule the statutory requirement inSection704(a)(1) for presentation of a notice of inspection.  Under theproposed regulation, manufacturers, distributors, and retailers would have tomake records available "upon presentation by an FDA representative of officialcredentials."  The statute, however, by its terms, prevents an FDArepresentative from entering a facility where devices are processed, packed,and held unless, in addition, a written notice of inspection is also issued.FDA cannot ignore this statutory prerequisite.</tt><p><tt>	Finally, FDA has not presented any reason why it needs a regulation thataddresses its inspectional authority solely for tobacco products.  No aspect ofthose products justifies an inspectional regulation targeted specially at them.The proposed inspection regulation thus epitomizes all of FDA's proposed Part897 regulations-- FDA has decided it wants something, and it simply doesnot matter to FDA what the FDCA authorizes or what limits it imposes.</tt><p><p><tt><b>[[section]]897.42--Preemption of State and LocalRequirements</b></tt><p><tt>		<b>and Requests for AdvisoryOpinions</b></tt><p><tt></tt><p><tt><b>	[[section]]897.42(a)--Preemption</b></tt><p><tt>	FDA proposes to exempt from federal preemption, and to incorporate intoFDA's own regulatory scheme as federal requirements, all State and localrequirements relating to the "sale, distribution, labeling, advertising, or useof cigarettes" that are "more stringent" than (and that do not conflict with)those required under Part 897.  This section also directs that manufacturers,distributors, and retailers "shall comply" with such "more stringent" State andlocal requirements, thus evidencing an intent to incorporate such requirementsas part of FDA's own regulations.</tt><p><p><tt><b>COMMENT</b></tt><p><tt>	This proposal exceeds FDA's statutory authority in purporting to grantblanket exemptions from preemption and to incorporate, wholesale, and withoutprior FDA or public review, State or local medical device requirements into thefederal regulatory scheme.  It is contrary to the plain language and intent ofSection 521 of the Medical Device Amendments of 1976, 21 U.S.C.[[section]]360k (the "MDA"), and is procedurally defective.  Moreover,for the reasons discussed in Volume VI of our comments, Section 897.42(a) isprecluded by the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act and by theADAMHA Reorganization Act of 1992.</tt><h3>10.	  Distorts FDCA Preemption</h3><tt>	Congress established in Section 521(a) a general rule preempting any Stateor local requirement respecting a medical device </tt><p><tt>"(1) which is different from, or in addition to, any requirement applicableunder this Act, and (2) which relates to the safety or effectiveness of thedevice or to any other matter included in a requirement applicable to thedevice under this Act."  21 U.S.C. [[section]]360k(a).  </tt><p><p><tt>This broad preemption was enacted to establish national uniformity inmedical device regulation, protecting such products from onerous burdens oninterstate commerce created by a patchwork of State and local requirements.  Asstated in the House Committee Report:</tt><p><tt>"The Committee recognizes that if a substantial number of differingrequirements applicable to a medical device are imposed by jurisdictions otherthan the Federal government, interstate commerce would be unduly burdened.  Forthis reason the bill prescribes a general rule that no State or politicalsubdivision thereof may establish or continue in effect any requirement withrespect to a device for human use which is different from, or in addition to,any requirement made applicable to such a device under the proposed legislationor existing provisions of the [FDCA]."  H.R. Rep. No. 853, 94th Cong., 2dSess. 45 (1976) (emphasis added).</tt><p><p><tt>Congress recognized, however, that in limited circumstances State and localdevice regulations might constitute a "useful supplement to Federal regulation"and thus authorized FDA to grant exemptions from preemption on a case-by-casebasis and in response to applications submitted by the States.Id<i>.</i> at 45-46.  </tt><p><tt>	Section897.42(a), however, stands the preemption provision on itshead.  Different State and local requirements that are more stringent than thefederal ones become the federal requirements; and uniform federal standards aredisplaced by diverse State and local requirements.</tt><h3>11.	  Procedurally Defective</h3><tt>	Section 521(a) automatically preempts different or additional Staterequirements for a device.  Section 521(b) then authorizes FDA to grantexemptions from preemption, but only "[u]pon application of a State or apolitical subdivision . . . by regulation promulgated after notice andopportunity for an oral hearing."  21 U.S.C. [[section]]360k(b) (emphasisadded).  FDA has ignored the clear language of the statute by proposing anacross-the-boardprospective exemption for all States (1)without any application by aState or local entity and (2)without an oral hearing.  </tt><p><tt>	The legislative history makes clear that Section 521(b) was intended toaccommodate particular device requirements that had been adopted in California,but indicates that even these could not be exempted except upon a petition bythat State:</tt><p><tt>"In the Committee's view, requirements imposed under the California statuteserve as an example of requirements that the Secretary should authorize to becontinued (provided any application submitted by a State meets requirementspursuant to the reported bill)."  H.R. Rep. No. 853, 94th Cong., 2d Sess.46 (1976) (emphasis added).</tt><p><p><tt>	The requirement for an application for exemption is also set forth inFDA's current regulations governing preemption exemptions.  21 C.F.R.[[section]]808.20 (1995).</tt> [4  Thoseregulations also apply a case-by-case approach to exemptions from federalrequirements for hearing aids.  ]<tt>See, e.g., 21C.F.R. [[section]][[section]]808.61(a), 808.69(a), 808.71(a) (1995).Again, FDA may not fail to comply with its own procedural rules.  SeeUnited Statesv. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683, 696 (1974);Servicev. Dulles, 354 U.S. 363, 373-82(1957); Clean Ocean Actionv. York, 57 F.3d 328, 332-33(3d Cir. 1995); Orengo Caraballov. Reich, 11 F.3d 186, 193(D.C. Cir. 1993).  Nor may it arbitrarily adopt a different approach solely forcigarettes.  </tt><h3>12.	  Exceeds Statutory Authority</h3><tt>	Nothing in the language or legislative history of Section 521 authorizesFDA to exempt any State or local laws from preemption a priori orsua sponte, or to exempt multiple State and local laws on awholesale basis.  </tt><p><tt>	To the contrary, Section521 requires FDA to undertake a moredeliberative process--carefully considering the application for each State or local requirement thatis proposed to be exempted under Section521(b), determining whether togrant a hearing on the request of an interested party, and exercising itsdiscretion to grant or deny the requested exemption on a case-by-casebasis.  Only in this way can the preemption rule of Section 521(a) adequatelyserve the interest of Congress in establishing national uniformity in medicaldevice regulation.  Congress did not mean for FDA's medical device regulationsto be minimum standards; it meant those regulations to be the governingstandards absent unusual local circumstances.</tt><p><tt>	FDA's proposed rule disregards Congress' policy of national uniformity inmedical device regulation.  FDA has no authority to pursue its own policypreferences (the strictest restrictions on cigarettes politically attainable atthe federal, State, and local levels) at the expense of the policies enshrinedin the legislation under which the Agency claims to act (national uniformity inmedical device regulation, except in extraordinary local circumstances).Amalgamated Transit Union, AFL-CIO v. Brock, 809 F.2d 909, 915(D.C. Cir. 1987).  Section 897.42(a) is yet another instance in which FDA haschosen to ignore a statutory requirement that does not suit its own agenda forregulating cigarettes.  </tt><h3>13.	  Violates Manufacturers' Procedural Rights</h3><tt>	FDA's blanket exemption also denies to cigarette manufacturers and otherinterested parties the congressionally mandated opportunity to participate in apublic hearing on each exemption from preemption sought by a State or politicalsubdivision.  Section 521(b) authorizes an exemption only "after notice and anopportunity for an oral hearing."  Plainly, the hearing is intended for thebenefit of the applicant and other interested parties, including possibleopponents.  FDA has so construed that requirement by providing that notice isto be in the Federal Register, 21 C.F.R. [[section]]808.25(c), and that"[a] request for an oral hearing may be made by the State or politicalsubdivision or any other interested person," 21C.F.R.[[section]]808.25(d) (emphasis added).  </tt><p><tt>	These procedural rights are significant.  Exemptions from preemption arenot authorized by Section521(b) as a matter of right.  Under the statute,even where a State or local provision satisfies the requirements for anexemption, FDA still has discretion to deny it, and must do so if the requisiteshowing is not made.  Section 521(b) mandates that FDA exercise its discretionon a case-by-casebasis (i.e., after an individual State or political subdivisionhas submitted an application).  The opportunity for interested parties topresent to FDA reasons why the Agency should determine in a particular case todeny preemption is important to them and to the process mandated bySection521(b).</tt><p><tt>	FDA cannot know or foresee all the circumstances that may properly bebrought to its attention by interested parties in connection with itsconsideration of individual applications for exemptions.  It is contrary toSection521(b), and arbitrary and capricious, for the Agency to reject allsuch considerations categorically and in advance.</tt><p><tt>	Quite apart from the procedural rights of interested parties underSection521(b) and 21C.F.R. [[section]]808.25, it would besubstantively contrary to the FDCA for FDA to refuse to exercise its judgmenton a case-by-casebasis.  Granting a blanket exemption to all provisions adopted by a State orpolitical subdivision that do not conflict with FDA's regulations and are insome respect more stringent, and without any consideration by FDA of theparticular circumstances of the provisions adopted by States or politicalsubdivisions, is an abdication by FDA of the responsibility conferred bySection521(b).</tt><p><tt>	FDA's proposal contradicts FDA's established policy in administeringSection 521 and yet provides no explanation for this departure from establishedpolicy.  For example, in considering exemption of certain California laws andregulations pertaining to medical devices soon after enactment of the MedicalDevice Amendments of 1976, FDA recognized that State requirements morestringent than federal requirements were merely eligible to be proposedfor exemption and were not automatically exempt from preemption underSection521, and that each such State requirement must be separatelyevaluated on its own merits in order to be granted an exemption frompreemption.</tt> [5  By repudiating aconsistently applied Agency interpretation, Section 897.42(a) inappropriatelyjettisons an important means of ensuring that the Agency effectuates the willof Congress.  ]<tt>Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Ry. Co.v.Wichita Bd. of Trade, 412 U.S. 800, 807 (1973) ("A settled course ofbehavior embodies the agency's informed judgment that, by pursuing that course,it will carry out the policies committed to it by Congress").  </tt><p><tt>	Congress' treatment of the Medical Device Amendments since their enactmentsupports the established interpretation of, and Agency practice under,Section521.  When enacting extensive amendments to the Medical DeviceAmendments in the Safe Medical Devices Act of 1990, Congress did not modifySection521.</tt> [6  Congress also did notmodify the preemption language of Section521 in further amending thedevice provisions of the FDCA in 1992.7  "Congress," as the Supreme Court hasstated, "is presumed to be aware of an administrative or judicialinterpretation of a statute and to adopt that interpretation when it re-enactsa statute without change."  ]<tt>Lorillard v. Pons,434U.S. 575, 580-81 (1978).  </tt><h3>14.	  Incorporation into Federal Regulatory Scheme</h3><tt>	FDA attempts to circumvent the procedural and substantive requirements ofSection521(a) by declaring more stringent State and local measures to be"part of" FDA's regulatory scheme.  60 Fed. Reg. 41,340.  According to FDA,Section897.42(a) adopts as federal requirements, sight unseen, any andall State or local requirements that may be adopted at any time in the future,regardless of their content or circumstances, provided that they are morestringent than FDA's requirements and do not conflict with FDA's requirements.To be part of FDA's regulatory scheme, however, requirements must be authorizedby the FDCA and promulgated pursuant to the requirements of that statute aswell as the Administrative Procedure Act.</tt><p><tt>	If FDA's extravagant claims for the impact of Section897.42(a) inexpanding the federal regulatory scheme were valid, then FDA, acting in tandemwith State and local governments, readily could circumvent the limits on theAgency's powers under the FDCA.  By automatically incorporating State and localrequirements into the federal regulatory framework, Section897.42(a)would dramatically expand the scope of compliance and enforcement programsunder the FDCA.  For example, FDA presumably could enforce a State or localrequirement, at least with respect to a violation occurring in that State,using the administrative, civil, and criminal provisions of the FDCA or infederal court through the U.S. Department of Justice.</tt> [8<p>	In this manner FDA attempts to establish new regulatory programs, prohibitionsand requirements, as well as quite possibly declare new crimes and establishnew civil and criminal remedies.  Federal administrative and judicial machinerycould be placed at the service of substantive provisions of law adopted byStates and local governments, but not adopted by Congress.  Under Section897.14(b), moreover, manufacturers presumably would be required to train theirsales representatives, and those representatives presumably wouldberequired to monitor retailers' compliance, with respect to the Stateand local requirements and prohibitions that, under Section897.42(a),would be adopted into Part 897.9<p>	Indeed, what FDA has proposed in Section 897.42(a) is even more extraordinarythan this.  With or without consultation with FDA, and without need for anyfurther action by Congress, by FDA, or by any other unit of the federalgovernment, States and local governments could put into ]<tt>federallaw any requirements or prohibitions they choose with respect to cigarettes, aslong as they are more stringent in some respect than FDA's requirements and donot conflict with those requirements.</tt><p><tt>	The result would be that federal requirements and prohibitions withrespect to cigarettes would vary from State to State and, within States, fromcounty to county and city to city.  Even FDA would have to train its own fieldforce in the different FDA requirements created by different States andlocal governments.</tt><p><tt>	Moreover, all of this would occur without notice in the Federal Registerto interested parties or the public, without opportunity for comment or ahearing, without consideration of comments by FDA, and without a federaladministrative record.  In these respects, Section 897.42(a) violatesprocedural rights guaranteed by the Due Process Clause and by theAdministrative Procedure Act.</tt><p><tt>	Interested parties (including FDA) would wake up some mornings and learnthat some State or local government had enacted a new, more stringent, andnonconflicting requirement or prohibition with respect to cigarettes, andtherefore that that new enactment had ipso facto become anoperative part of 21 C.F.R. pt. 897.  Manufacturers who opposed such anew enactment would be required to sue FDA to enjoin implementation of the newprovision, which might already be in effect as part of FDA's regulations(without FDA necessarily even knowing about it).</tt><p><tt>	This body of State and local enactments incorporated into FDA'sregulations would not necessarily be published in either the Federal Registeror the Code of Federal Regulations.  Thus, persons who need to know whatfederal regulations applied to cigarettes under the FDCA could not obtain afull text from those publications.</tt><p><tt>	This absurd lawmaking process evidently contemplated bySection897.42(a) is not a process for making federal law that isauthorized by the Constitution.  It also is not the process for promulgation offederal regulations that is contemplated in the FDCA and the AdministrativeProcedure Act.  It is a process, rather, that is unconstitutional (in violationof Article I and the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment), unauthorizedby the FDCA, irrational, arbitrary, and capricious.</tt><h3>15.	  Other Matters</h3><tt>	FDA's purported disclaimer of preemption under Section521 withregard to tort claims against tobacco manufacturers, 60 Fed. Reg. 41,340, isequally unavailing.  As FDA acknowledges, there have been "several recent courtdecisions construing section 521 of the act to preempt certain common law tortactions with respect to medical device products."  Id.  If FDA persistsin regulating tobacco products as medical devices (despite the Agency's lack ofauthority to do so), then no basis exists for treating them differently thanother devices for purposes of preemption.  Such discriminatory treatment isimpermissible.  Rather, the Agency "must govern with an even hand."  UnitedStates v. Exachol, 716 F. Supp. 787, 795 (S.D.N.Y. 1989).</tt><p><tt>	Moreover, the preemption of tort claims is a matter that must be left tothe courts; FDA has no special expertise in matters of common law torts.</tt><p><tt>	Finally, FDA claims that, because its proposed rule "addresses only thesale, distribution, labeling, and advertising of cigarettes," State and localrequirements regarding such matters as "licensing, taxes, or smoking in publicareas" would not be affected.  60 Fed. Reg. 41,340.  Once FDA has chosen toregulate cigarettes as a medical device, however, any health-related (includingyouth-related) State or local regulation would be preempted.  Cigarettelicensing and taxation often are pursued as "health measures," and public-placesmoking restrictions invariably are based on such concerns.  See,e.g., Institute of Medicine.  Growing Up Tobacco Free 283("government... should use tobacco taxes as an interventionto accomplish these health goals"); id. at 284 (recommending retaillicensing systems as a means for enforcing restrictions against youth access);id. at 281 (recommending programs to "inform the public about thehazards of environmental tobacco smoke").  All would be preempted by FDA'srules.</tt><p><p><tt><b>	[[section]]897.42(b)--Advisory Opinions</b></tt><p><tt>	Under Section 897.42(b), a State or local government could request an FDAadvisory opinion on whether a particular law or regulation relating to tobaccoproducts is preempted.  FDA also proposes that such a request may, at theAgency's discretion, be treated as an application for exemption frompreemption.  Moreover, notwithstanding the lack of a request for an advisoryopinion, FDA proposes that it may, on its own initiative, issue advisoryopinions relating to tobacco products.  </tt><p><p><tt><b>COMMENT</b></tt><p><tt>	As shown above, Congress mandated in Section 521 that exemptions frompreemption be considered on a case-by-case basis and granted only in responseto an application by a State or local government.  These statutorily mandatedprocedures for considering exemptions from preemption cannot be reconciled withthe procedure for issuing advisory opinions proposed by FDA.  </tt><p><tt>	If -- as FDA contends -- any and all nonconflicting State or localrequirements relating to tobacco products that are more stringent than FDArequirements are ipso facto not preempted under Section521,the advisory opinion procedure proposed by FDA would be superfluous andunnecessary (except, perhaps, to consider possible conflicts with FDA's rules).The advisory opinion procedure thus reinforces the conclusion that FDA'sconstruction of Section521 is untenable.  </tt><p><tt>	FDA's proposal to issue on its own initiative advisory opinions onpreemption matters lacks any statutory authority.  This proposal is invalidbecause it is tantamount to granting preemption exemptions outside thestatutorily mandated application procedure of Section 521(b).  The entireprocedure also is discriminatory in applying only to tobacco products and notto medical devices generally.  Exachol, 716 F. Supp. at 794.</tt><p><tt>	Furthermore, FDA's proposed procedure for granting advisory opinions failsto acknowledge that all the procedural requirements governing requests foradvisory opinions under FDA regulations, including the opportunity forinterested persons to submit comments, would apply as a matter of course.See 21 C.F.R. [[section]][[section]]10.85(b) and 10.30(d) (1995).The proposal also fails to provide that FDA would treat a request for anadvisory opinion as an application for exemption only if it met all therequirements set forth in FDA's regulations.  See id.[[section]][[section]]808.20, 808.25.  </tt><p><tt></tt><p><tt><b>[[section]]897.44--Additional RegulatoryMeasures</b></tt><p><tt>	Section 897.44 announces goals for the reduction of underage tobacco usethat are to be achieved within seven years after publication of a final rulegoverning the marketing of tobacco products.  Taking 1994 as the baseline year,these goals call for a 50 percent reduction in the proportion of youths whosmoke cigarettes and a 50 percent reduction in the proportion of male youthswho use smokeless tobacco products, the latter reduction to be achieved withoutany increase in the proportion of female youths using smokeless tobacco.</tt><p><tt>	If these goals are not achieved, Section 897.44 mandates that the Agency"shall take additional measures to achieve the reduction in the use of tobaccoproducts by children and adolescents described above."  60 Fed. Reg. 41,375.FDA has offered only the most obscure hints about what these "additionalmeasures" might be.  All that is reasonably certain is that they will be someform of regulation.</tt> [10  The Agency intendsto "propose" specific additional measures "[a]t the time a final rule ispublished."  60 Fed.

Moreover, FDA's failure to explain whatadditional measures it will impose under Section897.44 gives insufficientnotice of the Agency's intentions and impedes effective comment about theproposed rule.  Finally, Section897.44 constitutes arbitrary andcapricious decisionmaking.</tt><p><tt><b>		1</b>.  <b>Beyond FDA's Statutory Authority</b></tt><p><tt>	Section897.44 exceeds FDA's authority under Section 520(e).  Thatprovision authorizes restrictions on the "sale, distribution, or use" of adevice only when "there cannot otherwise be reasonable assurance of its safetyand effectiveness."  21 U.S.C. [[section]]360j(e)(1).  By definition,that statutory standard will not be satisfied in seven years, given FDA's viewthat cigarettes are irremediably harmful.  </tt><p><tt><b>		2.</b>  <b>Insufficient Notice</b></tt><p><tt>	If FDA, as part of any final rule, announces the additionalmeasures that it will impose-- and not simply propose, some time in thefuture-- the Agency will have failed to provide meaningful notice andopportunity to comment, as required by the Administrative Procedure Act (APA).5U.S.C. [[section]]553; see Davis K.C., Pierce R.J.Administrative Law Treatise 287-289,298-309(3d ed. 1994).  For there to be adequate public notice, a proposal must be madewith some specificity.  The Agency cannot expect the public to read its mind ordeduce the specific proposal from general references.  Shell Oil Co. v.EPA, 950 F.2d 741, 751 (D.C. Cir. 1991); Rodway v. UnitedStates Dep't of Agric., 514 F.2d 809, 814 (D.C. Cir. 1975).</tt><p><tt>	FDA conceives of the imposition of "additional measures" as a way tocreate incentives for tobacco manufacturers to "decide it is in their bestinterest to initiate or to increase their support of programs that discourageunderage purchasing of tobacco products."  60Fed. Reg. 41,366; seealso id. at 41,371.  How that incentive will operate depends bothon the goals that must be achieved and on the penalty-- in the form ofadditional regulation-- for failing to achieve them.  However, FDA hasnot explained how burdensome these undisclosed regulations will be or whichmembers of the tobacco industry would become subject to additional regulationshould the goals not be achieved.  Perhaps only manufacturers will be targetedfor further regulations, see 60 Fed. Reg. 41,371, but perhaps retailerswill be targeted as well.</tt> [11  As long asno one outside of FDA knows who will bear the burden of additional compliancecosts should the goals not be achieved, or even what these costs will be, it isimpossible for the public to evaluate the proposed goals.<p>	The prejudice that FDA's inadequate notice inflicts on public commentors willnot be cured when FDA proposes specific additional measures.  Some may arguethat FDA will be bound to follow Section897.44, and not be free to departfrom the rule's mandate that additional measures be imposed if its goals arenot achieved.  ]<tt>See Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass'n<i></i>v.<i> </i>State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 42 (1983)("an agency changing its course by rescinding a rule is obligated to supply areasoned analysis for the change beyond that which may be required when anagency does not act in the first instance").  Public comment about specificadditional measures that FDA may propose might be constrained by the arguablybinding effect of Section897.44.  For example, absent a new rulemaking,conditioning the imposition of additional measures on percentage declines intobacco use different from those contained in Section897.44 could be analternative effectively foreclosed.  </tt><p><tt>	The "notice" FDA has given resembles the notice held inadequate inUnited Church Board for World Ministries<i> </i>v.<i> </i>SEC,617 F.Supp. 837 (D.D.C. 1985).  In that case, the SEC commenced aninformal rulemaking in which it announced only that it was consideringrevisions to the percentage threshold in one of its rules.  The SEC did notspecify what the new threshold should be, whether the threshold should beincreased or decreased, or why the Agency believed the threshold should berevised.  The SEC then requested comment on the appropriate levels for thethreshold and subsequently promulgated a rule revising the threshold.  Thereviewing court held that the SEC had violated the APA's notice requirement,because "[i]nterested parties are unable to participate meaningfully in therulemaking process without some notice of the direction in which the agencyproposes to go."  Id<i>.</i> at 840.  The court also noted that, "[i]fthe SEC's direction was unknown, the agency was unprepared to propose arevision, let alone issue a final rule change."  Id<i>.</i>  Likewise,FDA should not have proposed Section897.44 until it was prepared tospecify additional measures.</tt><p><tt><b>		3.  Arbitrary and Capricious</b></tt><p><tt>	On a variety of grounds, Section897.44 is arbitrary,capricious, and therefore invalid.</tt><p><tt><b>			a.  Goal and Time Frame Arbitrarily Selected</b></tt><p><tt>	FDA has arbitrarily selected both the goal of a 50 percent reduction andthe time frame of seven years.  The Agency claims to base these selections onthe "Healthy People 2000" report's objectives, but the preamble discussionshows that neither the time frame nor the goals are directly comparable.See 60 Fed. Reg. 41,341 (the proposed rule modifies the age groups, thegoal, and the time frames).  </tt><p><tt>	Moreover, in formulating its proposed regulation, the Agency failed toconsider any alternatives to relying on the "Healthy People 2000" report.  Forexample, FDA fails to explain why seven years and not 10 years was chosen asthe necessary time frame, and why 50 percent rather than some other percentagewas selected as the necessary reduction.  FDA's proposal is thus arbitrary andunsupported by the record.  Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass'n v. State FarmMut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 46 (1983) (setting aside a rescission ofa rule where agency failed to consider alternative that appeared to promoteagency's policy objective); Small Ref. Lead Phase-Down Task Force v.EPA, 705 F.2d 506, 525 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (holding that an agency mustjustify why it chose one numerical standard rather than another).</tt><p><tt><b>			b.	No Demonstrated Need Now for Additional</b></tt><p><tt>				<b>Regulation in theFuture&nsp;</b></tt><p><tt></tt><p><tt>	FDA has assumed that, if a 50 percent reduction in underagetobacco use is not achieved in seven years, the reason will be that its accessand advertising restrictions were not strict enough, and that additionalregulations will be warranted.  This is pure speculation.  FDA cannotreasonably predict now that additional regulations would be justified if theAgency's goals are not achieved.  There are many plausible scenarios underwhich additional regulations would not be justified, even if the goals statedin Section897.44 are not met.  </tt><p><tt>	For example, the Agency's goals may not be met simply because theyarbitrarily define the patterns of decline in underage tobacco use that countas acceptable progress.  Section897.44 posits that only a 50 percentreduction in both underage smoking and underage smokeless tobaccouse qualifies as progress sufficient to avoid imposition of additionalregulations.  As FDA has formulated its goals, larger-than-expected reductionsin one product category do not offset smaller-than-expected reductions in theother.  Thus, were the proportion of youths who smoke cigarettes to fall by 60percent but the proportion using smokeless tobacco to fall only by 49 percent,the terms of Section897.44 apparently would require FDA to imposeadditional regulations.</tt> [12  FDA's proposalis unreasonable because no additional regulatory measures would be justifiedfor ]<tt>cigarettes if the specified reduction in cigarette use ismet, regardless of the outcome for other tobacco products.</tt><p><tt>	Another reason that the goals might not be met is that federal regulatorymeasures may not be (and, as we have shown in these comments, they, in fact,are very unlikely to be) an effective response to the problem of underagetobacco use.  As FDA itself acknowledges, "[t]he full realization of this goalwould require the active support and participation of State and localgovernments, civic and community organizations, tobacco manufacturers andretail merchants."  60 Fed. Reg. 41,359 (emphasis added).  FDA acknowledgesthat peer pressure and adolescent risk-taking contribute to the decision to usetobacco products, see 60 Fed. Reg. 41,329, and that some adults procuretobacco products for their underage friends and relatives, seeid<i>.</i> at 41,326.  FDA simply cannot regulate all of these factors,no matter how many additional restrictions the Agency imposes on the tobaccoindustry.</tt><p><tt>	If youth smoking fails to fall by 50 percent in seven years, it will notbe because FDA's proposed restrictions were not sufficiently severe, or becausethose restrictions were circumvented, but because those restrictions were aimedby the wrong agency at the wrong targets-- tobacco advertising andpromotion, event sponsorships, open-shelfdisplays, vending machines, and the like.  Extending the restrictions proposedby FDA, if youth smoking rates do not fall in response to its initialproposals, would be like ordering further "bleeding" of an eighteenth-centurypatient who did not respond to the initial treatment.</tt><p><tt>	Unable to control such future contingencies, Section897.44improperly aims to bind the Agency in the future by specifying steps that theAgency must take years hence if certain goals are not reached.  Theburden of justifying regulatory action at that time would be shiftedfrom those who customarily bear that burden (the proponents of regulatoryaction) to those urging that no further action is warranted or justified.  Sucha reversal of the burden of justifying agency action is a form of regulatoryprejudgment that is both improper and contrary to law.</tt><p><tt><b>			c</b>.  <b>Lack of Economic Justification</b></tt><p><tt>	FDA states that the purpose of Section897.44 is "to provide for anadditional incentive for the companies to take appropriate actions" to achievethe Agency's goal of reducing underage tobacco use by 50percent.  60 Fed.Reg. 41,341; see also id. at 41,371.  This is a form ofregulation, albeit through outcome-based incentives rather than direct command.Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act, Pub. L. No. 96-354,5 U.S.C. [[section]][[section]]601-612,and Executive Order 12,866, FDA must perform an economic analysis of theincentive effects of proposed Section897.44.</tt><p><tt>	FDA's "analysis" of the economic impact of Section897.44 is reportedin a single paragraph.  See 60 Fed. Reg. 41,367.  The Agency consideredonly the costs of implementing a program to monitor retail establishments, andit relied in part on purely hypothetical data.  This perfunctory "analysis" isclearly inadequate to justify or even explain the incentive effects ofSection897.44.  Indeed, until FDA determines what additional measures itwould impose under Section897.44, no economic analysis of the rule'sincentive effects is possible.</tt><p><tt>	Moreover, this analysis suggests that tobacco companies are not the propertarget of the incentives that Section897.44 creates.  FDAestimated-- inconsistently-- that, if tobacco manufacturersinstituted a retail surveillance program, the annual cost of the program wouldbe $35 million or $85 million.  60 Fed. Reg.41,367, 41,371.FDA notes, however, that "SAMHSA estimated that the establishment andimplementation of effective State-administered retail surveillancesystems would cost about $30 million annually."  60 Fed. Reg. 41,367(emphasis added).  Given these cost estimates, FDA ought to have recommendedthat the States, not tobacco companies, be given further incentives to controlunderage tobacco use.</tt> [13]<p><tt><b>			d.  Automatic Triggers Unreasonable</b></tt><p><tt>	By incorporating automatic triggers into its regulation, FDA has removedits ability to respond flexibly to future circumstances, without initiating arulemaking to revise the proposed rule.  For example, the same additionalregulatory measures apparently would be triggered at the specified dateregardless of whether the reduction in the next seven years is49.8percent or 2percent.  This would be an irrational andinappropriate result.  Yet this is the inevitable result of the automatictrigger that FDA has proposed.  Indeed, as noted, Section897.44 wouldreverse the usual regulatory scheme by placing on the opponents of additionalAgency action the burden of persuading the Agency to conduct a new rulemakingto permit it not to act-- rather than requiring the proponents offurther Agency action to persuade the Agency that such further action iswarranted.  </tt><p><tt>	Trying to select additional regulatory measures now to be appliedseven years in the future also deprives the public of a meaningful opportunityto comment, in violation of Section 553 of the APA, because no one,including the Agency, can anticipate what regulatory measures would or wouldnot be appropriate to future factual circumstances.  What FDA apparentlycontemplates is a second, more onerous, tier of undefined controls, which wouldbecome operative upon circumstances no one yet knows.</tt> [14  Without knowing those future circumstancesnow, it is impossible for the public to provide meaningful comment on whetheradditional controls would be appropriate.  FDA asks the public to buy a "pig ina poke."<p>	It is improper and unlawful to engage ]<tt>now in rulemaking withrespect to a set of facts that will exist seven years in the future and that noone --not the Agency, not other interested parties --now can predict.  By conducting the rulemaking now, FDA deprivesinterested parties of a meaningful opportunity to comment on regulations thatwill (contingently) take effect seven years in the future.  That deprivation isa denial of due process.  </tt><p><tt>	<b>PARTS 801, 803, 804</b></tt><p><p><tt><b>[[section]]801.61(d)--Statement of Identity</b></tt><p><p><tt>	Section 801.61(d) would exempt cigarettes and smokeless tobacco productsfrom the statement-of-identity requirements of 21 C.F.R.[[section]]801.61.</tt><p><p><tt><b>COMMENT</b></tt><p><tt>	FDA correctly recognizes that it cannot require the label of cigarettes tobear a statement of identity.  60 Fed.

[[section]]1459(a)(1).This exemption further confirms that "tobacco products" cannot be "drugs" or"devices" within the meaning of the FDCA.  The FPLA applies to any "consumercommodity," a term defined to include "drugs" and "devices" as defined in theFDCA, but that explicitly excludes tobacco products.  See<i></i>id. [[section]]1459(a) &amp; (a)(1).  This separate anddistinct treatment of drugs and devices on the one hand, and tobacco productson the other, is further evidence of Congress' determination that cigarettesare not within FDA's authority to regulate.</tt><p><tt></tt><p><tt><b>[[section]][[section]]803.1(d) and 804.1(d)--MedicalDevice Reporting</b></tt><p><tt>	Sections 803.1(d) and 804.1(d) would exempt cigarettes and smokelesstobacco products from the medical device reporting requirements of 21 C.F.R.pts. 803 and 804, respectively.</tt><p><p><tt><b>COMMENT</b></tt><p><tt>	FDA asserts that MDR reports would be of "little benefit" because "theadverse health effects attributable to cigarettes and smokeless tobaccoproducts are extensive and well-documented." 60 Fed. Reg. 41,342.  Cigarettes, indeed, should not be subject to MDRreporting because such requirements would be unduly burdensome and of nobenefit to FDA, Congress, or the public.  This exemption from the MDRregulations, however, once again demonstrates that FDA is attempting to rewritethe FDCA in order to apply it to cigarettes.  That it cannot do.</tt><p><tt>	Section 519(c) of the FDCA authorizes FDA to exempt a class of personsfrom MDR reporting requirements upon a finding that reporting for a device "isnot necessary to (A) assure that a device is not adulterated or misbranded or(B) otherwise to assure its safety and effectiveness."  21 U.S.C.[[section]]360i(c)(3).  Again, exempting cigarettes from MDR reportingunder these standards is inconsistent with FDA's determination to regulate themas restricted devices and to impose unprecedented restrictions on theiradvertising, promotion, distribution, and sale.</tt><p><p><tt><b>	COMMENTS ON FDA'S PROPOSED REGULATIONS:</b></tt><p><p><tt><b>EXECUTIVORDERS</b>/tt><p><p><p><tt>	FDA's proposal to restrict the sale and distribution of tobacco productsviolates three different Executive Orders:  (1)ExecutiveOrder12,606, 3C.F.R. 241 (1988 Comp.), which requires agencies toconsider the effect of proposed regulations on family formation, maintenance,and general well-being; (2)Executive Order12,612, 3C.F.R. 252(1988 Comp.), which requires agencies to examine whether proposed regulatoryactions would have a significant effect on federalism; and (3)ExecutiveOrder12,630, 3C.F.R. 554 (1988 Comp.), which directs agencies toanticipate the obligations imposed by the Just Compensation Clause of the FifthAmendment.</tt><p><h2>D.	  Executive Order 12,606</h2><tt><b>	</b></tt><p><tt><b>	</b>	Executive Order 12,606 requires executive agencies to assess anyregulation that may have a significant impact on family formation, maintenance,and general well-being in light of the considerations enumerated inSection1 of the Order.  FDA's conclusion that its proposed rule "has nopotential negative impact on family formation, maintenance, and generalwell-being," 60Fed. Reg.41,356, ignores many potential adverseconsequences of the proposed rule for families.</tt><h3>1.		The Proposed Regulations Will Impair </h3><tt>			<b>FamilyEarningsnbsp;</b></tt><p><p><tt>	FDA's perfunctory conclusion that the proposed regulations "will not haveany significant impact on family earnings," 60Fed. Reg.41,356,ignores the severe economic dislocations that the proposed regulations wouldinflict on numerous sectors of the economy.  FDA estimates that the reductionin cigarette sales that the proposed regulations would bring about "wouldresult in the displacement of about 1,000 jobs annually among warehousers,manufacturers, tobacco growers and wholesalers."  60Fed. Reg. 41,369.  Asdiscussed in greater detail below, the regulations would impose enormous costson retailers, vending machine operators, specialty goods manufacturers,publishers, outdoor advertisers, event promoters and the local communities thathost sponsored events, and local governments.  These costs will surely causebusinesses to close and employees to be terminated.  FDA has utterly ignoredthe inevitable effect on family earnings of the job losses that the proposedrule would cause.</tt><h3>2.		FDA Has Failed To Consider What Role</h3><tt><b>			the Family Should Play in Reducing</b></tt><p><tt>			<b>UnderageSmoking&bsp;</b></tt><p><p><tt>	Section1 of Executive Order12,606 requires agencies toconsider whether families rather than the federal government should address asocial problem:</tt><p><tt>	"(c)  Does this action help the family perform its functions, or does itsubstitute governmental activity for the function?</tt><p><p><tt>	*     *     *</tt><p><p><tt>	"(e)  Can this activity be carried out by a lower level of government orby the family itself?</tt><p><p><tt>	"(f)  What message, intended or otherwise, does this program send to thepublic concerning the status of the family?"</tt><p><p><tt>	Even though FDA indicates that its regulations are designed to assist "thesignificant majority of American families that seek to discourage theirchildren from using cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products," 60Fed.Reg.41,356, FDA did not consider what role families might play in thereduction of underage tobacco use.  FDA's prediction that "[t]he fullrealization of [the Agency's] goal would require the active support andparticipation of State and local governments, civic and communityorganizations, tobacco manufacturers, and retail merchants" inexplicably omitsfamilies from the list of entities that FDA believes are essential to reducingunderage smoking rates.  60Fed. Reg.41,359.  Although FDA suggeststhat families cannot control their children in the face of "[t]he pervasivepromotion and easy availability" of tobacco products, 60Fed.Reg.41,356, the Agency offers no evidence at all that this is the case.There may be another reason for this omission:  For FDA to admit that familiesexert a major influence over an adolescent's smoking status would undermine theAgency's attempt to blame underage smoking on the marketing practices oftobacco manufacturers and retailers.</tt><p><h2>E.	  Executive Order 12,612</h2><tt><b>	</b></tt><p><tt><b>	</b>	Executive Order 12,612 requires agencies "formulating regulationsthat have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship betweenthe national government and the States, or on the distribution of power andresponsibilities among the various levels of government" to be guided by thefundamental federalism principles enumerated in Section2 of the Order andto adhere to the federalism policymaking criteria enumerated in Section3and the special requirements for preemption listed in Section4.Nevertheless, FDA's proposed rule disregards the traditional police powers ofthe States with respect to protection of minors and regulation of retail salesin favor of a federal regulatory orthodoxy that is entirely withoutconstitutional or statutory authorization.</tt><h3>1.		The Proposed Rule Violates Constitutional and </h3><tt>			<b>Statutory Limits on FDA'sAuthority</b></t><p><p><tt>	The enumeration of fundamental federalism principles in Section2 ofExecutive Order 12,612, as well as Section3(a)'s direction that "[t]hereshould be strict adherence to constitutional principles," emphasizes theobvious point that agencies such as FDA must act only in accordance with theConstitution.  In addition, Section3(a) of the Order requires FDA to"closely examine the constitutional and statutory authority supportingany Federal action that would limit the policymaking discretion of the States"(emphasis added).  As has already been amply demonstrated, FDA lacks bothstatutory and constitutional authority to regulate tobacco products.</tt><p><tt>	In addition to the constitutional deficiencies noted elsewhere in thesecomments, the proposed rule would circumvent the States' ability to protecttheir sovereign powers through the political process in general and throughaccess to Congress in particular.  In Garcia v. San AntonioMetropolitan Transit Authority, 469 U.S. 528, 556 (1985), the Supreme Courtobserved that "the principal and basic limit on the federal commerce power" is"the built-in restraints that our system provides through state participationin federal governmental action.  The political process ensures that lawsthat unduly burden the States will not be promulgated."  (Emphasis added.)As the Court warned in Garcia, however, when the procedural safeguardsof the political process fail, the judiciary may intervene to assure that theState's most fundamental sovereign power is protected.  Id.at554.</tt><p><tt>	FDA's proposed regulations constitute precisely such a failure of theprocess-based protections of federalism.  Unlike Congress, whose members areboth representative of, and accountable to, the electorate, the unelectedregulators of FDA are largely insulated from the influences normally associatedwith the political process.  As a practical matter, the States have politicalaccess to Congress that they do not have to FDA.  In this case, the fact that asweeping displacement of State authority emanates from a federal administrativeagency, rather than directly from Congress, constitutes an abridgment of theStates' power to protect their interests through the political process.</tt><h3>2.		Youth Access to Tobacco Is an</h3><tt>			<b>Issue of State Concern       </b></tt><p><tt></tt><p><tt>	Section3(b) restricts federal interference with thepolicymaking discretion of the States to situations in which federal action "isnecessitated by the presence of a problem of national scope."  No such problemexists here.  Section3(b)(1) distinguishes between</tt><p><tt>"problems of national scope (which may justify Federal action) and problemsthat are merely common to the States (which will not justify Federal actionbecause individual States, acting individually or together, can effectivelydeal with them)."</tt><p><p><tt>FDA acknowledges that Executive Order12,612 predicates federalintervention in State affairs on the existence of a problem of national scopebut does not explain why underage smoking is such a problem.  See 60Fed. Reg. 41,357.</tt><p><tt>	FDA can offer no such explanation because the Agency's own discussion ofthe effectiveness of State and local access restrictions demonstrates that theproblem of underage tobacco use is merely common to the several States andlacks the sort of national character that requires a nationally uniformsolution.  FDA bases its conclusion that "[y]outh access restrictions have beenfound to be effective in reducing illegal sales" on the results of a localprogram maintained by the town of Woodbridge, Illinois.  60 Fed. Reg. 41,322.Indeed, that program produced declines in smoking rates among seventh andeighth graders greater than the declines that FDA has projected for itsproposed rule, and in considerably less time than the seven years that FDA hasallowed for its proposed rule to achieve even lesser results.  Seeid.  The success of this program highlights the fact that underagetobacco use is not the sort of problem that only nationally uniform regulationcan solve.</tt><p><tt>	By imposing a national orthodoxy of regulation, the FDA's proposal wouldsupersede State ability to fashion the best methods of implementing thenationally accepted goal of prohibiting the sale of tobacco products to minors.In so doing, FDA proposes to undermine one of the fundamental values of ourfederal system-- the ability of the States to act as "sociallaboratories."  See New State Ice Co. v. Liebmann, 285U.S. 262, 311 (1932) (Brandeis, J., concurring).  Under this "sociallaboratory" theory, States are allowed to experiment, on a smaller scale thanis possible at the federal level, with a variety of methods for addressingsocial problems.  FDA's proposal would stifle this State experimentation infavor of establishing uniform, national standards for regulating tobacco salesand advertising tobacco products.</tt><h3>3.		FDA Has Made No Attempt To Minimize</h3><tt><b>			the Conflict Between Its Proposed Rule</b></tt><p><tt>			<b>and the Discretion of theStates</b></tt><p><p><tt>	Section3(d)(2) of Executive Order 12,612 commands FDA to "[r]efrain,to the maximum extent possible, from establishing uniform, nationalstandards for programs" (emphasis added).  3C.F.R. 252.  FDA has made noattempt to determine whether the Agency's goal of reducing underage tobacco usecould only be achieved if the final rule includes all of the manyregulations that comprise its proposed rule.  FDA's shotgun approach evidencesa lack of concern for preserving the discretion of the States to establishtheir own methods for controlling underage tobacco use.</tt><p><h2>F.	  Executive Order 12,630</h2><p><tt>	Executive Order12,630 directs federal executive agencies to besensitive to interference with constitutionally protected property rights andto anticipate the obligations imposed by the Just Compensation Clause of theFifth Amendment.  FDA's sensitivity to such takings issues is slight at best.Although FDA acknowledges that restrictions on outdoor advertising, the vendingmachine ban, the elimination of self-service displays, the ban on brandednontobacco items, restrictions on the use of nontobacco product trade names,sponsorship restrictions, and new labeling requirements "might affect privateproperty," 60 Fed. Reg. 41,357, FDA somehow omitted from its takings analysisthe most blatant taking of all:  the requirement that manufacturers spend $150million annually to establish national educational programs.  Given FDA'sinability even to identify all of the takings issues that its proposed rulepresents, it is not surprising that FDA erroneously concluded that none of theregulations whose takings implications it did consider would effect a taking.See 60 Fed. Reg. 41,357.</tt><p><tt>	In addition to failing to recognize all of the takings issues that itsproposed rule presents, FDA nowhere has explained why it believes that therestrictions on property rights that the proposed rule would impose are nogreater than is necessary to achieve the desired reductions in underage tobaccouse, or why these restrictions are not disproportionate to the contributionthat the affected property allegedly makes to underage smoking.  FDA's failureto do so violates Executive Order12,630.  Section3(c) of the Orderstates that actions taken to protect the public health and safety</tt><p><tt>"should be undertaken only in response to real and substantial threats topublic health and safety, be designed to advance significantly the health andsafety purpose, and be no greater than is necessary to achieve the healthand safety purpose."  (Emphasis added.)  Executive Order 12,630, 3 C.F.R.554.  </tt><p><p><tt>In addition, Section4(d) of the Order requires, as a prerequisite toany proposed action regulating the use of private property for the protectionof public health and safety, that the Agency</tt><p><tt>"(1)  Identify clearly, with as much specificity as possible, the publichealth or safety risk created by the private property use that is the subjectof the proposed action;</tt><p><p><tt>(2)  Establish that such proposed action substantially advances thepurpose of protecting public health and safety against the specificallyidentified risk;</tt><p><p><tt>(3)  Establish to the extent possible that the restrictions imposed on theprivate property are not disproportionate to the extent to which the usecontributes to the overall risk ..." (emphasis added).Executive Order 12,630, 3 C.F.R. 554.  </tt><p><p><tt>	Perhaps FDA has failed to offer any explanation because it realizes thatdoing so would be impossible.  How, for example, does banning cigarette vendingmachines from factories and office cafeterias "substantially" or"significantly" advance the purpose of reducing underage smoking?  How can FDAestablish that the proposed restrictions on the tobacco industry's ability toadvertise in magazines and in retail outlets are not disproportionate to theextent to which such advertisements supposedly contribute to the risk ofunderage smoking, especially when there is no evidence that underagesmoking even is affected by such advertisements?  The answer to these questionsis simple:  FDA has not made the showing required by ExecutiveOrder12,630 because it cannot do so.</tt><p><tt><b>	COMMENTS ON FDA'S PROPOSED REGULATIONS:</b></tt><p><p><tt>	<b>ANALYSISOFIMPACTS</b></tt>p><p><p><tt>	Executive Order 12,866, 3 C.F.R. [[section]]199 (1993), theRegulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. [[section]][[section]]601 etseq., and the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995</tt> [15 all require FDA to analyze the economic impactof its proposed regulations.  FDA presents a single "Analysis of Impacts" inpurported satisfaction of these requirements.  ]<tt>See 60Fed.Reg. 41,359-72.  However, FDA's economic analysis is inadequate in severalrespects.  It greatly exaggerates the benefits and seriously underestimates thecosts of the proposed regulations.</tt> [16]Moreover, the Agency does not even attempt to determine whether any of thenumerous and undeniably burdensome components of the proposed regulations couldbe omitted, or replaced with less burdensome alternatives, without impairingthe Agency's goals.<p>	FDA's failure to meet its obligation to analyze the economic impact of theproposed regulations is sufficient ground for a court to strike down theregulations.  ]<tt>See, e.g., Small Refiner LeadPhase-Down Task Forcev. U.S.E.P.A., 705 F.2d 506, 539 (D.C.Cir. 1983) ("[A] reviewing court should consider the regulatory flexibilityanalysis as part of its overall judgment whether a rule is reasonable and may,in an appropriate case, strike down a regulation because of a defect in theflexibility analysis.").  The defective analysis FDA has performed fails tosatisfy FDA's obligations under the Executive Order, the Regulatory FlexibilityAct, and the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act, exposing the proposed regulation asan exercise in arbitrary and capricious decisionmaking.</tt><p><tt>	The Barents Group LLC, a KPMG Peat Marwick company, analyzed the economiccosts of the FDA's regulations in a study entitled The Costs of Proposed FDARegulations Regarding the Advertisement, Labeling and Sale of TobaccoProducts.17  That study, which appears in Volume XI of these comments,presents a more complete review of the quantifiable costs that the proposedregulations would entail.  Barents examines the likely costs of the regulationsto a wide variety of sectors that would be affected, and reviews the economicanalysis performed by FDA.  Barents offers corrections to the Agency'smethodology, and considers numerous costs FDA ignored.</tt><p><tt>	Barents concludes that the onetime costs associated with FDA'sproposed regulations are likely to be $748 million to $1.057billion in 1996 dollars-- nearly 30 times greater than theFDA's estimate of $26 to $39 million (in "old" dollars).</tt> [18  Barents estimates that the ]<tt>directrecurring costs from FDA's regulations would be $826million to$867 million.  Barents further estimates that, if the sectors of oureconomy respond to FDA's regulations in various ways, those recurring costscould become as much as $2.1billion to $4.1billion per year in1996 dollars-- about 10 to 18 times greater than FDA'sestimate of $227 million per year (in "old" dollars).</tt> [19<p>	Barents relied, in part, on data collected by A.T.Kearney, Inc., andreported in ]<tt>Inventory of Point of Sale Promotional Materials andEstimated Compliance Burden Associated with the Food and Drug Administration'sProposed Revisions Governing the Labeling, Advertising, Sale and Distributionof Tobacco Products.20  Kearney performed a series of "compliance-audits"to gather data to assist in determining the cost of complying with FDA'sproposed removal and inspection regulations (Section 897.12).  Kearney observedthe baseline conditions involving the display, promotion, handling and sale oftobacco products that exist in a broad cross-section of retail establishmentsin 25 communities throughout the United States.  Through initial on-sitevisits, the Kearney Study identified the actions that would be required tobring each retail establishment into compliance with the FDA's proposedregulations.  Kearney then determined a least-coststrategy and identified the level of effort and the likely bearer of the burdenfor each action required.  Kearney then performed on-site audits, which weretabulated and used to depict the typical compliance scenario for each type ofretail establishment.</tt> [21]<h2>G.		FDA Has Exaggerated the Benefits of the</h2><tt><b>		Proposed Regulations Because There Is No</b></tt><p><tt><b>		Record Support for FDA's Claim That They</b></tt><p><tt>		<b>Would Substantially Reduce Adult Smoking</b></tt><p><p><tt>	By FDA's own calculation, all of the benefits that supposedly will flowfrom the proposed regulations are based on the assumption that they eventuallywill reduce the number of adult smokers.  The Agency computes thesesupposed benefits in terms of such factors as lives saved, life-years saved,and reduced medical costs-- but each of these statistics flows from FDA'scalculation of reduced adult smoking rates.  60 Fed. Reg. 41,362-65.  Unlessthe regulations in fact will reduce the number of adult smokers, all of theAgency's benefit computations are illusory.</tt><p><tt>	In an attempt to show that the proposed regulations will reduce the numberof adult smokers, FDA assumes that most adults will never smoke unless theystarted doing so when they were underage.  Specifically, the Agency assumesthat (1) each year an estimated one million persons under the age of 18 beginto smoke; (2) anyone who begins to smoke under the age of 18 will thereaftercontinue to smoke for the rest of his or her life; (3) FDA's regulations wouldprevent about 500,000 of these one million youngsters from starting to smokeeach year; (4) 250,000 of the 500,000 youngsters would eventually start smokingafter they turned 18 years of age, and thus would not be affected by theregulations; but (5) the other half of the 500,000 youngsters, having notacquired a "smoking addiction" during their adolescence, would thereaftercontinue not to use tobacco for the rest of their lives.  60 Fed. Reg. 41,314,41,362-63.  In sum, according to FDA, the regulations ultimately should reducethe number of adult smokers by 250,000 for each year that they are in effect.Id. at 41,363.</tt><p><tt>	There is, however, no support in the record for FDA's claim that onemillion persons under the age of 18 begin to smoke each year or the Agency'sprediction that reducing the amount of underage smoking would significantlyreduce smoking by adults in subsequent years.</tt><h3>1.		FDA Has Exaggerated the Scope of the</h3><tt>			<b>Problem                             </b></tt><p><p><tt>	The cigarette manufacturers firmly believe that smoking should be limitedto adults.  The industry has undertaken extensive initiatives over the years toaddress the problem of underage smoking.  However, it is wrong to invoke orexaggerate the scope of any social issue in an attempt to justify an unlawfulexercise of power.  Unfortunately, it appears FDA has done just that.  TheAgency has failed to recognize the unreliability of the survey data that itcites as showing the prevalence of underage smoking.  Indeed, FDA's estimate ofthe prevalence of underage smoking is inconsistent with the Agency's otherassumptions about underage smoking.  Finally, FDA ignores recent changes inState law that may significantly reduce underage smoking without federalregulatory intervention.  In short, FDA lacks any foundation for its statementsabout the scope of this problem and the need for its regulations.</tt><h4>a.	  FDA's Survey Data</h4><tt><b>	</b>	First, FDA exaggerates the underage smoking problem byreferring to increases in youth smoking, and ignoring evidence that, in themain, underage smoking has been declining.  FDA claims that "smoking amongyoung people has begun to rise," 60 Fed. Reg. 41,315, and that 3000 youngpeople become regular smokers every day.</tt> [22  This "3000 per day" number is misleading ifused to refer to underage smokers, because it actually refers to the number of20-year-old]<tt>adults who begin smoking each year.</tt> [23  Moreover, a review of pertinent research,published in January 1995 but ignored by FDA, reports that "smoking [among 12-to 17-year-olds]declined in all surveys from 1974-1991."24 The 1993 Teenage Attitudes and Practices Survey ("TAPSII"), also ignoredby FDA, reveals that the incidence of underage smoking declined between 1989and 1993.  The TAPSII Study concluded that both daily smoking and anysmoking in the past 30days declined between the two surveys for underageteens.25]<tt></tt><p><tt><b>	</b>	Second, in estimating underage smoking prevalence, FDAerroneously treats the population of persons under the age of 18 as anundifferentiated group.  This leads to an exaggerated estimate of underagesmoking prevalence because it appears that many young people experimentwith cigarettes, but only a fraction are regular smokers by the timethey turn 18.  For example, one survey of young children reported that thenumber of smokers age 8 to 10 was greater than the number of smokers age11.</tt> [26  Several surveys have reported thatthe percentage of young people who use tobacco products]<tt>declines with school year, so that the percentage of collegestudents who smoke is lower than the percentage of high school seniors who doso, and the percentage of high school seniors who smoke is lower than thepercentage of high school freshmen who do so.</tt> [27  The TAPSII data indicate that underagesmokers are much less likely to be daily smokers than young adult smokers (18-to 22-year-olds),suggesting that those underage teens who indicated that they had smoked wereexperimenting.28]<tt></tt><h4>b.	  Recent Changes in State Law</h4><tt>	Nowhere in the preamble to the proposed regulations does FDA acknowledgethat there have been substantial governmental initiatives in the last few yearsto reduce underage tobacco use.  The Agency notes that "all States prohibit thesale of tobacco products to persons under the age of 18," 60 Fed. Reg. 41,315,but it does not reveal that this is a relatively recent development.  In 1992,Congress passed the ADAMHA Reorganization Act of 1992.  Pub. L.No.102-321.  That legislation added a new Section 1926 to the PublicHealth Service Act, 42 U.S.C. [[section]]300x-26, which requires eachState, as a condition of receiving federal substance abuse prevention andtreatment block grants, to have in effect a law prohibiting the sale anddistribution of tobacco products to individuals under 18.[[section]]1926(a)(1).  The statute requires States to enforce those laws"in a manner that can reasonably be expected to reduce the extent to whichtobacco products are available to individuals under the age of 18."[[section]]1926(b)(1).  To promote compliance, States are directed toconduct random, unannounced inspections of locations at which tobacco productsare sold, [[section]]1926(b)(2)(A), and States must submit annual reportsto the Secretary of Health and Human Services describing their enforcementactivities during the preceding year and their enforcement strategies for theupcoming year.  [[section]]1926(b)(2)(B).  If a State fails todemonstrate a reasonable effort to enforce the law prohibiting tobacco sales tominors, or if it fails to report the extent of its success toward that end,then it will lose between 10percent and 40percent of its blockgrant funds.  [[section]]1926(c).</tt><p><tt>	Three important points follow from the recent governmental initiativesagainst underage smoking.  First, if FDA were truly objective, it wouldacknowledge that it is too early to tell whether the recent State legislationenacted in response to Section1926 will succeed in curtailing tobaccosales to minors.  Section 1926's deadline for States to have enacted a minimumage law was October1, 1994.  Moreover, until Section 1926 took effect, anumber of States set 16 or 17 as the minimum age for purchasing tobaccoproducts, and four States did not set any minimum age.</tt> [29  The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and theNational Cancer Institute (NCI) have confirmed that "the visibility andenforcement of youth access laws has increased since July 1992," noting that"[s]ince July 1992, a total of 30 state legislatures have passed additionallaws to prevent youth access."30<p>	Indeed, several of the authorities cited by FDA conclude that "activeenforcement of [State] age restriction laws on tobacco sales can lower theprevalence of smoking among teenagers."31  If programs under Section1926to enforce minimum age laws in all States are fully implemented, the problem ofyouth access to tobacco products could be effectively eliminated--without resort to federal regulatory intervention.  As the Department of Healthand Human Services (HHS) has stated, "[t]here are straightforward enforcementapproaches [under State law] which can eliminate almost all sales to minorswhile yielding revenues sufficient to cover the cost of enforcement.  Teenagesmoking can be greatly reduced without disruption either to governments or tosales to adults."32  HHS has further stressed:<p>	"Unlike some other law enforcement problems, this is neither inherent orinsuperable.  Eliminating virtually all sales to minors does not even presentparticularly difficult enforcement problems."  58 Fed. Reg. 45,165.<p><p>FDA itself cites youth access "success stories" that have not involved thedraconian controls now proposed by the Agency.  60 Fed. Reg. 41,322.  FDA,however, chose to rely on 1990 and 1992 reports regarding State enforcement ofminimum sales age laws-- reviewing efforts that predated the enactment ofSection1926-- to justify its conclusion that the federal governmentmust step in.33]Second, because FDA has failed even to consider thepossibility that recent changes in State and federal laws may eliminate theproblem of underage smoking, it follows that FDA's rulemaking proposal ispremature at best.  The proposal is also contrary to the AdministrativeProcedure Act, 5 U.S.C. [[section]]553, because an agency's failure toconsider regulatory alternatives-- including the alternative of awaitingfurther developments in the States-- is arbitrary and capricious.</tt> [34  FDA avoids considering the possibility thatthe recent State law initiatives prompted by Section1926 may moot theAgency's asserted concerns by pretending that its regulations are merelyintended to "assist [the] States" in fulfilling their obligations underSection1926.  60 Fed. Reg. 41,357.  The States, of course, have requestedno such "assistance."  <p>	In any event, it is the province of SAMHSA-- not FDA-- to provideany "assistance" that States may desire in connection with Section1926.FDA's proposed regulations, far from "complement[ing]" State programs, as FDAclaims, 60 Fed. Reg.41,357, would utterly supplant them.  FDA's failureto consider the fact that the States in fact are moving to address the problemof youth access on their own violates Executive Order 12,866, 3C.F.R.[[section]]199 (1993), and the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C.[[section]][[section]]601 ]<tt>et seq., both of whichrequire FDA to analyze all costs and benefits of available regulatoryoptions.</tt><p><tt>	Third, the recent changes in the legal environment just mentionedcall into question almost all of the data about underage smoking on which FDArelies.  For example, FDA asserts that approximately three million childrenunder the age of 18 are daily smokers.  60 Fed. Reg. 41,317 &amp; n.15.  Thesource cited for this dubious statistic is a 1990 article, which in turn relieson telephone surveys seeking "retrospective data on the age of initiation ofdaily smoking" that were conducted in 1979 and in 1986.35  Even if onebelieves that three million people under the age of 18 were daily smokers in1979 or in 1986-- and there are good reasons for doubting thatclaim-- it simply does not follow that there are three million peopleunder the age of 18 who are daily smokers today.  The data on which FDA relies,assuming they accurately reflect underage smoking prevalence in 1979 and 1986,are plainly outdated.</tt><p><tt>	Similarly, FDA states that "youngsters under the age of 18 consume318million packs of cigarettes per year, leading to industry profits of$117million."  60 Fed. Reg. 41,366.  FDA derived this statistic from areport in a 1994 article that people under the age of 19 smoked516million packs of cigarettes in 1991.36  What the Agency'sreasoning overlooks, however, is that a significant portion of the sales topeople under the age of 18 was in fact lawful in 1991, before thechanges in the legal environment discussed above.  FDA has no basis forassuming that the same number of persons under the age of 18 are smoking today,or that they are consuming the same number of packs.</tt><h4>c.	  FDA's Conflicting Assumptions</h4><tt><b>	</b>	FDA's assumptions about the frequency of underage smoking are alsoinconsistent with one another.  On the one hand, FDA assumes that adolescentsunder the age of 18 consume 318million packs of cigarettes per year, or6.4 billion cigarettes per year.  Id.  On the other hand, FDAasserts that there are three million daily adolescent smokers under the age of18 who smoke an average of nearly 14 cigarettes each day-- a total of15.3 billion cigarettes a year.  Id. at 41,317.  Which is thecorrect figure?  6.4billion?  15.3 billion?  Some other number?  Both ofFDA's estimates, of course, cannot be right.</tt><p><tt><b>	</b>	FDA derived its 318-million-pack figure by subtracting sales to18-year-olds from the total of 516million packs supposedly consumed in1991 by people under the age of 19.  FDA's calculations show that it assumedthat 198million packs were consumed by 18-year-olds.  60 Fed. Reg. 41,372n.39.  This assumption, however, conflicts with still other assumptions thatFDA made.  If 18-year-olds had consumed 198million packs, then the annualprofit from sales to 18-year-olds would have to be $73million(because FDA asserts that the industry derives $117million in annualprofits from the 318million packs sold to people under 18, and the profitmargin per pack is obviously the same regardless of the purchaser's age).  60Fed. Reg. 41,366.  Elsewhere in its preamble, however, FDA explains thatraising the legal age for purchase from 18 to 19 "would have added costs ofabout only $34million annually, mostly due to lost producerprofits."  60 Fed. Reg. 41,371 (emphasis added).  Is the correct figure $73million?  $34 million?  Some other sum?  Clearly, FDA is pulling numbers out ofthe air.  </tt><h3>2.		FDA Has Not Shown That Underage Smoking</h3><tt><b>			Is a Significant Determinant of Adult</b></tt><p><tt>			<b>Smoking                                </b></tt><p><p><tt>	Even if one accepted FDA's estimate that one million people under the ageof 18 begin to smoke each year-- and for the reasons discussed above thatassumption is entirely unsupported-- FDA's assessment of the benefitsthat supposedly would result from its regulations contains a serious logicalflaw.  FDA suggests that the proposed regulations would not produce anybenefits if it merely resulted in delaying the time when these one millionpeople began to smoke until they were over 18.  See 60 Fed. Reg.41,363.</tt><p><tt>	Instead, the Agency states that the beneficiaries of the proposedregulation "are those individuals who would otherwise become addicted totobacco early in life, but who are unlikely to start using tobacco productsas an adult."  Id. (emphasis added).  Thus, in order to demonstratethe supposed benefits of its proposals, FDA contends that they will stop asmany as 250,000 people a year from using tobacco for the rest of their lives.Id. at 41,362-63.  FDA's assumption that the proposed regulation willprevent 250,000 people each year from becoming lifetime smokers, however, isnot supported by logic or by evidence of record.  The only evidence cited byFDA to defend this assumption is a statement in the 1994 Surgeon General'sReport that 82percent of persons (aged 30 to 39) who reported "eversmoking" on a daily basis also said that they "began" to smoke before the ageof 18.</tt> [37] It simply does not follow fromthis statistic, however, that reducing the prevalence of underage smoking willreduce the prevalence of adult smoking.]First, the smokers discussed by the Surgeon General's Reportwere born between 1955 and 1964 and reached their adolescence during the1970s-- a time when smoking by persons under the age of 18 was stilllegal in many States and in any event was more socially acceptable than it istoday.  Data regarding initiation and prevalence among that cohort isoutdated.</tt><p><tt>	Second, and more important, FDA has confounded mere sequence withcausation.  It simply does not follow as a matter of logic that adults will notsmoke if they did not start smoking as adolescents.  The fact that many adultsmokers experimented with tobacco before they were 18 does not proveanything about whether, had they not done so, they would have started tosmoke at a later age.  (Even FDA does not claim that its regulations willcompletely prevent adolescents from experimenting with tobacco.)Adolescent tobacco use obviously is not a precondition of adult tobaccouse.  The Department of Health and Human Services, in a 1990 report toCongress, indicated that more than half of all current smokers (53.3percent) started after they had reached the age of 18.38  Among blacks,nearly 70 percent started after reaching the age of 18.</tt> [39<p>	Conceding this logical deficiency, FDA emphasizes that its regulations "wouldstill yield impressive results" even if the annual reduction in lifetimesmokers were only 25,000 a year instead of 250,000.  60 Fed. Reg. 41,365.  FDAis saying, in effect, that its regulations would produce sufficient benefits tojustify the resulting costs even if they prevented only ]<tt>10percent of the target population of one million from becoming smokers.  FDAis wrong to assume, however, that its regulations are justified regardless oftheir costs simply because any reduction in the number of young peoplewho become smokers is, in the Agency's view, a "good thing."  Nevertheless, thenumber of young people that FDA's regulations would prevent from becomingsmokers is critical to determining whether the regulations are justified,because other means that would produce the same result at a lesser cost alsoare available.</tt><p><tt>	Clearly, FDA knows that its estimates of the likely success of itsregulations are wholly speculative and ultimately arbitrary.  Just as clearly,however, this is of no concern to FDA.  FDA's willingness to adjust the numberof supposed beneficiaries under the regulations by a full order of magnitudeconfirms the speculative and arbitrary nature of FDA's benefitcalculations.</tt><h3>3.	  FDA Overestimates Benefits from Reduced</h3><tt>		    <b>Fire Costs and Productivity Gains      </b></tt><p><p><tt>	The infirmity of FDA's benefits calculation is further illustrated by itseffort to magnify the financial benefits of less smoking by adults.  </tt><h4>a.	  Reduced Fire Costs</h4><tt>	FDA erroneously predicts savings as a result of avoided cigarette relatedfires.  60 Fed. Reg. 41,364.  FDA claims that cigarettes are involved in firesthat cause $318million in property damage each year, and that "[i]f thenumber of fires fell by the same percentage as the expected reduction incigarette sales," this would save $24million in property damage eachyear, which is 7.5percent of the total dollar value of annualfire-related property damage.  </tt><p><tt>		These arbitrary assumptions, however, take no account of the reality thatthere has been a substantial and continuing decline for more than a decade inthe number of fires, fire deaths, and injuries caused by careless smokingand that this decline has little relation, if any, to changes in cigaretteconsumption.  From 1983 through 1992, residential fires caused by carelesssmoking have declined by 39 percent, while residential fire deaths caused bycareless smoking have declined by 40 percent.</tt> [40  The fact that these declines occurredindependent of consumption trends is demonstrated by a dramatic 45 percentdecline from 1980 through 1989 (the last year for which these calculations areavailable) in the number of residential fires per billion cigarettesconsumed.41<p>	It is thus incorrect for FDA to count as a benefit the reduction of firescaused by careless smoking because the number of fires caused by carelesssmoking has been declining and is likely to continue to decline without theregulations.]<h4>b.	  Productivity Gains</h4><tt>	FDA suggests that smoking results in $12.3 billion in lost wages due to"tobacco-relatedwork absences."  60 Fed. Reg. 41,364.  The Agency estimates that itsregulations, by preventing 250,000 youths per year from smoking, would avoid$879 million per year in such lost wages.  Id.  It has not beenestablished, however, that smokers miss work more often than nonsmokers becauseof their smoking.  FDA should not have included this supposed savings in itsestimate of the benefits of the proposed regulations.</tt><p><tt>	The large majority of studies that report an association between smokingstatus and increased absenteeism from work acknowledge that factorsother than smoking may account for the apparent association.  AsProfessors RobertD. Tollison and RichardE. Wagner commented intheir 1992 study of the issues:</tt><p><tt>"[S]mokers and nonsmokers are not identical in all respects other thansmoking.  Among other things, smokers have an above-average representation inblue collar occupations, they also consume on average an above-average amountof alcohol, although there are many teetotaling smokers and nonsmokingalcoholics, and they generally exercise less than nonsmokers, although smokingbicyclists, swimmers, and joggers can be found.  In assuming that people areidentical except for their smoking, various diseases and their associated costsare improperly attributed to smoking."</tt> [42<p><p>	Thus, James Athanasou, an antismoking advocate, stated in an early reviewarticle:<p>"Sickness absence is a complex behavioral phenomenon in which a multiplicity ofhealth, social and psychological factors areinvolved....  None of the reported studies hasconsidered the additional effects on sickness absence of job satisfaction,attitudes to work, personality, other psychosocial or socioeconomic variablesand the urban factor in conjunction with the effects of smoking."43<p><p>	A more recent study, by Gabel and Colley-Niemeyer, is instructive.  Theseresearchers investigated absenteeism among employees of a State public healthdepartment in the United States in a 1990 study.  Although they found a higherrate of absenteeism among smokers than nonsmokers, they also suggested that "inaddition to education level and sex, selected lifestyle behavior may be relatedto smoking [that] may significantly influence sick leave and absenteeism."44FDA's benefits from productivity gains are illusory without reliable evidencethat smokers are less productive because of their smoking.  As the editor ofthe journal in which the study appeared stated, "separating absenteeismdifferences in smokers and nonsmokers is difficult if these two groups ofworkers differ in other health-related behavior."45]<h2>H.		FDA Has Failed To Take into Consideration the</h2><tt>		<b>Enormous Costs of the Proposed Regulations   </b></tt><p><p><tt>	Whereas the supposed benefits of the proposed regulation are speculative,its economic costs are certain to be enormous.  FDA's regulations fail to givethese costs serious consideration.  Indeed, the Agency has underestimated thetotal cost of its proposal by hundreds of millions of dollars, because it hasunderestimated, disregarded, or simply overlooked many of the specific costsentirely.  These costs are discussed below and reviewed in greater detail inthe attached study by the Barents Group.</tt><p><tt>	To take just one example, the only job losses included in FDA'sregulatory cost analysis are predicted to occur in the tobacco industry.  TheAgency estimates that approximately 10,000 jobs will be lost during the next 10years in the tobacco warehousing, manufacturing, and farming sectors as aresult of the reduced demand for cigarettes that supposedly will result if theproposed regulations are promulgated.  60 Fed. Reg. 41,369.  Although FDAadmits that "certain other industry sectors" will also experience "lost salesand employment" as a result of its regulations, id. at 41,365, it doesnot bother to quantify those costs because "these effects would be largelyoffset by gains to other sectors...."  Id.  Thisis tantamount to saying that FDA's proposed regulations will impose no netcosts because they will simply shift dollars from A to B.  The world as a wholewill be no poorer as a result.  Under this reasoning, however, few if anyregulations could ever be said to impose "net" costs, since money not spent inone place will eventually be spent in another.  Such spurious reasoning--ignoring all accepted rules for conducting cost-benefitanalyses-- reduces cost-benefitanalysis to an empty (and pointless) exercise.</tt><p><tt>	As demonstrated below, the costs of FDA's proposed regulations would beenormous.  The following discussion is organized in terms of the economicsectors that would be affected most directly by FDA's proposed regulation.There are nine such sectors:  (1)retailers; (2)vending machineoperators; (3)the print advertising industry; (4)the outdooradvertising industry; (5)athletic and sporting events; (6)thetobacco industry; (7)suppliers of promotional items to the tobaccoindustry; (8)local governments; and (9)consumers.  FDA hassignificantly underestimated (if not entirely ignored) the adverse economicimpact of its proposed regulation on each of these sectors.</tt><h3>1.	  The Retail Sector</h3><tt>	FDA's proposal would require a change of unprecedented magnitude in theway that cigarettes and other tobacco products are sold at retail in the UnitedStates.  As detailed in VolumesVI and VII, the regulations would imposerestrictions on cigarette advertising that would amount to an outright ban;outlaw cigarette vending machines and self-service displays (even for cigarettecartons); prohibit use of functional items (such as clocks and newsracks)bearing cigarette logos and other brand designs; and require retailers toverify, by means of photographic identification containing the bearer's date ofbirth, that purchasers are not under age; and mandate other actions byretailers to ensure compliance.</tt><p><tt>	FDA predicts that the proposed regulation would impose a one-time cost onretailers of $11million and annual costs of$52million.  This estimate represents the costs of reconfiguringstores to comply with the self-service ban ($11million),</tt> [46 the costs of training clerks to check customerI.D. ($10million/year), the added labor costs incident to checking I.D.'s($28million/year), and the cost of selling all tobacco products inface-to-face transactions ($14million/year).  ]<tt>See 60 Fed.Reg. 41,367-68.  In contrast, Barents estimates that the total onetime costs toretail outlets will range between $532 million and $744 millionwith annual recurring costs of $868 million to $1.443billion.47</tt><p><tt>	The Agency's cost projections are so unreasonably low that FDA itself doesnot consistently stand by them.  In its analysis of the small business impactsof the proposed regulation, FDA estimates the first-year compliance costs thatsmall retail stores such as convenience stores would bear will be $320 perstore for establishments that do not currently verify customers' age alreadyand $35 per store for those that do.  Id. at 41,370.  But, given thatFDA assumes that there will be 645,000 "smaller" retail outlets selling tobaccoproducts after implementation of the proposed regulations, and that 80% of themwill not have already been checking I.D.'s, see id. at 41,367,FDA's own numbers imply that the first-year costs for small retailers alonewill approach $170million-- more than double the $63 million(combined one-time and annual) cost estimate for both small and largerretailers offered elsewhere.</tt><p><tt>	FDA has good reason to ignore its own cost estimates.  Moreover, FDA hasignored completely other costs that the proposed regulations will impose onretailers.  In fact, the economic impact of the proposed regulations on retailoutlets will be so vast that it is likely to cause a significant number ofsmall retailers to close their doors.</tt><h4>a.	  Onetime Costs To Reconfigure Stores</h4><tt>	FDA estimates that a onetime expenditure of $22.5million, which FDAassumes retailers and manufacturers will share equally, will suffice to"reconfigure" stores to comply with the Agency's self-service ban, in-storeadvertising and labeling restrictions, and other requirements.</tt> [48<p>	The Kearney Study divides the cost of complying with the FDA's regulationsinto four major components.  The first cost component reflects labor costs,such as the labor cost associated with removing noncomplying items from retailstores.  Based upon on-site visits and analysis, Kearney indicates whether thelabor required is likely to be performed by retailers, manufacturer'srepresentatives, distributors, contractors, or others.  This labor cost isexpressed in hours of labor required because Kearney is not certain who will]<tt>actually perform the removal in each specific instance, and whowill ultimately bear responsibility for this cost.</tt> [49  For example, Kearney determined the]<tt>labor cost for removal and installation of just one newattached display case is $150.</tt> [50]<p>	The second cost component used by Kearney is the cost associated withmodifying existing material and structures to comply with the regulations.Placing locking devices on self-service displays and the material costsassociated with removing or covering up point-of-purchase advertising are twoexamples of this second cost component.51<p>	The third cost component is the cost of replacing items that are banned orwhich cannot be economically modified to comply with the regulations.  Forexample, small self-service countertop displays would have to be replaced withalternative behind-the-counter displays.52<p>	Kearney notes that the fourth separate cost component is the costs ofwarehousing, shipping, assembling and labeling (which involves additional laborcosts not included on the first component).  Kearney states that in addition tothe purchase price of the replacement case, distribution services contractorsimpose costs of roughly $185 for warehousing, delivering, assembling, stacking,and placing the typical display case.53  The fourth component is similar to thefirst in that both include installing the new item; but each component is alsodistinct in that the first is borne by ]<tt>retailers, whereas thefourth will be borne by distributors.</tt><p><tt>	Each of these component costs were considered by Kearney to determine theleast-cost scenario for the typical retail store to be brought into compliance.Thus, Kearney only uses the costs associated with replacing items, when thecosts of modifying them are greater.  Ironically, replacement is often theleast costly scenario because many items such as display cases are custom-madeor cannot be easily modified.</tt> [54]<h5>(i)	  Advertising and Labeling Restrictions</h5><tt>	FDA completely ignores the costs to retailers of complying with theadvertising and labeling restrictions, which will require the removal of allfunctional items (clocks, newsracks, etc.) from the store that bear brandlogos, designs and other graphics, and the replacement of all utilitarian itemsso removed.  FDA has not attempted to calculate the cost of bringing retailoutlets into compliance with the prohibition on noncomplying advertising andother items at the point of sale.  </tt><p><tt>	This omission is stunning.  The Kearney Study reports that a typicalconvenience store displays more than six pieces of promotional material--including movable signboards, decals, posters, movable window signs andbanners-- on the outside of the store.</tt> [55  Convenience stores that sell gasolinegenerally display more than four such items per store.56  A typical supermarketand a typical convenience store display or use in excess of 14 pieces ofpromotional material and/or equipment on the inside of the store, includingposters, lighted signs, clocks, "open"/"closed" and similar decals, ashtrays,change trays, newsstand racks, shopping baskets and shopping carts.57  Theseitems generally are provided by cigarette manufacturers at no cost to theretailers.  Retailers, of course, utilize the exterior advertising andpromotional materials to attract customers; they utilize the interioradvertising and promotional materials to promote sales. <p>	The utilitarian items are, of course, used for functional purposes, and wouldhave to be replaced-- with functional items that are ]<tt>notbranded.  Retailers or manufacturers would incur the cost of replacing thebranded items with comparable items that comply with the new regulations.  Itis utterly arbitrary for FDA to assume that all branded items would simplydisappear without any cost to retailers.</tt><p><tt>	The labor cost alone to remove and replace these advertisingdisplays and branded utilitarian items is estimated by Barents to range between$23 million and $32 million.58  This labor cost does notinclude the cost of replacing the useful utilitarian items (which are not usedfor tobacco display), such as shopping baskets, by either obtaining them fromother manufacturers or buying new ones.</tt> [59]<h5>(ii)	  Self-ServiceBan</h5><tt>	The Agency assumes that only 42,000 of its upper estimate of 700,000retail outlets (or 6 percent) expected to sell cigarettes after implementationof its regulations would need to renovate their facilities, at a total cost of$12.6million, or an average of only $300 for materials, labor, andassociated costs per store.</tt> [60]  FDAassumes that approximately another 480,000 retail outlets would be able tocomply with the self-service display ban simply by "relocating" their stock, ata total one-time cost of only $9.9million, and that the remaining nearly180,000 retail outlets would have to make no changes whatsoever.]<tt>See 60 Fed. Reg. 41,367.  FDA further assumes that only theself-service display ban would require retailers to alter the physicalfacilities of their stores.</tt><p><tt>	In fact, the onetime costs to bring the physical facilities of retailstores into compliance with the proposed regulation will far exceed$22.5million.  FDA underestimates the costs of reconfiguring stores tocomply with the self-service display ban by undercounting the number of storesthat would have to reconfigure their facilities and by underestimating the costof the required modifications. </tt><p><tt>	The premise that most retail outlets will be able to eliminateself-service sales without having to change their physical plant in any way iswholly arbitrary.  It rests on FDA's assumptions that (1)stores sellingcigarettes by the carton are the only ones that would need to make renovationsto their physical plant as a result of the self-service ban and(2)cigarette cartons are sold only in the 56,000 largest retail outletsin the country.</tt><p><tt>	First, FDA's assumption that remodeling would not be required inretail outlets that sell cigarettes only by the package is manifestlyincorrect.  Many of these stores are small and already crowded.  In suchoutlets, there is often barely enough room behind the counter for thesalesclerk to turn around.  In such stores, either the area behind the counterwould have to be expanded if self-servicedisplays were banned, or the retailer would have to substantially cut back onthe number or variety of cigarettes that he stocks.  FDA improperly ignoredthese costs.</tt> [61]]Second, FDA has undercounted the number of retail firms thatwould have to make substantial physical changes to continue to sell cigarettes.The Agency assumes without any evidence that only the 56,000 largest retailoutlets in the country, composed of about 23,000 supermarkets, 12,800 generalmerchandise stores, and 20,200 chain drugstores, sell large volumes ofcigarettes by the carton.  Id.  Thus, there are an additional 50,000stores in the United States classified as "supermarkets" not included by theFDA in its estimate because they are supposedly not large enough.</tt> [62  Even if these additional supermarkets do notsell most of their cigarettes by the carton, their self-service carton displaycases must still be removed or replaced.  As a result, even if FDA were correctin assuming that cigarettes are sold by the carton in large volumes only in thelargest supermarkets and other retail stores, the Agency has undercounted bynearly 50,000 the number of such establishments that would need to makephysical changes to eliminate the self-service sale of all tobacco products.<p>	FDA then compounds its error by seriously underestimating the average cost ofthe physical renovations that would be needed in order to comply with theself-service ban.  FDA ignores the significant investment that is representedby the self-service shelving systems currently used by both large and smallretail establishments to display cigarette cartons.  The average cost per storeto replace such displays will be over $1,600 for supermarkets and up to $2,229for tobacco specialty stores.63]Third, as a practical matter, FDA's regulations mandate thatall of these self-service displays either be replaced by locked display casesor be taken out of service.  In many cases, the cost of installing a suitablelock (i.e., retrofitting) is estimated by Barents to cost as muchas replacing the displays with new ones because many of these displays arecustom-made and would have to be shipped back to the manufacturer, modified andthen shipped back to the retailer.</tt> [64]The cost of simply taking a unit out of service is the undepreciated capitalinvestment plus the cost of removal and disposal.<p>	Barents estimates the total onetime cost to retailers to replace or modifydisplay items and useful utilitarian items, such as shopping baskets, to bebetween ]<tt>$325 million and $455 million.65  Obviously,these cost figures for one component of the retail sector's obligations dwarfthe FDA's $22.5 million estimate for this whole category.  Of course, the costof changing a store's physical plant to comply with the self-service ban wouldbe even greater if, instead of simply adding locks to existing display units,the store built a special tobacco control area with its own floor plan, storagearea, customer service counters, cash registers, and so on.</tt><p><tt>	Correcting FDA's underestimations and omissions results in a much largerestimate of the cost to bring the physical facilities of retail stores intocompliance with the proposed regulation.  The Kearney Study found thatreconfiguring the typical supermarket or grocery store to comply with theproposed rule would cost approximately $905 (compared to FDA's $300 estimate)and would require nearly six hours of labor by the employees of the retailerand the sales representatives of the tobacco companies.</tt> [66  The Kearney Study also estimates that inorder to bring the typical convenience store into compliance, it will costapproximately $452 (compared to FDA's $300 estimate) and over 3.6hours oflabor by retailer employees and tobacco company sales representatives.67 <p>	As noted, replacing noncomplying utilitarian and display items would costretailers between $325million and $455million.68  The total cost toretailers of these estimates for all utilitarian and display items for bothlabor and material range from ]<tt>$347 million to$486million.69  Thus, FDA's estimate that converting the physicalfacilities of retail stores will cost only $22.5million misses the markby over $325 million to $465 million.70</tt><h4>b.	  Retailer Training Costs (Section 897.10)</h4><tt><b>	</b></tt><p><tt><b>	</b>	Section 897.10 requires each retailer to "ensur[e] that thecigarettes and smokeless tobacco products it... distributes,sells, or otherwise holds for sale comply with all applicable requirementsunder this part."</tt> [71]  Meeting thisrequirement will require both trained salesclerks andmanagers.]<tt></tt><h5>(i)	  Cost of Training Salesclerks</h5><tt>	FDA has substantially understated the cost to retailers of trainingsalesclerks to comply with the proposed regulation for five reasons.  FDA'sinitial projection of this cost is only $16million a year, reflecting theAgency's use of wholly outdated compensation data and its assumption that therequisite training can be provided in only a few minutes.  Based upon a findingthat effective training may be in place in one-thirdof retail outlets already, FDA reduces its estimate of training costs by aboutone-third,to $10 million.  For at least five reasons, the Agency's estimates are much toolow.</tt><p><tt>	First, the Agency uses out-of-datedata on employee compensation.  FDA uses nine-year-oldpayroll data from 1986, when the average retail employee annual compensationwas only $15,410, resulting in an average hourly wage of $7.70.  60 Fed. Reg.41,367.  Since 1986, compensation costs have increased by about 30 percent.  In1994, the most recent year for which data are available, retail employeeaverage total hourly compensation was $9.51.</tt> [72  As Barents concluded, "[t]his correction,alone, raises FDA's cost estimate from $10 million to $13.3 million."73]Second, the Agency dramatically underestimates the amount oftime required to train each retail employee.  FDA simply assumes, withoutoffering any support, that only 15 minutes of training would be sufficient toteach each salesclerk both about the new regulations and about how to checkI.D.'s (in establishments that do not currently check I.D.'s).  60 Fed. Reg.41,367.</tt><p><tt>	In fact, when State government agencies and private sector companiesundertake to train retail employees on how to check customer identification inconnection with the sale of alcoholic beverages, they actually spend severalhours doing so.</tt> [74]  For example,according to a Virginia State agency, ]<tt>two hours, not 15minutes, are needed to train employees how to identify valid I.D.'s foralcoholic beverage sales.  Private sector training companies typically takeabout two hours of employee time and charge between $10-15per employee for I.D. verification training.</tt> [75]<tt></tt><p><tt>	Third, FDA also completely ignores the actual cost of hiringor contracting with professional trainers to provide the training to employees.The Barents Study estimates this cost of the training itself to range from$40million to $56million.</tt> [76]<tt></tt><p><tt>	Fourth, the Agency further assumes, again offering nosupport for its assumption, that no time is necessary to instruct employeesabout the new regulations in establishments that already check I.D.'s foralcohol purchases.  Barents conservatively estimated that at least five minutesof additional training per employee would be necessary to instruct employeesabout the new regulations even in those retail establishments that alreadytrain employees to perform I.D. verification.</tt> [77  Using FDA's assumption that one-thirdof cigarette retailers already check I.D.'s, Barents estimates that it wouldstill cost a significant amount in the aggregate for these retailestablishments to provide minimal training about the new regulations.78  ]Fifth, FDA ignores the recurring cost resulting from employeeturnover and refresher training.  The rate of employee turnover issignificantly higher for retail stores than most other employment areas.</tt> [79  Barents, using FDA's assumptions about thenumber of retailers who already have training programs in place, finds thatrecurring costs from turnover will range from $32.2 million to $45.1 millioneach year.  Refresher training, which updates and reinforces initial training,is estimated by Barents to cost from $6.3million to almost$8.9million per year.  Thus this recurring cost, which FDA failed toconsider, would total between $41.2 million to $57.8million per year (in1996 dollars).80<p>	In short, to provide a more accurate training cost estimate, FDA's own$10million cost estimate must be corrected using (1)currentemployee compensation data, (2)more realistic training time, (3)thecost of providing the training itself, (4)the cost of briefly trainingemployees who already perform ID checks about the new regulations, and(5)recurring costs.  If these adjustments are made based on 1994compensation data, then the one-time cost to retailers of training theirsalesclerks to comply with FDA's proposed regulation would be not$10million, but rather about ]<tt>$117.6million to$164.8million, with additional recurring costs due to turnover andrefresher training of $38.5million to $54million peryear.</tt> [81]<h5>(ii)	  Cost of Training Retail Store Managers</h5><tt>	FDA has ignored the cost of the time that retail store managersmust spend to learn the requirements of its regulations.  Managers will beresponsible for ensuring that their stores comply with the many aspects of theregulations applicable to retailers, and so must be familiar with theregulations' requirements.  The Agency's failure to estimate these costs isinconsistent with its treatment of other training costs.  FDA recognizes thatmanufacturers' representatives and retail salesclerks will require trainingregarding the requirements of the regulations, and that the cost of thattraining should be considered.  See 60 Fed. Reg. 41,366, 41,367.</tt><p><tt>	FDA estimates that eight hours will be required to train a manufacturers'representative to recognize through a visual inspection whether a retail storeis in compliance with its regulations.  60 Fed. Reg. 41,366.  The store managermust have at least as great an understanding of the requirements of theregulation as a manufacturers' representative in order to ensure that the storehe or she manages is in compliance.  See Section897.10.  Hence, itis reasonable to assume that at least eight hours will be required to trainretail store managers about their obligations under the regulation.  Assumingthat at least one manager must be trained in each of the up to 700,000 retailstores FDA predicts will sell tobacco products after the regulations go intoeffect, at least 5.6million hours of training time initially willbe required.  Managerial turnover will necessitate additional training time infuture years.  A conservative estimate of the costs of managerial training timeis between $54.6million and $76.4million in onetime costs,and $6.6million to $9.2million per year in recurringcosts.</tt> [82]<p>	Thus, after making these corrections and adjusting the 1993 wage data forinflation to 1996 dollars, Barents concludes that the onetime training cost toretailers for employees and managers to be on the order not of ]<tt>$10million, as FDA estimates, but rather on the order of$183.5million to $257.2 million (in 1996 dollars)--with additional recurring costs due to turnover and refresher training of about$48 million to $67.4 million per year.83</tt><h4>c.	  Age-VerificationCosts</h4><tt>			    <b>(Section 897.14(a))   </b></tt><p><p><tt>	Section 897.14(a) requires a retailer to "verify by means of photographicidentification containing the bearer's date of birth that no person purchasingor intending to purchase the product is younger than 18 years of age."</tt> [84  FDA estimates that the age-verificationrequirement will cost $28million per year.85  FDA's calculation of thiscost is based on the assumption that customers between the ages of 18 to 26purchase tobacco products in 2.2 billion transactions a year, that75percent of these transactions would need to be extended by 10 seconds,and that the added cost of the additional employee time (assuming an averageemployee salary of $15,410) would be about $35million per year.]<tt>Id.  FDA reduces this estimate by 20 percent based on thearbitrary assumption that 20percent of all retail establishments alreadyadequately check the identifications of customers aged 18 to 26.</tt> [86<p>	FDA's $28 million estimate substantially understates the recurring compliancecosts that the I.D. verification requirement will impose on retailers.  FDA'sestimate here too rests on out-of-date payroll data and an unrealisticassumption about the number of affected transactions.  Citing nine-year-oldpayroll data, the Agency erroneously states that retail clerks now receive anaverage salary of ]<tt>$15,410, or $7.70 per hour.</tt> [87  In fact, the average total compensation perhour was $9.51 in 1994.88<p>	For several reasons, FDA underestimates the number of transactions that theage verification requirement would prolong.  Although the Agency suggestsotherwise in the preamble,89 the obligation imposed by Section 897.14(a) isunqualified:  By its terms, ]<tt>all customers must be asked toprovide proof of age.  Even assuming that retailers follow their usualpractice, retailers who check I.D's typically do so for all customers whoappear to be 30 years old or less, rather than (as FDA assumes) 26years or less.</tt> [90]  Also, the age-verificationrequirement presumably would prolong ]<tt>all transactions withcustomers who appear to be 30 years old or less; FDA does not explain why itassumes that proof of age would be demanded in only 75percent of suchtransactions.  Correcting for FDA's erroneous assumptions about salesclerkcompensation and the number of affected transactions yields an annual costestimate not of $28million, but rather $142million(in 1996 dollars).</tt> [91]<p>	In addition, FDA has not attempted to estimate the costs of hiring anyadditional clerks that the increased delay caused by age verification maynecessitate.  Stores that already are understaffed will be unable to checkidentifications during busy periods with existing help.  FDA itself recognizesthat "the additional workload might compel the hiring of the additionalemployees," yet the Agency has not included an estimate of the number ofadditional employees who would need to be hired or what it would cost to hirethem.  60 Fed. Reg. 41,367.  The cost could be substantial.  Even if only]<tt>1 percent of the 700,000 establishments that FDA expects willsell cigarettes after promulgation of the regulations hired only asingle new employee apiece it would cost more than$140million more per year to ensure compliance with theregulations.</tt><h4>d.	  Recordkeeping Costs</h4><tt>	FDA's cost analysis has inexplicably failed to take into account theannual reporting and recordkeeping burden that the proposed regulation wouldimpose on retailers.  In FDA's Paperwork Reduction Act statement, the Agencyestimates that "businesses" will spend a total of 1,173,334 hours per year insatisfying their reporting and recordkeeping obligations under the proposedregulation.</tt> [92]  A significant number ofthese hours represent burdens that will be borne by retailers.93  Nevertheless,FDA does ]<tt>not include this significant burden in its overallestimate of the cost of the regulations.</tt><p><tt>	FDA predicts that Sections897.32 (labeling and advertisingrequirements) and 897.40 (duty to present records to FDA representatives upondemand)-- both of which explicitly impose duties on retailers--will require each respondent to spend 20minutes per year to documenttheir compliance with each of these regulations.</tt> [94  But FDA ignores recordkeeping costs thatretailers will be forced to bear to document their compliance with thesesections.<p>	FDA does not explain how it calculated the number of respondents and burden-hoursfor Sections 897.32 and 897.40.  Needless to say, this makes it difficult, ifnot impossible, to assess the accuracy of the Agency's estimate.  FDA statesthat only 200,000 businesses would have to respond to Sections897.32 and897.40; yet FDA also assumes that up to 700,000 retail stores would selltobacco products and thus be subject to both of these regulations.95  FDA hasgiven no reason why all 700,000 retailers would not have to keep records,especially since Section897.40(c) requires retailers to "make all recordsand other information collected under this part" available to FDA upon demand.Retailers may well need more than 20 minutes per year simply to find the papersthey need to begin work, let alone to document compliance with the many formatand content requirements in Section897.32.  Were FDA to require aretailer, in addition, to document compliance with the labeling and advertisingrequirements, the retailer would also have to show that all of the cigarettesit had sold had been labeled properly, that all newspapers and magazines it hadsold were in compliance with the text-only advertising restriction, that itsystematically checked proof of age, that it sold tobacco products only in hand-to-handtransactions, etc.<p>	Assuming that all 700,000 stores must spend ]<tt>only 60 minutesannually to comply with all applicable recordkeepingrequirements-- three times FDA's estimate, and still absurdly low in viewof the obligations imposed by FDA's proposed regulations-- retailerswould spend a total of 700,000 hours annually on recordkeeping duties alone.Assuming labor costs of $10/hour for the employees who must keep the records,the annual labor costs of recordkeeping alone would amount to over$7million.  FDA, as noted, did not provide any estimate for thiscost at all.</tt><h4>e.	  Loss of Promotional Allowances</h4><tt>	FDA recognizes that, in addition to incurring the direct compliance costsdescribed above, retail outlets would receive smaller promotional allowancesfrom manufacturers as a result of the prohibition of self-service displays andadvertising imagery at the point of sale.</tt> [96  Based on absolutely no evidence, however,FDA asserts that it is "likely" that manufacturers will continue to compete forany remaining "display space," and thus will continue to pay promotionalallowances at roughly their current amounts.97  In short, the Agency treatsthis major economic impact on retailers as minimal and insignificant by simplywishing it away.  This is irresponsible.<p>	Tobacco industry promotional allowances to retailers totaled about $1.6billion in 1993.98  It is beyond genuine dispute that these allowances would bereduced very substantially if self-service displays were prohibited.  Norational manufacturer would continue to pay display allowances if displays nolonger were permitted; and no rational manufacturer would pay anything close tothe rate for prime floor space for a fraction of the same-sizearea behind a counter.  Manufacturers will not make payments to retailers fornothing, or make the same payments for a substantially smaller benefit.  It isnonsensical to suppose otherwise.  <p>	FDA tries to minimize the significance of these promotional allowances byobserving that, if they were spread evenly among the estimated 600,000 retailoutlets currently selling tobacco products, they would amount to $2,600 perstore.  Barents, by contrast, examined the special case of convenience storesin detail and concludes that sizable reductions in promotional allowances wouldpush many profitable stores into a loss position.99  <p>	FDA's approach on this issue is totally unpersuasive.  ]<tt>First,the allowances are not spread evenly among all stores.  Generally, retailerswho have higher sales volumes in both the pack and carton sales categoriesreceive more promotional allowances.</tt> [100]]<tt>Second, even a few thousand dollars a year is a significantamount to many retailers, especially those that are only marginally profitable.For example, because the profit margin for the average convenience store isunder 3 percent,</tt> [101] the averageconvenience store would need to increase its sales by $34,500 in order to makeup a loss of a $1,000 promotional payment.102  <p>	In short, FDA has simply wished away a cost to retailers that could exceed]<tt>three quarters of a billion dollars per year and result injeopardizing the profitability of many convenience stores.</tt> [103]<h3>2.	  Vending Machine Operators</h3><tt>	Section 897.16(c) would prohibit all vending machine sales of cigarettes.Rather than attempt to estimate what the cost of this prohibition would be, FDAcontents itself with noting that cigarette vending machine sales are in declineand that "[t]he proposed prohibition of vending sales would require these firmsto develop new markets to replace these sales revenues."  60 Fed. Reg. 41,369.While not denying that the ban would impose costs on vending machine owners,FDA nevertheless implies that any costs attributable to the ban should not becounted against the proposed regulation, because the costs of the ban would beoffset by substitution, and in any case the ban would do no more than hastenthe end of a declining sector of the vending machine industry.Id.</tt><p><tt>	FDA's failure to consider the costs of the vending machine ban isindefensible.  Whatever would be the eventual fate of the cigarette vendingmachine industry in the free market, FDA cannot evade responsibility for thefact that its regulations would eliminate this segment of the industryinstantly.  Moreover, the Agency's attempt to depict the cigarette vendingmachine business as defunct misses the mark.  Retail census data indicate thatthere are more than 3000 vending machine operating firms with payroll that sellcigarettes.  In addition, there are a large number of entities that do not showup in these census figures because they operate vending machines as part ofsome other business (e.g., supermarkets, restaurants, ortaverns).</tt> [104]  Barents notes that asignificant amount, but not all, vending machine sales will be replaced byover-the-counter transactions.  Barents concludes that the net loss would be$122 million, which FDA totally ignores.105<p>	The long-termdecline in vending machine sales of cigarettes in recent years does not makethe lost revenues any less important to the persons who earn them.  Nor does itentitle FDA to ignore the consequences of its proposed regulation.  For severalreasons, the proposed ban on cigarette vending machines would inflictsignificant economic hardship on these persons.106]<h4>a.	  Concentration of Cigarette</h4><tt>			    <b>Vending Machine Ownership </b></tt><p><p><tt>	FDA downplays the importance of revenues derived from cigarette vendingmachines by comparing them to total revenues for all vending machines, findingthem to be only 3.4 percent of the total.</tt> [107  This analysis ignores the fact that the3000 firms with payrolls that operate cigarette vending machines receiveroughly 10 percent of their revenues from cigarette sales.108  Although theimpact of a cigarette vending machine ban on the vending machine industry as awhole may not be severe, the firms that actually operate cigarette vendingmachines will immediately lose a substantial fraction of their revenues.  Thisloss will be devastating to their bottom line.]<h4>b.	  Small Business Will Lose</h4><tt><b>	</b>	Those most likely to bear the brunt of the vending machine ban aresmall businesses.  According to Vending Times, "Census of the IndustryIssue," 33(9) (Aug. 1995), the vending machine industry is dominated by smallbusinesses.  Almost 70 percent of vending companies employed three or fewerpeople on a full-timebasis in 1994.</tt> [109]  There is no availableevidence to suggest that cigarette vendors are less likely than other vendorsto be small businesses, so it follows that small businesses will suffer adisproportionate share of the losses from the ban on cigarettevending.]<tt></tt><h4>c.	  Loss of Investment</h4><tt>	Vending machines that cannot be converted to dispense other products willautomatically be rendered worthless by the proposed ban.  Many cigarettevending machines now in use cannot be converted to other uses.</tt> [110  FDA has failed to calculate the value ofthis lost capital investment or the economic consequences to those who willlose it.<p>	For businesses such as bars and restaurants that incidentally operatecigarette vending machines, the economic consequences would exceed the lostcapital investment in the vending machine itself.  For example, withoutcigarette vending machines in taverns, some customers would perhaps leaveearlier, and the tavern would do less business.  To be sure, taverns could tryto compensate for the loss of their vending machines by starting to sellcigarettes over the counter.  This method, however, would obviously be moreexpensive for them-- or they would not have decided to sell cigarettesfrom vending machines in the first place.  FDA has not estimated the cost tosuch businesses from lost patronage or the increased costs of sellingcigarettes over-the-counter.<p>	Even if it were possible to convert every cigarette vending machine in thenation to other productive uses, FDA overlooks the fact that most, if not all,such conversions take significant time and money.111  No allowance is made bythe Agency for the cost of physically converting cigarette vending machines toother purposes.]<h4>d.	  Loss of Revenues</h4><tt><b>	</b>	FDA does not contend that cigarette vending machine operators willbe able to recoup lost cigarette revenues by entering new markets; all FDAconcludes is that these firms would have to develop new markets to have anyhope of replacing the revenues that the proposed regulation would eliminate.See 60 Fed. Reg. 41,369.  FDA's silence as to whether the lost revenuesactually could (or would) be replaced (and, if so, when) speaksvolumes.</tt><p><tt><b>	</b>	In fact, cigarette vending machine operators will not be able torecoup the revenue losses that the ban will inflict on them.  To supposeotherwise is to assume-- unreasonably-- that vending machineoperators deliberately have foregone more profitable uses of their vendingmachines.  Thus, even if cigarette vending machines could be converted to sellother products (one "if")-- and there were a market for such products(another "if")-- there is every reason to believe that the machines'owners would earn lower profits than they did selling cigarettes.</tt> [112  The thousands of restaurants, taverns,bowling alleys, and other small businesses that maintain their own cigarettevending machines are even less likely to replace lost cigarette revenues.  Ifthere were a demand for vending machines dispensing other products, it seemsprobable that vending machines dispensing such other products already would bein use.]<tt></tt><h4>e.	  Failure To Consider Alternatives</h4><tt><b>	</b>	The Agency does not compare these costs against the supposedbenefits of eliminating vending machine cigarette sales.  FDA does notconsider, for example, the fact that cigarette vending machines already aresubject to restrictions in many States to prevent youth access.  Although noState has completely banned tobacco product vending machines-- itself afact that speaks loudly to the political arrogance of FDA's proposal--all States prohibit the sale of tobacco products to minors through vendingmachines, and 32States provide additional restrictions to reduce youthaccess to vending machines.</tt>[113]  FDAunreasonably dismisses or disregards alternatives to a vending machine ban, andignores the fact that eliminating cigarette vending machines from places inwhich children are not allowed or typically found (]<tt>e.g.,factories, offices, bars, cocktail lounges and taverns) will likely haveno impact on underage smoking, let alone an impact sufficient to justifythe costs.</tt><h3>3.	  The Print Media</h3><tt>	Section897.32(a) would prohibit the use of colors and imagery forcigarette advertisements appearing in magazines and newspapers whose under-18readership equals or exceeds 2million or 15percent of thepublication's total readership.  Cigarette manufacturers wishing to advertisein such publications would be limited to "text only" advertisements--black text on a white background.  Apparently, not even the product packageitself could be shown. </tt><p><tt>	FDA suggests that the impact of its regulations on the various print mediaand advertising agencies is "difficult to determine."  60 Fed. Reg. 41,369.FDA does not even venture to estimate the impact of the text-only requirementon advertising revenues.  Instead, FDA suggests that lost tobacco advertisingrevenues will be replaced quickly by advertising revenues for otherproducts-- once again, falling back on "substitution" to avoid a realcost-benefit analysis.  In this connection, FDA invokes the precedent of the1971 ban on television and radio advertising, asserting that the networksrecouped lost advertising revenues within a year.  See 60 Fed. Reg.41,369.  In a further attempt to minimize the impact of the text-onlyrequirement, FDA states that if tobacco manufacturers cut their advertisingoutlays for consumer publications by one-half, "this dollar figure amounts toless than one-half of onepercent of the reported $131.3 billion spent onU.S. media advertising in 1992."  Id.  FDA's analysis is seriouslyflawed.</tt> [114]  Using an estimated 25% and75% reduction in advertising revenues from the tobacco industry due to FDA'sregulations, Barents concluded that the total cost to the print media couldrange between ]<tt>$69 million and $207 million.115  </tt><p><tt>	The overall estimated decline in advertising is likely to be even greaterbecause, under FDA's pervasive advertising restrictions, tobacco manufacturerswill not be able to shift their advertising expenditures to other media.  Forexample, the amount previously spent on magazine advertisements cannot beshifted to promotional items because under FDA's pervasive advertisingrestrictions, promotional items are also banned.</tt><h4>a.	  Reduction in Demand</h4><tt>	It is certain that the text-only requirement would reduce the demand forprint advertising in the United States.  FDA's text-only requirements wouldrender cigarette advertising invisible, and prevent manufacturers fromdistinguishing their brands from those of their competitors.  For thatreason-- the established name requirement of Section 897.32(b)andthe proposed text-only requirement would be tantamount to a ban.  Althoughtobacco manufacturers could still use graphics and color in a small number of"adult" publications, it is unlikely that they would increase their advertisingin those outlets substantially.  Typically, no more than one advertisement fora given brand is placed in a given issue of a magazine, because the marginalbenefit of a second advertisement in the same issue tends to be less than thefirst.  Even if advertisements are shifted from one publication to a secondpublication, there is still a cost associated with being forced to make thischange.  The first publication most likely was better suited for theadvertisement than the second, otherwise advertisers would have made thischange on their own.</tt> [116]<p>	It is a fundamental economic principle that, all other things being equal, adecrease in demand will produce a decrease in revenue.  Thus, the decrease indemand that would follow the curtailment of cigarette advertising in printmedia would reduce print advertising revenues and adversely affect publishers,advertising agencies, and the various businesses that supply them.<p>	The fact that the television networks may have recouped lost cigaretteadvertising revenues within a year of the 1971 ban is not to the contrary.Average network television advertising rates fell significantly in the periodimmediately following the ban.  The average cost per 30 seconds dropped by10percent and the average cost per 1000 homes fell by nearly 14percent.117<p>	Before the ban, television advertising was limited to spots of 60 seconds orlonger.  In the face of the ban, the networks authorized the sale of 30-secondadvertising spots-- in effect, a new "product."  This change had theeffect of increasing demand for television advertising spots by making themaffordable to more advertisers.118  Print media, however, will be unable tomake a comparable change in advertising formats to offset the reduction indemand that the proposed regulation will trigger.  The print media]<tt>already sell advertising space in the smallest units.  Theycannot offer advertisers a new "product."</tt><p><tt>	The measure of the effect of the advertising regulations is the differencebetween advertising revenues after the regulations and expected revenueswithout the regulations.</tt> [119]  Thereduction in demand, and thus the loss in revenues, will be significant.  TheAgency's definition of magazines with a substantial youth readership sweeps inmost of the top-circulated magazines in the United States-- includingsuch publications as ]<tt>TV Guide, People, Life,Sports Illustrated, Jet and Vogue.120  Many of thesemagazines derive a substantial percentage of their advertising revenues fromcigarette advertising.</tt> [121]  Although thedecline in the market price of advertisements that would result from thecigarette manufacturers' reduced demand for advertising space might lead someother sellers to increase their own level of advertising, total advertisingrevenues nevertheless would fall.  FDA's assertion that any loss of tobaccoadvertising revenues would be replaced readily by revenues from advertisingother products is therefore arbitrary and unsustainable.  ]<h4>b.	  Reduced Profits from</h4><tt>			    <b>Text-Only Advertising</b></tt><p><p><tt>	Even if tobacco manufacturers continued to advertise in publicationsrestricted to text-only advertisements, these advertisements would be likely togenerate lower profits for the publication.  Black-and-white advertising ratesare generally substantially lower than color rates.</tt> [122  Although the cost of printingblack-and-white advertisements is also lower, one would expect that publisherscurrently charge a premium for color advertisements because of their greatereffectiveness in catching the reader's attention.  Publishers would lose anysuch premium were they to accept text-only cigarette advertising.123]<h4>c.	  Impact on Particular Entities</h4><tt><b>	</b>	FDA's regulations would have different effects on what would seemto be quite similar magazines.  For example, the regulation apparently wouldallow tobacco advertising to use color and imagery in Soap Opera Digest,but not in Soap Opera Weekly; in Redbook, but not inCosmopolitan or Mademoiselle; in Field and Stream, but notin Guns &amp; Ammo or Hunting.124  In addition, the proposedregulation would ban the use of color and imagery in many of the most popularmagazines-- Better Homes and Gardens, Cosmopolitan,Life, National Inquirer, Newsweek, People, andTV Guide-- simply because their "readership," as defined by FDA,includes over 2million persons under the age of 18-- even thoughtheir youth readership amounts to less than 15percent of their totalreadership.</tt> [125]  The regulations wouldaffect these magazines adversely-- not because they are youth-oriented,but simply because they are fortunate enough to have large circulations.  Thus,not only will the regulation impose substantial costs on the print advertisingindustry, but it will distribute those costs unfairly and will penalize certainmagazines solely because they have succeeded in attracting large adultreaderships, which incidentally include over 2million persons under theage of 18.  Barents estimates that the cost to the magazine industry alone inlost revenues could equal $38 million to $115 million.126]<tt></tt><h4>d.	  Direct Mail</h4><tt><b>	</b>	Although its use by tobacco companies has been declining, directmail advertising amounted to $32.6million in 1993, the latest year forwhich data are available.</tt> [127]  The blacktext on a white background advertising restrictions in FDA's proposedregulation would apply to direct mail advertising (]<tt>see Section897.32(a)(1)).  The loss of the ability to use color and visual imagery toobtain and hold the reader's attention is likely to decrease the utility anduse of direct mail by cigarette advertisers.  Similar to the above advertisingdiscussion, the Barents Study found that the decreased use of direct mail wouldresult in an annual revenue loss to the direct mail industry and its suppliersof $7.7 million to $23 million (in 1996 dollars).</tt> [128]<tt></tt><h3>4.	  The Outdoor Advertising Industry</h3><tt>	FDA's regulation would ban all outdoor tobacco advertising within 1000feet of any playground, elementary school or secondary school, and wouldrequire all other outdoor tobacco advertising to consist solely of black texton a white background.  In many communities, these requirements would betantamount to a ban on cigarette billboard advertising.  In Manhattan, 94.8percent of the land area would be off-limits to cigarette billboardadvertisements under Section897.30(b); in Seattle, 87.7 percent of theland area would be off-limits; and in other cities, the effects would besimilar.</tt> [129]  In areas that remainavailable (mainly business and industrial districts), billboard advertising bycigarette manufacturers can be expected to decline simply because of thepointlessness of text-only advertising, and the inhibiting effect of theproposed established-nameand scare-warningrequirements.<p>	As with print advertising, FDA's regulations will lead to reduced demand forbillboard space and reduced billboard advertising revenues.  The advertising ofcigarettes accounts for 14percent of all outdoor advertising.130  Theproposed regulation effectively will eliminate these revenues and forcebillboard owners to lower their prices significantly to compete for replacementbusiness.  Barents estimates the lost revenue to the outdoor advertisingindustry could range from $49 million to $147million.131]<tt></tt><p><tt>	FDA observes that, in response to Canada's short-lived advertisingban, that that country's billboard industry "quickly replaced $20millionin lost cigarette revenues with ads for food, soap, toothpaste and beer."  60Fed. Reg. 41,369.  The relevance of the Canadian experience is questionable,because the Canadian "ban" did not have the same scope as FDA'sproposal.</tt> [132]  In Ontario,moreover-- the largest, most populous province-- the governmentresponded to the cigarette advertising ban by repealing the ban on alcoholadvertising, thus offsetting the impact of the cigarette advertising ban.133FDA takes neither of these facts into account.<p>	The overall estimated decline in advertising is likely to be even greaterbecause, under FDA's pervasive advertising restrictions, tobacco manufacturerswill not be able to shift their advertising expenditures to other media.  Forexample, the amount previously spent on outdoor advertisements cannot beshifted to promotional items because under FDA's pervasive advertisingrestrictions, promotional items are also banned.]<h3>5.	  Athletic and Sporting Events</h3><tt>	Section 897.34(c) would prohibit manufacturers, distributors, andretailers from sponsoring any athletic, musical, artistic, or other social orcultural event under the name of any brand or other indicium of productidentification used to market cigarettes or smokeless tobacco products.  FDAthus proposes to abolish such longstanding and popular events as the VirginiaSlims Tennis Tournament and the Marlboro 500 series of the NASCAR Winston CupSeries.</tt><p><tt>	Pleading uncertainty, the Agency has made no effort to calculate theeconomic consequences of the proposed sponsorship restrictions-- otherthan presenting information about the potential cost to the governmentin the event that a court were to find this aspect of the proposed regulationto constitute a taking for purposes of the Fifth Amendment.  See 60 Fed.Reg. 41,359 ("FDA is unable to provide an approximate figure").  FDA's timidityin estimating the costs of its proposed regulations in the face of uncertaintyin this context stands in sharp contrast to the Agency's boldness in estimatingbenefits in the face of even greater uncertainty.</tt><p><tt>	Nevertheless, it is clear that the proposed restrictions will have adverseeconomic effects.  FDA may not simply ignore its legal responsibility to takeaccount of such effects.</tt>[134]<h4>a.	  Effects on Sponsored Events</h4><tt><b>	</b>	It is certain that the proposed sponsorship restrictions willcause a contraction in the availability of sponsorship funds.  Increasedsponsorships by cigarette manufacturers under their corporate names will noteven begin to make up the loss.</tt> [135]Barents predicts a destructive ripple effect, with other sponsors "trading up"to sponsor some of the high-profile events that previously had obtainedsponsorship from cigarette manufacturers, leaving less "attractive" eventsscrambling to find new sponsors, who may well not materialize.  This is exactlywhat happened when Australia banned tobacco company sponsorships in 1992.  Suchsponsorships were the main sponsors of the country's two major sports leagues.Although the two sports leagues found new main sponsors, those new sponsorsdropped many smaller organizations to pay for their new sponsorship clients.136Even some high-profile events-- such as professional auto racing--may be unable to secure alternative sponsorship simply because the demographicsof the audience to which they appeal, while attractive to tobacco companies,may not be attractive to manufacturers of otherproducts.137]<tt></tt><p><tt><b>	</b>	The fact that sponsorships would continue to be permitted under amanufacturer's corporate name would not significantly offset the costsinflicted by the proposed ban on brand-name sponsorships.  The major cigarettebrands tend to play a leading sponsorship role, and often the title of theevent incorporates the brand name.  The Winston Cup Series (NASCAR) andMarlboro 500 are two notable examples.  Changing the name of the event to thename of the tobacco company involves losing the continuity and goodwillassociated with the brand name in the title of the event.</tt> [138  ]<tt></tt><h4>b.	  Effects on Local Communities</h4><tt><b>	</b>	The proposed restrictions on sponsorships will also have aneconomic ripple effect on the communities in which sponsored events are held.The tourist and recreational revenues generated by sponsored events aresubstantial.  A recent study conducted by Dover Downs, along with the AmericanCoalition for Entertainment and Sports Sponsorship (ACESS), of the economicimpact of two auto racing events sponsored by Reynolds under the Winston brandname, concludes that a two-raceweekend contributes over $38million to the local Dover, Delawareeconomy.</tt> [139]  Thus, to the extent thatFDA's regulations cause tobacco companies to withdraw their sponsorship of suchevents, not only will the event organizers suffer, but the local community willalso lose significant amounts of income.]<tt></tt><h3>6.	  The Tobacco Industry</h3><tt>	Even though FDA concludes that Section897.34(c) would lead to theloss of thousands of jobs in the tobacco industry, see 60 Fed. Reg.41,369, the Agency does not adequately consider several ways in which theproposed regulation would affect cigarette manufacturers:</tt><p><tt>	First, the Agency completely fails to consider the cost of therequirement that manufacturers remove all noncomplying advertising andpromotional items from retail stores pursuant to Section897.12(a).Second, FDA underestimates the costs associated with the requirementthat manufacturers' representatives inspect retail stores and generally monitorretailer compliance within the regulations pursuant to Sections 897.10 and897.12(b).  Third, FDA does not address further potential costs of itslabeling requirement.</tt><p><tt>	Fourth, the Agency's cost analysis does not consider the true costof establishing and maintaining a national public educational program todiscourage persons under 18 years of age from using cigarettes and smokelesstobacco products.  Fifth, FDA fails to account for the burden ofcomplying with annual recordkeeping and reporting requirements pursuant toSection897.40.  Sixth, the Agency does not adequately calculatethe cost to the manufacturers resulting from the destruction of theirintellectual property and goodwill arising from the proposed restrictions onthe use of their marks in labeling and advertising, and in connection withpromotional activities, including sponsored events.  Seventh, FDA failsto consider the incentives and future cost associated with the threatenedimposition of additional regulations under Section897.44.</tt><h4>a.	  Removal Costs</h4><tt><b>	</b>	Section 897.12(a) would require every tobacco product manufacturerto remove from every retail store all displays, advertising, labeling, andother manufacturer-supplied items not in compliance with the regulation.  FDAcompletely ignores the cost of this requirement in its assessment of the coststo manufacturers; the Agency does not even list manufacturers' putative removalduties among the core requirements of the regulation whose costs FDA estimates.See 60 Fed. Reg. 41,365.  The Kearney Study estimates that tobaccomanufacturers will have to pay over $452 per store to ensure thatconvenience stores come into compliance with FDA's regulations and over $905per store to ensure compliance by supermarkets and grocery stores.</tt> [140  Barents estimates that manufacturers ortheir distributors would face estimated onetime labor removal costs of about]<tt>$209 million to $293 million (in 1996 dollars), notincluding capital loss due to the removed items' premature obsolescence.</tt> [141  These costs are in addition to the laborcosts for retailers that would be incurred in removing and replacing items notin compliance with the regulations.  ]<tt></tt><h4>b.	  Inspection Costs</h4><tt>	Section 897.12(b) would require manufacturers' representatives who visitretail stores in the normal course of business to perform inspections to ensurethat tobacco products are labeled, advertised, and sold in compliance with "allapplicable" rules and regulations (including, presumably, State and local lawsincorporated into Part897 by operation of Section897.44(a)).  If arepresentative observed any noncomplying materials, for example, he or shewould be required to see that those materials are removed from the premises.If the sales representative spots a salesclerk failing to demand proof of age(as required by Sections 897.14(a)), he or she presumably would be required totake corrective action.  </tt><p><tt>	FDA projects that the annual cost of these various requirements for thetobacco industry would be no more than $25million, consisting of$24million in extra labor costs incurred in performing visual inspectionsand $1million in training costs.  60 Fed. Reg. 41,365-66.  FDA assumesthat 7,300 manufacturers' representatives would each visit 10 outlets per dayand spend an extra three minutes at each outlet performing a visual inspectionat a cost of $25/hour.  60 Fed. Reg.41,365.  The Agency assumes thatrepresentatives would require eight hours of training to perform the requiredinspections.  See id. at 41,366.</tt><p><tt>	FDA's estimates are ridiculously low.  First, FDA's assumptionsabout the costs of routine visual inspections are deeply flawed.  If theinspections were conducted at all seriously, they would take much longer thanthe two to three minutes FDA postulates.</tt><p><tt>	The Kearney Study estimates that the total time that will be spent bymanufacturers' marketing representatives in conducting an adequate compliancecheck and in effecting compliance in any noncomplying areas ranges from 18minutes at service stations to 45 minutes at convenience stores.  Grocerystores, which along with convenience stores are the retailers who sell the mostcigarettes, would take 31 minutes for a compliance check.</tt> [142  The Kearney study takes into account thedetailed inspections that will be necessary at each cigarette retail site toensure compliance, and the numerous acts that must be taken to remove allvestiges of noncomplying promotional materials.  Compliance audits at each sitewill at a minimum require review of interior space for offending materials,inspection of the exterior of the facility for inappropriate materials, andchecking of the individual displays and signs to assure that the specificlabeling requirements of the regulations are being implemented and that tobaccoproducts are not accessible to customers.  Because it is based upon on-sitevisits, the Kearney Study presents a much more realistic view of the burdensimposed on cigarette manufacturers by the proposed rules than does the FDA.143It illustrates that the FDA's estimates of the time required to conductcompliance audits and assure compliance are drastically underinclusive, andthat the monetary costs of such compliance will be exceedingly high.  Barentsfound the annual recurring labor cost for the minimum required to inspectadequately retail stores to range from $27 million to $47 million.144<p>	FDA's own assumptions about the frequency with which young adults purchasecigarettes at the typical small retail store suggest that the time required toconduct visual inspections to ensure compliance with the age-verificationrequirement will be significantly longer than three minutes.  FDA assumes thatsmall outlets sell 50 tobacco packages per day to adults aged 18 to 26.]<tt>See 60 Fed. Reg. 41,370.  Assuming a store is open for 12 hoursper day, then on average a young adult will purchase tobacco products no morefrequently than once every 15 minutes.</tt> [145  Therefore, a manufacturer's representativeon average would have to wait at least ]<tt>five times longer thanthe three minutes FDA allots--  simply to observe how a retail storehandles a single transaction with a young adult.  Even assuming it weresufficient to observe only one such transaction, this correction inFDA's estimate alone would increase the annual labor cost of performing visualinspections to at least $120million.  </tt><p><tt>	Kearney found that an inspector would generally have to wait between 14and 39 minutes, depending on the type of store, simply to observe a tobaccotransaction involving someone who appeared to be between 18 and 26.</tt> [146  Estimating the effort that would berequired to conduct serious inspections in all of the various types of storesthat sell tobacco products, Kearney concluded that between 19 and 45 minuteswould be required to conduct an adequate compliance check and audit at eachstore.147]Second, FDA simply miscalculates the first-year cost oftraining manufacturers' representatives in the requirements of the proposedregulation.  FDA assumes that 7,300 representatives with compensation costs of$25 per hour would each require eight hours of training.  60 Fed. Reg.41,365-66.  Using FDA's own assumptions, the first-year training cost wouldthus be $1.46million, not the $1million that FDAcalculates.</tt><p><tt>	Third, FDA does not include in its estimate of the time required totrain representatives any allowance for training them in the requirements ofState and local youth-access laws that Section897.42(a) purports toincorporate into the regulations.  Manufacturers' representatives presumablywould be responsible for ensuring compliance with these State and localrequirements, and therefore must be trained to recognize violations.</tt><p><tt>	Fourth, the Agency ignores the costs of preparing and having aninstructor teach the information to the manufacturers' representatives.Barents finds that typical costs for providing similar training involvingalcohol purchase regulations was $5 per hour per employee.</tt> [148  Using FDA's assumptions that 7,300employees will need eight hours of training each, the cost of providing thistraining will be $292,000.]Finally, the Agency fails to account for the substantiallitigation costs that tobacco firms surely would incur as a result of theirrepresentatives' efforts to take private property that belonged to retailers.Retailers have property and possessory rights to the many self-servicedisplays, signs, and other promotional items found in their stores, and theycan be expected to defend those rights.  A manufacturer's representative cannotsimply remove such promotional items without facing unpleasant and costlyconsequences, which have been ignored by FDA.</tt><h4>c.	  New Labeling Requirements</h4><tt><b>	</b>	FDA estimates the cost of changing the labels of cigarettes tocomply with its new warnings to be in the range of $4million to$17million.  60 Fed. Reg. 41,366.  These estimates are seriouslyincomplete because they only consider the costs of retooling the label printingprocess.  The estimates ignore the potential costs associated with recallingnonconforming products and destroying these products as well as existing labelstocks.  The size of this potential cost depends on the exact date theregulations take effect, and how much advance notice the manufacturers have ofthe precise new labeling requirements.</tt> [149]<tt></tt><h4>d.	  Cost of Educational Programs</h4><tt>	Section 897.29 would require the tobacco industry to spend$150million per year for the purpose of establishing and maintaining anational public educational program to discourage persons under 18 years of agefrom using cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products.  60 Fed. Reg. 41,326-28.FDA does not, however, consider the true costs of this requirement.</tt><p><tt>	Section 897.29 apparently would require manufacturers to buy$150million worth of television and radio airtime and advertising spacein print media.  All other costs associated with the required educationalprograms-- including costs of producing the programs, (see60 Fed. Reg. 41,328)-- would then be in addition to the$150million.</tt> [150]<p>	FDA apparently intends to exercise extensive control over the production andbroadcasting of these education programs, and in its discussion of theregulations FDA "describes one set of requirements for such a program that theagency is considering requiring in a final rule."  60 Fed. Reg. 41,327.  FDAsays it may require manufacturers to spend a specific amount of money oneducational programs and may dictate exactly when manufacturers will runFDA-mandated educational messages on television, during which types of shows,and with what frequency.  ]<tt>Id. at 41,327.  FDA indicates that itmay require each manufacturer to conduct tracking studies of 12-to 17-year-oldsand to submit quarterly analyses to the Agency to determine the effectivenessof the educational program.  See id. at 41,328.  Apparently, thecost of obtaining Agency approval of particular programs and conducting thesetracking studies and analyses would be in addition to the $150million tobe spent on the program.  FDA makes no attempt to quantify these additionalcosts.</tt> [151]<p>	Moreover, FDA refers to the $150million figure as the annual amount tobe "allocated ]<tt>initially."  60 Fed. Reg. 41,328 (emphasisadded).  FDA does not explain what this means or what additional amounts mightbe "allocated" to the manufacturers, and under what circumstances.</tt><h4>e.	  Recordkeeping and Reporting Costs</h4><tt><b>	</b>	Manufacturers must discharge substantial recordkeeping andreporting obligations under the regulation.  FDA's Paperwork Reduction Actstatement postulates that recordkeeping duties will arise under four proposedregulations, all of which apply to manufacturers.  See 60 Fed. Reg.41,356.  One of these regulations, Section897.29 (educational programsconcerning cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products), applies only tomanufacturers.</tt><p><tt><b>	</b>	As discussed earlier in regard to the retail sector, FDA does notpropose any estimate of the cost of recordkeeping requirements.  However, FDAestimates that recordkeeping requirements related to the mandated-educationalprograms alone will impose a burden of onemillion hours per year onmanufacturers.  According to FDA's estimates for recordkeeping requirementsunder the other proposed regulations for which recordkeeping obligations exist,each manufacturer must spend a further 40 hours per year documenting compliancewith the regulations.  Id.  Even assuming moderate labor costs for theemployees who must discharge these reporting obligations (for example,$25/hour, FDA's own estimate of the labor cost of manufacturers'representatives), total annual costs for all manufacturers would be on theorder of $55-57million.152 Because highly skilled labor could be required to produce reports documentingthe effectiveness of the mandated educational programs, annual costs could besubstantially higher.</tt><h4>f.		Destruction of Intellectual Property</h4><tt>	The reduction in value of the tobacco companies' intellectual property andgoodwill associated with brand names and marks is another cost that FDA failsto take into account in its analysis.  Section 897.34, coupled with Section877.32, would ban the use of tobacco manufacturers' marks on nontobaccoproducts, in sponsored events and severely limit their use in most advertising.It would not allow tobacco logos or brand names to appear on consumerpromotional items, such as tee shirts, hats and ashtrays, and even onnontobacco products not sold for brand promotional purposes.  It would ban namesponsorships of events.  60 Fed. Reg. 41,336.  By prohibiting most uses, theban would severely diminish the value of tobacco brand names and logos.  Thegoodwill associated with these marks is likely to be reduced by the severerestrictions imposed on their use.  Although these costs are difficult toquantify, they are costs that will be borne in the first instance by tobaccomanufacturers.  </tt><p><tt>	Significantly, many of the manufacturers' tobacco-related marks areintended only for use in nontobacco products.  For example,Brown&amp; Williamson has approximately 40 trademarks registered for usein connection with nontobacco products.  Tobacco manufacturers have investedmillions of dollars promoting their marks over many decades.</tt> [153<p>	The courts have recognized that regulatory action by the government thatresults in the loss of intellectual property, such as trademarks and goodwill,can constitute a compensable taking under the Fifth Amendment.]<tt>See, e.g., Kimball Laundry Co.v.United States, 338 U.S. 1, 8-12 (1949) (goodwill);Connollyv. Pension Benefit Guar. Corp., 475 U.S. 211, 223(1986) (contract rights); see also Winstar Corp.v.United States, 64 F.3d 1531, 1541-43 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (en banc).  Anylicensing or contracts rights tobacco companies and suppliers have concerningthese marks would be severely diminished if not destroyed bySection877.34.  If a court found that the regulations constituted acompensable taking, then the government would have to pay compensation.  Theregulations therefore severely damage the value of tobacco manufacturers'intellectual property resulting in enormous potential takings liability.</tt><h4>g.	  Costs To Avoid Imposition of</h4><tt>			    <b>Additional Regulations      </b></tt><p><p><tt>	FDA threatens to impose additional regulatory measures pursuant toSection897.44 and intends its threat to be an "incentive" to motivate thetobacco industry to fashion its own programs to discourage underagesmoking.</tt>[154]  The Agency assumes thatmanufacturers could establish programs to discourage youth smoking, which"could" cost less than the cost of complying with whatever additional measuresFDA may ultimately impose.  60 Fed. Reg. 41,367.  As the Agency's sole example,FDA hypothesizes that manufacturers might attempt to avoid additionalregulations by establishing a retail surveillance program at an annual cost of$35million.  ]<tt>Id.  (Elsewhere in the preamble, however,FDA estimates that the costs of a rigorous monitoring system could be ashigh as $85 million.  60 Fed. Reg. 41,371.)</tt><p><tt>	FDA's analysis of the costs of industry programs to discourage youthtobacco smoking and of the incentives that Section897.44 would create iswholly inadequate.  First, because FDA has not revealed what sort ofadditional measures it may impose pursuant to Section897.44, the Agencyhas absolutely no basis for performing any economic analysis of the incentiveeffects of the regulations.</tt><p><tt>	Second, the minimal economic analysis that FDA has performedactually suggests that Section 897.44 is economically unjustified.  FDA notesthat "SAMHSA estimated that the establishment and implementation of effectiveState-administeredretail surveillance systems would cost about $30 million annually," 60 Fed.Reg. 41,367 (emphasis added), i.e., $5 million less thanan industry-sponsoredprogram.  If it would cost less for the States to establish a retailsurveillance program ($30 million) than for tobacco manufacturers to establishsuch a program ($30 million), requiring the manufacturers to spend more for thesame purpose is economically unjustifiable.</tt><h3>7.	  Tobacco Industry Suppliers</h3><tt>	Section 897.34(a) would eliminate sales and giveaways of nontobacco itemsbearing cigarette brand advertisements.  This ban obviously would have anadverse impact on the businesses that manufacture and sell lighters, hats,jackets, and other promotional items to the tobacco industry.  Nevertheless,FDA only asserts that these businesses (like vending machine companies) would"experience short-term costs while exploring other business options."  60 Fed.Reg. 41,369.  FDA apparently believes that suppliers of promotional items tothe tobacco industry would be able to recoup lost revenues by manufacturingpromotional items for nontobacco products.  See 60 Fed. Reg.41,370.</tt><p><tt>	FDA again errs by ignoring the effect of the ban on overall demand withinthe specialty items market.  Once tobacco manufacturers are no longer competingfor the services of specialty item manufacturers, overall demand for theirproducts will fall, thereby depressing the revenues that these businesses wouldreceive.  It is no more proper for FDA to ignore this basic economic principleof supply and demand here than it is for FDA to ignore it in connection withother sectors.</tt>[155]<p>	In the Federal Trade Commission reports, the spending figures for specialtyitems are combined with coupons and other buy-one-get-one-free-typepromotions, so it is difficult to isolate the value of these specialty items.Overall, this combined category is the largest single category of tobaccoadvertising and promotion, accounting for ]<tt>$2.6billion inspending in 1993.  The banning of customer promotional items could thereforehave a devastating impact on the businesses that supply thismerchandise.</tt> [156]<h3>8.	  Local Governments and Transit</h3><tt>		    <b>Authorities                  </b></tt><p><p><tt>	FDA projects that the proposed regulation would decrease State and localtobacco tax revenues by from $31million in the first year to$252million in the tenth year.  60 Fed. Reg. 41,370.  However, the Agencyoverlooks the loss of revenues to public transit authorities that would resultfrom the proposed ban on the use of color and imagery in tobacco advertising.As will be the case for the print advertising and outdoor advertisingindustries, such a ban will reduce the demand for advertising space on publictransit and thus reduce the revenues that transit authorities receive fromadvertising.</tt><p><tt>	The FDA regulations that prohibit tobacco ads 1000 feet from a school mayresult in a complete ban on advertising on the outside of public transit busesthat drive within 1000 feet of a school.  Thus, Barents concludes that it islikely that local governments and transit authorities will lose about $39million (1993 dollars) that is generated from tobacco ads.</tt> [157<p>	Although tobacco advertising in 1992 represented only about 1percent ofthe aggregate operating revenues of all public transit authorities,158 thereare two reasons why this share may be far more significant than it mightappear.  ]<tt>First, because a number of transit authorities declineto accept tobacco advertising, the 1percent figure understates theimportance of tobacco advertising to those transit authorities that do acceptsuch advertising.</tt> [159]]<tt>Second, because of deep cuts in federal operating assistance,about 40percent of transit systems around the country were forced toraise fares in the past year.</tt> [160]  FDAacts arbitrarily when it simply fails to consider the impact that the declinein transit system advertising revenues would have on any transit authoritiesthat rely on these revenues.]<h3>9.	  Consumers</h3><tt><b>	</b>	FDA's proposal would impose costs on adult consumers of cigarettesand other tobacco products because it would make the purchase of such productssignificantly more difficult and inconvenient.  FDA acknowledges that as aresult of its regulations "[c]onsumers would... lose theconvenience offered by the use of cigarette vending machines."  60 Fed. Reg.41,360.  The Agency also suggests that some of the delays occasioned by the ageverification requirement might be shifted "to customers through an increase inthe average amount of time customers wait in line to make purchases."  60 Fed.Reg. 41,367.  Barents indicates that the cost to consumers could be at least$282 million, without the loss of inconvenience from the banning of vendingmachines.</tt> [161]  Despite recognizing thesecosts, however, FDA fails to analyze them adequately.  ]<tt></tt><h4>a.	  Age Verification Requirement</h4><tt><b>	</b>	Rather than calculate the costs of the inconvenience that the age-verificationrequirement would impose on adult consumers, the Agency simply asserts that"the affected [retail] establishments would bear all of the costs imposed bythis requirement."  60 Fed. Reg. 41,367.  FDA assumes that the age-verificationrequirement would extend each transaction in which a young adult or underageteenager attempted to purchase a tobacco product by 10 seconds.  But FDA doesnot consider the effect of this delay on adult consumers waiting in linebehind the tobacco purchaser whose I.D. is being checked.  Thus, theAgency attributes no value at all to the inconvenience the consumer willsuffer as a result of the proposed regulation.  The Agency also does notinclude the cost of measures that a store might take to alleviate theinconvenience to consumers caused by age verification.</tt><p><tt><b>	</b>	Barents conservatively estimates that the omitted annual cost toconsumers resulting from the age verification requirement is at least$282million.162  This estimate assumes that the consumer will onlyhave to wait 10 seconds for the clerk to check his or her I.D., that no oneelse is waiting in line behind the consumer, that no one ahead of the customerhas been asked for proof of age, and that the consumer's time is worth no morethan a salesclerk's.</tt> [163]  Theseassumptions probably are extremely conservative.  The actual cost under real-worldconditions of the age-verificationrequirement would probably be far higher.]<tt></tt><h4>b.	  Vending Machine Ban</h4><tt><b>	</b>	Although FDA admits that the vending machine ban would imposeinconvenience costs on consumers, the Agency ultimately does not estimate thesecosts but instead requested comment on their magnitude.  See 60 Fed.Reg. 41,368.  The fact that vending machines sell cigarettes at prices higherthan those at retail stores suggests that the convenience they offer has avalue to consumers.  The loss of this convenience is an economic cost.However, FDA appears to assume that the costs that the ban would impose wouldeventually disappear, because the consumers who previously purchased fromvending machines "would adjust their purchasing patterns to reflect thiscircumstance."  60 Fed. Reg. 41,368.  That, however, is simply to say thatsmokers will absorb the cost of the lost convenience.</tt><h2>I.		FDA Has Failed To Conduct a Valid Cost/</h2><tt><b>		Benefit Analysis Because It Has Failed </b></tt><p><tt><b>		To Consider Less Burdensome Alternatives</b></tt><p><tt><b>		to the Proposed Rule                    </b></tt><p><tt></tt><p><tt>	The statutes and Executive Order that require FDA to analyzethe economic impacts of the proposed regulation also require FDA to considerless burdensome alternatives.  The Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C.[[section]][[section]]601 et seq., requires FDA to preparean initial regulatory flexibility analysis that contains</tt><p><tt>"a description of any significant alternatives to the proposed rule whichaccomplish the stated objectives of applicable statutes and which minimize anysignificant economic impact of the proposed rule on small entities."  5 U.S.C.[[section]]603(c).</tt><p><p><tt>Section1(b)(11) of Executive Order 12,866 likewise requires FDA to"tailor its regulations to impose the least burden on society, includingindividuals, businesses of differing sizes, and other entities (including smallcommunities and governmental entities), consistent with obtaining theregulatory objectives...."</tt><p><tt>	Moreover, Section 205(a) of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995requires an agency to "consider a reasonable number of regulatory alternativesand from those alternatives select the least costly, most cost-effectiveor least burdensome alternative that achieves the objectives of therule...."  Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995, Pub.L. No. 104-4, [[section]]205(a), 109 Stat. 48, 66 (1995) (to be codifiedat 2 U.S.C. [[section]]1531).</tt> [164]<p>	FDA failed to satisfy its obligation to consider less burdensome alternatives.One obvious alternative that FDA has not adequately considered is to abstainentirely from interfering with State and local government initiatives againstunderage tobacco use.  The Office of Management and Budget's ("OMB") Guidanceto Regulatory Impacts requires federal agencies to prefer State and localinitiatives, stating that "the smallest unit of government capable ofcorrecting the market failure should be chosen."165  FDA ignores the variedState alternatives, which in most cases are not only adequate but also betterthan pervasive federal regulation.<p>	Beyond that failure, FDA has also not considered whether ]<tt>allof the many bans, restrictions, and mandates contained in its regulations needto be prescribed in order to achieve the Agency's stated goals.  If eliminatingone or more unnecessary regulations from the proposed rule would produce a lessburdensome but equally effective alternative, under Executive Order 12,866, FDAwould have to prefer that alternative.</tt><p><tt>	FDA's analysis of the overall benefits of the proposed regulations, bycontrast, frustrates any attempt to determine how important each componentwould be to the achievement of the Agency's stated goals.  FDA considers onlythe benefits that the Agency expects the proposed regulations as a wholeto produce.  FDA's analysis of benefits conspicuously fails to project themarginal benefits that each of the proposed regulation's componentprovisions would produce, or even to identify the relative importance of thevarious components to the realization of the benefits.</tt><p><tt>	FDA has simply developed a laundry list of every ban and restriction thatthe antitobacco movement has suggested might be employed to advance its agendaunder the banner of discouraging underage smoking-- without evenconsidering whether anything less than all of these actions wouldachieve the Agency's goals.  On the present record, it is absurd for the Agencyto claim (for example) that a nationwide ban on underage cigarette sales wouldnot be effective unless all cigarette decals were removed from stores, unlesstobacco firms were prohibited from sponsoring athletic events under their brandnames, or unless cigarette brand names no longer could be used on nontobaccoproducts.  This is the sort of regulatory overkill that Executive Order 12,866,the Regulatory Flexibility Act, and the Unfunded Mandates Act all were intendedto prevent.</tt><p><H3><a href=vol12.htm><I>Next Volume</I></a></H3><I><B>(Note: Volume eleven is not available.)</B></I><H3><a href="contents.htm#start"><I>Table of Contents</I></a></H3><hr><IMG WIDTH=50 HEIGHT=48 ALIGN=LEFT SRC=../../lcc.gif ALT=*> Released through <a href="/inside/about.html">COUNSEL CONNECT</a>.

FDA HAS FAILED TO PROVIDE INTERESTED PARTIES</h1><tt><b>	WITH ALL OF THE DATA, CALCULATIONS, AND OTHER</b></tt><p><tt><b>	INFORMATION FDA HAS CONSIDERED IN THIS PROCEEDING</b></tt><p><p><tt>	Basic principles of administrative law and procedural fairness require FDAto provide interested parties with a meaningful opportunity to comment on theinformation FDA has considered in this rulemaking proceeding and on theconclusions it has drawn from that information.  See 5U.S.C.[[section]]553(c) (1994); Portland Cement Ass'nv.Ruckelshaus, 486F.2d 375, 392-94 (D.C. Cir. 1973), cert.denied, 417U.S. 921 (1974); United Statesv. NovaScotia Food Prods. Corp., 568F.2d 240, 250-51 (2d Cir. 1977).</tt><p><tt>	To meet this obligation, FDA must first disclose all of the information ithas considered or relied upon in the proceeding.  See PortlandCement, 486F.2d at393-94; see also SoliteCorp.v. EPA, 952F.2d 473, 484 (D.C. Cir. 1991) ("Anagency commits serious procedural error when it fails to reveal portions of thetechnical basis for a proposed rule in time to allow for meaningfulcommentary.") (quoting Conn. Light &amp; Power Co.v. NRC,673F.2d 525, 530-31 (D.C. Cir.), cert. denied,459U.S. 835 (1982)); United States Linesv. FederalMaritime Comm'n, 584F.2d 519, 536 (D.C. Cir. 1978) ("we have requiredinformation in agency files or reports identified by the agency as relevant tothe proceeding to be disclosed to the parties for adversarial comment").</tt><p><tt>	Despite specific requests, FDA has refused to disclose criticalinformation it considered or relied on in this proceeding.  This refusal by theAgency has thereby deprived us, and all other members of the public, of a fulland effective opportunity to comment on the proposed rule.</tt><h2>A.		FDA Has Unlawfully Considered Nonconfidential</h2><tt><b>		Material That the Agency Has Refused To </b></tt><p><tt>		<b>Disclose to the Public&nsp;    </b></tt><p><p><tt>	FDA has refused to provide interested persons with nonconfidentialdocuments and information which FDA has considered in this rulemaking.  Severalexamples of this unlawful practice are set forth below.</tt><h3>1.		Undisclosed Data and Calculations Concerning</h3><tt><b>		"Tar" and Nicotine Yields from Cigarettes</b></tt><p><p><tt>	FDA has refused to disclose all of the data and calculations on which itrelies for the portion of its "Jurisdictional Analysis" that concerns changesover time in the "tar" and nicotine yields from cigarettes.  FDA purports torely on "information supplied by the FTC that was derived from the FTC'sdatabases on nicotine levels in cigarettes," 60Fed. Reg. 41,727-41,731.The Agency presents that information in the form of several summary charts thatpurport to show the "sales weighted" average yields of "tar" and nicotine forall brands, low-"tar" brands, ultra-low-"tar" brands, and high-"tar"brands, id. 41,728-41,731. </tt><p><tt>	We believe the data presented in FDA's summary charts are incorrect andmisleading.  See discussion in VolumeIII of these comments.  Wetherefore specifically asked FDA to provide the data, the calculations, and themethodology it used to prepare the summary charts.  See Letter fromRichardA. Merrill to DavidA. Kessler (Dec.8, 1995).</tt><p><tt>	The Agency, however, has refused to disclose all of the necessary dataand the calculations on which the summary charts are based.  In particular,despite our specific request, FDA has refused to provide the followinginformation: </tt><p><tt><b>		(i)	The "Tar" and Nicotine Data for </b></tt><p><tt><b>			Each Individual Brand for Each </b></tt><p><tt>			<b>Year FDA Analyzed</></b></tt><p><p><tt>	FDA did not provide all of the raw "tar" and nicotine data it used, anddid not identify the source of those data.  As described in greater detail inVolumeIII of these comments, although FDA states that it used datacompiled by the FTC, FDA's analysis includes sales-weighted averages of "tar"and nicotine yields for years, namely, 1982 and 1984-86, in which the FTCeither issued no report on "tar" and nicotine yields or did not test for "tar"and nicotine yields.  The source of this data is therefore unknown.</tt><p><tt><b>		(ii)	A Statement of the Brands Considered by</b></tt><p><tt><b>			FDA, and Why and How Some Were Excluded</b></tt><p><tt>			<b>from FDA's Analysis&nsp;</b></tt><p><p><tt>	As described in VolumeIII of these comments, for some of the yearsat issue, FDA reports on fewer brands than the FTC included in itsreports for those years; even more strange, for some years FDA reports onmore brands than the FTC analyzed.  The explanation of the discrepancyis apparently unknown even to FDA;</tt> [1] andthe source of the additional brands is undisclosed.  FDA does not identifywhich brands were excluded from its calculations, nor does it reveal therationale or methodology for excluding those brands.  FDA cannot lawfully relyon these data unless and until these discrepancies have been addressed]<tt>publicly and all the data relied on and the calculationsbased on those data have been disclosed to the public.</tt><p><tt><b>		(iii)	The Sales Figures for Each Brand</b></tt><p><tt><b>			FDA Used To Calculate Its</b></tt><p><tt>			<b>Sales-Weighted Averages</b></tt><p><p><tt>	Most importantly, FDA has refused to identify or disclose the salesfigures for each individual brand that the Agency used to create its "sales-weighted"averages for the reported "tar" and nicotine levels.  As discussed at greaterlength in Volume III of these comments, such sales-weightedaverages can only be calculated-- and therefore the calculation of suchsales-weightedaverages can only be confirmed-- by beginning with the individual salesfigure for each brand for each year analyzed.  Despite our repeated requeststhat FDA place in the public record the sales figures that were used to compilethe "sales-weighted"averages contained in FDA's notice, FDA has refused to do so.  Withoutthose data, no one-- neither the cigarette manufacturers nor any otherinterested member of the public-- can have any confidence in FDA'sreported "sales-weighted"figures.</tt> [2]<p><tt><b>		(iv)	FDA's Methodology, Including an Explanation</b></tt><p><tt><b>			of FDA's Use of Groupings of Brands or </b></tt><p><tt>			<b>Sales Other Than by Individual Brands</b></tt><p><p><tt>	FDA has refused to provide a full statement concerning its methodology forcalculating the sales-weighted averages.  The comments that have been provided,for example, fail to identify all sources or describe the manner in which thesales-weightedstatistics were derived.</tt> [3]  <p>	As a result of FDA's failure to provide such information, it has not beenpossible for our experts to understand, or to replicate, the calculationsreflected in FDA's summary charts.  Accordingly, we and all other members ofthe public have been deprived of a meaningful opportunity to comment on thesummary charts and the conclusions FDA draws from them.]<h3>2.		Unavailable Materials from FDA's Investigation</h3><p><tt>	With less than a week remaining in the public comment period, the Agencyhas released a list of 75documents that it terms "confidentialdocuments."  The Agency represents that these documents occupy 13volumesof material.  In each case, the Agency states that the "documents [are] notavailable for public display."  The list of documents, however, leaves no doubtthat they address some of the most critical allegations that the Agency hasmade in this proceeding-- and that most of them are in nojusticiable way "confidential."  A partial list of some of the titles is asfollows:</tt><p><tt>28.	Orleans C. et al.

Whitehill K. et al., "Changes in the Visual Imagery of Cigarette Ads,1954-1986," (Draft), pp.1-41,November 1990.</tt><p><p><tt>	What is perhaps most striking about this list is that the Agency hasaccepted-- and is now relying upon-- "unpublished" comments and"working drafts" by well-known,anticigarette advocates (including a number who have appeared as paid witnessesagainst the cigarette companies in various litigations) without permittingtheir peers and, more importantly, the public at large to review and critiquetheir allegations.  Neither we nor any other member of the public has any wayof knowing what charges these avowed enemies of the tobacco industry haveadvanced; what errors, deliberate or otherwise, they have made in theseunpublished and draft documents; what false and misleading presentations ofbiased, invalid or otherwise unreliable "data" they have made.  All anyoneknows is that these antitobacco advocates have been allowed to submit, on anexparte basis, allegations that FDA has relied upon in thisrulemaking proceeding.  </tt><p><tt>	There is absolutely no justification for treating such materials as"confidential."  These are materials prepared (and in many instances actuallysubmitted) for publication; they have been provided to FDA for use in thisrulemaking; they bear directly on issues the Agency considers material to therulemaking; and they have been considered and relied on by the Agency inreaching conclusions on those issues.</tt><p><tt>	Such materials are not subject to any recognized privilege.  They do notcontain trade secrets.  They do not fall within any exception to mandatorydisclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C.[[section]]552(b).  Any interest the authors of these materials may havein them as intellectual property either is nonexistent or has been waived.Dr.Henningfield, for example, is a federal employee and therefore has noproperty interest in work relating to his official duties.  We agree with FDAthat when a party submits information that the party, itself, generated, "therecan be no reasonable expectation of confidentiality for information submittedto a public docket in a rulemaking proceeding."  60 Fed. Reg. 66,981-66,982(Dec.27, 1995).</tt> [4]  Thus, any authorwho provides to FDA an unpublished manuscript or draft for consideration by FDAin connection with its investigation or this rulemaking can have "no reasonableexpectation" that such a manuscript or draft will be withheld from publicscrutiny.<p>	In addition, disclosure of these materials would not deprive their authors ofany intellectual credit for their work.  Indeed, disclosure would helpestablish the priority of their work with respect to any others who replicateit.<p>	Finally, even if there were (and we believe there is not) any remaininglegitimate interest in confidentiality in these materials, it would beoverridden and far outweighed by the Agency's duty under the APA to discloseinformation that it had considered in a rulemaking and that is not privilegedand is not protected by 21 U.S.C. [[section]]331(j) or 18 U.S.C.[[section]]1905 or 5 U.S.C. [[section]]552(b).<p>	In view of the Agency's refusal even to consider nondisclosure of "tobaccocompany documents" that do not contain trade secrets but are claimed by atobacco company to be confidential and were disclosed to FDA improperly,]<tt>see letter from Margaret Jane Porter to AndrewS. Krulwich1-2 (Dec.22, 1995), the Agency's refusal to disclose documents actuallyprepared for publication by antismoking activists demonstrates its bias in thisrulemaking.</tt><p><tt>	FDA's reliance upon such "secret" allegations-- and its obduraterefusal to make that information available during the notice and commentperiod-- invalidates these proceedings.  It is antithetical to our systemof government for an agency of the United States to propose subjecting anentire industry to a new and onerous regulatory system based on exparte submissions without affording the affected companies and thepublic the fundamental right to address the allegations or even know what theyare.  This is particularly true where those submissions are made by those withlong histories of antitobacco animus.  In these circumstances, a refusal todisclose such "information" to the public shows a contempt for the Americanpeople.  </tt><h3>3.		Undisclosed Interviews with Unnamed Former</h3><tt>		<b>Employees of Cigarette Manufacturers      </b></tt><p><p><tt>	FDA also purports to rely on undisclosed interviews with unidentifiedindividuals.  For example, the proposed rule would impose an onerous andfar-reaching requirement that cigarette manufacturers be "responsible forremoving all self-service displays... advertising, labelingand other manufacturer-or-distributor-supplied items from each point of sale" that do not comply with newstandards set by FDA.  60Fed. Reg. 41,323.  The Agency has concluded thatthis requirement is "both feasible and reasonable," primarily based onstatements FDA claims were made by "former sales representatives" of cigarettecompanies in interviews with FDA officials.  Id.</tt><p><tt>	FDA has not, however, disclosed the most basic information needed toevaluate its claims concerning these interviews of "[f]ormer salesrepresentatives," such as the notes or transcripts of the interviews, thenumber of interviews, or the identity of the interviewees.  Certainly, FDAcould disclose the contents of these interviews without disclosing the sources.Moreover, there is no apparent justification for FDA's failure to disclose thesources.  Those sources have no legitimate interest in confidentiality.  Underthe APA, an agency may not withhold from the record relevant information(especially information it relies on) based on indiscriminate claims ofconfidentiality by the Agency.  If, for example, the Agency indiscriminatelyled former tobacco company employees to believe their statements would be heldin confidence, it cannot both maintain confidentiality and rely on thestatements in a rulemaking.  As a result of FDA's withholding of thisinformation, we and all other members of the public have been deprived of ameaningful opportunity to comment on the portion of the proposed rule that isbased on such undisclosed interview material.</tt> [5]<h3>4.		Clinical Studies Related to FDA's Claims</h3><tt>		<b>Concerning Nicotine&nsp;</b></tt><p><p><tt>	FDA relies heavily on studies included in New Drug Applications("NDAs") for various nicotine replacement therapies for its conclusion that "ahigh proportion of smokers are addicted [to nicotine]," 60Fed. Reg.41,549.  In particular, FDA cites the following seven NDA's: (1) NDA #18612(Nicorette gum 2mg.); (2) NDA #20066 (Nicorette gum 4 mg.); (3) NDA#19983 (ProStep Transdermal Patch); (4) NDA #20150 (Nicotrol TransdermalDelivery System); (5) NDA #20076 (Habitrol Transdermal Delivery System); (6)NDA #20165 (Nicoderm Transdermal Delivery System); and (7) NDA #20385 (NicotineNasal Spray).  Id. 41,549 &amp; n.62; Appendix 1 at A-62.</tt><p><tt>	Despite our request, FDA has refused to provide the information needed toevaluate FDA's claim that these materials support the Agency'saddiction-related "findings."  On August 31, 1995, we specifically requestedthat FDA place in the record the studies and supporting documentation for allNDAs cited by FDA in the Federal Register documents in this rulemaking.See Letter from Richard A. Merrill to David A. Kessler 4-5 (Aug. 31,1995).  FDA has refused, without explanation, to provide thosematerials.</tt><p><tt>	FDA has not put any materials relating to NDA #18612 and NDA #20385in the public record.  In an apparent concession that the materials from NDA#20385 are relevant and have been relied upon by the Agency, FDA put somematerials in its "confidential" record on December27, 1995-- but,as noted above, will not let any member of the public look at those materials.Dumping presumably relevant materials into a "secret" record (which no one isallowed to see) one week before the end of a comment period affords noopportunity for meaningful comment; and it is not due process.</tt><p><tt>	For the other NDAs, FDA has provided only selected portions of "ClinicalStudy Summaries" (most of them written by FDA staff), and has not providedadequate summaries or other relevant nontrade-secretdocumentation submitted by the manufacturers.  Such materials are not tradesecrets and are not otherwise legitimately confidential.  As a result of FDA'sarbitrary decisions, neither the studies, nor the underlying data, nor theanalyses of the researchers who conducted the studies, have been available forany of the seven NDAs relied on by FDA.  Those materials are necessary for ameaningful opportunity to comment on key factual premises of the Agency'sproposed rule.</tt><h2>B.		FDA Unlawfully Considered and Relied</h2><tt><b>		on Confidential Material FDA Determined</b></tt><p><tt>		<b>Could Not Be Disclosed&nsp;</b></tt><p><tt></tt><p><tt>	FDA has redacted from the proposed rule certain findings andconclusions, explanations of findings and conclusions, and supporting authorityon which it has nevertheless relied.  FDA has redacted such information fromthe proposed rule on the ground that the information involves confidentialmatters, such as trade secrets, that FDA legally is prohibited from disclosing.See, e.g., 60Fed. Reg. 41,707; 41,713.</tt><p><tt>	For example, FDA asserts that "[b]lending techniques have been used tofinely control nicotine concentrations in marketed cigarettes."  Id.41,707.  Yet it then redacts the sentence following that assertion, as well asthe citation supporting that assertion, on the ground that the redactedinformation involves trade secrets or other confidential commercialinformation.  Id.</tt><p><tt>	In its December27, 1995, Federal Register notice concerningits handling of "confidential" information received or considered by FDA inconnection with this proceeding, see "Procedures for HandlingConfidential Information in Rulemaking," 60Fed. Reg. 66,981-66,982(Dec.27, 1995), FDA confirmed that it has indeed considered and relied,in this proceeding, on such information that it considers to be "confidential"and, for that reason, has not placed it in the public docket.Id.</tt><p><tt>	In this instance, where true trade secrets are involved, FDA is right torecognize that it is prohibited from disclosing confidential trade secretinformation.  See 21U.S.C. [[section]]331(j); 18U.S.C.[[section]]1905; 5U.S.C. [[section]]552(b); 21C.F.R.[[section]]20.61(c) (1995).  However, because such information cannot bedisclosed, it also cannot be subjected to comment by interested parties.Consequently, it cannot be considered or relied upon by FDA in connection withthis rulemaking proceeding.  See 5U.S.C. [[section]]553(c);Portland Cement, 486F.2d at392-94; Nova Scotia,568F.2d at250-51; United States Lines, 584F.2dat536.</tt> [6]<h2>C.		FDA Must Identify and Disclose All Nonconfidential</h2><tt><b>		Information Within FDA's Files That Is Contrary</b></tt><p><tt><b>		to or Otherwise Not Supportive of FDA's</b></tt><p><tt><b>		Assertion of Jurisdiction or the Proposed Rule    </b></tt><p><tt></tt><p><tt>	FDA's analysis supporting the proposed rule is almostentirely devoid of reference to or discussion of the large body of relevantlegal, administrative, scientific, and factual material that is inconsistentwith, or otherwise not supportive of, the proposed rule.  For example, FDAclaims to have performed "an extensive investigation and comprehensive legalanalysis" that allegedly supports its assertion of jurisdiction to regulatecigarettes. 60Fed. Reg. 41,314.  However, FDA does not identify ordisclose the wealth of legal, administrative, scientific, and factualinformation that formed the basis for, or was an expression or reflection of,FDA's consistent position over more than 80years that it does nothave jurisdiction to regulate cigarettes.  Such materials include FDA's ownprior decisions that it does not have jurisdiction over cigarettes, FDA'stestimony before Congress that it does not have jurisdiction over cigarettes,and the relevant internal FDA documents that FDA relied on for its conclusionthat it lacks jurisdiction over cigarettes. </tt><p><tt>	Also not mentioned in the Agency's Federal Register documents is awealth of relevant scientific and factual information that undoubtedly came toFDA's attention during its investigation or during the preparation of theFederal Register documents in this rulemaking, and that is contrary to,or otherwise does not support, FDA's position on central scientific or factualissues.  A striking example of such omissions by the Agency is a group of FDA'sown administrative precedents with respect to products (other than nicotinepatches and nasal sprays) that contain tobacco or nicotine.  Those precedentsare discussed in VolumeV of these comments.  FDA makes only a passingreference, 60Fed. Reg. 41,483 n.5, to these obviously pertinentprecedents.</tt><p><tt>	It would be illegal for FDA, in commencing this rulemaking, to have failedto consider such obviously relevant materials in its possession.  An agencyengaged in rulemaking "must examine the relevant data and articulate asatisfactory explanation for its action."  Motor Vehicle Mfrs.Ass'nv. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463U.S. 29, 43(1983).  The "relevant data" the Agency must examine certainly include theAgency's own prior decisions, statements, and findings, and other informationof which it becomes aware, that are directly contrary to the position theAgency now seeks to adopt: </tt><p><tt>"A `settled course of behavior embodies the agency's informed judgmentthat, by pursuing that course, it will carry out the policies committed to itby Congress.  There is, then, at least a presumption that those policies willbe carried out best if the settled rule is adhered to.'"  Id. (quotingAtchison, T. &amp; S.F. R.R. Co.v. Wichita Bd. of Trade,412U.S. 800, 807-08 (1973)).</tt><p><p><tt>	From at least 1914 to August 1995, FDA's consistent position was that ithas no jurisdiction over cigarettes.  FDA obviously cannot overcome thepresumption against a reversal of that long-settledagency policy unless it considers the data and information on which that policywas based and the expressions of that policy over the years.  Accordingly, itwas wrong for FDA to refuse to include in the administrative record for commentby interested persons the materials that supported or reflected the Agency'sprior position and other relevant materials known to the Agency that arecontrary to or otherwise not supportive of its current position.  SeeWalter O. Boswell Memorial Hosp.v. Heckler, 749F.2d788, 791 (D.C. Cir. 1984); Portland Cement, 486F.2d at394;Public Citizenv. Heckler, Civ. No.85-1395, MemorandumOpinion (D.D.C. Dec. 31, 1986).</tt><p><tt><b>	D.	FDA Must Provide an Opportunity for Comment</b></tt><p><tt><b>		on FDA's Evaluation of, and Reasons for</b></tt><p><tt><b>		Rejecting, the Information Within FDA's Files</b></tt><p><tt><b>		That Is Contrary to the Proposed Rule</b></tt><p><p><tt>	FDA also is required to provide a meaningful opportunity for comment onits own evaluation of, and its reasons for rejecting, therelevant information within Agency files that is contrary to or otherwise notsupportive of the proposed rule.  Incredibly, the proposed rule does not evenattempt to explain how it may be reconciled with the wealth of legal,administrative, scientific, factual, and policy-related information that FDAhas relied on during the 80-year period in which it repeatedly and consistentlydetermined that it does not have jurisdiction over cigarettes.</tt><p><tt>	For example, FDA does not discuss its numerous prior decisions which,contrary to the "Jurisdictional Analysis" published in support of the proposedrule, hold that FDA has no jurisdiction over cigarettes.  SeeVolumeI of these comments.  FDA also fails to mention or address itsnumerous public pronouncements-- including testimony beforeCongress-- to the same effect.  Id.  Nor does the Agency addressthe wealth of scientific and factual material that is contrary to or otherwisenot supportive of the scientific and factual bases for FDA's change ofposition.</tt><p><tt>	Where, as here, an agency reverses a long-settled position, the agencymust supply a reasoned explanation.  Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass'n,463U.S. at43.  FDA acknowledges that requirement.  60Fed.Reg. 41,482, n.5.  That requirement necessarily entails a frank discussion ofthe contrary Agency precedents and pronouncements, and of other relevantinformation known to the Agency and contrary to, or otherwise not supportiveof, the Agency's new position.  Nevertheless, FDA fails to engage in anyserious discussion of these matters.</tt><p><tt>	There are numerous other examples of FDA's failure to present for publiccomment its rationale for rejecting information within its files that iscontrary to the proposed rule.  For example, FDA asserts that advertisingfeaturing the "Joe Camel" character targets underage smokers.  60Fed.Reg. 41,330; 41,334.  However, FDA fails even to mention the formal decision ofthe Federal Trade Commission (an agency that, unlike FDA, has expertise andexperience in regulating advertising of products to consumers), whichreached the opposite conclusion.  See Divided FTC Votes To EndJoe Camel Cigarette Ad Probe, 1994 Daily Rep. Execs. (BNA) 109(June9, 1994).</tt><p><tt>	FDA's obvious and deliberate strategy throughout the FederalRegister documents is to disregard virtually all authorities andinformation contrary to its present position.  The Agency thus plays "hide theball" with respect to obviously relevant authorities and information. </tt><p><tt>	The Agency presumably will, in the preamble to the final regulations,present elaborate rationales for its rejections of contrary authorities andinformation.  However, by keeping those rationales secret until the publicationof the final rule, the Agency will have avoided presenting them for publicscrutiny and criticism, and thereby will have denied the public an opportunityto comment on those rationales in this rulemaking proceeding.</tt><p><tt>	The strategy the Agency is pursuing in this rulemaking is thus unlawful,unfair, and unworthy.  It mocks the Administrative Procedure Act.  It mocks thefederal courts, through whose decisions informal rulemaking has become a modelof informed and deliberative communication between the government and thepublic.  It also mocks the fundamental sense of procedural fairness mandated bythe Due Process Clause and fostered by the APA.</tt> [7  The strategy reflects a mindset that brooksno opposition, and that sees no value in the public comment the Agency legallyis required to consider:  the Agency has made up its mind, and is determinednot to change it.   <p>	The strategy is also a discredit to an agency that for many years had been aleader among federal agencies in conducting fair and open public proceedings.However committed the Agency may be to the goals of this rulemaking, thosegoals cannot justify its abuse of the notice-and-comment procedure by aproposed rule (including its accompanying jurisdictional analysis) thatdeliberately puts forward a biased, one-sided,and misleading presentation of the relevant legal, administrative, scientific,and factual materials.<p>	FDA's failure to present for public comment its reasoned assessment of allsuch relevant materials (including those that are contrary to or otherwise donot support its position) has denied the public a fair opportunity to commenton the basis for the proposed rule.<p>]<h1>VIII.	FDA HAS FAILED TO PROVIDE THE PUBLIC WITH A MEANINGFUL</h1><tt><b>	OPPORTUNITY TO COMMENT ON THE FOCUS GROUP STUDIES AND</b></tt><p><tt><b>	THE LANGUAGE OF THE WARNING STATEMENTS FDA PROPOSES TO</b></tt><p><tt><b>	IMPOSE ON PRIVATE PARTIES                 </b></tt><p><p><tt>	In the proposed rule, FDA stated that it would conduct "extensive focusgroup testing" during the comment period and would use that information todevelop the language of warnings to be required, by the final rule, incigarette advertising.  60Fed. Reg. 41,338.  According to FDA, thestatements would fulfill the proposed requirement that cigarette advertisingcontain a brief summary of the relevant warnings, precautions, side effects,and contraindications pertaining to cigarette use.  Id. at41,374.</tt><p><tt>	On December 1, 1995, FDA published in the Federal Register,60Fed. Reg. 61,670 (Dec. 1, 1995), a summary report entitled "Findings ofthe Focus Group Testing of Brief Statements for Cigarette Advertisements."  FDAfurther announced that it "will use the report, as well as comments submittedon the report, to determine the design, format and content of the briefstatement when preparing a final rule."  FDA gave interested persons only untilJanuary 2, 1996-- the deadline previously set for comments on thematerials made public last summer and fall-- to submit written commentson the focus group report.  </tt><p><tt>	FDA's findings concerning the 19 focus group tests are stated inconclusory language, and generally lack specific references to the testingdata.  For example, there are numerous references to views that the Agency sayswere expressed by "most groups" or "several groups," without furtherspecification.  Commenters, therefore, must review the transcripts of the focusgroup studies, which are more than 1500 pages, in order to evaluate and respondto FDA's findings.  However, FDA did not make the transcripts and relatedmaterials publicly available to us until December 8, 1995, in response to ourspecific request that it do so.</tt> [8]  Atthat time, FDA stated that other materials we requested, "such as interimtabulations and methodologies developed for the [focus group] `study' do notexist."  Letter from William Schultz to Arthur N. Levine 2 (Dec. 7, 1995).  FDAalso refused our request to extend the comment period to provide an opportunityfor thorough comment on the focus group studies, and the conclusions FDA drawsfrom those studies.  ]<tt>Id. </tt><p><tt>	FDA's belated disclosure of the focus group studies and its failure toextend the period to comment on those studies have denied us and the rest ofthe public a full opportunity to comment on those studies, and the requirementsFDA seeks to impose based on them.  FDA has given the parties only 14 workingdays interspersed during the Christmas and New Year's holidays to respond tothe focus group studies.  So short a period is simply inadequate for thethorough review and fully considered expert evaluation necessary for commentson matters as important as FDA's findings concerning the focus group testing,and the requirements FDA would impose on the basis of those findings.  While wehave included (in VolumeVII) some comments on the focus group findings,this does not overcome the fact that adequate opportunity for comment has beendenied by FDA's last minute provision of the report and data.</tt><p><h1>IX.	THE PROPOSED RULE LACKS ADEQUATE FACTUAL SUPPORT</h1><p><tt>	Pursuant to the "arbitrary" and "capricious" standard of Section706of the APA, 5U.S.C. [[section]]706(2)(A), an agency rule is invalidand unenforceable if it lacks adequate factual support.  See AircraftOwners and Pilots Ass'n v. FAA, 600 F.2d 965, 971 &amp; n.28 (D.C.Cir. 1979); Associated Indus., Inc. v. Department of Labor, 487F.2d 342, 349-50 (2d Cir. 1973). </tt><p><tt>	For reasons set forth in detail in the substantive sections of ourcomments, the evidence relied on by FDA is insufficient to support numerousprovisions in the proposed rule and the "jurisdictional analysis" in support ofit.  The procedural defects set forth in this section of our comments establishthat the factual predicate for several critical aspects of the proposed ruleand for the accompanying jurisdictional analysis is patently insufficient foran additional reason:  a substantial portion of the material on which FDArelies cannot be considered or relied upon because it was not made availablefor public scrutiny and comment.</tt><p><tt>	For example, the requirement in the proposed rule that cigarettemanufacturers be responsible for policing the point-of-sale advertising of third parties, such as distributors and retailers, is basedalmost entirely on FDA's account of undisclosed interviews with unidentifiedpersons.  60Fed. Reg. 41,323, 41,373.  Because such undisclosedinterviews cannot be considered or relied upon by FDA, the proposed requirementnecessarily is invalid and unenforceable.  See also Amoco OilCo. v. EPA, 543F.2d 270, 76 (D.C. Cir. 1975) ("EPA cannot byregulation impose blanket liability on refiners for all of the negligent actsof their lessees in the sale of gasoline in violation of the applicable statuteand regulations"); Amoco Oil Co. v. EPA, 501 F.2d 722 (D.C. Cir.1974) (agency regulations cannot impose an irrebuttable presumption ofvicarious liability).</tt><p><tt>	FDA also relies heavily for its claim that cigarette manufacturers"manipulate" nicotine yields, 60Fed. Reg. 41,693-41,733,on undisclosed data and calculations allegedly obtained from the FTC and onundisclosed trade secrets and confidential commercial information.  Becausesuch undisclosed information cannot be considered or relied upon by FDA, theAgency's claims concerning manipulation of nicotine yields fail for want of asufficient factual basis.  </tt><p><tt>	More generally, FDA apparently has relied throughout the proposedregulations on undisclosed unpublished scientific manuscripts and otherdocuments.  When these materials are excluded from the record, as required byapplicable law, the remaining record is insufficient to support FDA's proposedregulations.</tt><p><h1>X.	FDA'S REFUSAL TO EXTEND THE COMMENT PERIOD</h1><tt><b>	IS ARBITRARY ANDCAPRICIOUS&nbs;</b></tt><p><p><tt>	FDA's decision to limit the comment period to approximately 90 days fromthe date of release of the supporting documents it belatedly made available inthe public record of the rulemaking is arbitrary and capricious.</tt> [9 <p>	The proposed rule is an unprecedented and controversial assertion ofregulatory authority over a product that for 80 years FDA has declared is notwithin its jurisdiction.  FDA's expansive interpretation of its authority underthe drug and device provisions of the FDCA has profound implications, andimmediately would affect nearly 50million American smokers, as well asretailers, tobacco farmers, farming communities, the cigarette manufacturingand distribution industries, the advertising industry, participants inactivities sponsored by cigarette manufacturers, manufacturers of drugs anddevices legitimately regulated by FDA, and others.<p>	The proposed rule also contains a large number of novel and intrusivecontrols, almost every one of which could be the subject of a separate,substantial rulemaking proceeding.  Many of these proposed controls raise newand complex issues of food and drug law and of constitutional law, and requireanalysis of complex scientific and factual materials.<p>	The scope and volume of the scientific and factual materials pertaining to theproposed rule also are extraordinary.  The proposed rule is described in a75-page ]<tt>Federal Register notice, supported by a 325-pageaccompanying "analysis."  Initially, FDA placed over 16,000 pages of documentsand other materials in the record in the rulemaking docket.  Subsequently, FDAadded well over 100,000 additional pages to the record.  All of these materialsmust be reviewed and evaluated before commenters can prepare fully consideredresponses on the legal, scientific, and factual assertions set forth in theproposed rule.</tt><p><tt>	FDA itself acknowledges "that the regulation of cigarettes raises societalissues of great complexity and magnitude."  Letter from David A. Kessler toScottD. Ballin 3 (Feb. 25, 1994).  However, despite the sweeping andunprecedented nature of the proposed rule, its complexity, and theextraordinary volume of the accompanying documentation and cited references,FDA refused our formal request to extend the original comment period to atleast 180 days.</tt> [10] <p>	FDA has regularly provided comment periods of 180days or more inproceedings involving far less complex issues-- and having far lesssocietal impact-- than the current rulemaking.  Indeed, it is fair to saythat comment periods of 180 days or more are the norm for important or complexFDA rulemaking proceedings.  For example:<p>	]&#176;<tt>	Dkt. 78N-021D (diaper rash): 270 days, 55Fed. Reg.51,926 (Dec. 18, 1990);</tt><p><p><tt>	</tt>&#176;<tt>	Dkt. 78N-0064 (antiperspirants): 180 days, 58Fed.Reg. 38,541 (July 19, 1993);</tt><p><p><tt>	</tt>&#176;<tt>	Dkt. 93N-0029 (draft revised "Redbook"): 300 days,58Fed. Reg. 40,151 (July 27, 1993);</tt><p><p><tt>	</tt>&#176;<tt>	Dkt. 78N-0038 (sunscreen TFM): 270 days; 59Fed. Reg.29,706 (June 8, 1994) and</tt><p><p><tt>	</tt>&#176;<tt>	Dkt. 93N-0348 (lead in food ingredients): 180 days,59Fed. Reg. 23,035 (May 4, 1994).</tt><p><p><tt>None of those proceedings presented issues of the complexity or societalimpact of those involved in the current rulemaking proceeding. </tt><p><tt>	Measured against FDA's past acknowledgment of the need for a commentperiod of at least 180 days for complex rulemaking proceedings, the Agency'sdecision to provide a period half that length for this proceeding is patentlyunreasonable.  Indeed, FDA offers no credible explanation of its decision torequire unusual expedition in this proceeding and, in so doing, to depart fromits precedents.  </tt><p><tt>	FDA's claim that an extension of the comment period to at least 90 daysfrom FDA's addition of well over 100,000 pages of documents to the record wouldbe contrary to the public health, 60Fed. Reg. 53,560 (Oct. 16, 1995),does not withstand even minimal scrutiny.  Government and public concerns aboutsmoking and health have existed in this country for decades.  The Agency's ownconduct demonstrates that unusual haste is not required here: FDA took morethan 18 months to conduct the "investigation" that led to this rulemaking.Moreover, nearly two and a half years ago, FDA's parent Department, HHS,proposed regulations, pursuant to the explicit congressional mandate of theADAMHA Reorganization Act, 42U.S.C. [[section]]300x-26, which, likethe proposed regulations at issue in this proceeding, were intended to reduceunderage smoking, 58Fed. Reg. 45,156 (Aug.28, 1993).  HHS stillhas not promulgated those regulations in final form.  </tt><p><tt>	In light of the foregoing, it is absurd for FDA to claim that the commentperiod in this rulemaking must be truncated "because of the public healthimportance of this matter."  60Fed. Reg. 53,560.</tt><p><tt>	Finally, the fact that we have been able to present this set of commentsdoes not show that the comment period has been adequate.  With additional time,and the disclosure of materials such as the NDA and FTC sales data and theunpublished nonconfidential documents noted above, more thorough considerationand more pointed responses could have been given to the large number of issuesraised, and the large volume of materials embraced, by FDA's proposedregulations.</tt><p><h1>XI.

FDA'S FAILURE TO PROPOSE A REASONABLE EFFECTIVE DATE</h1><tt><b>	ALLOWING SUFFICIENT TIME FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ITS</b></tt><p><tt><b>	REGULATIONS IS ARBITRARY AND CAPRICIOUS</b></tt><p><p><tt>	As we have demonstrated in these comments, the notion that cigaretteswould be subject to FDA's medical device requirements is absurd.  Oneindication of this absurdity is that FDA-- which routinely proposeseffective dates and implementation schedules for its major regulations--did not propose such a date or schedule for regulating cigarettes as medicaldevices.  Even FDA does not know "what would be the appropriate schedule forimplementing the provisions of the final rule."  60Fed. Reg.41,341.</tt><p><tt>	Nevertheless, FDA has proposed novel and sweeping regulations respectingthe distribution, advertising, and promotion of cigarettes, together with"various pre-existing requirements in the statute and the regulations."Id. at41,352.  Section897.10 would make cigarettemanufacturers responsible for compliance with all the regulations, even byparties whose activities the manufacturers do not control.  FDA furtherthreatens that failure to comply with its requirements "could result in varioussanctions, including:  fines, injunctions, civil money penalties, productseizure, and prosecution."  Id. at41,352.  </tt><p><tt>	The Agency concedes that it is "likely that the final rule would containsome provisions that could not be complied with immediately following the datethat the final rule becomes effective."  Id. at41,341.  At thesame time, the Federal Register notice suggests that most provisions ofany final rule could generally take effect on the day it was published</tt> [11 (which would be unlawful) or perhaps withinthe minimum 30 days required by the Administrative Procedure Act.]<tt>See 5U.S.C. [[section]]553(d).  To precipitateimplementation of regulations with such massive effects would be arbitrary,capricious, and hence all the more unlawful.</tt> [12<p>	We begin with this observation.  In light of the time FDA has providedcompanies long-regulated by FDA to comply with routine changes in newregulatory requirements, and given the burdensome requirements that would beimposed under the proposed regulations and the "pre-existing requirements," itis self-evident that effective dates ranging from two years to three yearswould be required, ]<tt>at an absolute minimum, to allow companiesnewly subject to FDA requirements to achieve compliance with a new set ofregulatory requirements.  Although such time frames are consistent with pastschedules set by FDA for new rules, there is, in fact, no comparable precedent.FDA's tobacco regulations would bring under FDA's regulatory control an entireindustry whose activities have been the subject of regulation over many yearsby numerous federal regulatory agencies, but have never been the subject ofregulation by FDA.</tt><p><tt>	More fundamentally, FDA's proposals would require massive changes in themanufacture, advertising, and marketing of cigarettes.  In the past, the Agencyhas recognized that such dramatic changes warrant delays in the effective datefor regulations for periods far exceeding the legal minimum.  It wouldtherefore be arbitrary and capricious for the Agency to depart from its pastpractice and deny the tobacco industry a substantial time to adjust to therules' sweeping provisions.</tt> [13]<p><tt><b>	A.	The Dramatic Changes in Manufacturing</b></tt><p><tt><b>		Practices Required by FDA's Rule </b></tt><p><tt><b>		Necessitate Substantial Time for Compliance</b></tt><p><p><tt>	FDA has announced that, as medical devices, cigarettes would besubject to FDA's current good manufacturing practices (CGMP) regulations fordevices, 21C.F.R. pt.820 (1995).  60Fed. Reg. 41,352.  FDAhas consistently recognized the need to allow industries that it alreadyregulates adequate time to implement new CGMP requirements.</tt><p><tt>	When FDA originally imposed the CGMP requirements upon medical devicemanufacturers in 1978, it allowed five months until the regulation's effectivedate.  43Fed. Reg. 31,508 (1978).  The FDA advisory committee, in fact,suggested that the medical device industry be allowed even more time to adjust.See id. at31,510, 31,526.  Those CGMP requirements weremuch simpler than FDA's current requirements.  CGMPs have become vastly moresophisticated since 1978.</tt><p><tt>	Moreover, even in 1978, those companies were not starting from scratch.Before the device CGMP provisions were promulgated, those manufacturers wererequired to make their devices under procedures that ensured they would not be"adulterated" or "misbranded" under the FDCA.  See 21U.S.C.[[section]][[section]]351, 352.  Moreover, several of thosemanufacturers' products were regulated as "drugs," and the methods, processesand controls for their manufacture were subject to FDA's CGMP regulations fordrugs.  See 21C.F.R. pt.211 (1995).</tt><p><tt>	Cigarette manufacturers start from a very different regulatory baseline.Unlike nearly all other "device" manufacturers, cigarette companies process anagricultural commodity.  The device CGMP requirements are applicable to an"instrument, apparatus, implement, machine, contrivance" or similar truedevice.  Merely to convert the CGMPs to processing tobacco leaf will be a majorundertaking.</tt><p><tt>	More recently, in proposing further changes in the device CGMPs, theAgency again assured the device industry that the new rules would not beeffective for 6 months.  See 60Fed. Reg. 37,856 (1995).  Themedical device industry, though, believes that a period of a year and a half isneeded.  M-D-D-I Reports ("The Gray Sheet"), Sept.18, 1995,at5.</tt><p><tt>	The medical device industry's need for adequate time to comply withchanges to an existing set of regulations underscores the fact thatcigarette manufacturers would need considerably longer to satisfy a set ofrequirements completely new to them.  To comply with FDA's deviceCGMP regulations, cigarette manufacturers would need to develop, establish, andimplement new systems for, inter alia, controlling purchasing,design, recordkeeping, and manufacturing processes so that they would conformto FDA's requirements.  Because many of FDA's requirements are intended tofacilitate FDA inspections as much as to improve product quality, even a well-runcigarette manufacturing facility would need to adopt major new systems in orderto achieve compliance.  That, of course, would be enormously time-consuming.</tt><p><tt>	Indeed, cigarette manufacturers would have to make major changes to theirprocedures just to accommodate the recordkeeping required by FDA's CGMPrequirements:</tt><p><tt>	</tt>&#176;<tt>	Manufacturers' quality assurance programs would have toinclude reviews of production records, documented approvals/rejections of allcomponents, and regular written audits, with reviews by FDA.  21C.F.R.[[section]]820.20.  </tt><p><p><tt>	</tt>&#176;<tt>	Personnel would have to receive new training in thequality assurance and recordkeeping required by the CGMP regulations,id. [[section]]820.25, and equipment maintenance would have to beclosely chronicled, id. [[section]]820.60.  </tt><p><p><tt>	</tt>&#176;<tt>	Calibration procedures would have to be documented,id. [[section]]820.61, and extensive records would have to be keptof components as they were received, id. [[section]]820.80.</tt><p><p><tt>	In its 325-page Medical Device Good Manufacturing Practices Manual(5th ed. 1991), FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health describes thesystems and procedures necessary to establish and implement a CGMP programacceptable to FDA.  For example, the quality assurance ("QA") programnecessitated by the device CGMP regulations requires a manufacturer to createboth a quality assurance system and a "feedback" system that includesmanagement policies, objectives, organizations, and documentation (includingrecords of both task performance and monitoring).  Id. at 2-2 to 2-3.The QA system itself and the system's reports must be fully documented andcirculated  Id. at 2-2. A quality assurance plan-- its policies, objectives, andspecifications-- must be prepared, circulated, and put in place,id. at2-5 to 2-6; employees must be trained (and the trainingitself documented), id. at2-7 to 2-8; and systems for collectingquality assurance data must be created, tested, implemented and then audited,id. at2-9 to 2-11.  All processes must be validated.  See21C.F.R. [[section]]820.100.</tt><p><tt>	If a manufacturer cannot implement an acceptable quality assurance programin time, the results can be devastating.  Failure to comply with the deviceCGMP regulations causes a device-- and all devices made under thoseconditions-- to be adulterated under the FDA.  21U.S.C.[[section]]351(h).  Adulterated devices may be seized, 21U.S.C.[[section]]334(a)(2), and their shipment enjoined, id.[[section]]332.  Thus, inadequate time to comply with CGMPs would exposecigarette manufacturers to the risk of their products being completely barredfrom commerce.</tt><p><tt>	Cigarette manufacturers already have quality control systems in place.However, the tobacco industry is not the medical device industry; itsmanufacturing processes are quite different.  Therefore, it is difficult tojudge how long it would take cigarette manufacturers to adopt and implementFDA's distinctive requirements for good manufacturing practices.</tt><p><tt>	Nonetheless, it would be palpably unreasonable for the Agency to set aneffective date of less than two years for the implementation of CGMPs by thetobacco industry.</tt><p><tt><b>	B.	The Retail Monitoring System</b></tt><p><tt><b>		Described in Subpart B Would Take</b></tt><p><tt><b>		at Least Two Years To Implement  </b></tt><p><tt></tt><p><tt>	SubpartB of the proposed rule, if promulgated as afinal regulation, would require manufacturers to remove all self-servicedisplays and noncomplying advertising from each point of sale.  They would alsohave to monitor and inspect the labeling, advertising, and distribution oftheir products at the point of sale.  In addition, extensive physicalrenovations in stores would be required to move cigarette packages behindretail counters.  Promotional materials posted about the stores would have tobe eliminated.  Retailers would need to hire and train additional personnelbecause of the additional time needed for each transaction as clerks dealt withcustomers in face-to-facetransactions and checked proofs of age.  Manufacturers would be required tomonitor this profoundly reordered retail structure.</tt><p><tt>	In its report, The Costs of Proposed FDA Regulations Regarding theMarketing of Tobacco Products (VolumeXI of these comments), theBarents Group LLC reviewed in detail the steps that would have to be taken toimplement these changes at the retail level.  The accompanying technical reportof A.T. Kearney, Inc. analyzes the mechanical processes that would be needed toclear retail stores of the newly banned cigarette promotions and displays.  Asthese studies show, implementing the proposed regulations would require dozensof different activities at each of the hundreds ofthousands of retail outlets.</tt><p><tt>	Because of their scope and reach, we believe that it would take at leasttwo years to meet the requirements in SubpartB.</tt><p><tt>	FDA has, itself, recognized that a thorough monitoring system requires asubstantial amount of time and effort to implement.  On January28, 1994,FDA announced proposed regulations for a monitoring system to ensure quality inthe seafood industry.  59Fed. Reg. 4142 (1994).  Acknowledging that themonitoring system "cannot be written and implemented overnight," the Agencyinitially announced that it would give the seafood industry one year toimplement the proposed new monitoring system.  Id. at4156.  In itsfinal rule, issued just last month, FDA announced that the seafood industrywould have two years for implementation.  60Fed. Reg.65,096 (Dec.18, 1995).</tt><p><tt>	Seafood sanitation and related monitoring issues have been under activediscussion among FDA, the USDA and the seafood industry for several years.Voluntary quasi-regulatorystandards, adopted with FDA and USDA approval, have existed for some time.Nevertheless, FDA provided a two-yearimplementation period for its new regulations.  Unlike the seafood industry,the tobacco industry has no history of monitoring compliance with requirementsthat would be imposed by FDA's regulations.</tt><p><tt>	By FDA's own count, the restructured retail tobacco industry will includeup to 700,000 outlets.  60Fed. Reg. 41,365.  The changes that must beimplemented in those stores are quite extensive, and, while different, are intheir own way no less onerous than the regulations FDA has imposed on thosehandling seafood.  In fact, the required physical renovations alone, the costsand time needed for the completion of which the Agency consistentlyunderestimates, are by themselves sufficient to justify a much longer timeperiod.  FDA must allow at least two years for substantial compliance with therequired changes in sales and distribution contemplated bySubpartB.</tt><p><tt><b>	C.	Cigarette Manufacturers Would Need</b></tt><p><tt><b>		Substantial Time To Develop and</b></tt><p><tt><b>		Present the $150 Million "Educational"</b></tt><p><tt><b>		Programs Required UnderSubpartC</b></tt><p><p><tt>	The unprecedented nature of FDA's proposal to require manufacturers"to establish and maintain a national public educational program, includingmajor reliance on television messages," all but precludes comparison with theeffective dates of other FDA regulations.  Even FDA seems to acknowledge thedifficulty in coordinating, creating, and placing in the media a "program[that] would be national in scope and could require that the companies purchasecertain times and places on television programming."  60Fed. Reg. 41,327.Accordingly, a substantial time is needed before such a program could beinitiated.</tt><p><tt>	Time will be required merely to account for FDA's involvement.  In formingthe campaign, "industry members could select from a variety of messagesmaintained by FDA."  Id.  Thus, it would be FDA, not the privateadvertisers, that "could determine which messages would be appropriate."Id. at41,327-41,328. The Federal Register notice, however, offers no guidance as to how theprogram would be structured and implemented with ongoing FDA involvement.Thus, the Agency has failed to provide commenters sufficient information as tohow the program would work to make possible reliable estimates of the timeneeded for specific tasks.</tt><p><tt>	FDA suggests that the requirement that hearing aid providers affordconsumers certain instructional brochures is an analogous precedent. See60Fed. Reg. 41,351 (citing regulation set forth at 21C.F.R.[[section]]801.420).  This claim is preposterous.  The hearing-aidpatient brochure program bears no relationship to the nationwide, major-mediamulti-firmadvertising campaigns that FDA demands at a cost of $150 million peryear.</tt><p><tt>	Even for the relatively minor user-notificationrequirement for hearing aids, FDA allowed six months before theregulation became effective.  42Fed. Reg. 9286 (1977).  At a minimum, atleast two years would be necessary for even substantial compliance by thecigarette manufacturers with the educational program described inSubpartC.</tt><p><tt><b>	D.	Experience Shows That Relabeling</b></tt><p><tt><b>		Requirements, as Described in</b></tt><p><tt><b>		SubpartD, Cannot Be Implemented</b></tt><p><tt><b>Quickly&nbs;</b></tt><p><tt></tt><p><tt>	Subpart D of the proposed rule would require substantialchanges in the tobacco industry's advertising and sponsorship practices, and inthe industry's labeling and packaging of tobacco products.  Although there areno precedents for many of the Agency's extreme proposals for cigaretteadvertising, past regulatory efforts suggest that the tobacco industry must beafforded a substantial period of time to implement these requirements.  Thetime periods that federal agencies have allowed in the past for compliance withrelabeling requirements include:</tt><p>&#176;<tt>	Hazard communication labeling requirements:  24 or 30months allowed.  When the Occupational Safety and Health Administrationissued its final rule regarding labels for hazardous materials, chemicalmanufacturers were given two years to comply with the new labelingrequirements, and other employers were given an additional 6 months, for atotal of 30 months to come into compliance.  48Fed. Reg. 53,280(1983).</tt><p><p>&#176;<tt>	New food labeling requirements:  16 months beforeeffective date.  In response to industry concerns that relabeling costs tocomply with the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990 would dropdramatically (by 30 to 90 percent) if the manufacturers had a year or more toadjust, the Agency extended the period for implementation to16months to allow food companies to use up most of the existinglabeling and packaging stocks and to incorporate labeling language thatcomplies with FDA's regulations.  58Fed. Reg. 2070, 2078 (1993). </tt><p><p>&#176;<tt>	New labeling requirements for iron-containing foods:6months allowed.  FDA allowed manufacturers 6months to placewarnings on iron-containing dietary supplements and foods.  59Fed. Reg.51,030; 51,056 (1994) (noting that "[i]n general, costs of compliance forlabeling and other requirements are less if longer compliance periods areprovided because firms can incorporate mandatory changes to product, labelingand packaging with regularly scheduled changes").</tt><p><p>&#176;<tt>	New rules on packaging lidocaine and dibucaine:oneyear allowed.  The Consumer Product Safety Commission's final rulegoverning child-resistant packaging for lidocaine- or dibucaine-containingproducts, pursuant to the Poison Prevention Packaging Act of 1970, allowsmanufacturers one year to implement the required changes in packaging.60Fed. Reg. 17,992 (1995); see id. at18,003 (allowingtemporary exemptions, acknowledging that this "1-year effective date may notallow adequate time to modify or replace" the packaging).  </tt><p><p>&#176;<tt>	New meat and poultry labeling:  effective date extended,in order to lower implementation costs.  Recognizing that additional timewould reduce costs and increase uniformity in labeling, the Food Safety andInspection Service (FSIS) of the U.S. Department of Agriculture extended (to19 months) the implementation period for FSIS requirements regarding thelabeling of meat and poultry products.  59Fed. Reg. 30,875 (1994).</tt><p><p>&#176;<tt>	New rules on labeling household substances:30months allowed before enforcement.  To ease industry's transitionto new packaging for household products, the CPSC postponed a new rule'seffective date for 12 months, and assured manufacturers anadditional 18 months of exemption from compliance, for a total of30 months before compliance would be required.  60Fed. Reg.37,710, 37,726-37,727(1995).  Furthermore, the CPSC announced that it would grant individualmanufacturers further extensions (on proper application) beyond the initial30-month period.  Id.  </tt><p><p><tt>	In these examples, the responsible agency allowed a substantial period, upto 30months, for firms to achieve compliance with straightforward changesin packaging and labeling.  </tt><p><tt>	The requirements that FDA has proposed for the tobacco industry--requirements that we believe it has no authority to impose-- would have abroader reach and greater impact than any of the examples cited.  Their purposeis, and their effect would be, to revolutionize the way cigarettes arepromoted.  They affect not only labeling, but also billboards, magazines,promotional events, and many other activities.  Compliance would directlyaffect advertising companies, media, and a myriad of others.  The labeling andpackaging program "precedents" that we have identified here provide only thepalest of comparisons because the changes imposed in those rulemakings were farless revolutionary than those proposed here.  Thus, as a matter of precedent,practicality, and fairness, the effective date of any final regulations musttake account of the enormous burdens they impose.  At very least, it would takethree years to make the changes necessary for substantial compliance withSubpartD.</tt><p><H3><a href="contents.htm#start"><I>Table of Contents</I></a></H3><H3><a href=http://www.counsel.com/lawlinks/spotlight/index.html><I>Spotlight</I></a></H3><hr><IMG WIDTH=50 HEIGHT=48 ALIGN=LEFT SRC=../../lcc.gif ALT=*> Released through <a href="/inside/about.html">COUNSEL CONNECT</a>.

<P>UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT<BR>

DISTRICT OF NEW JERSEY</P>



<P>DENNIS RODMAN,<BR>

Plaintiff,</P>



<P>v.</P>



<P>FANATIX APPAREL, INC., MICKEY GOLDSCHMIDT, JMJ INTERNATIONAL, MHK PRODUCTS,

INC., JAY ENIS and JOHN DOES 10, Defendants. </P>



<P>Civil Action No.</P>





<P>FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF: FALSE DESIGNATION OF ORIGIN

and INVASION OF RIGHT OF PUBLICITY </P>



<P>Plaintiff Dennis Rodman, by his attorneys Jules D. Zalon and Rutan &

Tucker, hereby respectfully alleges on knowledge as to plaintiff's own acts

and on information and belief as to all other matters, the following for

his complaint against the defendants: </P>



<P>A. Plaintiff Dennis Rodman is a citizen and resident of the state of Texas.</P>





<P>B. Defendant Fanatix Apparel, Inc. is a New Jersey Corporation whose

principal place of business is at 729 Washburn Street, Teaneck, New Jersey

07666. </P>



<P>C. Defendant Goldschmidt is the president of Fanatix and has caused it to

commit the acts herein complained of. </P>



<P>D. Defendant JMJ International is a business entity whose formal

organization is not known, but whose principal place of business is at 130

Gamewell Street, Hackensack, New Jersey. </P>



<P>E. Defendant MHK Products, inc. is a New Jersey Corporation whose principal

place of business is at 130 Gamewell Street, Hackensack, New Jersey. </P>



<P>F. Defendant Jay Enis is a principal of both defendants JMJ International,

and MHK Products, Inc., and has caused each of them to commit the acts

herein complained of. </P>



<P>G. Defendants John Does 1-10 are partners of, or are otherwise associated

with, one or another of the named defendants in their production, sale or

distribution of unauthorized Dennis Rodman T-shirts, and are either

residents of or regularly do business in the State of New Jersey. </P>



<P>H. The identities of the individuals described as John Does are not

presently known; the complaint will be amended to include their true names

when identified. The counts herein set forth arise out of their actions

within the State of New Jersey. </P>



<P>I. The separate counts set forth herein arise under the trademark laws of

the United States, Title 15 U.S.C. 1051, et seq. as well as the common law

of this state, and jurisdiction and venue are founded upon Title 15 U.S.c.

1051 et seq. Title 28 U.S.C. 1331, 1338, 1391, 2201 and 2202. The matter in

controversy exceeds, exclusive of interest and costs, the sum of Fifty

Thousand Dollars ($50,000) and is between citizen of different states. </P>





<H3>AS AND FOR A FIRST COUNT FOR VIOLATION OF 15 U.S.C. 1125(a)</H3> 



<P>Plaintiff Dennis Rodman is a well known, extremely successful and hugely

popular professional basketball player. Mr. Rodman's exploits on the court

are legendary: he has led the entire National Basketball Association in

rebounds for five years in a row, a record that no other player has ever

come close to matching; he was named the NBA defensive Player of the Year;

he has been an NBA All-Star, and a member of the NBA All Defensive Team. </P>



<P>2. As a result of this popularity, plaintiff has regularly received

financially lucrative offers to license use of his name and likeness on a

wide variety of products. However, he has been careful to limit such

merchandising activities only to products of the highest quality and

pursuant to arrangements by which he maintains complete control over the

manner in which such name and likeness is used, such that he maintains and

fosters an image in keeping with the high regard in which he is held

throughout the sports world. Presently plaintiff has authorized Today's

Trendz and NIKE, Inc. to produce T-shirts bearing plaintiff's name and

likeness. Both these agreement are carefully and constantly monitored for

quality control purposes, and require the licensees to submit all licensed

articles to plaintiff for his approval. The agreements also require the

application of specific trademark and copyright information on all such

articles. </P>



<P>3. During the course of his remarkable career, plaintiff has at various

times arranged with different tattoo artists to apply tattoos to his

(plaintiff's) body. Each tattoo was carefully chosen by plaintiff; several

were in fact designed by the plaintiff. One of the tattoos is a

meticulously accurate likeness of plaintiff's young daughter, Alexis. </P>



<P>4. Plaintiff caused each of these tattoos to be produced, in part, for the

purpose of identifying and associating them with himself, solely. </P>



<P>5. The said tattoos are extremely recognizable and identifiable as being

"Dennis Rodman's tattoos." They are often referred to in published articles

and television and other media segments, always being identified with the

plaintiff alone. As an indication of this identifiability of the tattoos

with plaintiff, McDonalds and Carl's Jr., two nationwide food chains,

recently filmed television commercials featuring plaintiff's tattoos.

Moreover, one of plaintiff's nicknames throughout the sports world is

"Tattoo Man." </P>



<P>6. As a result of plaintiff's great public visibility and the public's

association of plaintiff with these tattoos, the tattoos have attained and

now possess a secondary and distinctive trademark meaning to the general

public, particularly to sports fans. </P>



<P>7. The defendants were, until restrained by this Court, producing and

distributing a long-sleeved T-shirt bearing colorable replications of ten

of plaintiff's body tattoos, including the tattoo of plaintiff's daughter,

Alexis; each such tattoo is placed on the shirt in the same place as the

actual tattoo is found on plaintiff's body. </P>



<P>8. The accused shirts are extremely expensive to produce, and were

therefore, until restrained by this Court, being sold at premium prices

throughout the country. Nevertheless, they were being sold in large numbers

by major chain stores and supermarkets, particularly in the Chicagoland

area. </P>



<P>9. The only reason why these shirts could have commanded such premium

prices was their identification with plaintiff, being widely described as

"Dennis Rodman Tattoo T- Shirts." In fact, the shirts would have had no

commercial value but for their association with the plaintiff. </P>



10. In advertising and promotional materials issued by or authorized by the

defendants to sell their spurious shirt, the defendants have regularly and

prominently used the plaintiff's name, generally referring to the shirt as

their "Dennis Rodman Tattoo T-Shirt," and have otherwise represented to the

public and the trade that the shirt was authorized by the plaintiff, which

is clearly false. 



<P>11. Reproduced here is a copy of one such display, from the Omni SuperStore

in Bridgeview, Illinois: </P>



<P>[An actual photograph of such display is annexed to the original complaint

filed herein.] </P>



<P>12. These shirts are universally recognized as being associated with

plaintiff even absent accompanying use of his name on the shirt itself by

the defendants. This recognition is a direct and natural consequence of the

defendants' own identification of the shirt as the "Dennis Rodman Tattoo

T-Shirt," and their like representations to their sales reps and their

customers. In addition, the arrangement of these ten replications of

plaintiff's body tattoos on the defendants' infringing shirt would be --

and are -- clearly recognized as identifying the plaintiff. For example,

newspaper articles, television segments and Internet "pages" have regularly

and prominently identified the shirt as the "Dennis Rodman Tattoo T-Shirt."</P>





<P>13. Defendants' said merchandise is of the same general nature, type and

description as merchandise licensed by the plaintiff and manufactured and

distributed by plaintiff's various licensees, and defendants' said shirts

and plaintiff's authorized merchandise are so related that the defendants'

use is likely to cause confusion among purchasers. The use of the said

tattoos by each of the defendants is without the permission or authority of

plaintiff and said use by the defendants is likely to cause confusion, to

cause mistake and to deceive. </P>



<P>14. The said infringing merchandise of the defendants being of inferior

quality, the sale thereof will be damaging to the reputation which

plaintiff has developed in connection with his licensing of authentic

merchandise. </P>



<P>15. The unauthorized sale of such bootleg merchandise is likely to create

confusion and/or misunderstanding by the purchasers as to the source and

sponsorship of such merchandise. </P>



<P>16. The defendants are selling their imitation merchandise without the

permission or agreement of the plaintiff and have not obtained any license

to manufacture, distribute or sell the same. On the contrary, plaintiff has

formally demanded that they desist from selling such infringing shirts, but

the defendants have ignored such demands and refuse to cease such acts. </P>



<P>17. The defendants, and each of them, have been transacting and continue to

transact business in this state and elsewhere in interstate commerce, and

have been and continue to infringe plaintiff's right of publicity in this

state and elsewhere in interstate commerce, and regularly have been and now

do business and solicit business and derive substantial revenue from goods

sold, used and consumed in this state and elsewhere in interstate commerce,

including the accused merchandise as aforesaid. The defendants, and each of

them, expected or should have reasonably expected their acts, including the

aforementioned acts and those set forth hereinbelow, to have consequence in

this state. </P>



<P>18. The defendants, and each of them, have and at all times relevant to the

acts set forth hereinabove had actual and constructive knowledge of the

rights of plaintiff but have proceeded in complete disregard thereof. </P>



<P>19. Unless the defendants are restrained and enjoined from selling their

unauthorized merchandise, their conduct will deprive plaintiff of a

substantial portion of the income he expects to receive from the sale of

licensed personality merchandise. </P>



<P>20. The defendants' prominent identification of the shirt as the "Dennis

Rodman Tattoo T-shirt" as well as their appropriation and use of these

tattoos as aforesaid are each false descriptions and representations that

said goods are made, sponsored or approved by, or are otherwise affiliated

with the plaintiff. Said acts are in violation of 15 U.S.C. 1125(a) in that

defendants are using in connection with goods false designations of origin

and false or misleading descriptions of fact, which are likely to cause

confusion or to deceive as to affiliation, connection or association, or as

to sponsorship or approval, and have caused such goods to enter into or

affect interstate commerce. Plaintiff believes that he is and is likely to

be, damaged by such false descriptions and representations by reason of the

likelihood that purchasers will be confused as to the true source,

sponsorship or affiliation of said goods. </P>





<H3>AS AND FOR A SECOND COUNT FOR VIOLATION OF 15 U.S.C. 1125(a) </H3>



<P>21. Plaintiff hereby realleges, as if fully set forth, the allegations of

Paragraphs 1 through 20 herein. </P>



<P>22. As a result of the widespread identification of the shirt by the

defendants, their agents and representatives (including sales reps) as

being the "Dennis Rodman Tattoo T-shirt," the defendants' customers, mostly

retail stores, have themselves prominently identified and described the

shirt in like manner, thus exploiting the shirt's association and identity

with the plaintiff in all their promotional and sales activities. </P>



<P>23. It was reasonable -- in fact, it was virtually certain -- that these

(retail store) customers would themselves so identify the shirt as the

"Dennis Rodman Tattoo T-shirt." </P>



<P>24. At the time that they advertised, offered for sale and sold their

infringing shirt, the defendants and each of them must have expected and,

plaintiff avers, certainly did expect that their said customers would so

identify and describe the shirt. </P>



<P>25. The said identification of the shirt as aforesaid by the defendants'

customers, the retail stores, is a false description and representation

that said goods are made, sponsored or approved by, or are otherwise

affiliated with, the plaintiff. Said acts are in violation of 15 U.S.C.

1125(a) in that such retail stores are using in connection with goods false

designations of origin and false or misleading descriptions of fact, which

are likely to cause confusion or to deceive as to affiliation, connection

or association, or as to sponsorship or approval, and have caused such

goods to enter into or affect interstate commerce. The defendants are

liable for such false designations as contributory infringers. Plaintiff

believes that he is and is likely to be, damaged by such false descriptions

and representations by reason of the likelihood that purchasers will be

confused as to the true source, sponsorship or affiliation of said goods. </P>





<H3>AS AND FOR A THIRD COUNT FOR MISAPPROPRIATION OF PLAINTIFFS' RIGHTS OF

PUBLICITY </H3>



<P>26. Plaintiff hereby realleges, as if fully set forth, the allegations of

Paragraphs 1 through 25 herein. </P>



<P>27. Due to the investment of substantial money, time and energy in

advertising, publicizing and promoting the accomplishments and excellence

of plaintiff, plaintiff has developed and now possesses a separate right of

publicity. </P>



<P>28. The said identification of the plaintiff in association with the

promotion, advertising and sale of the defendants' infringing shirt use of

such tattoos on the defendants' infringing shirts constitutes a willful

infringement of the plaintiff's separate right of publicity. </P>



<H3>

AS AND FOR A FOURTH COUNT FOR INTERFERENCE WITH CONTRACTUAL RELATIONS </H3>



<P>29. Plaintiffs hereby reallege, as if fully set forth, the allegations of

Paragraphs 1 through 28 herein. </P>



<P>30. The unauthorized and unlawful activities of the defendants as described

hereinabove will wrongfully impair the value of the contracts referred to

in Paragraph 2 herein. </P>





<H3>AS AND FOR A FIFTH COUNT FOR UNFAIR COMPETITION </H3>



<P>31. Plaintiffs hereby reallege, as if fully set forth, the allegations of

Paragraphs 1 through 31 herein. </P>



<P>32. The aforesaid acts of the defendants have been and will be committed

willfully and with full knowledge of the rights of plaintiff and with the

intention of deceiving and misleading the public and of wrongfully

misappropriating and trading upon the nationally recognized value of the

good will and reputation of the plaintiff and of benefiting from and

depriving plaintiff of the benefits arising from his said reputation and

goodwill inhering therein. </P>



<P>33. The defendants' said misappropriation and unfair competition will

interfere with the plaintiff's rights and ability to exploit the commercial

value of his name and likeness. </P>



<P>34. Defendants will receive substantial profits from their unauthorized use

and misappropriation of plaintiff's great reputation, and defendants will

become unjustly enriched thereby. The defendants' aforementioned willful

and unauthorized misappropriation of plaintiff's reputation will cause

substantial and irreparable damage, injury and loss to the plaintiff and

constitute unfair competition. </P>





<H3>DAMAGE TO PLAINTIFF</H3>



<P>35. By reason of the defendants' acts alleged herein, plaintiff has

suffered and will continue to suffer damage to his reputation and goodwill,

and has lost sales and profits he would have made but for the defendants'

acts. </P>



<P>36. Unless the defendants' acts of misappropriation and unfair competition

are immediately restrained and enjoined, the plaintiff will suffer

irreparable injury in that defendants' actions will: </P>



<P>(a) lessen and dilute the value of the

plaintiff's merchandising rights;</P>



<P>(b) interfere with his ability to exploit, market, and license such rights;</P>





<P>(c) create confusion in the marketplace as to the duly authorized source of

Dennis Rodman merchandise; and </P>



<P>(d) deprive plaintiff of his just revenues based upon his legal

exploitation of his name and likeness. </P>



<P>37. It will be impossible to ascertain the amount of compensation which

could afford plaintiff adequate relief for such threatened continuing acts,

and a multiplicity of judicial proceedings would be required. Moreover, the

remedies at law are not adequate in any event to compensate plaintiff for

injuries suffered and threatened. </P>





<H3>PRAYER FOR RELIEF

</H3>

<P>WHEREFORE, plaintiff prays:</P>



<P>1. That defendants, their agents, servants, employees, officers, attorneys,

successors and assigns and all persons acting under the defendants or on

their behalf, be enjoined pendente lite and permanently from: </P>



<P>(a) manufacturing, distributing, selling, offering for sale, holding for

sale or advertising any T-shirt or other product bearing the name or

likeness of the plaintiff, or bearing any of plaintiff's body tattoos, or

any colorable variation thereof; </P>



<P>(b) representing that any article of merchandise manufactured, distributed,

sold, held for sale or advertised by them is sponsored or authorized by the

plaintiff; </P>



<P>(c) applying the plaintiff's name or likeness, of any of his body tattoos,

or any reproduction, counterfeit, copy or colorable imitation thereof, to

labels,-signs, prints, packages, wrappers, receptacles or advertisements

intended to be used or capable of being used, or used in connection with

the sale, offering for sale, distribution or advertising of goods or

services or in connection with which such use is likely to cause confusion

or to cause mistake or to deceive; </P>



<P>(d) using plaintiff's name, likeness or identity in association with the

sale, offering for sale, distribution or advertising of goods or services

in any manner; </P>



<P>(e) making, having made for them, selling, distributing or disposing of in

any manner any advertisements or promotional material including ad mats,

point of sale devises, catalogs, letters, posters or brochures using the

plaintiff's name or likenesses, or using any of plaintiff's body tattoos; </P>



<P>(f) filling any order for merchandise associated with plaintiff; </P>



<P>(g) engaging in any unfair trade practices or unfair competition against

the plaintiff; </P>



<P>(h) aiding, abetting, encouraging or inducing another to do any of the acts

herein enjoined. </P>



<P>2. That defendants, and each of them, be required to account and pay over

to the plaintiff all gains, profits and advantages derived by each of them

from their adjudged unfair competition with the plaintiff; from their

violation of Section 43 (a) of the Lanham Act; and from their infringement

of the plaintiff's right of publicity; as well as the damages which the

plaintiff has sustained by reason of the defendants' said acts. </P>



<P>3. That because of the willful nature of their violation of Section 43 (a)

of the Lanham Act, the Court enter judgment for the plaintiff for three

times the amount of said damages. </P>



<P>4. That the Court award punitive and exemplary damages against the

defendants and in favor of the plaintiff in such sum as it determined at

trial by reason of the said defendants' fraud in using the plaintiff's

identity and body tattoos. </P>



<P>7. That the defendants and each of them be required to pay to the plaintiff

the costs of this action, and reasonable attorneys' fees to be allowed by

the Court. </P>



<P>8. That the defendants be required to deliver up to the plaintiff all

merchandise and material in their possession or under their control which

is subject to the injunctive order of this Court, including all negatives,

positives, plates, molds, matrices, film positives and negatives, screens,

and any other materials for making the same, for the purpose of destruction

or other disposition. </P>



<P>9. That the defendants be required to withdraw from their customers,

retailers and all others all of the material specified in Paragraphs 1(a)

through 1(d) hereof, including offering reimbursement for same, and

delivering up the same to the plaintiff for destruction or disposition. </P>



<P>10. That plaintiff have such other and further relief as the Court deems

just and proper. </P>

<H4>Whitewater Trial - Pres. Clinton Video Deposition Transcript </H4><BR>

<BR>

The transcript from President Clinton's videotaped testimony at the fraud and conspiracy

trial of James and Susan McDougal and Gov. Jim Guy Tucker in Little Rock, Ark.: <BR>

<BR>

James McDougal attorney Sam Heuer: Please state your name. <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> Bill Clinton.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> What is your occupation at this time? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> President of the United States.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> President Clinton, please tell the jury about your career leading up to the point in

time that you became President of the United States. <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> Well, I graduated from law school in 1973 and I went home to Arkansas, and I found a

position teaching at the university. And I was there from 1973 until I assumed office as

Attorney General in 1977, January. <BR>

<BR>

During that time, I ran for Congress and lost, I married my wife, and then made a

successful race for attorney general. In 1978, I was elected governor; in 1980, our

daughter was born and I was defeated for governor. And I practiced law for a time, and

then in 1982, I was re-elected governor. I served as governor from 1982 until I was

elected president in 1992. <BR>

<BR>

Shortly after I was elected president, I resigned the office and the lieutenant governor,

now Governor Tucker, became governor. And you know the rest. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Mr. President, do you know defendant James McDougal? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> I do.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Please tell the jury when and how you got to know Mr. McDougall <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> We met, oh, about 30 years ago when he was running Senator Fulbright's office in Little

Rock and I was a student at Georgetown working for Senator Fulbright part-time on the

staff of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee here in Washington. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Was there ever a time when Mr. McDougal worked for you while you served as governor of

the state of Arkansas? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> Yes, there was. In my first term, he was my economic development liaison. He had a lot

of important responsibilities. worked with the Arkansas Industrial Development Commission,

he worked with other agencies that dealt with economic matters. He was kind of a

troubleshooter on projects designed to advance our economy and get more jobs for our

people. And he worked for - not the entire first term, not the whole two years, but for

most of the two-year period between '79 and '80 he was working in the Governor's office.

<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Have you ever been engaged in a business relationship with Mr. McDougal? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> Yes. We had two.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Would you please tell the jury about those? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> In 1977, Mr. McDougal, who was - at that time had been, I think, for some time, engaged

in various real estate development projects, asked me if I wanted to invest a small amount

of money in one in Pulaski County. And I did, I invested, as I recall, about $2,800 for

about a year and a half, and I liquidated the investment and made about $5,000. So I had a

profit of $2,100, it was a nice profit. <BR>

<BR>

Then after that, Mr. McDougal invited Hillary and I to invest with Jim and Susan in 230

acres of land in Marion County which was unimproved land near the White River, and is now

called Whitewater land. And we did that. And we invested in that in 1978, and I was in

that investment until 1992. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Were you aware of Mr. McDougal's purchase and ownership of a savings and loan in Little

Rock, Arkansas in the 1980s? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> Yes. I became aware at some point that he bought a savings and loan, I think it was

maybe in Woodruff County, and then got permission to move it down to Little Rock in the

early 1980s. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Mr. President, did you ever have any loan relationship with Mr. McDougal's savings and

loan known as Madison Guaranty concerning your investments? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> No, sir, I did not, I never borrowed any money from Madison Guaranty. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Did you ever cause anybody to borrow any money for your benefit, Mr. President? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> No, I did not.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Did you ever have any personal loan with Madison Guaranty at any time, Mr. President?

<BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> No, sir, I didn't.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Did you ever campaign with or for Jim McDougal? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> I did once. Mr. McDougal had, as I said, worked for Senator Fulbright, that's what he

was doing when I met him 30 years ago, and had supported others who ran, but in 1982, he,

himself, ran for Congress in the third congressional district, the same district where I

had run eight years earlier in 1974. And it was also in that year that, as I said

previously, I ran for governor. Having been defeated in 1980, I was trying to get back in

office. He won the Democratic primary, and after a very difficult battle, so did I. <BR>

<BR>

And so, in the general election, from time to time we would be together when the

Democratic Party would sponsor rallies in that part of the state, I would be there, he

would be there, we would be campaigning together, we would be endorsing each other, and it

was an interesting campaign. But I remember that, I think - I think that's the only time.

<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Are you familiar with a former judge of Arkansas who now lives in Conway called Jim

Johnson? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> Yes, I am.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> During the time that you served as governor of Arkansas, Mr. President, was Mr. Johnson

a supporter of yours? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> Oh, no.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Mr. President, please characterize your relationship with Justice Jim Johnson while you

were in politics in the state of Arkansas, sir. <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> I think a fair characterization would be that it was one of opposition, both his

opposition to me and my opposition to him. The first campaign I worked in, I supported a

candidate for governor who was running against Justice Johnson, that was 1966. In 1968,

Justice Johnson ran against Senator Fulbright, and I, along with Mr. McDougal, worked

against him then, in that we had severe differences of opinion, and I vividly remember his

characterization of Senator Fulbright was soft on communism, for example, it was that sort

of emotional aspect to the campaign. <BR>

<BR>

Then at some point in the 1980s, after I became governor, Justice Jim Johnson became a

Republican, and therefore, more explicitly opposed to me. Now, if you would see him on the

street, he would be just as friendly as could be, you know, and you would have a cordial

conversation, but I was never under any illusions that - he and I were basically polar

opposites in terms of what we thought was good for our state, good for our people, and

good for our future. <BR>

<BR>

And then when I ran for president, he was exceedingly active with some of the extremist

groups that were stirring up negative stories about me, my record as governor, and indeed

trying to create an impression of our state that was unfavorable. So, there is almost an

unbroken strand of opposition between me and Jim Johnson that starts in 1966 and ends in

1992. <BR>

<BR>

And I don't suppose it has ended, but at least that was the last dramatic chapter in his

vigorous involvement in the machine, that sort of publicity machine against my candidacy

for president in 1992. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Has he continued to criticize you since you have obtained the office of president of

the United States? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> I think he has, but to be honest, I haven't paid a lot of attention to it. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Okay. If you would, please, describe your relationship with Jim McDougal in the 1980s.

<BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> Well, in the early '80s, I didn't see Jim much in the first couple of years, because he

didn't live in Little Rock. But sometime after his race for Congress, which was 1982,

sometime after that, maybe 1983, he moved to Little Rock, he had purchased the savings and

loan, he had moved the S&L to Little Rock, he set it up in downtown Little Rock, less than

a mile from the Governor's mansion. So, after he moved there and began to get active in

trying to rebuild that neighborhood and establish relationships in the community, I would

see him more frequently. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Are you familiar with a former municipal judge by the name of David Hale? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> Yes, I 

am.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Please tell the jury when you became acquainted with him. <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> I think I met David Hale sometime in the mid-1970s, and I believe it had something to

do with the Jaycees. He had - at some time in that period, he was the national president

for the Jaycees, he was from Arkansas. I was a member of the chapter at Fayetteville, and

as a candidate for office, I would, from time to time, go to the conventions of the

Jaycees. So, I believe I met him at one of those, somehow in connection with his Jaycee

activities. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Did you ever have a business relationship with Mr. Hale, either personally or through

his company, known as Capital Management Services? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> No.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Did you ever receive any loan from Mr. Hale personally or from his business known as

Capital Management Services? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> No, I 

didn't.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> You said earlier that you ran for political office in Arkansas in 1976, I believe; is

that correct? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> Yes, 1976, I was a candidate for attorney general. I won the Democratic primary, and

the only time in my life I had no Republican opposition, so I was elected. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Did you ever ask Mr. Hale at that time to serve as your campaign manager? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> No, I didn't do that. Now, let me say, Mr. Heuer, to make a full disclosure, if, in

fact, I saw David Hale in 1976, I knew that he was an active Jaycee, I'm certain that I

asked him for his support if I saw him. I asked every person I saw in the first half of

1976 to support me and do whatever they could for me. So, I'm certain - I'm sure if I did

see him, I asked him to help me, but I didn't ask him to be my campaign manager. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Was your opponent George Jernigan at that time? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> Yes, George Jernigan was one of my opponents. George Jernigan and Clarence Cash were my

opponents. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Okay. In late '85 or 1986, were you aware of any plans that Mr. Hale had to increase a

capital base in his business known as Capital Management Services? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> No, I wasn't.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Are you familiar with an office that Jim McDougal established sometime in 1986 in the

south part of Pulaski County on property that was commonly referred to as Castle Grande

Estates? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> I know Mr. McDougal in 1986 had an office on 145th Street <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> That's the same.<BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> - at south Pulaski County. I don't know if that's the same place, but I know he had an

office out there. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Did you ever visit him on 145th Street? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> Yes, I did, one time.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> And tell me, you were known in Little Rock to enjoy jogging; is that correct? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> I did, I did then, I do now.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Tell the jury if you've ever jogged from the mansion to Mr. McDougal's office on 145th

Street at any time. <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> No, sir, I didn't do that. In fact, I couldn't have done that. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Okay. When you visited Mr. McDougal at his office on this singular occasion, were you

wearing jogglng shoes? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> No. I was dressed up, I had a shirt and tie on, coat and tie. I remember the day quite

well, because I was going to a Siemens-Allison plant, it is a big German plant, they make

electrical motors in Arkansas, and they had announced an expansion of the plant. They were

going to hire about 200 more people, as I recall, and they were good jobs, and we needed

them, and I had worked hard on that, and I was looking forward to the day. And I had never

been out that way before. I thought I had been on every road in the state, but to the best

of my knowledge, I had never been out that way before. <BR>

<BR>

And Mr. McDougal's office was in a trailer, as I recall, on the way out there. And I

stopped there for a few minutes, either going to this event or coming from this event, but

I don't remember, to be honest, whether I was going to or coming from, I just know I

stopped there. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Do you remember what date that was?<BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> I have refreshed my memory by resorting to my own records, and I know now it was in

June of 1986. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Okay. What was the weather like, if you recall? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> Well, as I recall, it was warm. It normally is in Arkansas in June, and I remember it

was a sunny day, because we - I remember that from the Siemens-Allison event. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Was anyone with you at that time?<BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> I believe Bob Nash was with me, because he was my principal economic development aide,

and then the trooper who was assigned to duty that day was driving us. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Did you have any contact in any shape, form, or fashion with David Hale at that visit

to <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> No, I didn't. He wasn't there.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> All right. Were you ever present in Mr. McDougal's office on 145th Street when a

discussion occurred about financial assistance from David Hale or his Capital Management

Services Company involving any other business that you or Mr. McDougal may have had? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> No, sir, never.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Were you ever present at any time for any meeting between Jim McDougal and David Hale?

<BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> Never, I never was present at any<BR>

meeting.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Were you ever present when there was any discussion of getting any kind of loan from

David Hale or his SBIC? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> No.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Did you ever make a statement that your name could not appear on any loan documents or

financial documents related to any type of loan from David Hale or his SBIC? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> Absolutely not.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Did you ever get assurance from Jim McDougal that your name would be secreted from any

loan documents pertaining to any loan from David Hale or his SBIC? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> No, we never had any conversation about it at all. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Did you ever tell David Hale that you had property in Marion County, Arkansas, that you

could use as collateral or security for a loan from him? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> I did not do that, 

no.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Did you ever ask David Hale to make you a loan? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> No.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Did you ever ask David Hale to make Jim McDougal a loan? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> No.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Did you ever ask David Hale to make Susan McDougal a loan? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> No, I didn't.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Did you ever ask David Hale to make Jim Guy Tucker a loan? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> No.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Did you ever, in any shape, form or fashion, put any pressure on David Hale for the

purpose of obtaining a loan or for the purpose of causing him to make loans through his

SBIC? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> I did not put any pressure on David Hale. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Do you have any idea what he is talking about in regard to these loans that he has come

up with? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> No, sir. I tried to keep - he has told two or three different versions of this, and

I've tried to keep up with these different stories, but all I know is that any suggestion

that I tried to get any money from him or I tried to keep that a secret or I put any

pressure on him, these things are simply not true, they didn't happen. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> In late 1985 or early 1986, were you aware or made known of any purported agreement

whereby Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan would advance money to Mr. Hale or his company

in some shape, form, or fashion as agreed to between Mr. Hale and Jim McDougal whereby Mr.

Hale would then make loans to various people? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> That was a long question, Mr. Heuer.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> I understand.<BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> It has got a short answer. No, I didn't know anything about Mr. Hale's financial

business. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> And the same question for Susan McDougal? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> No, I did not.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Or Jim Guy Tucker?<BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> No, I did not.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Did you ever have any conversation with Jim McDougal wherein you were led to believe

that you and Mr. McDougal could obtain financing or money from David Hale at any time?

<BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> No, Jim McDougal never talked to me about anything like that. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Did you ever have any meetings with Jim McDougal at the governor's mansion in January

of 1986? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> We did have a meeting in January of 1986. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> And what was the topic of that meeting? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> Well, it was more than 10 years ago, and I have had a lot of meetings. But my memory is

that Jim wanted to talk to me about his concern that the state Health Department was not

treating him fairly at one of his developments; not the Whitewater Development, he had

another land operation. And as I recall, the area being developed was not connected to a

municipal sewer system, so that in order to sell these lots and put houses on them, they

had to have septic tanks there, and they had to get a permit. <BR>

<BR>

And I have a clear memory that he believed that the people the Health Department had

assigned to look into this were not giving him fair treatment, and in fact, one of them

was actively trying to undermine his attempt to sell this property to others. And he was

upset about it, and he actually gave me a memorandum about it, you know, just outlining

one or two items, and he asked me to look into it. And I did, I subsequently arranged for

him to have a meeting about it. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> In that meeting, Mr. President, did there ever come a point where a discussion was had

with you and Mr. McDougal about any plans involving David Hale providing financing in any

shape, form, or fashion? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> No, sir, it didn't - we didn't discuss that. <BR>

<BR>

MR. HEWER: Your Honor, I would pass the witness at this time. <BR>

<BR>

THE COURT: Mr. Collins or Mr. Brown?<BR>

<BR>

MR. COLLINS: Mr. Brown, Your Honor.<BR>

<BR>

MR. BROWN: Thank you, Your Honor. If the Court pleases, ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

and Mr. President. <BR>

<BR>

THE WITNESS: Mr. Brown.<BR>

<BR>

EXAMINATION ON BEHALF OF GOV. JIM GUY TUCKER BY MR. BROWN: <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> I will try to be as brief as I can and as precise as I can in asking you these

questions. If I am unclear, please ask me to repeat the question. <BR>

<BR>

Mr. President, do you know Jim Guy Tucker? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> I do.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> And when did you first meet Jim Guy Tucker, Governor Tucker? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> I believe I met the governor almost 30 years ago here in Washington. I believe the

first time I ever met him was in Senator Fulbright's office in the late '60s, and if my

memory is correct, I believe that he had finished Harvard and was on his way to Vietnam as

a war correspondent, or had just come back from Vietnam. And of course, after that, he

went home to Arkansas, and then after I finished law school, I did, so I have known him

ever since then. But I believe that's the first time I met him. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> All right. Can you describe your relationship with Governor Tucker over the years? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> Well, it has changed a little from time to time. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> All right. I'll get you to tell us about that? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> When I - first of all, I was very impressed with him when I first met him, and I liked

him. But then he went home to Arkansas and I went - I went away, I lived in England for a

couple of years and I went to law school. But while I was in law school, he was elected to

prosecutor for Pulaski County. And then when I came home and made my race for Congress in

1974, that was the same year Mr. Tucker ran for attorney general. <BR>

<BR>

After he was elected attorney general and I was defeated for Congress and went back to

teaching in the Arkansas Law School, he asked me to prepare for him an anti-trust brief on

an issue involving the banking and interest rates in Arkansas that he wanted to file on

behalf of our state before the U.S. Supreme Court. I prepared that brief, and in the

course of doing it, had a lot more contact with him, and we became better friends. <BR>

<BR>

In 1975, late '75, when Hillary and I were married, we had a private wedding ceremony, but

we had a larger party that night, and I invited Jim Guy to the party and I remember he

flew up there to the party. Then in 1976, there was an opening for Congress in Little

Rock, he ran for that job and got elected, and I ran for his job, I became attorney

general. And again, we had a good relationship. <BR>

<BR>

And in 1978, when he ran for the United States Senate after the death of Senator

McClellan, along with Senator Pryor and Congressman Thornton, I ran for the governorship,

and I was elected governor. He lost the Senate race, and he basically devoted himself

after that, nearly as I could tell, to his own business interests and his law practice.

So, I didn't see him so much then, but we were still friendly. <BR>

<BR>

Then in 1982, after I was defeated for governor in 1980, I ran for re-election in '82 in a

very crowded Democratic primary field which included Governor Tucker. So, we ran against

each other for the first and, thank goodness, the only time in our careers. It was a very

difficult, very heated race, and it left some hard feelings. I was lucky enough to win it.

But we were sort of estranged after that. <BR>

<BR>

Although I always respected the way he handled it, he continued to support the Democratic

Party, he continued to stand up for the things that I believed in, and from time to time,

he even made contributions to my campaign. But we weren't really close. It got a little

better as time went on, you know, time often heals some of those wounds, it got a little

better. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> I understand.<BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> Then in 1990, there was another brief period of tension, because Governor Tucker was

considering running for governor and I was considering running for re-election. As it

turned out, I ran for re-election, he ran for lieutenant governor, and we began to serve

together. In my view, he had a hard job, because when I started running for president,

under the Arkansas constitution, he is the governor, the lieutenant governor is the

governor with all the powers of the office. So, I have had a cordial relationship with him

since then. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Now, Mr. President, understanding your relationship historically with Governor Tucker,

particularly as it related to the political aspects of it, have you ever had any business

relationships with Governor Tucker? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> No, Mr. Brown, I never have.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Now, let me focus, if you will, in the year 1985 and 1986. Were you ever aware that

David Hale, in fact, had a company called Capital Management Systems? Were you ever made

aware of that, Capital Management System - <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> I don't know.<BR>

<BR>

MR. HEWER: Services.<BR>

<BR>

BY MR. BROWN:<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Services, excuse me, I'm sorry, Services. <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> I don't know. My guess is that I did not know that he had a company by that exact name.

<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> All right.<BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> I knew that David - I want to make a full disclosure here. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Okay.<BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> I believe I knew that David Hale had a business of some kind, or was in business, as

well as being a municipal judge, but I don't believe I knew that was the name of his

company or what that company was, exactly. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Well, apparently I had some problems repeating the name of that company, too. But it is

Capital Management Services. Let me ask you this question: Did you ever request David Hale

or any of his companies to make a loan to or for the benefit of Governor Tucker, to the

best of your knowledge? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> I did not.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Are you aware of whether or not there was ever any agreement of any kind involving

Governor Tucker, David Hale and Jim McDougal which concerned the making of loans for the

mutual benefit of these persons or other persons? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> If there ever was such an agreement, I had no awareness of it. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Are you aware of whether or not there was ever any agreement of any kind involving

Governor Tucker and David Hale through any of his companies which had the intent of

increasing the capital of David Hale's small business investment company or any company

that he might have been associated with? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> If there was an agreement like that, I didn't know anything about it. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Did Governor Tucker ever ask you to do anything at any time to help him obtain loans

from David Hale or any of his companies? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> No, sir, he did not ever ask for that kind of help. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Did he ever ask you to do anything at any time to help obtain loans for any of Governor

Tucker's companies? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> No.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> All right. And I guess this question has been asked, but since we represent different

individuals, I need to ask you this question as it relates to Governor Tucker. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Did you ever pressure David Hale to do anything at any time to benefit - or for the

benefit of Governor Jim Guy Tucker? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> I did not.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> In late 1985 and early 1986, were you aware of whether or not there was ever any

agreement involving Governor Tucker and David Hale and Jim McDougal involving Madison

Guaranty loans in exchange for loans from David Hale's company, CMS, that we have referred

to? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> I was aware of no such agreement. I did not - <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Did you ever have -- excuse me.<BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> I want to make sure I made myself clear. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> All right.<BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> I was not aware of that agreement if, in fact, it existed. If there was an agreement, I

knew nothing about it. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Thank you, Mr. President. Mr. President, did you ever have any conversation with

Governor Tucker, in which he informed you that he would be arranging a loan through

Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan which would enable David Hale to make loans to various

other people? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> No, sir, I never did.<BR>

<BR>

MR. BROWN: Mr. President, I have no further questions. <BR>

<BR>

THE WITNESS: Thank you.<BR>

<BR>

THE COURT: Mr. McDaniel?<BR>

<BR>

MR. McDANIEL: Yes, Your Honor.<BR>

<BR>

THE COURT: Do you need a break?<BR>

<BR>

MR. McDANIEL: I'm not going to be very long, Your Honor. At your will, we can either

proceed or at the conclusion of my questioning, I will defer. <BR>

<BR>

THE COURT: All right. Why don't you proceed? <BR>

<BR>

MR. McDANIEL: Thank you, Your Honor.<BR>

<BR>

EXAMINATION ON BEHALF OF SUSAN McDOUGAL BY MR. McDANIEL: <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Good afternoon, Mr. President.<BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> Good afternoon, Mr. McDaniel.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> We have been introduced, and I'm Bobby McDaniel, and along with Jennifer Horan, the

federal public defender, represent Susan McDougall And in that regard, I would like to ask

you, do you know Susan? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> I do.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Can you tell us, sir, when and how did you meet Susan? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> I met Susan through her relationship with Jim, I met them before they married, and if

my memory serves me right, I think he taught a course at Ouachita University in

Arkadelphia, and I believe she was a student there, I think that's how they met. But

anyway, we met, therefore, it would have been somewhere either in the late '60s or the

early '70s, some time in that area. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> All right, sir. To get right to the point, Mr. President - 

<BR><BR>

<B>A:</B> And let me - <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> All right, sir.<BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> Also, they invited me to their wedding, I remember that, it was outside out in west

Little Rock some place, or west of Little Rock some place, and I remember being there.

<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> All right, sir. And as I say, to get right to the point, Mr. President, did vou ever

request David Hale to make a loan to Susan McDougal? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> No, sir, I did not.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Mr. President, did you ever in any way try to pressure David Hale directly or

indirectly, to make a loan to Susan McDougal? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> I did not pressure David Hale to do that. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> All right, sir. And I want to focus for a minute on a time frame late 1985, early 1986,

and again, we represent separate defendants, and it may be cumulative, but bear with me, I

will be brief. Were you aware of any alleged agreement whereby - involving Susan McDougal

and David Hale, involving loans that would be made with Madison Guaranty in exchange for

loans being made for David Hale's company? Did you have any knowledge of any such

agreement, if it existed? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> If it did exist, I didn't know anything about it. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Mr. President, likewise, in reference to that same time frame, early '85 - late '85,

early '86, were you aware of any alleged agreement involving Jim Guy Tucker, Jim McDougal,

David Hale, or Susan McDougal, involving Madison Guaranty loans in exchange for loans from

David Hale's company? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> No, sir.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Were you aware in 1986 that on April 3rd, 1986 David Hale's small business investment

company, Capital Management Services, made a $300,000 loan to Susan McDougal doing

business as Master Marketing? Were you aware of that in 1986? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> No, Mr. McDaniel, I was not.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Mr. President, did you ever discuss a $300,000 loan to Susan McDougal with David Hale

in any way? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> I did not.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Mr. President, did you urge David Hale to make any such loan? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> No.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Did you ever discuss a $300,000 loan to Susan McDougal from David Hale with Jim

McDougal? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> No.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Did you ever discuss a $300,000 loan to Susan McDougal from David Hale with Susan

McDougal? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> I did not.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Did you receive any of the proceeds from a $300,000 loan made to Susan McDougal by

David Hale's company? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> I did not receive any proceeds, sir.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> When, if you know, did you first become aware that Susan McDougal did receive a

$300,000 loan from David Hale's company, if you know? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> I believe it was when it broke in the press, when there were reports in the press,

whenever that was, when was it, '92, '93, whenever. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Okay.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> But I didn't know anything about it before then. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Mr. President, in 1986, were you aware that Jim and Susan McDougal were buying land in

south Pulaski County from International Paper Realty Company for a project, real estate

development project, later to be known as Lorance Heights? Were you aware of that in 1986?

<BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> No, sir. The only thing I knew about was what I testified, I stopped in on 145th Street

at Mr. McDougal's office, in a suit, it is too far to jog, and that's all I know. I don't

know where they got that property, I didn't know if they had any other property, I don't

know where they got that. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> All right, sir. And were you aware in 1986, for a few months' period of time during

that year, that Lorance Heights property was held in the name of Whitewater Development

Company? Were you aware of that in 1986? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> No, sir. In 1986, I did not know that. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Were you aware, also, in 1986 that later in that year the Lorance Heights land was

transferred out of Whitewater Development Company into another McDougal company? Were you

aware of that, its going on? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> No, sir. Since I didn't know it was ever in there in the first place, when it left, I

was not aware of that, either. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> All right, sir. And did you know in 1986 how the McDougals financed the purchase of the

land later known as Lorance Heights? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> No, sir, I did not.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Did you know in 1986 where the McDougals got the funds for the down payment for this

land from International Paper? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> No.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Were you aware that in the late 1980s there was litigation involving the McDougals and

International Paper Company whereby International Paper eventually took back this land?

<BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> No, sir.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> When did you -<BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> I don't remember knowing about that, either, in the 1980s. I don't believe I knew

anything about that. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> When did you first find out, if you know, that Whitewater Development Company briefly

held title to this land known as Lorance Heights? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> When that information appeared in the press, whenever that was. It was either in late -

in '92 or '93, sometime in that time frame, that information appeared in public, and

that's how I became aware of it. <BR>

<BR>

MR. McDANIEL: Your Honor, as has previously occurred, and to Mr. President a thank you. I

have no further questions. <BR>

<BR>

THE COURT: All right, Mr. Jahn, you might proceed with your cross examination. <BR>

<BR>

EXAMINATION ON BEHALF OF THE PLAINTIFF BY MR. JAHN: <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Mr. President, during the course of your direct examination, sir, you made a reference

to different versions of David Hale's accounts. Can you tell us, sir, what is your source

of information concerning different versions of David Hale's accounts? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> Well, just from press accounts and from reports that my counsel have given me. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Okay. Are you aware, sir, of what he testified to? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> I believe he testified -<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> I'm not asking you, sir, what he said. I'm saying, has anyone related to you a version

of what his testimony was under oath? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> I read the press accounts of it.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Okay. You read how - to what extent, sir, were they quotations, were they direct

quotations? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> Well, I read - I don't remember, but I read the press accounts, and of course, my

counsel has briefed me. They said that under oath he said that I was in jogging shorts in

the cold weather on 145th Street. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Okay.<BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> And some other things.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> So, you did receive, then, direct information concerning what it was that Mr. Hale had

apparently testified to under oath; is that correct? <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> You indicated, sir, that your counsel provided you information concerning how Mr. Hale

had testified. I believe you indicated there was something along the line of wearing

jogging shorts while you were at the 145th Street. What other information did you receive,

not from the newspapers, but what other information did you receive concerning the subject

matter and the content of Mr. Hale's testimony? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> None, sir. I mean, my impression is that all of us were talking about what we read in

the paper. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Were you aware, sir, or are you aware, sir, that the law firm that was formerly - Mr.

Lindsey was formerly associated with was buying a transcript of the testimony provided in

the court, sir? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> No, sir, I was not aware of that.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Is Mr. Lindsey still associated with the White House, sir? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> He is.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> What is his current association with the White House? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> Mr. Lindsey is one of my aides, he travels with me, and he does political work for me.

<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Has he ever related to you, sir, accounts as to what Mr. Hale allegedly said under oath

during the course of this trial? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> I don't believe so.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> I believe the question, sir, was whether or not anyone other than your attorney had

related subject matter concerning what Mr. Hale had allegedly testified during the course

of his testimony? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> No, sir. I believe that all of us, including my attorneys, I believe we were all

discussing what we read in the paper about Mr. Hale's testimony. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> You, sir, in your position, receive extensive briefing and briefing books concerning

virtually every item that occurs to you on your daily schedule; is that correct, sir? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> Well, I get a national security briefing in the morning and I get a scheduling book for

the rest of the day, yes, sir. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Have you received a briefing book concerning your testimony, sir? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> I have received a briefing book which contains what I have said before in my

interrogatories, and our notes on the three times I have been interviewed already by the

Special Counsel's Office. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Did that briefing book contain any accounts concerning what Mr. Hale had allegedly said

under oath during the course of this trial, sir? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> No, sir, it didn't.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Okay. You were asked by Mr. Heuer, sir, concerning whether or not you had ever gone to

Mr. McDougal and sought financial aid from Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan concerning

your joint business ventures; do you remember that, sir? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> Yes, sir, I do.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> You and Ms. Clinton - well, perhaps maybe I'm misphrasing it. There was, in fact, an

occasion in which you did go to a financial institution controlled by Mr. McDougal

concerning financial assistance to the Whitewater Development, was there not, sir? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> That's correct.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> All right. Can you tell the jury, sir, what arose, what was the circumstances by which

- first of all, who was it that did it? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> My memory is that when Mr. McDougal had the bank up in Madison County, in the mountains

of north Arkansas, Madison County is a county that adjoins Marion County were the

Whitewater property was, that I had borrowed some money there, either Hillary or I one

borrowed some money there, but it was our - our family, Hillary and I borrowed the money

to build a house on one of the lots, one of the Whitewater lots that Jim thought would

make it easier for us to sell the lots, make it more attractive, make it more realistic.

And he had called me and said he had put some money into the developing of the lots and I

should build a house, and we agreed to that, and that's what we did. I think that's what

the loan was for. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Okay. And that was the Bank of Kingston; is that correct, sir? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> I believe that's right.<BR>

<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> All right. Later became called Madison Bank and Trust, I believe. Were you familiar

with the change in name at a later date? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> I am now, I don't know that I knew when it happened. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> And were you aware at the time, sir, that that was a financial institution owned

jointly by Mr. McDougal and Stephen Smith? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> I knew that Steve had an interest in the bank, yes. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Okay. I believe the question was something along the line of, kind of describe for the

jury's benefit your knowledge of Stephen Smith and your relationship with Stephen Smith.

<BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> I met Mr. Smith I believe in 1972 when he was a young Arkansas state legislator from

Madison County. And in 1974, when I ran for Congress, Mr. Smith supported that effort,

worked in my campaign. He later came to work for me and he worked in my first term as

governor, in the governor's office. He left shortly before the election of 1980, and

that's the last time he ever worked for me. I maintained a limited but occasional contact

with Steve in the years after that. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> And while he worked for you in the governor's office was the same time that Mr.

McDougal also worked with you in the governor's office? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> That's right, they worked there together. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> And was that also the same time that Mr. McDougal advanced to you or sought you out

concerning your investment in what later became Whitewater Development Corporation? Was

that also about the same time? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> Mr. Jahn, I think that was before that. I believe that Mr. McDougal and Susan and

Hillary and I invested in Whitewater in 1978, before I became governor. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Okay. But in 1978, was Mr. Smith working for you as attorney general, sir? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> He was working in the attorney general's office. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Okay.<BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> But Mr. McDougal wasn't.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Okay. Thank you. I'm sorry. Again, if I ask a question that's not a hundred percent

within the confines of your memory, please correct me on that particular regard. <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> All right, sir.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> So, there did come an occasion then where you were approached, or you and Mr. McDougal

discussed obtaining some financing for the benefit of Whitewater Development Corporation,

and Mr. McDougal made the arrangements, did he not, sir? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> Well, I assume that we made them together, since we took out the loan and we took it

out from that bank. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Do you recall you and your wife going to the Bank of Kingston and executing notes and

the like? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> No, I think we signed the note without going up there. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Okay. And so, at the time that you did it, you knew that it was Mr. McDougal's

institution? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> I did.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Okay. And you knew that he and Mr. Smith were basically in control of that institution?

<BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> I did.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Now, at the time that it was done, though, is it fair, and I don't want to put words in

your mouth that aren't fair, sir, is it fair to say that you actually considered that to

be a debt of Whitewater Development Corporation, even though you were personally, or

perhaps your wife was personally responsible, didn't you really consider that to be part

of the Whitewater Development Corporation Enterprise, itself? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> Mr. Jahn, I think the fair way to characterize it was, I considered that loan in the

same light that I considered the other loans that we had taken out to finance Whitewater.

That is, I had hoped that the company would generate enough income from the sales of lots

to repay those loans, but I was well aware that if it did not generate that income that I

would be personally liable on them. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Okay. And that hope, sir, was based upon representations that Mr. McDougal made to you;

is that correct, sir? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> Yes, sir. He had been in the land development business for some years, and he had

enjoyed quite a bit of success in that. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> And you and your wife had no experience in land development; is that correct? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> No. I had had that one very limited experience where I had made an investment with him

and it had returned a nice profit in a modest amount of time. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> But as far as putting in roads and developing tracts <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> No.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> - and developing marketing programs and the like, that was Mr. McDougal's expertise.

<BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> That's right. And that was the understanding, that we would put in half of the money

but that he would manage it. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Okay. And you deferred to Mr. McDougal's expertise in that particular area? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> Yes, sir, I did.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Did Ms. McDougal have any expertise in that particular area? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> Well, they worked together. I donit know exactly what she knew, but they did work

together, she was very active in the business, and of course, she helped to promote it and

market it. She did some of the marketing. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Okay. So, when there came occasions in which you had questions for Mr. McDougal, and

you couldn't contact Mr. McDougal, was Ms. McDougal his alter ego as far as the Whitewater

Development Corporation itself was concerned? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> I don't know if I would use that word, Mr. Jahn. There were times when I talked to him

over the years, times when I talked to her. The truth is, we didn't - once the property

became more or less self-financing, we didn't talk much for years about it. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Now, you say "once the property became self-financing.'' Did there come an occasion,

sir, in which you believed that the properties had, in fact, become what you called

self-financing? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> I believe it was in - I believe in 1981, Mr. McDougal informed me that he had sold

enough lots and payments were being paid on enough lots so that at least the bank notes

could be paid down. I believe that's right. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> How important was that to you and Ms. Clinton, sir? And at this particular time, with

all due respect, like most states, or perhaps like most southern states, public officials

aren't overpaid in the state of Arkansas, are they? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> We were paid less than the other southern states. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Okay.<BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> But - well, in 1981, I was a lawyer and making a pretty good living. But when I was

attorney general and governor, I didn't make much. But Hillary made more money than I did,

and she did quite well and we were quite comfortable, but we didn't want to be - we didn't

want to lose all the money we had borrowed, obviously, and I was pleased when the

investment began to pay out. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> And the representation then from Mr. McDougal that he had these hopes and expectations

and dreams that the properties would start to sell and then they would become

self-supporting, that was an important feature of the decision to invest in the first

place, wasn't it, sir? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> Yes, sir. But what happened to that property happened a lot of times - in a lot of

places, the market changed rather dramatically in 1979 and '80 in our state, and in other

places, as well. I didn't blame Mr. McDougal or anyone else. The market changed on us and

we bore the consequences. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> But by 1981, I believe it was your testimony, though, Mr. McDougal still represented to

you that despite the market change, there had been enough sales to make the property

basically self-sufficient; isn't that correct? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> That's correct.<BR>

<BR>

MR. HEWER: May it please the Court.<BR>

<BR>

BY MR. JAHN:<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Sir, do you recall whether or not there was a name affixed to that particular piece of

property that we were talking about as far as the loan from the Bank of Kingston? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> No, sir, I don't.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Okay. Does lot 13 ring a bell with you, sir? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> That - it sort of rings a bell, that could have been it, where the house was. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> And do you recall, sir, that there was subsequently a sale of that particular piece of

property to a man by the name of Hillman Logan, do you remember that, sir? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> I do remember that.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Okay. And in connection with that particular sale, the property had been placed in

either your wife's name or you and your wife's name, and it was necessary, then, for you

to execute certain documents and papers in connection with that sale; is that correct?

<BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> That could be. I don't remember the documents, but I will it could have been the case.

<BR>

<BR>

(WHEREUPON, Government's Exhibit Number 94 was marked for identification.) <BR>

<BR>

BY MR. JAHN:<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> All right. I want to show you, if you will, sir, what has been marked for <BR>

<BR>

MR. JAHN: And Ms. Nance, I think we need some copies for defense counsel. <BR>

<BR>

MS. NANCE: (Complies.)<BR>

<BR>

BY MR. JAHN:<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> What has been marked for identification first as Government's Exhibit 94. And I would

ask you, if you would, to take a look at this, sir. <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> (Witness reviews document.)<BR>

<BR>

(WHEREUPON, Government's Exhibits numbered 94-A and 94-B were marked for identification.)

<BR>

<BR>

MR. JAHN: Your Honor, if we could have a second, there apparently was some confusion when

copies were provided to counsel. <BR>

<BR>

BY MR. JAHN:<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Have you had a chance, sir, to review the document that has been identified as

Government's Exhibit 94? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> I have, sir.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Does it have a signature, sir, on there that purports to be your signature? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> It does.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Okay. Does it also have a signature on there that purports to be the signature of James

McDougal? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> It does.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Okay. Let me ask you, Mr. President, is the signature on Government's Exhibit Number 94

- <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> Wait, wait. It does not have a signature. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> I'm sorry. It's a blank - is that one blank, then? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> Well, I can't see. It looks like there is something down there, but I can't tell, it

may be Jim's. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Okay.<BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> And I can't see. It says ''Officer/Purchaser,'' but I can't read it. The only signature

that I see here - well, this could be James McDougal, the Bank of Kingston. It is very -

it could be. I can't tell for sure because of the copying. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Okay. Well, let's just go back, then, to your signature. You can't see your signature;

is that correct? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> It is partially blocked, but I can see some of it. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Okay. And then, also there is a signature that purports to be the signature of your

wife; is that correct? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> That is correct.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Sir, is that your signature?<BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> I don't believe it is.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> All right. And as far as your wife's handwriting, sir, does that appear to be your

wife's handwriting? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> I don't believe it is.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Okay. I'm going to show you next Government's Exhibit 94-B, as in boy, and I would ask

you, sir, if you could, to review this document. <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> (Witness reviews document.) All right. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Have you had a chance, sir, to review that document? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> (Witness reviews document.)<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> And we are going to go just to the signature, Mr. President. <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> All right.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> If that will help speed things up.<BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> All right.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Okay. Once again, on the last page, sir, is there a signature that purports to be your

signature on that particular document? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> Yes.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> And is there a signature, sir, that purports to be your wife's signature on that

document? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> Yes, yes.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> And is there a signature that purports to be Mr. McDougal's on that document? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> Yes, yes.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> And as far as the document itself is concerned, 94-B, sir, is the signature on that

document yours? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> I don't believe it is.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> All right. And as far as the handwriting that appears under the - for Ms. Clinton, sir,

does it appear to be Ms. Clinton's handwriting? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> I don't think so, no.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Okay. Now, as far as the document itself or the property itself is concerned, these two

documents are - can you tell us what the heading is, as far as the title of the document?

<BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> It says [--]"Escrow Contract."<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Okay. And can you give us a date? Is there an approximate date on the contract, itself?

<BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> December 9th, 1981.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Okay. And as far as the contracts to the property, itself, did it, in fact, cover the

property that was the subject of the loan at the Bank of Kingston, or can you tell from

the legal description, sir? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> Well, it says, "Tract 13 of the Whitewater Estates," and it is being sold for $27,500.

I believe that it was the subject. I'm not positive, but I believe it is. <BR>

<BR>

MR. JAHN: Your Honor, we would move the introduction of Government's Exhibits 94 and 94-B.

<BR>

<BR>

BY MR. JAHN:<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Mr. President, you have identified those particular documents, and I believe they are

now in evidence. If you would, sir, I'm going to show you next what has been marked for

identification only as Government's Exhibit 94-A, and would ask you, sir, if you can, can

you examine Government's Exhibit 94-A? <BR>

<BR>

MR. COLLINS: You mean "B," I think.<BR>

<BR>

THE WITNESS: Yes, I can. (Witness reviews document.) <BR>

<BR>

BY MR. JAHN:<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> If you would, sir, the signature that's on that particular - first of all, what type of

document is it as far as its heading is concerned? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> It says, "Warranty Deed."<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Okay. And can you give us an approximate date that appears at the bottom of the

document where it is executed? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> December 14th, 1981.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Okay. And as far as the signature that appears on that, sir, does that appear to be

your true signature? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> Yes, it does.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> All right. And as far as the handwriting that appears on that particular document, sir,

does that appear to be your wife's true handwriting? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> It does.<BR>

<BR>

MR. JAHN: Your Honor, we would move the introduction of Government's Exhibit 94-A. <BR>

<BR>

BY MR. JAHN:<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Mr. President, as far as the document itself is concerned, it did, in fact, accurately

reflect that you and your wife were transferring that particular piece of property to Mr.

Logan; is that correct? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> That's what the document says.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> All right.<BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> It's a Warranty Deed.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> And can you explain, though, how your signature appears on the escrow, the two versions

of the escrow contract that was presented to you as Government's Exhibits 94 and 94-B?

<BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> I believe that - no, I can't explain that, that's the first time I have seen it. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> All right. Have you looked - well, I believe you have been shown to it - you were shown

during the course of your interrogatories, I think you were questioned about it during

that time, during the course of your interrogatories, you also expressed at that time the

sentiment that it was not your signature. And so, I'm asking now, if you would - that was

just, what, 1994, 1995. Can you explain - do you have any recollection as to how your

signature could have appeared on this particular document? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> I have no recollections about it.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Okay.<BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> I just - I remember that we sold the house to Mr. Logan. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Okay. Who was it that you looked to as far as the management of the sale? Did you, in

fact, negotiate with Mr. Logan? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> No, I never met him.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Did your wife even negotiate with Mr. Logan? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> No.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Who did you and your wife look to, sir, as far as negotiations and the management of

the sale of properties located at Whitewater Development Corporation? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> Mr. McDougall<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> All right. So, as far as the particular document, then, that bears a signature that

purports to be your signature, do you have an opinion, sir, as to who might have signed

that particular document? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> I don't know that.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Okay. Have you ever - was it ever brought to your attention at that particular time

that anyone was going to seek your permission to affix your signature to a document, a

legal document? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> I just don't remember.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> All right. Well, did you ever give Mr. McDougal either expressed or implied permission

to affix your signature to any documents bearing - or relating to Whitewater Development

Corporation business? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> I don't remember having such a discussion, but Mr. McDougal was clearly managing the

property and doing what he thought that he could to move the property. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Okay.<BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> But I don't remember any specific discussion of that, sir. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> And you entrusted Mr. McDougal, or you trusted Mr. McDougal to do what was necessary

for the benefit of the joint venture between yourself and your wife; is that correct? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> I did trust him, yes, sir.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> All right. And were there occasions, for instance, where Mr. McDougal would send you

documents to sign, such as loan renewals and extensions, that you would sign and return to

him? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> Well, I signed some renewals and extensions over time, perhaps he sent them to me. I

don't remember specifically. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Well, did you ever initiate or undertake an active role in obtaining the financing for

Whitewater Development Corporation, itself? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> No, sir, I did not.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> All right. As far as the initial loans that Whitewater, can you explain to the jury

basically how Whitewater Development Corporation was initially financed? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> Yes, sir. When we bought the 230 acres of land, we - the price was $200,000, and we

paid $20,000 down, which we financed with a loan, I think from Union Bank of Little Rock,

but anyway, from another bank, and then we borrowed the $180,000 amount from the local

bank in Marion County, the bank in Flippin, it has had several different names over the

last 15 years, I think it has had three different names, but anyway, it is the only bank

in town. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q.</B> Okay<BR>

<BR>

<B>A.</B> We borrowed the money from that bank, the principal amount. And it was - and our hope,

I will say again, was that we could sell enough lots so that the income from the lots

would at least be sufficient to pay off the bank notes when they came due, and then

hopefully, some day, we would actually make a profit. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Okay.<BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> It was a vain hope, as it turned out. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> As far as the land itself, let's take it one step at a time, you talked about the

purchase of the land. Did you and Ms. Clinton ever even go and look at the land before it

was acquired, sir? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> No, sir. We saw some pictures of it, and I was very, very familiar with that county,

with the White River, that's where I had run for Congress, I had lived in northwest

Arkansas for three years before I moved to Little Rock, and so I was - when Jim described

it to me, and I saw a couple of pictures, I knew where it was and what it was. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Okay.<BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> And I made the judgment it was a good business risk. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Sure. So, you, again - he showed you photographs, he described it to you, he told you

what his hopes were for the property, he told you what his expectations were for the

property; is that correct, sir? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> That's correct.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Okay. And did he tell you what his dreams and visions were for the property, for the

area? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> Well, I was familiar with the work that he was doing, and with the fact that he had

done quite well in the 1970s, as land values had escalated and retirees had flooded into

our state, and it seemed like a good risk to me, because I was familiar with the

experience of the last several years. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Is the answer yes, sir? Did he tell you what his dreams or visions were for this

particular property? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> Well, he told me what he hoped - he told me what he hoped would happen to the business

ventures. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Okay.<BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> And I thought it was a good risk, and so I joined him. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> And you placed your trust, and your wife placed your trust in Mr. McDougal's abilities

and his integrity; is that correct? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> Yes. But we also had an independent judgment about what the market would probably do.

Turned out our judgment was wrong. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Now, you had a situation involving Mr. Logan's property. You indicated you got some

financing at Union National Bank. Do you know who the loan officer was at Union National

Bank that made that loan? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> I don't remember that, sir.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Did you ever know or meet a Harry Don Denton that worked at Union National Bank? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> I know who Don Denton was. I'm not sure I met him at that time or whether he was the

loan officer on the note. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Did you have anything to do with acquiring the initial financing from Union National

Bank? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> I'm not sure. I might have, because I had some friends who worked there and I knew the

people who owned the bank, but I'm not sure. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> As far as the major financing from the only bank in Flippin, and I'm with you, I can't

keep the names straight, so let's just refer to them, to the bank in Flippin, as far as

the major financing, did you have anything to do with that major financing? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> Well, I knew the people at the bank, and I was aware that they were willing to finance

it, but I believe Mr. McDougal made the contact. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Okay. So, again, you were deferring to Mr. McDougal's expertise and Mr. McDougal's

leadership <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> That's right.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> - in terms of establishing this particular transaction? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> That's correct.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Now, let's just jump ahead. You indicated in 1981 there was a representation made to

you by Mr. McDougal that the bank, in and of itself - I mean, the land, in and of itself,

was now generating enough income to become self-sufficient. Do you remember that, sir?

<BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> I believe, to be specific, Mr. Jahn, I believe that the representation was that enough

lots had been sold so that the cash flow on the lots would at least cover the bank notes

when they came up. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Okay.<BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> And I think that that's - by then, I had already invested some money, I didn't think I

would ever get it back because of the changes in the economy, and I was simply relieved to

know that the bank note would be able to be paid as it came up. And so, I remember being

very relieved about it. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Did there come a time, sir, where you were called upon, though, to execute another

note, a note that was what has been referred to as the interest refinancing note? Did

there come an occasion in which you were required or requested to execute another note to

pay for interest payments that had not been made on the initial purchase loan? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> Can you refresh my memory, do you have some specific evidence here? <BR>

<BR>

MR. JAHN: Do we have the document, itself? <BR>

<BR>

MS. NANCE: (Complies.)<BR>

<BR>

MR. JAHN: Counsel, do you want to look at it first? I'm just going to show it to him for

memory recollection. <BR>

<BR>

(WHEREUPON, Government's Exhibit Number 91 was marked for identification.) <BR>

<BR>

BY MR. JAHN:<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> If you would, Mr. President, I'm going to show you only for the purpose of refreshing

your recollection, Government's Exhibit 91. <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> (Witness reviews document.)<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Mr. President, have you had a chance, sir, to look at the document? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> Yes, I have.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Does it refresh your recollection, sir, concerning the date in which a loan was made to

refinance the interest on the bank in Flippin's note? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> No, it does not.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Let me ask you this final question, sir. Is that your signature at the bottom of the

document, sir? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> Mr. Jahn, as has been pointed out, it is a little smudged, and I can't be sure. It

might - it might or might not be, and it might well be my wife's signature there, I just

can't tell. I think I ought to point out for the benefit of the Court and the jury that

this - that this date is November 1st, 1982, that was just a couple of days before the

general election for governor, and that it would be the last thing on my mind to be

involved in this. I do not have any recollection of it. But I cannot say for sure that the

signatures at the bottom are not mine or Hillary's. I'm confident the others weren't, I'm

not so confident on these. It might be mine and it certainly might be hers, I'm just not

sure. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Okay. Mr. President, if we could, sir, let's move on to the time frame of 1985 and

1986. And at that particular time, I believe you testified that Mr. McDougal had, in fact,

moved back into town and had opened a savings and loan within Little Rock; is that

correct? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> That's correct, sir.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Okay. Do you recall at this time, sir, the financial obligations which you and Ms.

Clinton had toward the Whitewater Development Corporation's investments and its

obligations financial institution - obligations at other financial institutions? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> Well, the bank note in Flippin was still outstanding at some level, I don't know that I

knew what level, and we may or may not have paid off the loan for - that we took out to

pay for the house. I don't remember whether it had been paid off by then or not. It was

<BR>

<BR>

(WHEREUPON, Government's Exhibits Numbered 87 and 89 were marked for identification.) <BR>

<BR>

BY MR. JAHN:<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Okay. If you would, sir, I'm going to show you what has been first marked for

identification as Government's Exhibit 89, and then I'm also going to show you

Government's Exhibit 87. <BR>

<BR>

MR. JAHN: Ms. Nance, if you could provide those. <BR>

<BR>

MS. NANCE: (Complies.)<BR>

<BR>

THE WITNESS: (Witness reviews document.) <BR>

<BR>

MR. JAHN: Counsel, are we ready?<BR>

<BR>

MR. McDANIEL: Yes.<BR>

<BR>

BY MR. JAHN:<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Government's Exhibit 87, sir, I would like to ask you, do you have that before you?

<BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> Yes, sir, I do.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> The signature which appears on the bottom of Government's Exhibit 87, can you identify

that, sir, as being your signature? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> Yes, it is mine.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> All right. And can - well, can you tell us as far as the type of document, what is the

document itself, sir? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> This appears to be a loan extension agreement with the Security Bank of Paragould with

the amount extended, $13,800. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Did there come an occasion, sir, in which the bank loan that we discussed previously,

the Bank of Kingston, later Madison Bank and Trust, did there come an occasion, sir, when

that loan was moved out of that financial institution to another financial institution?

<BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> Yes, sir.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Okay.<BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> It did.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> And at the time that that was moved, did you execute a note, then, at the other

institution? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> I believe I did.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> All right. And that was the Security Bank of Paragould; is that correct? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> That's correct, yes, sir.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Now, did you make the arrangements as far as that particular note is concerned as far

as negotiating for that particular loan? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> Mr. Jahn, I honestly don't remember, it was a long time ago. I don't remember. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> All right. But as far as the loan itself was concerned, it was the loan you made in

connection with the Whitewater Development Corporation? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> Yes, sir, that's right.<BR>

<BR>

MR. JAHN: Your Honor, we would move the introduction of Government's Exhibit 87. <BR>

<BR>

BY MR. JAHN:<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> And if you would, sir, Government's Exhibit 89, do you have that in front of you, as

well? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> Yes, sir, I do.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> And we are back to the bank in Flippin; is that correct? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> That's correct.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Now, this particular document, does it have a date in the upper right-hand corner, sir,

as far as the date that the document was executed? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> Yes, it says, November 26th, 1984.''<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> And does it have underneath a maturity date as far as how long this note was good for?

<BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> December 3rd, 1986.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Okay. And as far as the document itself, the borrowers on the left-hand, upper

left-hand portion, can you tell us who was the obligors under the document in the upper

left-hand corner? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> Whitewater Development, Inc., James B. McDougal, Susan H. McDougal, Bill Clinton,

Hillary Rodham Clinton. <BR>

<BR>

MR. JAHN: Your Honor, we would move the introduction of Government's Exhibit 89. <BR>

<BR>

BY MR. JAHN:<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Mr. President, if you would, going back to Government's Exhibit 87, can you tell us

what the amount was - at the renewal executed on September 30th, 1985, what was the amount

of that renewal? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> The amount extended was $13,800.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Okay. And as far as Government ts Exhibit 89, as far as the renewal in November of 1986

due on December 3rd, 1986, what was the loan amount in that particular instance? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> $100,121.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Okay. And these were both Whitewater Development Corporation obligations; is that

correct? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> Well<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> I mean, from your state of mind, from your point of view, these were both Whitewater

Development Corporation obligations; is that correct, sir? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> They were Whitewater Development obligations if Whitewater Development had the money to

pay them. Otherwise, they were our obligations, personally. The four of us were jointly

and individually obligated on the big bank note, and I was obligated on the small one.

<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> And it was your expectations and hopes and dreams and visions, though, that Whitewater

Development Corporation would still be the entity that would be responsible for paying

this note; is that correct? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> I hoped eventually we could at least break even, that's right. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> All right. Now, in 1985 and 1986, sir, you still had - I believe you indicated Mr.

McDougal had moved back into town. Did you have fairly frequent contact with him during

the year 1985, for instance? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> I'm not sure. Itm sure I saw him a few times. I donit know how - I hate to use the word

"frequent," because I don't know how many times. But I had some contact with him in 1985

over various things. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Okay. You talked about your jogging, and if you can, I think it is on the record, but

how far was Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan from the mansion at that particular time?

<BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> It was less than a mile from the Governor's mansion. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> All right. And there would be occasions, then, on which you would go out jogging on the

streets of Little Rock; isn't that correct? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> That's correct.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> And when you would go jogging on the streets of Little Rock, quite often, unlike today,

sir, you had a lot more personal freedom, did you not, as far as being able to move

without the necessary requirements of security? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> Yes. And particularly if I was downtown in daylight, I would run sometimes on Main

Street, that was one of the streets I regularly ran on. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Okay. And you were free to run on your own and to go out and run and go by and visit

people and talk to people and the like? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> That's correct.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> And did you, in fact, on occasion jog past or jog to Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan?

<BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> On occasion, I did jog past it, yes.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Okay. And on occasions, did you actually jog to it and go inside and stop and visit

with people, sir? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> I believe that once or twice I actually went in, yes. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Okay. Now, during, again, the year 1985, were there occasions, sir, in which you, as

governor of the State of Arkansas, would seek out advice from Mr. McDougal? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> It's possible. Could you refresh my memory? Have you got a specific issue you want to

raise? <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Yes, sir, I've got one. If you would, I want to <BR>

<BR>

(WHEREUPON, Government's Exhibit Number 73 was marked for identification.) <BR>

<BR>

MR. JAHN: Could we have Government's Exhibit 73? <BR>

<BR>

MS. NANCE: (Complies.)<BR>

<BR>

MR. JAHN: May I approach the witness, Your Honor? <BR>

<BR>

THE COURT: You may.<BR>

<BR>

BY MR. JAHN:<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> I want to show you what has been marked for identification purposes as Government's

Exhibit 73. <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> (Witness reviews document.)<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Mr. President, I was showing you Government's Exhibit 73. And perhaps to speed things

up a little bit, sir, I will try a little leading questions. That's a memo directed to you

dated February 7th, 1985; is that correct, sir? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> That's what it says, yes, sir.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> All right. And it is from Jim McDougal; is that correct? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> Yes, it is all typed, there is no signatures on it, but it is typed, it says, ''To

Governor Bill Clinton from Jim McDougall'' <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Okay. And it is at the bottom left-hand side, sir, as far as the slug, I believe is

what they call it, the initials, it says, JRM/SS on the bottom left-hand corner; is that

correct? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> That's correct, sir.<BR>

<BR>

MR. JAHN: Your Honor, we would move the introduction of Covernment's Exhibit 73. <BR>

<BR>

THE COURT: All right. Received.<BR>

<BR>

(WHEREUPON, Government's Exhibit Number 73 was received into evidence.) <BR>

<BR>

BY MR. JAHN:<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Mr. President, in Government's Exhibit 73, Mr. McDougal is writing to you concerning a

request from someone in your office, i that correct, someone named Kathy? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> Yes, sir.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> And who is Kathy, sir?<BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> I'm not sure, but it could be Kathy McNatt, it probably is someone who worked in the -

in the appointments section of the governor's office. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> All right. And in it, it talks about recommendations for two people to fill the

vacancies on the State Savings and Loan Board. <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> Yes.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Can you tell the jury, sir, what is the State Savings and Loan Board? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> The State Savings and Loan Board is a board - let me say, Arkansas has a lot of these

boards, hundreds of them. The legislature at one point in history created a board to

advise the person who is in charge of overseeing the state chartered savings and loan. The

board, by statute, has to be comprised of people who, themselves, are in the savings and

loan business, except there is a consumer position by law and there might or might not be

a position for a senior citizen, I just don't remember. But otherwise, the vast majority

of the board members have to come out of the state S&Ls, and I think at the time there

were just a handful of them left in Arkansas. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> And were you aware, sir, that Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan was, in fact, a state

chartered savings and loan? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> Yes, sir, I was.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> And if you would, sir, second paragraph, in the second paragraph, Mr. McDougal

recommends John Latham, who was Chairman of the Board of Madison Guaranty Savings and

Loan. Did you know John Latham, sir? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> I did.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> And did you, in fact, appoint Mr. Latham to the Savings and Loan Board based upon Mr.

McDougal's recommendation? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> Well, first of all, Mr. Jahn, let me say, I'm not sure I ever saw this memo, but we did

appoint Mr. Latham, and Mr. McDougal, I believe, did recommend him, and I wouldn't be

surprised if he wasn't the only person that wanted to be on the board. It was hard, we had

to go scare up people to be on some of these boards by the mid-1980s. So I believe he was

appointed. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Okay. But you are saying you're not sure you ever saw the memo. If you saw the memo,

though, would you follow Mr. McDougal's recommendation? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> Well, I might have, might have done it if I hadn't seen it. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Okay.<BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> But in this case, I'm not sure that - as I've explained to you, this was a board with

relatively little power, that had - the membership requirements included the requirement

that people would be involved in the S&L business. We didn't have many state savings and

loans left by then, and I wouldn't be surprised if Mr. Latham wasn't the only person that

asked to be on this board. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Okay. It had limited power, you indicated, but at the same time it did have some power,

did it not, as far as branch regulations? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> I expect it did.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> For instance, within the savings and loan institution? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> Sure. I believe that's right.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> And were you familiar, sir, with a limitation that was placed upon savings and loans,

or state chartered savings and loans concerning their investment in private businesses or

their investment in service corporations limiting their investment to three percent? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> I don't believe I was.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Okay. Do you know whether or not Mr. McDougal was aware of any such limitation? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> I don't know.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Do you know whether or not Mr. McDougal was having any difficulty within his

institution concerning any such limitation? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> I do not.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> You indicated you know John Latham. Did you know Greg Young at the Madison Guaranty

Savings and Loan? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> I don't remember him, no, sir.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Okay. If you would, sir, can you, for the benefit of the jury, read the last paragraph

on Government's Exhibit 73, the memo from Mr. McDougal to yourself. <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> It says, Bill, we are down to only about 15 state chartered savings and loan

institutions, and I'm about the only one around who has any interest in this board.'' <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Now, as far as a memo from Mr. McDougal where it contains a personal sentiment such as

this, Bill,'' do you feel, sir, that if you probably would have received a memo such as

that, your staff probably would have brought that to your attention? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> I just don't know, sir. There is no check here. My mail was opened by other people. It

is quite possible that I would send an appointment form, a recommendation, with just some

note saying, Jim McDougal recommended him.'' I just don't know what happened. But I

certainly can't tell from this memo that I ever saw it, because when I saw things, I

nearly always checked where my name was. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Okay. I asked you concerning the status of Whitewater Development Corporation, and as

far as the trust and faith that you put in Mr. McDougall Did Whitewater Development

Corporation in 1985 have a checking account, to your knowledge? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> I don't know one way or the other. I never wrote any checks from it or received any

checks from it. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Okay. That was the next question. Did you have any authority over any checking accounts

that bore the name Whitewater Development Corporation''? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> I had - we, I was a passive investor, Mr. McDougal was managing the property. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Okay. Did he ever talk to you, sir, concerning the status of their particular

investments or concerning the status of the checking account in the spring of 1985? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> I don't recall any conversations with Mr. McDougal about Whitewater in 1985. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Directing your attention to March 29, sir, 1985, were you aware that the Whitewater

Development Corporation checking account was overdrawn approximately $25,000? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> If it, in fact, was overdrawn, I was unaware of that. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Now, in - you indicated that in the spring of 1985, let's just go back, in the spring

of 1985, did there come an occasion, sir, in which Mr. McDougal raised funds for your

campaign? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> Yes, sir, there did.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> All right. Can you tell the jury, as far as - first of all, spring of 1985 was not a

campaign year, was it, sir? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> No.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Okay. What type of debt was Mr. McDougal assisting you on? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> I had been re-elected Governor in the fall of 1984, in a campaign that I was fortunate

enough to win handily, I got over 60 percent of the vote, but I owed about a $100,000 when

the race was over, and I was having to pay it off. And Mr. McDougal volunteered to have a

fund raiser to pay a portion of the debt off. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Okay. Is it fair to say, sir, as far as a debt that is incurred and exists after a

campaign, sometimes those are the hardest ones to get rid of? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> Not if you are a Governor that won with over 60 percent of the vote, it is not hard.

<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Okay. But as far as the assistance that Mr. McDougal gave to you, you appreciated it,

did you not? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> I sure did. I appreciate everybody that contributed to my campaign . <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> You made a comment, in fact, during the course of your direct testimony that as a

candidate, it is quite second nature to ask people for their assistance; isn't that

correct? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> It is.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Either their vote, perhaps some volunteering on the campaign; is that correct, sir?

<BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> Yes, sir.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Perhaps putting a sign, even something as small as putting a sign up in their front

yard can become something of importance to you; is that correct? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> Very important, yes.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Then, of course, money is also important; is that correct? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> It is.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> And also actually physically working in the campaign, going door to door, knocking on

the door and the like, that becomes very important? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> Yes, sir. It is.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Is it fair to say, then, as a campaign, you are asking quite a lot of people then, "Can

you help me out?" <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> That ts the only way you can prevail is thousands of people helping you. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> All right. And in fact, because as you indicated, as your success in all your years in

Arkansas, you must have asked thousands and thousands and thousands of people for their

help? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> I certainly did.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Now, as far as the campaign itself is concerned, you did, in fact, attend a campaign

fund raiser, it was located at Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan; is that correct? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> Yes, sir.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> And it was on April 4th, 1985; is that correct, sir? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> I don't remember the exact date, but it was in the spring of '85 sometime. <BR>

<BR>

(WHEREUPON, Government's Exhibit Number 83 was marked for identification.) <BR>

<BR>

BY MR. JAHN:<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Okay. Let me, if you can, for the purpose of refreshing your recollection only, I'm

going to show you what has been marked for identification as Government's Exhibit 83, and

I believe I can represent, sir, that this was your schedule for the day of April the 4th,

I believe, 1985. <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> (Witness reviews document.)<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> And to be specific, sir, does it refer, ''At 4:15 Jim McDougal's fund raiser for the

Governor''? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> Yes, sir. This is a Thursday, April 4th, 1985, and it says one of the things I did on

this day was to leave the office at 4:15 to go to a fund raiser which Jim McDougal hosted.

<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Okay. And does that refresh your recollection, then, as far as the date of the fund

raiser itself? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> Yes, sir.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Okay. And if<BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> I mean, I don't - this appears to be one of my schedules, and so - I do know it was in

the spring of '85, so it probably was on April 4th. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> All right. And if you would, sir, during the course of that fund raiser, did you

receive contributions from - either directly or indirectly, from certain individuals that

were at that fund raiser? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> Well, there were people who were there who contributed. I don't believe I received

them, I don't believe they handed me the checks, but there were people there who

contributed. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Mr. President, during the course of your direct examination, you were questioned

concerning your relationship with Mr. Tucker back during the time in which you and he ran

against each other. Do you remember that line of questioning, sir? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> I do.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> And I believe you've indicated that your relationship was estranged to a certain extent

during the course of that campaign, which was in 1982; is that correct? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> That's correct, sir.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Now, did it begin to improve, though, shortly thereafter? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> Well, as I said, when we discussed this before, or when I testified to this before, it

was strained, but Governor Tucker, as a private citizen, continued to support the

Democratic Party in Arkansas, continued to support my policies, and from time to time gave

me contributions, which I very much appreciated. <BR>

<BR>

So, there was a distance between us throughout the 1980s that had not been there before

when we were younger and when we were very close, but as time went on, and as I said

before, it got better. You know, time tends to heal those kinds of wounds. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> By 1985 and 1986, sir, was there still a distance between yourself and Mr. Tucker, or

had you, in fact, become closer together? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> Well, he contributed to my campaigns in the '80s a couple at least twice that I know

of, but I think it would be fair to say that we had not recovered the kind of close

relationship we had when we were young men. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Had you gotten to a point, sir, where Mr. Tucker would confide in you concerning his

business relationships in 1985 and 1986? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> No, sir, we had not.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Were you aware, sir, that he was doing business with Mr. McDougal during that period of

time? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> No, sir, I was not.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Were you aware, sir, that he was seeking and obtaining loans from Mr. Hale during that

period of time? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> No, sir, I was not.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Did he talk to you concerning his financial status during the years 1985 and 1986? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> No, he didn't.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Did he ever share with you any hopes or dreams or expectations that he had concerning

his business future during the year 1985 and 1986? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> I don't believe we ever had a conversation like that. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> All right. Now, as far as getting back to 1985, if you would, sir, I want to show you

what has already been admitted as Government's Exhibit <BR>

<BR>

MR. JAHN: I'm sorry, has this one been admitted? <BR>

<BR>

MS. NANCE: What number?<BR>

<BR>

MR. JAHN: 533-B, I think.<BR>

<BR>

MS. NANCE: No.<BR>

<BR>

BY MR. JAHN:<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> I won't show you that particular check, sir. Were you aware, did Mr. McDougal ever talk

to you, sir, concerning a development called Flowerwood Farms in the spring of 1985? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> I'm not aware that he did, sir. But perhaps you could help me, maybe you know something

I don't know. But I have no recollection of that. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> In the spring of 1985, Mr. McDougal, the documents will show, borrowed $135,000 from a

Stephens Security Bank in Arkansas, a man by the name of Richard Smith made the loan. Did

Mr. McDougal ever discuss with you, sir, the need to make a loan during the spring of

1985? We are talking about spring of 1985. <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> No, sir.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Were you aware, or did he ever tell you, sir, that some of the proceeds from that loan

were utilized to make payments or deposited in the account of Whitewater Development

Corporation? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> No, he did not.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Okay. Again, back to the spring of 1985, who were you trusting as far as the management

of Whitewater Development Corporation? <BR>

<BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> As I have said repeatedly, Mr. Jahn, Mr. McDougal was managing the property and had

since we first bought it. <BR>

<BR>

(WHEREUPON, Government's Exhibit Number 76 was marked for identification.) <BR>

<BR>

BY MR. JAHN:<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> I'm going to show you next, sir, what is marked as Government's Exhibit 76, being a

Warranty Deed bearing a file stamp of the 10th day of June, 1985. <BR>

<BR>

MR. JAHN: And Your Honor, we would move the introduction of Government's Exhibit 76 based

upon the understanding we had concerning deeds that were filed in public - in court. <BR>

<BR>

THE WITNESS: (Witness reviews document.) <BR>

<BR>

MR. JAHN: May I assume it has been admitted, Your Honor, without objection? <BR>

<BR>

THE COURT: Yes, received.<BR>

<BR>

(WHEREUPON, Government's Exhibit Number 76 was received into evidence.) <BR>

<BR>

BY MR. JAHN:<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Mr. President, do you need more time to look at it, sir? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> No, sir, I have looked at it.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> All right. Mr. President, this Warranty Deed reflects that on the 3Oth day of May,

1985, James B. McDougal, as President of Whitewater Development, Incorporated, also with a

signature of Susan H. McDougal, as Secretary of Whitewater Development, Incorporated,

transferred certain lots, and specifically lots two, three, four, five, six, nine, 10, 11,

12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 20, 22, 23, 24, 29, 30, 35, 37, 43, and 44 to an organization

called the Ozark Air Services, Incorporated. Do you know who or what Ozark Air Services,

Incorporated was, sir? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> I don't believe I did know that, no.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Did you know, sir, that these were the remaining unsold lots of Whitewater Development

Corporation, Incorporated? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> I don't believe I knew that at the time, no. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Did Mr. McDougal consult with you, sir, prior to his transfer of the unsold lots of

Whitewater Development in May of 1985? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> No, sir.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Did he ever tell you or did he tell you at that time, sir, as to what his - what he was

receiving in exchange for these particular lots? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> I don't believe he did, no.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Did he ever talk to you, sir, concerning the obligations which you still, and you and

Ms. Clinton still had, concerning the payments of debts in the name of Whitewater

Development Corporation after 1985? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> I'm not sure I understood that question, Mr. Jahn. Would you ask it again, please? <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Well, if Whitewater doesn't have any more real estate left over, where is the profit

going to come from, Mr. President? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> Well, presumably, sir, the real estate contracts were accompanied by the obligation to

pay certain funds into Whitewater, that was the money that was going to be used to pay the

bank notes off. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Yes, sir. That's what you were going to break even on, or that's what Mr. McDougal told

you? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> That's what we hoped we would. And there were a period of several years within the

early '80s where, at least I assume, that we were breaking even, or we were making the

bank notes, the bank payments we were supposed to be making. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Okay. And in fact, the profit that you and Ms. Clinton hoped to make was going to come

from the sale of these excess lots, wasn't that a fact, sir? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> Well, by then, sir, I had pretty much given up on making a profit, I was just hoping we

could break even and not lose anything else. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Well, now, Government's Exhibit 76, sir, is dated May 30th, 1985, and you still had the

obligations reflected in the government's exhibits concerning the renewal of the loan

which you signed in the fall of 1985. Do you remember that, sir? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> Yes, sir.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Did Mr. McDougal, when you renewed that loan in the fall of 1985, did he tell you, sir,

that he had, in fact, sold or transferred all of the real estate assets of Whitewater

Development Corporation to Ozark Air Services, Incorporated? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> No, sir, he didn't.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Sir, if you would, in October of 1985, Mr. Tucker purchased 35 acres, or 34 acres of

property at that same location that you've discussed previously in your testimony, that

is, at 145th Street and what later became known as the Castle Grande area. Were you aware

of that, sir, in October of 1985? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> No, sir, I was not.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> OK. You indicated that you had been to that area on one occasion, and your recollection

was that it was in June of 1986. Do you remember that? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> Yes, I do.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> OK. If you would, sir, your calendar also reflects that in October of 1985, more

specifically, October 26th, 1985, you went to the Siemens-Allison plant for their 15th

anniversary celebration. Do you remember, sir, going to the Siemens-Allison plant at that

location where you described in October of 1985 to celebrate their 15th celebration - 15th

anniversary? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> I believe I did go there, yes, sir.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> All right. At the time that you went, sir, that was on a Saturday, do you recall

whether or not you knew Mr. Tucker had, in fact, purchased some real estate in that

particular area? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> I did not know that.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> OK. Your telephone call, toll records, sir, reflect that on the following Monday,

October 28th, 1985, you received a phone call from Mr. McDougall. Do you recall, sir, what

it was that you spoke to Mr. McDougal about on October 28th, 1985? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> I don't know that I did speak to him. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Well, if you can, let me show you some - are you familiar with the record-keeping

system by Ms. Dixon, sir? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> Yes, sir, I am.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> OK.<BR>

<BR>

MR. JAHN: If I may have a second, Your Honor. <BR>

<BR>

(WHEREUPON, Government's Exhibit Number 71-B was marked for identification.) <BR>

<BR>

BY MR. JAHN:<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> I'm going to show what has been marked for identification as Government's Exhibit 71-B

as in boy, reflecting a page of her records of October 28th, 1985. Do you see that before

you, sir? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> (Witness reviews document.) This appears to be just a series of notes that Linda Dixon

made to herself, yes, sir. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> And reflects a Jim McDougal, 3 p.m., 374-7777; is that correct, sir? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> Yes, sir. But it doesn't reflect whether he called for me or for Betsey Wright. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> OK. That's a good point, sir. But as far as the notation or the scratching out of the

document, do you know what Ms. Dixon's practice was as far as calls which were either

completed or returned as far as scratching out those particular document? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> No, sir, I don't.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> OK. And Ms. Dixon was - what was her position at the time, sir? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> She was my secretary.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> All right. And is she still employed with you, sir? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> Yes, she is.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> OK. And what is her position now, sir? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> She works in our office in Arkansas.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> OK. And as far as - but back to the question, sir. Do you recall receiving a phone call

in October - October 28th, 1985 from Mr. McDougal? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> No, sir. I have gotten a few phone calls since then. That was more than 10 years ago. I

don't remember it, no. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Sir, the records of the governor's mansion of the state of Arkansas reflect that on

December 19th, 1985, Mr. McDougal and Senator Fulbright came by the mansion and visited

with you. Do you remember that event, sir? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> Yes, sir. I remember that Senator Fulbright was in town and he wanted to see me, I

wanted to see him, and Jim was good enough to bring him by. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> OK. During the course of that visit, sir, did you and Mr. McDougal have any

conversations concerning the development of his property called Castle Grande out at the

145th Street location that you've talked about? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> No, sir. I believe it was just a social visit with Senator Fulbright. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> OK. In that case, then, do you recall any conversations you might have had concerning

some property that he desired to purchase from International Paper Company, property that

later became known as the Lorance Heights development? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> No, sir, we never talked about that.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Now, you testified on your direct, sir, that you recall an occasion in January of 1986

when Mr. McDougal came by the mansion and visited with you; is that correct? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> Yes, sir, he did.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> And your recollection, sir, was that that was sparked by some difficulty that he was

having with the state of Arkansas, with an agency within the state of Arkansas? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> That's correct.<BR>

<BR>

(WHEREUPON, Government's Exhibit Number 81 was marked for identification.) <BR>

<BR>

BY MR. JAHN:<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Sir, if you would, I'm going to show you what has been marked for identification as

Government's Exhibit 81. Government's Exhibit 81, sir, is a memo addressed to you; is that

correct? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> Yes, sir.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> And it reflects the discussion concerning that meeting on that Saturday in 1986,

January 1986; is that correct? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> Well, this is a memo to me from Nancy Hernreich, who was at that time my scheduler, and

it has got my check on it in a handwritten notation, it is in my handwriting. It says Mr.

McDougal wants to see me before Tuesday. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> OK. And it has the notation of 1-14 as the date, and then a notation of 1-18, `1 slash

18, Saturday, mansion''; is that correct, sir? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> That's correct.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> And the handwriting at the bottom this "Saturday morning," that is your handwriting?

<BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> "Saturday morning," that is my handwriting. <BR>

<BR>

MR. JAHN: Your Honor, we move the introduction of Government's Exhibit 81. <BR>

<BR>

THE COURT: All right. Received.<BR>

<BR>

(WHEREUPON, Government's Exhibit Number 81 was received into evidence.) <BR>

<BR>

BY MR. JAHN:<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> In that, sir, what is the stated purpose as far as Mr. McDougal's desire to see you on

that Saturday, the 18th of 1986, sir? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> Well, this says - I will just read it. May I read it? <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Yes, sir, please. It is in evidence.<BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> This is a note from Nancy. It says, He needs to see you before Tuesday to get you to

sign some personal business papers. The best time would be this weekend or next Monday,

which is a state holiday. Any time is fine with Jim. Do you want me to have him come by?''

So, this is between 1-14 and the next Tuesday, and I said, "Saturday morning." <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Yes, sir. What were the personal papers that Mr. McDougal wanted you to sign, sir? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> I don't know. I don't remember. And I'm not sure there were any. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Well, Mr. McDougal at this time was a friend of yours; is that correct? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> Yes.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> He was a political adviser to a certain extent; is that correct? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> He gave me some political advice, yes. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> He was a business partner of yours; is that correct? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> Yes.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> It wasn't necessary for him to fib to your staff in order to get to see you, was it,

sir? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> No.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Do you recall, sir, whether or not you were asked to sign any personal papers on

January 18th, 1986, by Mr. McDougal when he came to the mansion? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> I do not remember signing any papers like that. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> All right. And no one has ever shown you any personal papers that bear a date of

January 18th, 1986, that you signed for - on behalf of Mr. McDougal, have you, sir? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> I don't remember doing it, and I have seen no documents that indicate that I did. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> All right. And as far as that particular visit, do you recall one particular reason

that he came. Do you recall him bringing any personal papers with him when he came, sir?

<BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> I don't, no.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Did he discuss with you, sir, any negotiations that he had concerning the purchase of

property from International Paper Corporation in January of 1986? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> Absolutely not. He never talked to me about that. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Did he discuss with you any hopes or expectations that he might have concerning his

Castle Grande real estate development during that meeting in January of 1986? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> I don't remember any such discussion. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Did he discuss with you the prospect of, regardless of the names, of acquiring

additional property south? You do know where Castle Grande is, right? I mean, you are

familiar now with - that that was the name that was applied to the 145th Street

development area by Mr. McDougal? I just want to make sure we are on the same wavelength.

<BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> I'm familiar with the fact that he had that property on 145th Street. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Yes, sir. And are you familiar, then, that there was advertising concerning Castle

Grande and that was the name that was applied to that particular real estate? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> If you say so, I'll take your word for it. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Well, I.m just asking you. OK. So, lefts talk about the 145th Street - let's just call

it the Castle Grande property, if we can. We have to make sure you and I understand what

we are talking about. Did he talk to you concerning any hopes and expectations that he had

as far as developments of the Castle Grande property? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> The only property he spoke with me about was the property that he was having trouble

with the Health Department on. Now, I know that wasn't Whitewater property, I don't

believe it was Castle Grande property, but it was some property where there was no

municipal sewer system, and it had to be inspected by the state and approved for

installation of septic tanks. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Maybe I can help you -<BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> And I don't know whether - now, maybe that was the Castle Grande property, but I don't

know. I have no recollection of that. There was no discussion of property acquisition or

finances or anything. He was upset because he thought the Health Department was not giving

him a fair shake on this property. I have a very clear memory of that, and that's all I

remember him talking to me about. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Let's be more specific, then, and maybe I can help you. Do you remember Maple Creek

Farms, do you remember that was the property where he was having the difficulty with the

Health Department, was Maple Creek Farms? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> I remember that he owned some property called Maple Creek, but I don't remember - if

that's where it was, I'll take your word for it. I'm sure there are documents on that.

<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> But then you have no independent recollection, then, of any conversation on January

18th concerning either developments of Castle Grande is that correct, sir? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> That's correct.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> You have no independent recollection, did he discuss with you purchases of the Castle

Sewer and Water by Jim Guy Tucker during the course of that January 18th, 1986 meeting?

<BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> No, sir, I don't.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> OK.<BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> Not at that meeting.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> And you have no recollection, then, concerning purchases of property from International

Paper Corporation; is that correct? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> Absolutely not. We never discussed anything having to do with International Paper

Corporation. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> All right. Now, you, in exchange, or after having this meeting with Mr. McDougal, you

personally, sir, set up a meeting, then, with representatives from the State Health

Department, did you not, sir? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> Well, that's - what I did was, I first had my staff look into it, give me a report, and

then they arranged to have this meeting set up. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Sir, back to the question. You personally, though, took a role in setting up that

meeting; is that correct? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> I don't believe I called the Director of the Department of Health to meet with him, but

I - it's conceivable, but I don't believe I did. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Do you know Tom Butler, sir?<BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> I do know Tom Butler.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Mr. President, you called Tom Butler and you specifically asked him, if he would, to

come to the meeting, sir, and at that particular time, you told Mr. Butler that you were

doing this because Mr. McDougal is a supporter. <BR>

<BR>

Do you remember that, sir?<BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> Have you got some documentation that would help me with that? That was a long time ago.

<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Sure. I'm going to show you a report of interview with Mr. Butler, if you would, sir,

dated March 8th, 1995. <BR>

<BR>

MR. COLLINS: May we have a copy of that? <BR>

<BR>

MR. JAHN: That's the only copy I've got. <BR>

<BR>

MR. COLLINS: Will we get one?<BR>

<BR>

MR. JAHN: Sure.<BR>

<BR>

BY MR. JAHN:<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> And I highlighted the particular portions, sir. <BR>

<BR>

MR. KENDALL: May the witness be allowed to read the entire document? <BR>

<BR>

MR. JAHN: Sure. Whatever. I just highlighted to try to speed things up. <BR>

<BR>

THE WITNESS: (Witness reviews document.) <BR>

<BR>

BY MR. JAHN:<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Have you finished it, sir?<BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> Almost.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> OK.<BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> I have now read the whole thing.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> OK. You personally set up that meeting, or took a role in setting up that meeting with

a conversation with Mr. Butler, did you not, sir? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> Well, according to this interview. First, let's talk about this. You have given me an

interview done by the Office of Independent Counsel with Tom Butler, who was the number

two person at the Department of Health when I was governor, and that was done in - last

month, on March the 9th, in 1995. And Mr. Butler says that I called him and asked him to

give Mr. McDougal an interview about his septic tank problems, and I stated to him that he

had been a supporter of mine for years and had never before asked for anything from the

state. And that might well have happened. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> OK.<BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> I don't dispute that. Let me just say this, I remember very well the meeting that was

held in the governor's office about this. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> OK. So, you don't dispute, then, that you could have even because of your respect for

Mr. McDougal and your relationship with Mr. McDougal, you could have even personally

undertaken to set up that particular meeting; is that correct? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> Yes, sir.<BR>

<BR>

(WHEREUPON, Government's Exhibit Number 93 was marked for identification.) <BR>

<BR>

BY MR. JAHN:<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> OK. And Mr. Butler, in fact, here - I want to show you now Government's Exhibit 93. Do

you see Government's Exhibit 93, sir? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> Yes, sir.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> In order to speed things up, I'm going to do a little leading of you, if I could.

That's your schedule for the date of March 4th, 1986; is that correct? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> Yes, sir.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> And it reflects that you did, in fact, have such a meeting with Mr. McDougal and Mr.

Butler at 2 o'clock on that day; is that correct? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> Yes, sir.<BR>

<BR>

MR. JAHN: Your Honor, we would move the introduction of Government's Exhibit 93. <BR>

<BR>

THE COURT: All right.<BR>

Received.<BR>

<BR>

(WHEREUPON, Government's Exhibit Number 93 as received into evidence.) <BR>

<BR>

BY MR. JAHN:<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> At that meeting, sir, did Mr. McDougal tell you that on that very day, or effective

that very day, he had signed a contract to purchase 200 acres of land from International

Paper Corporation, sir? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> No, sir, he did not. He was - as this report that you have given me points out and

refreshes my memory, that day all he could talk about, according to this report that you

have given me, and it is certainly consistent with my memory, was how upset he was about

the Health Department on the land there. He never said anything about any purchase of the

land. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Did he tell you, sir, that he had made that purchase - I'm sorry, 800 acres, I have

been corrected - of 800 acres in the name of Whitewater Development Corporation? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> Absolutely he didn't. As a matter of fact, we were never even alone there. I had a big

meeting there because he wanted a hearing from the Health Department, and he didn't say

anything about any of that. Not - he didn't ever say anything about it, and he certainly

didn't say anything that day, absolutely not. This was a meeting about, just as Tom Butler

reports here in this document you have given me, this was a meeting about the problems he

was having getting septic tanks approved. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Had you, sir, by March the 4th, 1986, been informed by Mr. McDougal of his sale of

other assets of Whitewater Development; that is, that at that day, on that date,

Whitewater Development had no other real estate assets for sale? Had he ever told you

about that transaction we talked about earlier, the one back in June of 1985? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> First of all, Mr. Jahn, those are two different things. The answer to the second

question is, no, I don't believe he ever told me about it. I don't believe I ever knew

that. The answer to the first question, I don't think is quite accurate. If the lots were

sold on escrow contracts, then the deed was withheld and they had to make the payments to

Whitewater and then Whitewater would use the payments to pay off the bank notes. So, I

don't think - the fact that the land was sold, it was a good thing for Whitewater, not a

bad thing, sir. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> But those were the loans that you were hoping would break  you even. As far as making

any profit, there were no assets in  March of 1986 to make your profit, were there, sir?

<BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> Well, I don't know the answer to that. That depends on - I  don't know how much was

outstanding on all those lots that had  been sold. I don't know if they had paid it all

off if it would  have been enough to pay the bank notes off and more besides. I  don't

have a clue about that. I can't answer that question. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> In March of 1986, sir, the only way Whitewater  Development Corporation could make

money, the money that Mr.  McDougal promised you, the profit, was to acquire new assets 

and make a profit on those assets; isn't that a fact, sir? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> Sir, I would have to say no for two reasons. Number one is  no and I don't know. Number

one, Mr. McDougal never promised me  any money. He asked me if I wanted to take a risk

with him, a  business venture, an investment. There is no such thing in the  free

enterprise system as a risk-free investment. We took a  chance, we made what I thought was

a prudent investment, and it  didn't make money. I'm sorry about that, but he didn't

violate  any promise to me on that. <BR>

<BR>

Number two, whether there was any way to make money or not  depends upon a question that I

don't know the answer to, which  is, what was the total outstanding due on all the

contracts  that had been sold as of that time, and was that total  sufficient to cover the

bank note and leave something over  besides? I don't know the answer to that, and I don't

know that  - if you do, I would be glad to hear it, but I don't have a  clue whether that

is true or not. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> And you don't know the answer because Mr. McDougal didn't  tell you, he didn't sit down

and talk to you concerning whether  or not there was enough money or enough assets left to

make a  profit for Whitewater Development Corporation; is that your  testimony, sir? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> I was a passive investor, he was managing the land, that  is my testimony. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Exactly. He was managing the land, he was making  the decisions; is that correct? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> That is correct, he was making the <BR>

decisions.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> And it is your testimony then that he never once told  you about any great hopes or

expectations or visions that he  had for property that he was purchasing from

International  Paper Corporation? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> Never once, he never discussed International  Paper. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Did he ever mention the name "Lorance Heights" to you, sir? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> I don't believe so. I have no recollection of that. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Did he ever mention the name "Master Marketing'' to  you, sir? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> No, sir.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Did he ever ask you to make any more additional  contributions to Whitewater

Development Corporation in the  spring of 1986? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> I don't believe he  did.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Did Mr. McDougal make any statements to you concerning the development of roads on the

Lorance Heights property, sir? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> No.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Did Ms. McDougal make any statements to you concerning the development of roads on the

Lorance Heights property? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> No.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Do you know R.D. Randolph?<BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> I do.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> OK. Did he ever talk to you about hiring R.D. Randolph to do work out at the Lorance

Heights property, sir? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> I knew that R.D. Randolph worked with Jim McDougall I don't believe I knew what he did.

<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> I asked you about organizations that you had not heard about. Did you ever hear any

reference to a company called Master Marketing, sir? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> No.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Did you ever discuss a Master Marketing with Jim McDougal? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> No.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Did you ever discuss Master Marketing with Susan McDougal? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> No.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> On April the 3rd, 1986, Master Marketing received $300,000 from David Hale's

corporation, Capital Management Services. Were you told in advance, sir, that such a loan

was going to be made? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> No.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Were you told after such a loan was made that it had been made? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> No.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Were you told as to how the proceeds of that loan were used? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> No, sir.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> were you aware, sir, that $25,000 of the proceeds of that loan was used for the down

payment in the name of Whitewater Development Corporation of the International Paper

Company property? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> I was not aware of that.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Were you aware, sir, of the need as to when the closing date was to be, as far as the

purchase of that particular property? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> No, sir, I wasn't.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Did you have contact at all, during the year 1986, with either Mr. or Ms. McDougal

concerning Whitewater Development Corporation, to your recollection, sir? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> Yes, I believe I did, along toward the end of the year. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> All right. What happened along toward the end of the year, sir, in reference to the

Whitewater Development Corporation and Mr. and Ms. McDougal? <BR>

<BR>

Who was it, first of all, that contacted you? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> I believe it was Mr. McDougal, along toward the end of the year. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> OK. And he contacted you, did he not, sir, and he wanted you and Ms. Clinton to

basically abandon any interest in the property; is that correct - in the corporation; is

that correct? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> My recollection is he called me and he said to me, ''This thing has lost money. We've

put a lot of money into it. It's never going to run a profit. I'd like for you to sign

your stock over to me and we could use it for,'' I think, for "tax purposes" or something.

I believe that's the request he made. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> And what was your response, sir?<BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> Well, I discussed it with Hillary, and in the end we decided not to do it. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> OK. When he made that request of you, sir, did he tell you that there was, in fact, 800

acres of land in the name of Whitewater Development Corporation? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> What 800 acres? You mean, different from the Whitewater land? <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Yes, sir.<BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> I don't believe he did, no, sir.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Did he tell you about any great hopes or expectations - at that time when he asked you

to abandon your interest in Whitewater Development Corporation, did he tell you about any

great hopes or expectations he had for the development of that property? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> Mr. Jahn, my recollection is - and I believe he also wrote me a letter about this time

- my recollection is that I had a conversation with him and I had a letter. And my

recollection is that what he said was there were - Whitewater had lost money, it still

lost money, there were losses on Whitewater that he had sustained, that if he had all the

- if he were the sole stockholder, if he and Susan owned all the stock, that he could get

some tax advantages from those losses, which means by definition he had some gains

somewhere. But I had no idea what those gains were or what the tax considerations were. He

didn't discuss it with me, and I didn't ask him. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> So, he didn't tell you anything at all about the assets that were then in existence of

Whitewater Development Corporation? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> He did not.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> He didn't tell you about any of his plans for development of the property in the name

of Whitewater Development Corporation? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> No, sir, he didn't.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Didn't tell you anything at all about his plans for the future for Lorance Heights; is

that correct? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> That's correct.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> OK. Did he tell you, sir, that he was going to transfer assets from the name of

Whitewater Development Corporation to Great Southern Land Company? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> No, sir, he didn't.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Are you familiar with the name "Great Southern Land Company," sir? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> I am now.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> OK. Did you have any interest in the Great Southern Land Company in 1986? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> No, sir, I didn't.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> What did you know Great Southern Land Company to be in 1986, sir? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> I don't think I knew anything about it in 1986. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> OK. If you would, sir -<BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> I might have, I just don't remember.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> All right.<BR>

<BR>

(WHEREUPON, Government's Exhibit Number 80 was marked for identification.) <BR>

<BR>

BY MR. JAHN:<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> If you would, sir, I'm going to show you Government's Exhibit 80, that's a check from

Ms. Clinton to Great Southern Land Company. <BR>

<BR>

MR. McDANIEL: Give us just a moment, counsel. <BR>

<BR>

MR. JAHN: Surely.<BR>

<BR>

THE WITNESS: (Witness reviews document.) <BR>

<BR>

I have reviewed the document, sir.<BR>

<BR>

MR. JAHN: OK.<BR>

<BR>

BY MR. JAHN:<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> To Great Southern Land Company in December of 1978; is that correct, sir? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> Yes, that's a check that my wife signed. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> OK. Do you know what Great Southern Land Company was, sir? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> I'm assuming it is a company that Jim owned, but I don't - <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> I'm sorry. Isn't it, in fact, a company that he was using back in 1978 at one time or

another? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> That's entirely possible and I've just forgotten it, that's right. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> And did he ever tell you, sir, that he intended to transfer real estate assets from

Whitewater Development Corporation to his other company, Great Southern Land Company? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> I don't believe so. I certainly have no memory of it. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> You indicated, sir, that you - or specifically denied having certain conversations with

David Hale during the course of your testimony? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> Yes, sir.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Do you remember that line of questioning? How long have you known David Hale? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> I believe I first met him, as I said, 20 years ago, perhaps a little more than 20 years

ago, now. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> OK. And you're not representing that you can remember each and every conversation that

you had with Mr. Hale; is that correct? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> No. I don't believe I've ever had any kind of a substantive conversation with him. I

don't believe we've ever sat down and had a long talk about anything. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Well, but have you ever sat down and had fairly short talks with him? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> Not to my memory. But I mean, we have been in the same place, you know, on a few

occasions over 20 years, so I can't remember every time I have ever seen him. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Wasn't it a fact that at one point he was the judge that handled any crimes that arose

within the capital complex? Did you ever have any occasion to see him, for instance, when

he was lobbying for pay raises for state judges and things like that? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> Well, if he was in the Capitol building, I might well have seen him. I was around the

Capitol building, particularly during legislative sessions, I would sometimes visit

committee hearings, and I saw hundreds, perhaps even a few thousand people during every

legislative session. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> And you're not maintaining, though, that you can remember each and every conversation

that you had with Mr. Hale? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> Not at all. I wouldn't begin to say that. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> And you're not maintaining, sir, that you can recall whether - what Mr. Hale's

reactions were to any conversations that he may or may not have had with you, are you,

sir? You're not trying to say that you are clairvoyant or anything like that, are you?

<BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> What are you asking me, sir?<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Well, I'm just asking you, there is no way that you can get in and read Mr. Hale's

mind, is there? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> No. I certainly can't do that. I wouldn't presume to do that. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> You are not claiming that you can know the thoughts that went on within Mr. Hale's mind

at the time that he may or may not have had conversations with you; is that correct? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> First of all, sir, I'm not sure I ever had a conversation with him in the Capitol, so I

can't even speculate about something I'm not even sure occurred. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Well, I didn't say in the Capitol, I'm just saying any conversations. You must have had

some conversation. Are you denying any conversations that you ever had with Mr. Hale at

this time? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> Absolutely not. If - I knew who he was, so if I were to run into him, I'd say Hello,

how are you,'' but I don't recall any substantive conversation I ever had with him. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> All right. And it is your testimony that you don't recall putting any pressure on Mr.

Hale; is that what you said, sir? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> My testimony is that I did not put any pressure on Mr. Hale. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Yes, sir.<BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> That's my testimony.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> And you are adamant about that, aren't you, sir? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> I am adamant about that.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> So that even if there were conversations which you can recall - or which you cannot

recall which occurred between yourself and Mr. Hale, you know that it was not your nature

to go about trying to place pressure on individuals with whom you had associations; is

that correct? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> I did not have any personal business conversations with Mr. Hale. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Well, but I'm saying, as far as your adamancy as far as pressure is concerned, what is

that based upon, sir? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> Based upon the fact that it didn't happen, sir. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Well, is it based upon your recollection of all of your conversations with Mr. Hale?

<BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> It's based on the fact that I know that I never pressured David Hale to make a loan,

just like I never ran in my jogging shorts out to 145th Street to see him in the cold. I

know that I never did that. What he - it is not true that that happened, sir. It did not

happen. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Did you ever jog directly to Mr. McDougal's office space, sir? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> I don't believe I ever jogged directly there, sir, but I - it was - as I testified

earlier, Mr. McDougal's office in downtown Little Rock was on Main Street. I never jogged

to any of his real estate offices, and certainly not to 145th Street, which was 12 miles

or so, or 10 miles or something from downtown Little Rock. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> I don't know why you would want to change the question, Mr. President. <BR>

<BR>

MR. HEWER: Your Honor, again<BR>

<BR>

BY MR. JAHN:<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> The question is, did you ever jog to Mr. McDougal's office space? <BR>

<BR>

MR. HEWER: I'm going to object to the argument by counsel. <BR>

<BR>

MR. JAHN: Have you ruled, Your Honor?<BR>

<BR>

THE COURT: Was that responsive to your question? <BR>

<BR>

MR. JAHN: The answer that the president gave? I will be more than happy to clarify, if he

doesn't understand, Your Honor. I will be more than happy to rephrase. <BR>

<BR>

THE COURT: Rephrase it.<BR>

<BR>

BY MR. JAHN:<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Where was the Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan office space, sir? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> As I testified, sir, it was on Main Street, less than a mile from the governor's

mansion. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> And you didn't even need to jog, you could stroll from the mansion to Mr. McDougal's

office space, could you not, sir? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> I could.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> And, in fact, during 1985 and 1986, there were a number of occasions in which you

basically just got in your car and drove around to various areas; isn't that correct, sir?

<BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> I don't know that that's true.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Well, as far as reports - was there a Lincoln assigned to the mansion, sir? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> The governor had a Lincoln, yes.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Yes, sir. I believe the line of questioning, Mr. President, was, it was not far from

the mansion to Mr. McDougal's office, was it, sir? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> No, sir. And I've already testified that I often jogged by there, and that on one or

two occasions, I actually went in. I've already testified to that effect a few hours ago.

<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> So, there would be nothing, then, to prevent you from either jogging, walking, or

driving from the mansion to Mr. McDougal's office, is there, sir? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> I could go to Mr. McDougal's office whenever I wished. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> That's right. And then there would be nothing that would prevent you from getting in

Mr. McDougal's car and driving anywhere where you wanted to, was there, sir? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> That would be highly unusual.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Well, I'm asking you, sir, was there anything that would prevent you from doing it?

<BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> I don't recall ever doing it.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Well, but sir, but I'm asking you, if you would, sir, the question is, was there

anything that would prevent you from doing it? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> I wouldn't do that unless there was some reason to do it, and I know of no reason why I

ever did it. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Mr. President, if you would, sir, the question is, was there anything that would

prevent you from doing it? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> Yes, there is something that would prevent me from doing it. If I were - if I had

jogged by there and I were unaccompanied by the state trooper and he was going to drive me

some place besides drive me home so that there wouldn't be the state trooper behind us

going wherever we were going, then I wouldn't get in the car, I don't think, and go

anywhere with him. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> You just threw up a reason why you couldn't. But is there anything that, under normal

circumstances, would prevent you from either walking, jogging, or driving over to Mr.

McDougal's place of business, getting in his car, and driving any place you wanted to?

<BR>

<BR>

MR. McDANIEL: Objection, Your Honor, it has been asked and answered now three times. <BR>

<BR>

MR. JAHN: Your Honor, I submit it has -<BR>

<BR>

THE WITNESS: I must not understand the question. <BR>

<BR>

BY MR. JAHN:<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> OK.<BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> If you want to ask me about a specific example and if something happened, I will be

glad to answer that. I have told you that I frequently ran on Main Street. On a couple of

occasions, I went in to Mr. McDougal's office at the savings and loan. I felt free to see

him whenever I wished to. Now, I don't know how else to answer your question. I have no

recollection of riding anywhere in a car with him. If you think that there is a time when

I did that or you want to ask me about it, sir, I will be glad to try to answer it, but

I'm doing my best to tell you the truth, and all you're asking me to do is speculate. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> No, sir. All I'm asking you to do is to admit to the jury, sir, that there is no

physical law, no spiritual law, no inconsistency that would prevent you from getting in

Mr. McDougal's car and driving anywhere that you wanted to back in 1985 and 1986. That's

all I'm asking you. <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> Well, and I explained to you what the facts were, what my practice was. I explained to

you what my practice was. Could I physically do it without anyone restraining me? Yes, I

could have done that. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> OK.<BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> Was it my practice to do it? The answer to that is no. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> So, the answer is, there was no reason why you couldn't have done it, as far as no

physical prevention, no moral prevention, no logical prevention that would have prevented

you from having done it; is that correct? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> There was a logical reason not to do it. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> All right.<BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> Depending on where we were going. But nobody - I wasn't in handcuffs and chains, if

that's what you are asking. No, I could have physically done it. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Is there a reason that you didn't want to answer that question? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> I didn't understand it.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Oh, I'm sorry.<BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> I still don't.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> If I don't make myself clear, please feel free to speak up. You've talked about jogging

past Mr. McDougal's office. You're aware, sir, are you not, that Mr. McDougal has a

recollection concerning an occasion in which you jogged past his office and had a

conversation concerning Ms. Clinton? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> I am aware of that.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Are you aware of that?<BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> Yes, I am.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> And you are aware, sir, that Mr. McDougal has a recollection of an event in which you

jogged by and asked Mr. McDougal to place Ms. Clinton's law firm on a retainer. Do you

remember that, sir? I'm saying, do you remember that that's one of Mr. McDougal's

recollections? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> I remember that - I am now aware that Mr. McDougal remembers that I asked - I believe

he has testified that he thought I asked him to give Hillary some law business. I don't

know about a retainer. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> And you're now aware that Mr. McDougal remembers that event occurring and you don't

remember it; is that correct, sir? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> I remember going in to see him. I do not remember asking him to do that, no. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> OK. But you don't recall asking him to place Ms. Clinton on a retainer; is that

correct? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> I do not, no.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> You don't recall - do you recall asking him to give her a specific amount per month in

reference to that retainer? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> No, I don't.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Do you recall any - you say you remember going in to see him. Do you remember going in

to see him and discussing Ms. Clinton and law business for Madison Guaranty Savings and

Loan? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> I do not.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Is there any - I just want to make sure I'm asking you the right question, I'm not

asking you a question that you don't understand. Is there any combination of facts that I

can ask you that comes anywhere close to what Mr. McDougal recalls as far as that

particular conversation is concerned? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> Well, I don't remember the specific request. You know, we spoke in passing about a lot

of things over the years. I don't know whether he asked me, How is Hillary doing?" ' How

are we doing?" I'm just answering the question as I know it. I do not remember making that

specific request. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Do you remember the question, sir?<BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> No.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Will you at least concede, sir, that it is human nature that individuals remember

events said differently from each other? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> Depends on the significance of the events and how long ago they occurred. But obviously

people's memory of specific things are different as time passes. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> OK.<BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> Particularly if they are not especially important to them. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> OK. And if they are especially important, there are occasions in which individuals can

remember, even on important issues, can remember conversations differently, one

remembering it one way and one remembering it another. Isn't that a fair statement, sir?

<BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> Your definition of important'' and mine might be different. I think there are some

times when people have different memories of exactly what was said, and both of them are

doing their best to tell the truth. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> That's correct. And those events occur whether it is important or unimportant. You're

the one that injected unimportant. I'm just trying to point out that those differences

occur whether it is important or unimportant; isn't that correct? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> Some things stick in your memory more than others, that's right, Mr. Jahn. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> That's correct. And sometimes it is a direct function of time. You can remember

something which occurred yesterday but you can't remember something that occurred a year

ago and vice versa; isn't that correct, sir? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> Yes, sir.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> All right. And you're not saying that Mr. McDougal is necessarily wrong concerning his

recollection of the event, are you, sir? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> No. All I'm saying is what I remember. That's all I can do. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> OK. And as of now, sir, you cannot remember having a conversation with Mr. Hale

concerning how Master Marketing was going to be funded; is that correct? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> I can remember that I never had such a conversation. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Well, you can remember specifically that you never had that conversation? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> I never had that conversation.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> OK. Did you ever have any conversation with Mr. McDougal concerning how Whitewater

Development Corporation was going to be funded in 1986, sir? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> No, sir.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Did you ever have any conversation with Susan McDougal concerning how Master Marketing

funds were going to be spent in 1986? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> No, sir.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> And those conversations you also specifically recall; is that correct? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> No.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Or the lack of those conversations?<BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> No, there were no such conversations. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> You indicated, sir, that you know R.D. Randolph? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> I do.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> OK. How long have you known R.D. Randolph? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> A long time. Maybe almost as long as Mr. McDougall I think that Mr. Randolph worked

with Mr. McDougal in Senator Fulbright's office in Little Rock back in the '60s. So, I've

known him a long time. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> OK. And known him both personally as well as through politics; is that correct, sir?

<BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> Well, I know him personally, if that's - I mean, I know him by his first name, I've

known him for many years. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> And he was also -<BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> Knew his father, knew he was from Logan County, and they supported me up there. I knew

him. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> And then you also knew that he was very active in politics; did you not, sir? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> Yes, I do. Well, that's how I met him, through Senator Fulbright. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> OK. And you were - and in fact, you were active in obtaining his employment with the

state, were you not, sir? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> I believe that he got a job with the state at some time before I left the governor's

office, and I think he asked me to support that. And we had someone in the governor's

office that actually tried to help place people with state jobs, so I might well have done

that. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Mr. President, if you would, sir, during the spring of 1986, sir, did you know, or did

Jim McDougal talk to you about arranging a loan to benefit Larry Kuca and a firm called

Campobello Realty? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> No, sir.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> In the early part of 1986, did Mr. McDougal talk to you concerning arranging a loan for

the benefit of Stephen Smith, your former employee, and his company, The Communication

Company? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> No, sir.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Did he talk to you, sir, concerning arranging a loan to benefit Jim Guy Tucker in a

firm called Castle Sewer and Water? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> No.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Did you have any conversations, sir, I believe it's already been covered, but I'll ask

it again, concerning arranging a loan to benefit a firm called Master Marketing? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> No, sir.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> And lastly, sir, did you ever have any conversations with Mr. Tucker concerning

arranging a loan with David Hale to benefit a firm called Southloop Construction Company?

<BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> No, I did not.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Sir, you indicated that you had - or that you recall that you did not have any

conversations in depth, or any substantive conversations with Mr. McDougal during the year

1986. Do you remember that, sir? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> No, I remember saying that I didn't recall ever having any substantive conversations

with David Hale. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> I'm sorry, David Hale. I'm sorry.<BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> I testified that I did talk to Mr. McDougal in January of '86 for sure, and I stopped

by to see him in June at his trailer on 145th Street. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> OK. But as far as conversations with Mr. Hale, that you testified affirmatively that

you did not have those; is that correct? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> I have no recollection of any kind of conversations with David Hale in 1986. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> Isn't it a fact, sir, that in your interrogatories to the Resolution Trust Corporation

you indicated that you could not remember any such conversations? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> That's correct, I don't remember having them. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Q:</B> OK. Does that preclude, then, sir, conversations which you no longer recall? <BR>

<BR>

<B>A:</B> Well, if you mean could David Hale have said, Hello, Governor,'' when he was in the

Capitol or something like that, I suppose that could have occurred. There were no

substantive business-related conversations. <BR>

ATTORNEYS FOR DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT BAKER & MCKENZIE 

<P>

APPELLANT BAKER & McKENZIE'S OPENING BRIEF 

<P>

<B>INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT</B>

<P>

A. The Central Issue Presented By This Appeal. 

<P>

No single illustration can fully expose all of the consequences of a particular legal

principle. But we think this one greatly helps focus one of the central issues raised by

this appeal: 

<P>

The ebullient mood at the meeting of Babylon Software's Board of Directors fades when its

Chairman, Howard Adams, asks the directors to consider a sensitive personnel matter. "We

have a serious problem. Debra Scott, our Sales Manager, appears to have a drinking

problem. So far it hasn't interfered with her performance. But her former assistant

reported that she keeps a bottle of vodka in her briefcase, and she may be surreptitiously

drinking all day. And she had quite a bit to drink at the Christmas party and then drove

home. She's on the road a lot in a company car and could really hurt somebody." Adams

pauses. "Still, she's doing a great job. I don't know what to do about it." 

<P>

The Board members discuss alcoholism and how to treat it. Interventions. Twelve-step

programs. The successes. And, more often (they think), the failures. 

<P>

"We have to try, don't we?" says Adams. "We've always said this Company is not just a

money machine for the stockholders, but a family. Debra was the eighth person employed; I

hired her myself in 1986. Is there any reason why we can't help her get the help she

needs?" 

<P>

"Well, there is a reason, if you want to hear it." The speaker is Kay Michaels, Babylon's

General Counsel. "I hate being the nay-sayer, but there is an unsettled area of California

law you ought to consider. It involves whether an employer is liable for punitive damages

when an employee commits a tort, such as driving while intoxicated. There is a theory

which resulted in at least one whopping jury verdict in San Francisco that you may have

read about that if an employer has information that one of its employees is 'unfit' (a

term which no court has ever defined), and doesn't fire that employee, it can be stuck

with punitive damages if that employee then goes out and hurts somebody. Moreover, we

can't get insurance for punitive damages." 

<P>

"Are you saying that if Debra runs over somebody after drinking, we could be hit with

punitive damages just because we didn't fire her?" 

<P>

"Please don't shoot the messenger, but that's exactly what I'm saying," Michaels replies. 

<P>

"Kay," says another director, "what if we confront Debra, tell her we know she has an

alcohol problem, and strongly encourage her to get help? Won't that protect us against

punitive damages?" 

<P>

"It would certainly help us in front of a jury, but it wouldn't spare us from having to go

to trial. Any competent plaintiff's lawyer would scoff at our efforts and argue that we

should have been more concerned about potential accident victims than with keeping our

star sales manager churning out profits." 

<P>

After a pause, the Chairman asks, "what can we do? We can't take the risk of a

seven-figure verdict that isn't covered by insurance. It makes me sick to say this,

because I like Debra, and she's a damn good sales manager. But we can't afford the kind of

risk that Kay has spelled out." 

<P>

Whether or not Babylon can prudently retain Debra in its employ while trying to help her

with her alcohol problem will depend directly on how this Court resolves the issues raised

in Parts I and II of this brief. 

<P>

B. Summary Of Appellant's Argument.

<P>

In August 1991, Rena Weeks, a legal secretary in the Palo Alto office of Baker & McKenzie

("Baker"), complained to Baker that during the four weeks she had been employed there, she

had been sexually harassed by partner Martin Greenstein. Greenstein categorically denied

her allegations to his partners. 

<P>

Plaintiff's allegations were strenuously disputed at trial. Nevertheless, the jury found

that Plaintiff's accusations were true, and held Greenstein liable for $50,000 in

compensatory damages. Because Baker had stipulated prior to trial that Greenstein was a

"supervisor" within the meaning of Section 12940(h)(1) of the Fair Employment and Housing

Act ("FEHA"), Baker was strictly liable for any compensatory damages Greenstein had

caused. Judgment was accordingly entered against Baker as well as Greenstein for the

$50,000 in compensatory damages. 

<P>

Baker acknowledges that an impartial jury properly could have found that Greenstein

harassed Plaintiff and that she suffered injury as a result. The acts that the jury found

Greenstein committed were deplorable. They violated the clear written policy against

sexual harassment Baker had in place at the time the harassment occurred; they offended

norms of civilized behavior in the workplace; and they violated the law. Neither

officially nor unofficially did Baker encourage or condone the sexual harassment of its

female employees in general, or of Plaintiff in particular. Accordingly, nothing in these

pages questions the jury's rightful condemnation of the behavior it found took place or

its determination that punitive damages of $225,000 is an appropriate sanction to be

assessed against the wrongdoer for his misconduct. 

<P>

But while Baker is fully prepared to accept its responsibility for properly imposed

compensatory damages and attorney's fees, the stakes here were dramatically escalated by

that part of the judgment finding Baker liable for $3.5 million in punitive damages. For

several different reasons, this punitive damage award cannot stand. 

<P>

Plaintiff presented substantial evidence that various instances of Greenstein's mostly

verbal misbehavior toward other female employees had been brought to the attention of

various Baker partners at scattered times prior to Plaintiff's employment. This

information, had it been thoughtfully collected and evaluated by a single decisionmaker,

should have resulted in more vigorous action than Baker took. But neither the inadequacy

of Baker's responses to prior complaints about Greenstein's behavior nor Baker's statutory

liability for compensatory damages based on Greenstein's supervisorial status justifies a

multi-million-dollar judgment for punitive damages. That, in the larger sense, is what

this appeal is about. Baker's appeal from the $3.5 million punitive damages award thus

addresses the following issues, several of which are questions of first impression: 

<P>

1. In the usual punitive damages case, the defendant engaged in extremely bad conduct

resulting in a finding of "malice, fraud or oppression""the statutory touchstone of

punitive damages. Civ. Code  3294(a). Corporate defendants can be liable for punitive

damages on this basis either because the wrongful acts carried out an evil corporate

policy or because they were conducted on the company's behalf, in purported service of the

company's business interests, by high-level corporate officers whose misconduct is the

misconduct of the corporation. 

<P>

This is a different kind of case. Here, Greenstein was not a "managing agent" of Baker,

and his misconduct was committed for his own personal gratification and not for the

benefit of his employer. His harassment of Plaintiff was not within the scope of his

employment. Farmers Insurance Group v. County of Santa Clara, 11 Cal. 4th 992 (1995). Not

surprisingly, then, the jury did not find that Baker was itself guilty of "malice" or

"oppression" toward Plaintiff. 

<P>

Instead, the punitive damages award against Baker rests on the jury's special verdict

finding (which tracked Section 3294(b) of the Civil Code) that Baker "either (a) had

advance knowledge of the unfitness of defendant Martin R. Greenstein and with a conscious

disregard of the rights or safety of others continued to employ him, or (b) ratified the

conduct of Mr. Greenstein which is found to be oppression or malice." 

<P>

a. This is the first case to reach a Court of Appeal in which an award of punitive damages

rests upon that part of Section 3294(b) which authorizes such punishment when an employer

knew one of its employees was "unfit" but failed to discharge him even though the employer

is not personally guilty of malice, fraud or oppression. The verdict rests on the theory

that Baker actually knew, prior to Baker's employment of Plaintiff in July 1991, that

Greenstein was disposed to harass female employees, and therefore had a duty to fire him.

Because Section 3294(b) defines the triggering event for an employer's punitive damages

liability based on the tortious acts of an employee as the failure to fire that employee

for "unfitness""not the failure to take less drastic disciplinary steps"the outcome of

this highly visible appeal inevitably will have an enormous impact on how California

employers respond to concerns raised or complaints made about their employees. It will

directly affect the job security of workers accused"unfairly, in some cases"of harassment

or other tortious behavior, and the ability of management to deal sensitively with these

matters. 

<P>

The message from the present judgment therefore is not an unmixed blessing: In addition to

rightly condemning the deplorable acts that Greenstein was found after trial to have

committed, the judgment also counsels California employers that to avoid liability for

punitive damages, the only prudent rule is "when in doubt, fire." That advice will not be

overlooked by risk-averse employers confronted with an accused employee, even when less

extreme steps such as mandatory counseling, reassignment, a short suspension, or a

reduction in pay or status, might be more appropriate. "When in doubt, fire" is poor

advice, and terrible public policy that could strip thoughtful and progressive employers

of needed flexibility in responding to allegations that employees have engaged in

harassment or other misconduct. See Part I(A)(2), infra. 

<P>

But that message to employers stems, we think, from a misreading of California punitive

damage law. As we show in Part I(A)(1), infra, the issue of an employer's duty to fire an

assertedly errant employee"like all questions of legal duty"is a question of law, subject

to this Court's de novo determination. The proper test is whether the employer has actual

knowledge of sufficient highly reliable information demonstrating that the employee is

"unfit" in that he or she poses a high degree of risk of serious future harm that could

not be avoided by alternative steps short of termination. Only then should an employer be

required"at pain of punitive damages"to fire the employee as "unfit." See Part I(A)(3),

infra. 

<P>

The evidence in this case falls far short of that. Prior to July 1991, various partners in

various Baker offices had learned of complaints by female employees of boorish behavior by

Greenstein, mostly in the form of offensive remarks. In each instance, Greenstein assured

his partners that the allegation was untrue. None of the complaints involved behavior as

outrageous as the intimate bodily touching he subsequently inflicted on Plaintiff. Several

of the complaining employees requested that they remain anonymous and that no further

action be taken; no employee made a formal complaint or urged Baker to take disciplinary

action against Greenstein. While the alleged conduct was thoroughly inappropriate and

wrong, and undoubtedly should have spurred further investigation and corrective action,

Baker was never presented with highly reliable information suggesting a high degree of

foreseeability of future serious harm (such as the uninvited touching of a female

employee's breast, as occurred here), let alone serious harm that could be avoided only by

termination. Indeed, even Plaintiff's own expert witness refrained from testifying that

Baker had a duty to fire Greenstein prior to the date Plaintiff was employed. See Part

I(A)(4), infra. 

<P>

This Court has guidance from the California Supreme Court that was not available to the

trial court. Fitch v. Commission on Judicial Performance, 9 Cal. 4th 552 (1995), holds

that a sitting judge"who was actually found after a full evidentiary hearing to have

engaged in acts of sexual harassment more numerous and egregious than the alleged acts of

misconduct reported to Baker prior to Plaintiff's employment"should be publicly censured,

but not removed from office. There is no way to square the Supreme Court's response to

Judge Fitch's sexual harassment with the jury's determination that, prior to Plaintiff's

employment, Baker knew Greenstein was "unfit" and breached a legal duty to fire him. 

<P>

b. The alternative basis for the punitive damage award against Baker is its purported

ratification of Greenstein's sexual harassment of Plaintiff. This far-fetched theory (put

to the jury in a single interrogatory that was combined with the "employment with

knowledge of unfitness" issue) will not wash. Ratification by an employer of the tortious

conduct of an employee requires a showing that the employer had (1) actual knowledge of

the tortious conduct and its outrageous nature, and (2) an actual intent to "adopt or

approve" that wrongful behavior. College Hospital, Inc. v. Superior Court, 8 Cal. 4th 704,

726 (1994). 

<P>

Baker did not intentionally adopt or approve Greenstein's harassment of Plaintiff. Baker

had a formal written policy prohibiting sexual harassment. Even though Baker was uncertain

as to whether Plaintiff's allegations"which Greenstein had denied" were true, and

certainly did not "know" that they were, it immediately reassigned her so that she would

not have to work with Greenstein. It also required Greenstein to undergo counseling. These

steps are the antithesis of "adopting" or "approving" Greenstein's sexual harassment of

Plaintiff. Indeed, Baker had no reason to adopt or approve such conduct, which was

unrelated to Baker's enterprise and provided Baker no benefit. 

<P>

2. For these reasons, the record cannot support either statutory ground for an award of

punitive damages, and Baker should not have been found liable for any punitive damages.

But even if the Court should disagree, the punitive damages award for $3.5 million"which

was based upon an assessment of Baker's financial condition and the "reprehensibility" of

Baker's conduct"cannot stand. The jury never found that Baker was guilty of "oppression,

fraud, or malice" (Civ. Code Section 3294(a)), which is the statutory sine qua non of

holding any party directly liable for punitive damages. Absent such a determination, a

finding that Baker had known of Greenstein's unfitness but failed to fire him, or that it

had somehow ratified Greenstein's misconduct, at most would support holding Baker

vicariously"and thus jointly and severally"liable for the $225,000 punitive damages

assessed against Greenstein. 

<P>

Civil Code Section 3294(a) provides that a party is liable for punitive damages only upon

a finding of "oppression, fraud, or malice." Adams v. Murakami, 54 Cal. 3d 105, 119-23

(1991), holds that a party can be held liable for punitive damages only when the plaintiff

has presented evidence of the defendant's financial condition. And Section 3295(d) permits

introduction of evidence of a defendant's financial condition only after that particular

defendant has been found to be guilty of oppression, fraud or malice. At the same time,

Section 3294(b) permits an employer to be found vicariously liable for punitive damages

"based upon acts of an employee" where the employer either (i) "had advance knowledge of

the unfitness of the employee" but nevertheless continued to employ him; or (ii) ratified

the employee's tortious acts. 

<P>

These statutes can be harmonized by interpreting Sections 3294(a) and 3295(d) as setting

the standards for direct liability for punitive damages (based on the reprehensibility of

the defendant's conduct and an assessment of its financial condition), while viewing

Section 3294(b) as authorizing an employer's vicarious liability for the punitive damages

assessed against its employee where the plaintiff proves that employer has either

knowingly continued to employ an "unfit" employee or ratified that employee's tortious

act. Under this analysis, the judgment against Baker for punitive damages must be reduced

to the $225,000 assessed against Greenstein. 

<P>

3. The trial court made two other errors that, especially in combination, created a

substantial likelihood of jury confusion concerning Baker's liability for punitive

damages. The first of these errors was submitting to the jury Plaintiff's alternative FEHA

claim, by which Plaintiff sought to hold Baker liable for compensatory damages on the

ground that Baker had failed to take "all reasonable steps to prevent harassment." That

alternative claim was moot and unnecessary because Baker had stipulated that Greenstein

was a "supervisor" and was therefore strictly liable for any compensatory damages caused

by Greenstein's conduct. 

<P>

Keeping the alternative FEHA claim in the case was prejudicial for two reasons. First,

that unnecessary and irrelevant claim permitted the admission of considerable testimony

and argument that was otherwise improper and very prejudicial to Baker. Second, presenting

the claim to the jury created needless jury confusion concerning Plaintiff's claim against

Baker for punitive damages. That claim turned on the seemingly similar issue of whether

Baker knew of Greenstein's "unfitness" and with "conscious disregard of the rights and

safety of others continued to employ him." In fact, the two claims were not the same at

all. The unnecessary FEHA claim was based on allegations of ordinary negligence: the

failure to take "all reasonable steps" to avoid harassment. By contrast, the punitive

damages claim required actual knowledge of "unfitness" and a failure to fire Greenstein

with "conscious disregard of the rights and safety of others." Moreover, Plaintiff could

prove the unnecessary FEHA claim by a preponderance of the evidence, while Plaintiff had

to prove her punitive damages claim by clear and convincing evidence. See Part III(A)-(C),

infra. 

<P>

The inevitable and unnecessary confusion caused by the presence of the alternative FEHA

claim was exacerbated when the trial court refused to give an instruction defining "clear

and convincing evidence" that has been used in California for nearly a century and

repeatedly approved. That requested instruction would have informed the jury that the

necessary evidence to impose punitive damages "must be so clear as to leave no substantial

doubt" and "must be sufficiently strong as to command the unhesitating assent of every

reasonable mind." Instead, the court gave a truncated instruction"one that omitted those

critical points"that the courts have frequently questioned and disapproved. See Part

III(D), infra. 

<P>

Either of these errors provides an independent basis for reversing the punitive damages

award. Taken together, they reinforce one another. They created a grave risk that the $3.5

million punitive damages judgment was based on irrelevant evidence evaluated under an

inadequate burden of proof. 

<P>

4. Even if the Court were unpersuaded by any of the foregoing arguments, $3.5 million

would be an excessive punishment for Baker's failure to appreciate that, given the various

complaints that had been made about Greenstein prior to its employment of Plaintiff in

July 1991, he was "unfit" for any continued presence in the workplace and had to be

terminated. As we have seen, under Section 3294(b) Baker's liability for punitive damages

is premised on that and nothing more. The jury did not find Baker to have acted with

malice or oppression; this fact distinguishes this case from every reported decision under

the present punitive damages statutes imposing substantial punitive damages. Indeed, the

trial court found that Baker's conduct "was not the product of a deliberate and purposeful

policy aimed at violating the rights of anyone." Greenstein's misconduct was outside the

scope of his employment and not undertaken for any reason that could possibly benefit

Baker; to the contrary, Baker had an established, written policy prohibiting any form of

sexual harassment. Baker's failure to have recognized Greenstein's unfitness and to have

fired him prior to employing Plaintiff simply does not rank sufficiently high on the scale

of "reprehensibility" to warrant a punitive damage award of $3.5 million, 70 times the

compensatory damages awarded by the jury. This ratio dramatically exceeds the ratios that

have been found impermissible in cases of even greater moral culpability. Given the

adverse publicity, the new procedures Baker has adopted to further protect its employees

against sexual harassment, the costs of this litigation, and the compensatory damages and

attorney's fees that Baker will have to bear in all events, this award of punitive damages

is far in excess of what would reasonably be required to deter Baker from making a similar

error in the future. Under all the circumstances, and in light of the limit on punitive

damages under comparable federal law to $300,000 even in cases far more severe than this

one, the punitive damages should be reduced to not more than $300,000. See Part IV, infra.



<P>

5. Finally, the judgment against Baker for punitive damages must be reversed because a

juror whose vote was necessary to the verdict concealed material facts on voir dire. The

juror's wife had been a claimant in a class action for gender discrimination in which she

had been represented by the same attorney who represented Plaintiff in this case. Her case

was successfully prosecuted and settled, leading to a substantial financial recovery. The

juror failed to respond to voir dire questions directly calling for disclosure of these

facts even though the juror later admitted that he had discussed the prior suit with his

wife at the time of the voir dire and that during the voir dire he was "sitting there

waiting to answer [and] ready to tell." Because this juror supplied the essential ninth

vote for a crucial special verdict finding that was a necessary predicate for the punitive

damages award against Baker, the failure of the juror to respond truthfully to questions

that should have elicited information that would have led to his dismissal for cause or,

at minimum, a peremptory challenge, was prejudicial juror misconduct requiring reversal of

the judgment for punitive damages. See Part V, infra. 

<P>

6. Plaintiff's claim for a multi-million dollar attorney's fee award relied heavily on the

size of the punitive damages judgment. The trial court's award of attorney's fees

therefore will need to be recalculated if this Court reverses or revises that judgment. If

the punitive damages award is reversed, this Court should remand the attorney's fees

issue, instructing the Superior Court to exclude from the fee award the hours Plaintiff's

counsel spent unsuccessfully pursuing punitive damages. A remand will also be necessary if

the punitive damages award is reduced, since a plaintiff who achieves limited success is

entitled only to an award of fees proportionate to the results obtained. See Part VI(A),

supra. 

<P>

Even if the punitive damages judgment is not reversed or reduced, the attorney's fee award

must be modified. Under their contingency fee agreement, Plaintiff's counsel would have

received a total fee of $2,348,282.50"plus interest at 10%"even if the trial court had

only granted a fee award equal to the lodestar (i.e., the product of counsel's hourly

rates times the number of hours expended on the litigation). But the trial court decided

to enhance the lodestar by a "multiplier" of 1.7, thereby increasing the fee by $645,095.

This, in turn, will give Plaintiff's counsel a total fee for merits work of $2,783,330.25,

73.7 per cent of the $3.775 million damages won by Plaintiff. The record contains no basis

for the trial court's startling conclusion that a fee of more than $2.78 million was

necessary to provide an "added incentive" for lawyers to take civil rights cases. The

trial court's decision to award Plaintiff's counsel a "multiplier" was therefore an abuse

of discretion and should be reversed. See Part VI(B), infra. 

<P>

<B>STATEMENT OF FACTS</B>

<P>0

Martin R. Greenstein joined the Chicago office of Baker & McKenzie in 1971 and became a

capital partner in 1982. RT 1038-40. Greenstein practiced intellectual property law in

that office until approximately September 1988, when he began splitting his time between

Baker's offices in Chicago and Palo Alto. RT 1064-6; see RT 583. Beginning in

approximately late 1989, Greenstein worked full time in Baker's Palo Alto office. RT

1065-66. 

<P>

On July 23, 1991, Plaintiff Rena Weeks began work as Greenstein's secretary. RT 2012-13,

2018, 2182. Plaintiff testified that Greenstein began acting inappropriately toward her

soon after she began work at Baker. On August 8, 1991, various people from the

intellectual property department, including Greenstein and Plaintiff, had lunch at the

Sizzler restaurant in Palo Alto. RT 1119-20, 2047. After lunch, Greenstein and Plaintiff

left the restaurant together, so that Greenstein could drop her off at a training session

on his way to the airport. RT 1127, 2054. According to Plaintiff, as they walked to his

car, Greenstein reached over her shoulder into her left breast pocket and emptied some M&M

candies (which he had picked up as they left the restaurant) into her pocket, touching her

breast as he did so. RT 2069-70, 2125. Plaintiff testified that Greenstein then grabbed

her arms from behind, put his knee in her lower back, pulled her arms back, and remarked,

"Let's see which breast is bigger." RT 2070, 2126. Plaintiff and Greenstein then continued

to his car, and Greenstein dropped Plaintiff at her training session on his way to the

airport. RT 2071-72. 

<P>

Plaintiff also testified that on August 14, 1991, she came into the office early in the

morning and saw Greenstein moving some boxes. When she said good morning to him, he put

down a box and "lunge[d]" towards her. When Plaintiff moved back, Greenstein asked her if

she was afraid he was going to grab her, and she responded that she was. RT 2093-94. The

next day, a number of individuals from Baker's Palo Alto office, including Plaintiff and

Greenstein, had lunch at a local Japanese restaurant. Plaintiff reported that Greenstein

ate most of Plaintiff's lunch off her plate and, towards the end of the meal, asked her

several times what was the "wildest thing" she had ever done. RT 2096-98. 

<P>

Plaintiff testified that on August 20, 1991, she and several other people from Baker's

Palo Alto office, including Greenstein, were loading some boxes into a van. When Plaintiff

was leaning into the back of the van, somebody "grabbed" her hips or "butt." She turned

around and saw it was Greenstein. RT 2106-07; see RT 1433- 34. During this period,

according to Plaintiff, Greenstein was critical of Plaintiff's work, calling her an

"imbecile" and telling her she needed "street smarts." E.g., RT 2099, 2103-04. 

<P>

On Friday, August 23, 1991, Plaintiff read Baker's sexual harassment policy in Baker's

employee handbook. RT 2117. She then went to speak with Mary Contreras, the office

administrator of Baker's Palo Alto office, and told Contreras of most of the incidents set

out above. RT 618, 2118; see 16 AA 4513. Contreras immediately told Plaintiff she could

take off the rest of that day and the next business day, with pay, while Contreras

consulted with the administrative committee about Plaintiff's complaint. RT 625, 2121,

2136-37; 16 AA 4513. When Plaintiff returned to work on Wednesday, August 28, Baker

reassigned her to work with another attorney and paralegal in Baker's Palo Alto office. RT

634, 926-27, 2162-64, 2275. During her remaining time at Baker, Plaintiff had minimal

contact with Greenstein. See RT 2164-65, 2275-77. On October 1, 1991, after nine weeks

working at Baker, Plaintiff voluntarily left the firm and took a job elsewhere as a

secretary. RT 2168, 2182, 3540. 

<P>

In December 1991, Plaintiff filed a complaint with the EEOC. RT 2169. This lawsuit was

filed in May 1992. 1 AA 1. 

<P>

At the time of Plaintiff's complaint to Contreras, Greenstein was confronted with

Plaintiff's allegations. RT 877, 927-28, 1302-03, 1611-12. At that time and as this

lawsuit proceeded, Greenstein repeatedly denied that he had acted inappropriately toward

Plaintiff in any way. See RT 877-78, 928, 1141-43, 1170, 1304-05, 1611-13, 1615. However,

in June 1993, after several women testified in deposition about being sexually harassed by

Greenstein, he was asked by his partners at Baker to resign voluntarily from the firm. RT

1228-30, 2400-02. He refused. RT 1229-30, 2402-03. Further discovery in this lawsuit

produced evidence that Greenstein had engaged in unprofessional conduct unrelated to the

allegations of harassment, including backdating of official documents. Acting on the new

revelations of harassment and the evidence of professional misconduct, the firm's

Executive Committee decided to seek Greenstein's involuntary removal from the firm by

placing a motion before the entire partnership at the firm's annual general meeting in

October 1993. RT 1231-32, 1549-50, 1554-55, 1566-67. Hours before a vote was to be taken

on the motion, Greenstein resigned. RT 1232-33, 1569. 

<P>

Plaintiff's claims were tried to a jury in July and August 1994. Plaintiff contended that

Baker was jointly and severally liable for her compensatory damages because (a) Greenstein

was a supervisor, for whose harassment Baker was strictly liable (Gov't Code Section

12940(h)); and (b) Baker failed to take "all reasonable steps" to prevent harassment. Id.

Section 12940(i). Because Baker had stipulated that Greenstein was a supervisor, the jury

was instructed that Baker was strictly liable for compensatory damages caused by

Greenstein's misconduct. RT 3541. With respect to punitive damages, the jury was asked to

decide only whether Baker was vicariously liable for punitive damages under Section

3294(b) "based upon acts of an employee""that is, Greenstein"and not whether Baker was

itself guilty of malice or oppression under Section 3294(a). See 7 AA 1778. 

<P>

At the end of Phase I of the trial, the jury found that Greenstein had harassed and

thereby injured Plaintiff, and that Baker had failed to take all reasonable steps to

prevent Greenstein's harassment of Plaintiff. 7 AA 1776. The jury awarded Plaintiff

$50,000 in compensatory damages for emotional distress. 7 AA 1777; see RT 3555-56. The

jury also found that Greenstein was "guilty of oppression or malice" in his harassment of

Plaintiff. 7 AA 1777; RT 3557. Finally, the jury found that Baker "either (a) had advance

knowledge of the unfitness of Martin R. Greenstein and with conscious disregard of the

rights or safety of others continued to employ him, or (b) ratified the conduct of Mr.

Greenstein which is found to be oppression or malice." 7 AA 1778; RT 3557. After Phase II

of the trial, in which evidence of the financial condition of both Greenstein and Baker

was introduced, the jury found Greenstein liable for punitive damages of $225,000 and

Baker liable for $6.9 million in punitive damages. 7 AA 1786; RT 3780-81. 

<P>

Baker timely moved for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and for a new trial. 7 AA

1796, 1799. After a hearing (RT 3782-3854), the trial court denied Baker's motion for

judgment n.o.v. 10 AA 2969. The court concluded, however, that the $6.9 million punitive

damage award against Baker was excessive and granted Baker's motion for a new trial on

that ground alone, subject to the condition that the motion was denied if Plaintiff

consented to a reduction in the punitive damage award against Baker to $3.5 million. 10 AA

2970. Plaintiff consented to the remittitur. 11 AA 3158. Baker timely appealed. 11 AA

3161. 

<P>

Plaintiff also moved for an award of attorney's fees and costs pursuant to Government Code

Section 12965(b) and Code of Civil Procedure Section 1021.5. 9 AA 2652; 11 AA 3099. The

trial court found a lodestar amount of $921,565 for merits work reasonable and applied a

multiplier of 1.7. Along with the resulting $1,566,660.50, the court awarded Plaintiff

$166,510.50 for "fees on fees" and expenses of $114,266.86, for a total award of

attorney's fees and costs of $1,847,437.86, assessed jointly and severally against Baker

and Greenstein. 16 AA 4468, 4474-75. Baker timely appealed the award of attorney's fees

and costs. 16 AA 4480. 

<P>

<B>ARGUMENT</B>

<P>

I. THE RECORD DOES NOT SUPPORT THE IMPOSITION OF  

<P>

PUNITIVE DAMAGES AGAINST BAKER UNDER  CIVIL CODE  

<P>

SECTION 3294(b).

<P>

Civil Code Section 3294(b) provides: "An employer shall not be liable for damages pursuant

to subdivision (a), based upon acts of an employee of the employer, unless "[i] the

employer had advance knowledge of the unfitness of the employee and employed him or her

with a conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others or "[ii] authorized or

ratified the wrongful conduct for which the damages are awarded or "[iii] was personally

guilty of oppression, fraud, or malice." (Civ. Code Section 3294(b) (subparagraphing and

bracketed subparagraph numbers added for convenient reference). 

<P>

Section 3294(b) thus sets out three circumstances in which employer liability for some

punitive damages may be imposed. Because the jury did not find that Baker was "personally

guilty of oppression, fraud, or malice," the third of these grounds is inapplicable to

this case. Rather, given the jury's special verdict, the award of punitive damages must

rest on either the first or the second ground. The evidence is insufficient to support

either finding. 

<P>

A. The Record Evidence Is Insufficient To Support The Finding That 

<P>

Baker Had "Advance Knowledge" Of Greenstein's "Unfitness." 

<P>

The punitive damages statute was materially revised in 1980, with further revisions in

1987. See College Hospital, Inc. v. Superior Court, 8 Cal. 4th 704, 712- 13 (1994). As a

result of the first of those revisions, Section 3294(b)[i] was added allowing an employer

to be held liable for punitive damages if: (1) the employee is 'unfit'; (2) the employer

knows this; (3) the employer fails to terminate the employee; and (4) the employer's

inaction is in conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others. But in the sixteen

years since this statute was enacted, there has been no reported case in which an employer

actually was held liable for punitive damages under Section 3294(b)[i] without a finding

that the employer was also personally guilty of malice, fraud or oppression. In other

words, in that period not a single reported punitive damages award has been based solely

on an employer's knowingly hiring or continuing to employ an "unfit" employee. 

<P>

Here, it is conceded that Baker continued to employ Greenstein through the time Plaintiff

worked at the firm. Similarly, Baker concedes that if Greenstein was unfit and Baker had

knowledge of this unfitness, the jury could have found that it employed Greenstein "with

conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others." Thus, whether Baker had a duty to

fire Greenstein turns on the first two elements above"that is, whether in light of what

Baker actually knew about Greenstein's prior conduct, it was bound to conclude that he was

"unfit" and had to be fired. 

<P>

This raises two issues not previously considered by any appellate decision. First, does

the general principle that the existence of a duty as a question of law apply here to the

existence of a duty on the part of an employer to terminate an unfit employee? Second,

what is the meaning of the term "unfitness" as used in Section 3294(b)[i]? Far more than

the fate of this verdict depends on how the Court resolves these issues. 

<P>

1. Whether Baker Continued To Employ Greenstein With "Advance  

<P>

Knowledge Of [His] Unfitness" In Violation Of Civil Code Section 

<P>

3294(b)[i] Is A Question Of Duty That Should Have Been Decided 

<P>

As A Matter Of Law By The Trial Court, And Is Subject To De Novo 

<P>

Review.

<P>

Section 3294(b)[i] imposes upon employers a legal duty to fire an employee it knows to be

"unfit"; breach of that duty subjects the employer to punitive damages. However, "'duty'

is not an immutable fact of nature 'but only an expression of the sum total of those

considerations of policy which lead the law to say that the particular plaintiff is

entitled to protection.'" Ballard v. Uribe, 41 Cal. 3d 564, 572 n.6 (1986) (citations

omitted). The court must balance "the foreseeability of the harm against the burden of the

duty to be imposed." Ann M. v. Pacific Plaza Shopping Ctr., 6 Cal. 4th 666, 678 (1993).

The existence of a duty is a question of law for the court, and is reviewed de novo on

appeal. 

<P>

The reservation of these issues to the court reflects the broader perspective of trial and

appellate judges, the policy implications the issues raise, and the respective

competencies of judge and jury. As one court recently observed in an analogous case, "[i]t

would be grossly unfair to permit a lay jury, after the fact, to determine in any case

that security measures were 'inadequate,' particularly in light of the fact that the

decision would always be rendered in a case where the security had, in fact, proved

inadequate." Nola M. v. University of Southern California, 16 Cal. App. 4th 421, 429

(1993). 

<P>

The same considerations apply here. Whether an employer is liable for punitive damages

because it failed to terminate an employee who was "unfit" has enormous implications for

the job security of any employee who may be accused of professional or personal

misconduct, incompetency, alcohol or drug abuse, or anything else that could affect the

health or safety of others. See Part I(A)(2), infra. Unless the legal standard determining

when an employer must terminate an employee in order to avoid liability for punitive

damages is sensibly calibrated, clearly articulated and even-handedly applied, rational

employers will hesitate to take steps less drastic than terminating such employees, and

will minimize their exposure for punitive damages by applying a hair-trigger standard of

"when in doubt, fire." 

<P>

Thus the trial court should itself have determined whether Baker had a duty under Section

3294(b)[i] to have ended Greenstein's employment prior to July 1991 (when Plaintiff was

first employed by Baker) instead of leaving that issue to the jury. See, e.g., Ballard, 41

Cal. 3d at 572 ("defendant is correct in suggesting that the trial court should properly

have resolved the duty issue itself"). Baker asked the trial court to make that ruling

both before and after the court submitted it to the jury. Under the foregoing authorities,

this Court must now resolve that issue de novo. 

<P>

2. The Jury's Implied Holding That An Employer Must Fire An 

<P>

Employee Accused Of Sexual Harassment, Or Face Punitive 

<P>

Damages If That Employee Is Accused Again, Has Profound 

<P>

Implications For Employers And Employees Alike. 

<P>

We begin by emphasizing what the question is not. To begin with, the question is not

whether, faced with the disputed reports of Greenstein's behavior various Baker managers

received from time to time prior to July 1991, Baker should have taken swifter or stronger

steps than it did, including earlier referral to counseling, more intensive supervision

or, eventually, economic penalties or suspension. Failure to have taken such steps sooner

(or at all) would fairly support a claim against an employer for negligence or under the

Fair Employment and Housing Act for direct liability for compensatory damages caused by

any later harassment. See Gov't Code  12940(i); Fisher v. San Pedro Peninsula Hosp., 214

Cal. App. 3d 590, 608 n.6 (1989). But the award of compensatory damages is not at issue

here. 

<P>

Therefore, the question here is when an employer should be subjected to punitive damages

under Civil Code Section 3294(b)[i] for hiring or continuing to employ an "unfit"

employee. That question, in turn, depends on what the statute means by "unfitness""a label

whose imposition requires that the employee be terminated (and rendered untouchable by any

other employer with knowledge of the employee's record). An appropriate interpretation of

the term "unfitness" must therefore take into account the practical consequences for

employee job security created by imposing liability for uninsurable punitive damages on an

employer's failure to identify and fire an "unfit" employee. 

<P>

The narrower the employer's discretion to resort to measures short of outright

termination, the narrower and more hazardous the channel it must navigate between the

Scylla and Charybdis of two perfectly legitimate but overtly conflicting policies. On the

one hand, employers have important legal duties to their employees to maintain a workplace

free from harassment; under existing laws, breach of these duties will leave the employer

liable for compensatory damages. On the other hand, employers also have duties to

employees accused of harassment, and who in any particular case may have been accused

wrongly; breach of those duties may subject the employer to claims for wrongful

termination or defamation. 

<P>

The choice an employer must make between protecting potential future victims of bad

conduct and the legitimate job security interests of its employees poses not only

difficult personnel management decisions, but difficult factual judgments as well. The

severity of the conduct and the merit of the complaint can be very hard to judge at the

time a complaint is raised. Often the accused employee denies the accuser's charge. In

addition, for good reasons or otherwise, the aggrieved employee often will not cooperate

in an investigation of the complaint, or the defense of any grievance the accused employee

might pursue if the employer imposes discipline. Faced with such uncertainty, the employer

must make choices whose effect on the particular employees involved, and on its workforce

in general, will be long-lasting. 

<P>

The punitive damages award against Baker can stand only if the information possessed by

Baker prior to July 1991 (when it first employed Plaintiff) was sufficient to brand

Greenstein "unfit" so that nothing short of termination was acceptable. Affirmance of that

award would require this Court to say that, as a matter of law, Baker had no alternative

but to fire Greenstein. That conclusion would have profound and serious consequences for

California's labor force: 

<P>

-- It would mean that even when the employee who has complained asks that nothing further

be done (and declines to pursue any internal or external remedy), and even though the

accused employee vigorously denies the accusations, the employer would be required by law

to make its own determination of the facts bearing on whether it must risk the imposition

of punitive damages unless it declares the accused employee "unfit" for any further

presence in the workplace and fires him. 

<P>

-- It would mean that when the employer has determined that an employee has engaged in

misconduct, it could not address the conduct by less drastic means (therapy, supervision,

suspension) because it would be exposed to punitive damages unless it declares the

employee "unfit" and fires him or her immediately. 

<P>

-- It would result in a class of workers indelibly marked with a statutory "scarlet

letter"""U" for Unfit and Unemployable"that no informed employer could prudently hire, no

matter how capable and productive that individual otherwise might be. 

<P>

These concerns are neither exaggerated nor hypothetical. There is already empirical

evidence that many employers are adopting hair-trigger practices to terminate employees

accused of sexual harassment after only one or two complaints, regardless of how well the

allegations are substantiated. And there is extensive evidence that employees terminated

following allegations of sexual harassment are bringing suits against their employers for

wrongful termination and defamation, with some success. Notably, some courts have held in

wrongful termination cases that an employer's subjective good faith belief that an

employee has engaged in sexual harassment does not constitute good cause for termination.

Thus an employer that swiftly terminates an employee following allegations of sexual

harassment may find itself faced with a wrongful termination suit by the fired employee. 

<P>

A low threshold for the duty to declare "unfit" and terminate an employee would inevitably

erode the job security of many employees. Accusations of sexual harassment, drug or

alcohol abuse, incompetence in operating a vehicle, or any other allegation that the

employee might pose a danger to others would put heavy pressure on the employer to declare

the employee "unfit" and terminate him. The employer may wish to be objective and fair in

evaluating the truth of the accusation and the severity of the problem, but the rule of

law implicit in this verdict would place a heavy hand on the scale: fire the employee and

risk little, especially if the employer has succeeded in maintaining its workforce "at

will"; but retain the employee (even on conditions designed to address the alleged

unfitness) and run the risk that if someone is injured by that employee, the employer will

be hit for large punitive damages"for which, of course, there can be no insurance

protection. See Ins. Code Section 533; Stonewall Surplus Lines Ins. Co. v. Johnson

Controls, Inc., 14 Cal. App. 4th 637, 642-43 (1993). 

<P>

3. An Employee Is "Unfit," Imposing On The Employer A Duty To 

<P>

Terminate The Employment, Only When The Employer Has 

<P>

Advance Knowledge Of Highly Reliable Information That The 

<P>

Employee Is Incapable Of Being Assisted By Corrective Measures 

<P>

And Creates A High Degree Of Foreseeability Of Serious Future 

<P>

Harm.

<P>

Given the Hobson's choice faced by employers in this situation, and the consequences for

employee job security that would result from a low threshold for the duty-to-fire under

Section 3294(b)[i], when should an absolute duty to terminate, the breach of which is

punishable by punitive damages, be found to exist? In other words, when must an employer

find an employee to be "unfit" for any further presence in the workplace? 

<P>

Over the last fifteen years the Legislature has repeatedly "made it more difficult for

plaintiffs to plead and prove [punitive damage] claims." College Hospital, 8 Cal. 4th at

712. Given this history, and the consequences of an unduly low threshold for the

duty-to-fire under Section 3294(b)[i], an appropriate interpretation of the statute must

have two critical features. 

<P>

First, because the statute requires "advance knowledge" of the employee's unfitness and

"conscious disregard" of the danger to others that would be posed by retention of the

employee, the duty to terminate should be found to exist only when the employer has actual

knowledge of "particularized information" (Pamela W., 25 Cal. App. 4th at 959 (emphasis

added)) concerning the employee's past misconduct that is highly credible and reliable.

See id. at 957, 959 ("the emphasis must be on the specific, rather than more general

facts; 'a "high degree of foreseeability is required"' to find existence of duty"); see

also Ann M., 6 Cal. 4th at 678-80 (finding no duty to hire security guards where violent

criminal assaults not "sufficiently foreseeable" and "social costs of imposing a duty"

significant); Sturgeon v. Curnutt, 29 Cal. App. 4th 301, 306-07 (1994). Facts the employer

merely could or should have known are doubtless pertinent to a claim for compensatory

damages based on negligence, or one under FEHA for failure to take "all reasonable steps"

to have prevented the alleged harassment, but cannot support holding the employer liable

for punitive damages when it did not actually have such knowledge. 

<P>

Second, the statute penalizes only the failure to have terminated an employee known to be

"unfit." Civ. Code Section 3294(b)[i]. Many employees have behavioral problems of one kind

or another. But not every employee with a behavioral problem is a hopeless case, beyond

redemption and thus fit only for termination. Employers should be encouraged to take all

reasonable steps to discipline errant employees and to correct their behavioral problems.

The term "unfit" as used in Section 3294(b)[i] thus distinguishes between employees who

can be assisted and redeemed, and those who are beyond rehabilitation. An employer should

not be liable for punitive damages merely for having failed to take more effective

prophylactic measures short of terminating an employee with potentially correctable

behavioral problems, such as referring him sooner to counseling, imposing closer

supervision, or taking other measures progressively tailored to the circumstances. Again,

failure to take appropriate steps less drastic than termination of such an employee could

be the basis for a claim for compensatory damages under FEHA or for negligence. See p. 17,

supra. But punitive damages may not be awarded unless the employer knew the employee was

"unfit""i.e., incapable of being assisted by any corrective or rehabilitative measures,

and creating a risk of serious future harm with a "high degree of foreseeability." Ann M.,

6 Cal. 4th at 680. In that circumstance, but only in that circumstance, an employer who

fails to terminate the "unfit" employee can be said to have acted with "conscious

disregard of the rights or safety of others" (Civ. Code Section 3294(b)[i]) and thus may

be held liable for punitive damages. 

<P>

The issue for de novo determination, then, is whether as of July 1991, Baker was on notice

that Martin Greenstein's behavioral problems created so high a degree of foreseeability of

serious future harm that no steps short of termination would be sufficient to correct his

behavioral problems. In other words, was the information known to Baker's "managing

agents" prior to July 1991 sufficiently particularized and reliable to impose upon Baker

an absolute duty to terminate Greenstein that, if breached, would support imposition of

punitive damages? For the reasons explained below, the information available to Baker did

not rise to this standard. In addressing this question, we of course accept the strictures

applicable to appellate review of an unfavorable verdict. Thus we do not seek

redetermination of the historical facts necessarily or impliedly found by the jury, so

long as those facts are supported by legally sufficient evidence.  

<P>

4. The Information Baker Had Received About Greenstein Prior To 

<P>

July 1991 Did Not Impose Upon Baker A Legal Duty To Fire Him. 

<P>

There was substantial evidence that, prior to July 1991, there were reports to various

Baker managers at various times over a four-year period that Greenstein had tickled one

employee's foot, had touched another employee on the shoulder, back or hip more familiarly

than social convention dictated, and had made tasteless and inappropriate remarks of an

intimate or personal nature to several other employees. (Other incidents that may have

occurred were reported in extremely general and impersonal terms, or were not known to

Baker management at all until after this lawsuit was filed.) Almost all of the reports of

objectionable behavior that reached Baker prior to Plaintiff's employment in July 1991

were verbal conduct. From what Baker actually knew, only Melinda Faier (foot-tickling) and

Vicky Gardiner (brief touches on her shoulder, back, or hip) reported physical contact by

Greenstein; that physical conduct, while unwelcome, was typically ambiguous (that is, not

overtly sexual) and was never forcible or directed to intimate parts of the body.

Significantly, several of the complaints or reports of which Baker did learn were made by

women who did not want to pursue their complaints (e.g., Haydock-Davis, Blow, and

Gardiner), or who asked that their names not be used in connection with the matter (e.g.,

Gardiner). Others (e.g., Zahn) made no complaint to Baker at all. 

<P>

Moreover, each time he was confronted with allegations of inappropriate conduct,

Greenstein denied them. See notes 18-20, supra. Under these circumstances, it is clear

that any firm, but particularly a partnership, would have had difficulty terminating

Greenstein (who was an equity partner, with contractual and common- law rights of his own)

without facing a serious threat of a claim of wrongful termination, breach of the

partnership agreement or breach of Baker's fiduciary duty to its partner. See generally

Page v. Page, 55 Cal. 2d 192, 197 (1961) (discussing partners' duties). 

<P>

We reiterate that we make no excuse for Mr. Greenstein, whose conduct prior to Plaintiff's

employment was boorish and adolescent. Nor was Baker's response to the incidents of which

it did learn as organized or as focused as it should have been. The various Baker managers

who learned of some of these incidents should have investigated more thoroughly,

communicated with one another more effectively, and responded with more forceful

disciplinary measures. 

<P>

But the issue before the Court today is not whether Baker should have gathered or

processed the available information more effectively or imposed sanctions short of

termination. The question is whether Baker was required (on pain of punitive damages) to

declare him "unfit" and banish him from the workplace. As we now show, the jury's verdict

for punitive damages against Baker"based as it must be on the proposition that Baker had

an unequivocal duty to fire Greenstein"cannot stand. 

<P>

a. A Recent Decision Of The California Supreme Court Makes 

<P>

Clear That Baker's Knowledge Of Greenstein's Behavior Prior 

<P>

To Plaintiff's Employment Was Insufficient To Trigger A Legal 

<P>

Duty Requiring Baker To Declare Greenstein "Unfit" And Fire 

<P>

Him.

<P>

The issue which Section 3294(b)[i] starkly puts to employers"must an employee be declared

unfit for any continued presence in the workplace and therefore fired?" is the kind of

question that judges and administrative tribunals face every day. Judges in criminal cases

decide between probation and penal sentences. Administrative bodies and courts decide

whether a particular record of misconduct warrants disbarment or suspension of a medical

or other professional licensee. 

<P>

Suppose the evidence of Greenstein's behavior known to Baker prior to July 1991 (when

Plaintiff was first employed at Baker) had been presented to a judge at that time. Even if

the truthfulness of the complaints had been verified after a hearing, no judge would have

concluded that only termination would suffice and declared Greenstein irredeemably unfit.

Similarly, no judge would have required that Greenstein be fired and (as a practical

matter) rendered unemployable. 

<P>

The Supreme Court's recent decision in Fitch v. Commission on Judicial Performance, 9 Cal.

4th 552 (1995), dramatically underscores this conclusion. Judge Fitch serves on the

Superior Court in Fresno. The Commission on Judicial Performance found that he had engaged

in a longstanding pattern of misconduct toward female members of the court's staff,

including eighteen separate acts of misconduct involving nine complaining witnesses. Id.

at 554. The Commission's findings, which the Supreme Court found "supported by clear and

convincing evidence" (id. at 557), included the following over a four-year period: 

<P>

-- Remarks on several occasions concerning women's physical attributes, including their

buttocks, breasts or legs. For example, Judge Fitch told a court reporter, "Your butt

looks good in that dress." Id. at 556. 

<P>

--  Remarks on several occasions to female employees concerning their intimate

relationships with their spouses. For example, Judge Fitch said to another court reporter,

after she turned away from his attempt to console her, "I certainly hope you're not that

frigid at home with your husband." Id. 

<P>

--  Other crude and offensive remarks in the presence of court staff. For example, in

discussing a janitor, Judge Fitch "jokingly told a female court reporter that, 'The only

thing he's ever done to me is go down on me a couple of times.'" Id. at 556-57. 

<P>

-- Inappropriate and nonconsensual touching of women working under his supervision, such

as slapping or patting a court reporter and a court trainee on their buttocks. Id. at 557.



<P>

Based on these incidents, each proved by clear and convincing evidence, the Commission on

Judicial Performance did not determine that Judge Fitch should be removed from office.

Instead it concluded that he should be publicly censured. The Supreme Court agreed,

deciding that "[t]his opinion will serve as appropriate censure." Id. at 558. 

<P>

Taking the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict in this case, the conduct

in which Judge Fitch was found to have engaged was even more objectionable, and at least

as repetitive, as what Greenstein was accused of before Plaintiff entered Baker's employ

in July 1991. Yet even after that conduct was fully proved by clear and convincing

evidence, the Commission on Judicial Performance and the California Supreme Court agreed

that public censure was an adequate response. Moreover, the Commission and the Supreme

Court are, of necessity, concerned not only with a penalty appropriately measured by the

wrong committed, but also with public respect for the judiciary and the law under a

standard authorizing removal of a judge for conduct that "brings the judicial office into

disrepute." Cal. Const. art. VI,  18(c) (quoted in Fitch, 9 Cal. 4th at 554). This

additional and powerful spur to action is obviously absent in this case. 

<P>

Of course, neither the Commission nor the Supreme Court condoned Judge Fitch's behavior.

But each concluded that public censure rather than termination was a sufficient response.

In light of the Supreme Court's decision that public censure is an appropriate remedy for

sexual harassment proved to have been committed by a judge, a private-sector employer

plainly has no absolute duty to fire an employee who is only accused of (and who has

denied) comparable or less egregious misconduct. 

<P>

b. The Testimony Of Plaintiff's Own Expert At Trial Shows That 

<P>

Baker Had No Absolute Duty To Have Terminated Greenstein. 

<P>

Plaintiff's own expert never expressed the opinion that Baker should have terminated

Greenstein prior to the time he harassed Plaintiff, let alone that Baker had an absolute

duty to do so. The expert, Mary Roberts, gave extensive testimony on whether Baker had

taken "all reasonable steps" in response to the harassment reported to Baker prior to July

1991. She stated that at the time of the foot-tickling incident, Baker might have

"discussed" with Greenstein the "ramifications if in fact he were to engage in . . include

serious disciplinary action up to and including discharge." RT 1722-23. On direct

examination by Plaintiff's counsel, Roberts was asked: 

<P>

"Q.Do you have an opinion as to whether, in late 1990, looking at all the 

<P>

incidents and assuming the facts that I have told you that a reasonable 

<P>

employer would have sought Mr. Greenstein's voluntary termination as a 

<P>

partner?

<P>

"A.I don't know if a reasonable employer would have sought his termination 

<P>

at that point in time. A reasonable employer would have acted so much 

<P>

earlier in this chain of events.

<P>

"A reasonable employer would have put Mr. Greenstein on notice that his 

<P>

job could be in jeopardy if he were to continue to engage in this kind of 

<P>

inappropriate conduct.

<P>

"From what the facts are that I am supposed to assume, it appears that that 

<P>

kind of clear communication never occurred. 

<P>

"Q.If Baker McKenzie had earlier put Mr. Greenstein on notice of his 

<P>

misbehavior in the form that you have suggested, would a reasonable 

<P>

employer in the fall of 1990 after the last incident with Vicky Gard[i]ner 

<P>

and Twila Carlsen, would a reasonable employer have sought Mr. 

<P>

Greenstein's voluntary termination from the firm? 

<P>

"A.In my opinion a reasonable employer would have given very serious 

<P>

consideration to seeking his removal from the firm." (RT 1742-43) 

<P>

Notably, Roberts testified on cross-examination that, at least at the time of her

deposition before trial, she had only once, in thirteen years as an attorney counseling

employers, recommended termination of an employee accused of sexual harassment, and that

case had involved "a threat that if the individual did not engage in sexual intercourse

her job would be affected." RT 1763-64. 

<P>

The fact that Plaintiff's own expert did not testify that termination was the only

reasonable step that Baker could have taken prior to July 1991 strongly supports the

conclusion that Baker did not have a legal duty to terminate Greenstein before Plaintiff

was hired by Baker. 

<P>

B. The Evidence Does Not Support A Finding Of Ratification As That 

<P>





Term Is Defined In Civil Code Section 3294(b) And College Hospital. 

<P>

In a punitive damages case, where the trier of fact was required to apply the clear and

convincing evidence standard, a reviewing court must determine whether substantial

evidence supports the verdict "with [the] higher burden [of clear and convincing evidence]

in mind" (Hoch v. Allied-Signal, Inc., 24 Cal. App. 4th 48, 59 (1994)), and must overturn

the verdict "when no reasonable jury could find the plaintiff's evidence to be clear and

convincing proof of" the essential facts. Id. at 60- 61; see also note 10, supra. On this

record no reasonable jury could have found clear and convincing evidence that Baker

"ratified" Greenstein's sexual harassment of Plaintiff. 

<P>

Section 3294(b)[ii] provides that an employer may be liable for punitive damages "based

upon acts of an employee" if the employer "ratified the wrongful conduct for which the

damages are awarded." (Emphasis added). The court instructed the jury that: 

<P>

"Ratification means that Martin Greenstein's conduct toward the plaintiff 

<P>

was adopted or approved by a managing agent of Baker McKenzie, with 

<P>

knowledge of the oppressive or malicious character of such conduct." 

<P>

(RT 3547 (emphasis added));

<P>

This instruction, based on established California law, reflects three key elements of

ratification. First, the statute itself is unambiguous, and the instructions to the jury

made clear, the employer must have "adopted or approved" the conduct of the employee

toward the plaintiff"not other conduct of the employee. Hence, a finding of ratification

could not be based on Baker's knowledge of, or views toward, Greenstein's prior conduct

towards other women at Baker. 

<P>

Second, the employer's adoption or approval of the employee's conduct "requires actual

knowledge of the conduct and its outrageous nature." College Hospital, 8 Cal. 4th at 726

(emphasis added); see 2 B. Witkin, Summary of California Law, Agency and Employment  89 at

89 (9th ed. 1987) ("the acquiescence or acceptance of benefits must be with full knowledge

of the material facts"). 

<P>

Third, the employer must have "demonstrated an intent to adopt or approve oppressive,

fraudulent, or malicious behavior by an employee." College Hospital, 8 Cal. 4th at 726

(emphasis added); see Hale v. Farmers Ins. Exch., 42 Cal. App. 3d 681, 691-92 (1975),

disapproved on other grounds, Egan v. Mutual of Omaha Ins. Co., 24 Cal. 3d 809, 822 n.5

(1979) (ratification requires evidence "which convincingly shows the intention of the

principal to adopt or approve the act in question"). 

<P>

Thus Plaintiff had to show that Baker knew of, and intended to adopt or approve,

Greenstein's sexual harassment of Plaintiff. But, as we now show, the jury could not

properly have found Plaintiff's evidence to be clear and convincing proof that Baker knew

that Greenstein had harassed her in an outrageous manner, let alone that Baker

intentionally adopted or approved of that misconduct. 

<P>

1. In The Period Prior To Greenstein's Forced Withdrawal From The 

<P>

Firm, Baker Did Not Know Whether Plaintiff's Allegations That 

<P>

Greenstein Had Sexually Harassed Her Were True. 

<P>

When Plaintiff complained to Baker that Greenstein had sexually harassed her, Greenstein

denied any misconduct. He continued to deny Plaintiff's charges even after he was

compelled to resign from the firm and thereafter throughout trial. RT 877-78, 928,

1141-43, 1169, 1302-05, 1611-12, 1615. At the time, then, Baker was faced with sharply

conflicting accounts of the key events. Moreover, Baker knew of no supporting witness to

any of the alleged harassment of Plaintiff. It was simply Plaintiff's word against

Greenstein's. 

<P>

To be sure, in the past other female employees had made complaints about Greenstein. But

employers are not required (and arguably are not even permitted) to apply a "where there's

smoke there's fire" standard. None of the prior complaints had involved conduct remotely

as egregious as the forced and blatantly sexual touching Plaintiff alleged at trial; and

at the time of Plaintiff's complaint, none of the prior accusations had been verified by

Baker or by any impartial tribunal. Moreover, even if one or more of the prior accusations

had been authoritatively determined to be true"and none had been"that would not have put

Baker on notice of the truth of Plaintiff's far more serious accusations. After all,

"evidence of specific instances of [a person's] conduct is inadmissible when offered to

prove his or her conduct on a specified occasion." Evid. Code  1101(a). 

<P>

Plaintiff may respond by pointing to evidence that Baker's investigation of Plaintiff's

accusations was inadequate or insufficiently documented. But Baker's arguably negligent

failure to determine the truth of Plaintiff's accusations against Greenstein is one thing,

and actual knowledge that those accusations were indeed true is quite another. Proof that

Baker could have done a better job investigating Plaintiff's accusations simply does not

establish that Baker knew that those allegations were true. 

<P>

In short, no managing agent had actual, reliable knowledge of Greenstein's harassment of

Plaintiff. As in College Hospital, Greenstein denied the allegations "and there is no

indication that [Baker] had personal knowledge to the contrary." College Hospital, 8 Cal.

4th at 727; see Rakestraw v. Rodrigues, 8 Cal. 3d 67, 73 (1972) (ratification cannot occur

where the "act of adoption [of the agent's act] . . . is done only . . . because of . . .

misrepresentation by the agent"). Without actual knowledge of Greenstein's wrongful

conduct, Baker could not have adopted or approved it. 

<P>

2. Baker Did Not Knowingly Adopt Or Approve Of Greenstein's Sexual 

<P>

Harassment Of Plaintiff.

<P>

There may still be employers in California that remain institutionally insensitive to the

concerns of female employees about sexual misconduct by male co-workers or executives.

Baker & McKenzie is not one of them. Its written policy on sexual harassment, in force at

the time of Plaintiff's employment, provided: 

<P>

"Baker & McKenzie is committed to maintaining a work environment that 

<P>

is free from sexual harassment, in any form, including both verbal and 

<P>

physical harassment and abuse. Partners, Associates, Legal Assistants and 

<P>

Staff Members who engage in sexual harassment will be subject to 

<P>

disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment." (16 AA 4549) 

<P>

The policy also provided that an employee who believed he or she was subject to harassment

should report the alleged behavior to the administration of the firm as soon as possible,

that an investigation would be "undertaken as soon as possible," and that "[i]f, after

appropriate investigation, it is determined that there is a significant basis to believe"

the harassment occurred, appropriate disciplinary action would be taken. Id. 

<P>

When Plaintiff complained about Greenstein's conduct, Baker took the following steps: 

<P>

-- Mary Contreras spoke with Peter Astiz (a member of the administrative committee of

Baker's San Francisco and Palo Alto offices) and Howard Fine (another partner in Baker's

San Francisco office) the same day Plaintiff complained and told them of Plaintiff's

allegations. RT 624-25, 869, 1478-79;see 16 AA 4513. 

<P>

--  Contreras immediately gave Plaintiff time off with pay, in part so that Contreras

could investigate the allegations. RT 625, 918-19, 2121, 2136-37; see 16 AA 4513. 

<P>

--  Within days, Contreras, Astiz and Fine spoke with William Atkin and Bruce Jackson, the

other two members of the administrative committee. It was agreed that Contreras would

immediately transfer Plaintiff so she would no longer have to work with Greenstein. RT

634, 652, 870-72, 926, 929; see RT 1307; 16 AA 4515. 

<P>

-- On instructions from the committee members, Contreras began an investigation by

speaking the next business day with two other women in Baker's Palo Alto office (one of

whom Plaintiff had suggested to Contreras) about Plaintiff's complaint. RT 628, 733-36,

872, 925, 1608-10, 1652; 16 AA 4548. 

<P>

--  William Atkin and Peter Astiz promptly met with Greenstein about Plaintiff's

complaint, discussing Plaintiff's allegations with him. RT 877, 927-28, 1302-03, 1611-12.

Greenstein categorically denied them. RT 877-78, 928, 1170, 1304-05, 1559, 1611-13, 1615.

Nonetheless, the administrative committee required that he attend (and personally pay for)

appropriate sexual harassment sensitivity counseling with psychologist Trisha Brinkman. RT

887, 929-34, 1308, 1381, 1481, 1610-12, 1614. She reported to Baker that the counseling

was "successful" and that there was no "immediate need for additional training. " 16 AA

4554; see RT 912-14, 940, 944, 1380-81, 1607. 

<P>

These actions were the antithesis of approval by Baker of Greenstein's sexual harassment

of Plaintiff. No reasonable juror could have found otherwise. 

<P>

The Supreme Court's recent decision in College Hospital v. Superior Court is squarely on

point and compels the conclusion that the evidence here cannot support ratification. In

College Hospital, the plaintiff claimed that the defendant hospital's administrator,

Westbrook, had ratified accused employee Berry's misconduct because Westbrook (a) knew

about Berry's relationship with plaintiff; (b) knew about Berry's prior sexual

relationship with another patient; (c) failed adequately to investigate plaintiff's

allegations; and (d) failed to discipline Berry. The Court of Appeal had accepted that

analysis. The Supreme Court reversed: 

<P>

"Under no view of the . . . evidence . . . can Westbrook's conduct be 

<P>

characterized as ratification. As noted above, plaintiffs have presented no 

<P>

evidence that Westbrook knew about the relationship's allegedly sexual or 

<P>

harmful nature. Berry denied any contact with [plaintiff], and there is no 

<P>

indication that Westbrook had personal knowledge to the contrary. By 

<P>

cautioning Berry against patient involvement, Westbrook attempted to 

<P>

repudiate"not adopt"such conduct on the Hospital's behalf. Thus, as a 

<P>

matter of law, plaintiffs have failed to state or substantiate a claim that 

<P>

Westbrook knowingly approved Berry's 'manipulative' relationship with 

<P>

[plaintiff]. Accordingly . . . no basis appears for assessing punitive  

<P>

damages against the Hospital based on malicious or oppressive acts of its 

<P>

employees." (College Hospital, 8 Cal. 4th at 726-27 (emphasis added)) 

<P>

College Hospital is on all fours with this case. There, as here, (1) the managing officer

knew of the accusation of sexual misconduct; (2) the accused employee denied to the

managing officer that the accusation was true; and (3) the managing officer told the

employee that such conduct, if it had occurred, was improper. Thus in the present case, as

in College Hospital, "[b]y cautioning [Greenstein] against [such] involvement, [Baker]

attempted to repudiate"not adopt"such conduct." Id. Indeed, the facts of the present case

include additional steps taken by Baker and not present in College Hospital that even more

clearly reflect the employer's "attempt[] to repudiate"not adopt" the alleged misconduct:

Upon learning of her accusation about Greenstein, Baker immediately gave Plaintiff time

off from work (with pay), reassigned her so that she would not have to work with

Greenstein in the future, and required Greenstein to obtain appropriate counseling even

though he flatly and repeatedly denied Plaintiff's allegations. Baker's actions cannot be

interpreted as approving the misconduct alleged by Plaintiff. See Stewart v. Truck Ins.

Exch., 17 Cal. App. 4th 468, 483 (1993) ("While [employer's] investigation could possibly

have been pursued with more vigor, it was nonetheless pursued, not ignored"). 

<P>

3. Baker Cannot Have Ratified Greenstein's Harassment Of Plaintiff 

<P>

Because That Conduct Was Not Within The Scope Of Greenstein's 

<P>

Employment And Was Not For Baker's Benefit. 

<P>

The Supreme Court's recent decision in Farmers Insurance Group v. County of Santa Clara,

11 Cal. 4th 992 (1995), lends further support to the conclusion that Baker's conduct did

not"and could not"ratify Greenstein's harassment of Plaintiff. "'[R]atification depends

upon . . . whether the act was originally intended to be done to the use or for the

benefit of the party who is afterwards said to have ratified it.'" Sullivan v. People's

Ice Corp., 92 Cal. App. 740, 746 (1928) (citation omitted); accord, Quay v. Presidio &

F.R. Co., 82 Cal. 1, 6 (1889) (no ratification "for the principal received no benefit from

the act of his agent"); Schweitzer v. Bank of America, 42 Cal. App. 2d 536, 542 (1941)

("ratification can occur only by approving the act of the agent after the agent performs

openly on behalf of his principal and not for himself"); Spahn v. Guild Indus. Corp., 94

Cal. App. 3d 143, 157 (1979) ("principal ratifies an agent's acts when he knows of the

acts, and accepts the benefits which flow from them"). In Farmers, the Supreme Court held

that an employer is not vicariously liable for sexual harassment of one employee by

another because sexual harassment is not within the scope of employment, and does not

arise "from the conduct of the employer's enterprise." 11 Cal. 4th at 1006; accord, Lisa

M. v. Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial Hosp., 12 Cal. 4th 291, 301-02 (1995) ("Our conclusion

does not rest on mechanical application of a motivation-to-serve test . . . . [The

employee's] personal motivations were not generated by or an outgrowth of workplace

responsibilities, conditions or events"). Under Farmers, then, Greenstein's harassing

conduct toward Plaintiff could not, and did not, serve any of Baker's interests. See 11

Cal. 4th at 1005-1007. Because Greenstein's behavior was not on Baker's behalf or for its

benefit, there was no "benefit" to Baker from the harassment that Baker could have

accepted. Thus as a matter of law there was no basis on which Baker could have "ratified"

the conduct. 

<P>

4. Baker's Continuation Of Greenstein's Status As A Partner After 

<P>

Plaintiff's Complaint Did Not Constitute Approval Of The 

<P>

Misconduct She Had Alleged.

<P>

Plaintiff first complained to Baker of Greenstein's behavior in August 1991. As noted,

Greenstein denied her allegations of harassment. Baker was uncertain as to whether

Plaintiff's accusations were untrue and, although it relieved her of any work relationship

with Greenstein and required him to undergo counseling, it did not immediately expel

Greenstein from the partnership. 

<P>

While the wisdom of continuing Greenstein's partnership and employment as long as Baker

did can be debated, as a matter of law it did not constitute ratification of the sexual

harassment of Plaintiff that Greenstein denied at the time. It has long been the rule in

California that: 

<P>

"the omission to dispense with the services of the offender, standing by 

<P>

itself and unsupported by any other circumstances indicating the  

<P>

employer's approval of his course, is never sufficient to establish 

<P>

ratification." (Edmunds v. Atchison, T. & S.F. Ry. Co., 174 Cal. 246, 249 (1917) (emphasis

added)) To be sure, "failure to discharge such agent may be evidence tending to show

ratification" (id.), and several cases have suggested that "failure to discharge an agent

guilty of oppressive acts toward patrons of the employer is in itself evidence to show

ratification." McChristian v. Popkin, 75 Cal. App. 2d 249, 256 (1946); accord, Coats v.

Construction & Gen. Laborers Local 185, 15 Cal. App. 3d 908, 914 (1971). But the

California courts have made clear that the simple fact of continued employment, by itself,

is insufficient evidence of ratification. As the court explained in Coats: 

<P>

"While maintaining a wrongdoer employee in the service of the employer 

<P>

standing alone, does not make the employer liable, it indicates the 

<P>

employer's approval of the employee's course and with other acts will 

<P>

make the employer liable in punitive damages." (15 Cal. App. 3d at 915 

<P>

(emphasis added))

<P>

Here, Baker had investigated Plaintiff's allegations and Greenstein's denial, and could

reach no firm conclusion as to the truth of the matter. See Part I(B)(1), supra. It

deplored the conduct alleged, relieved Plaintiff from any further work assignments with

Greenstein, and required Greenstein to undergo counseling. See Part I(B)(2), supra. Its

conduct in this regard cannot possibly be clear and convincing evidence that Baker adopted

or approved the behavior alleged by Plaintiff. 

<P>

5. Baker's Defense Of This Lawsuit, And Its Earlier Responses To The 

<P>

EEOC, Are Covered By The "Litigation Privilege" And In Any Event 

<P>

Do Not Constitute Ratification Of Greenstein's Conduct. 

<P>

Plaintiff argued below that Baker's assertedly incomplete or inaccurate discovery

responses regarding the firm's knowledge of complaints about Greenstein prior to the

incidents involving Plaintiff, both in this litigation and in response to requests of the

federal EEOC for information, constituted ratification of Greenstein's harassment of

Plaintiff. In particular, Plaintiff argued at trial that Baker had engaged in a "cover-up"

of Greenstein's prior harassment of other female employees in the Chicago office several

years before Plaintiff was hired. RT 3221, 3256, 3306, 3339, 3343, 3345, 3346, 3506, 3511.

Plaintiff also argued that Baker's defense of this lawsuit through trial was itself

ratification of Greenstein's harassment of Plaintiff; indeed, Plaintiff's counsel argued

to the jury in closing argument that Baker's ratification of Greenstein's acts was "still

going on now" because the firm was defending itself in the case. RT 3523. Again, Plaintiff

is wrong as a matter of law. 

<P>

a. Baker's Defense Of This Case And The Prior EEOC Proceeding 

<P>

Are Protected By The Statutory "Litigation Privilege." 

<P>

Baker's defense of this lawsuit and the EEOC investigation that preceded it could not have

constituted ratification of Greenstein's sexual harassment of Plaintiff. Baker's conduct

in these proceedings was absolutely privileged. Civil Code Section 47(b), which codifies

what is commonly referred to as the "litigation privilege," provides that "[a] privileged

publication or broadcast is one made: . . . (b) In any . . . (2) judicial proceeding, or

(3) in any other official proceeding authorized by law. . . ." The "privilege is now held

applicable to any communication, whether or not it amounts to a publication, and all torts

except malicious prosecution." Silberg v. Anderson, 50 Cal. 3d 205, 212 (1990) "[T]he

privilege applies to any communication (1) made in judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings;

(2) by litigants or other participants authorized by law; (3) to achieve the objects of

the litigation; and (4) that have some connection or logical relation to the action." Id. 

<P>

These requirements are plainly met here: Baker's statements and positions were made in

this litigation or to the EEOC, which obviously were "judicial or quasi-judicial

proceedings." See id. at 213 ("courts have applied the privilege to eliminate the threat

of liability for communications made during all kinds of truth-seeking proceedings:

judicial, quasi-judicial, legislative and other official proceedings"); Rubin v. Green, 4

Cal. 4th 1187, 1194 (1993) (discussing range of privileged communications). Baker was a

party to both these proceedings, and the communications were made as an integral part of

them. Baker's defense of this lawsuit and the EEOC investigation thus cannot be the basis

of liability for punitive damages because Section 47(b) "operates as a limitation on

liability," and an "'immunity' from suit." Moore v. Conliffe, 7 Cal. 4th 634, 638 n.1

(1994) (citations omitted, emphasis in original). 

<P>

This rule is essential in any system that depends on litigation to determine the truth.

Were it otherwise, every time an employer attempted to defend itself from punitive damages

in a lawsuit based on the alleged acts of an employee, a jury could find that the employer

ratified the alleged misconduct. Section 47(b) precludes this result. In Palmer v. Ted

Stevens Honda, Inc., 193 Cal. App. 3d 530 (1987), for example, the plaintiff had

introduced evidence of the defendant's litigation tactics, and the costs they had imposed

on plaintiff, and argued that these tactics supported awarding punitive damages. Id. at

535, 537, 540. Relying on Section 47(b), the Court of Appeal held that a defendant's

litigation tactics are an improper basis for punitive damages, concluding that "once

litigation has commenced, the actions taken in its defense are not, in our view, probative

of whether defendant in bad faith denied the contractual obligation prior to the lawsuit."

Id. at 539; see id. at 537-40; see also Thompson v. California Fair Plan Ass'n, 221 Cal.

App. 3d 760, 766 (1990) ("opposition to the prior lawsuit, by itself, is within the

privilege"). Similarly here, Baker's positions before the EEOC or in this litigation

cannot serve as a basis for a finding of ratification. 

<P>

b. The Conduct On Which Plaintiff Relies Does Not Show Baker's 

<P>

"Ratification" Of Greenstein's Acts Toward Plaintiff. 

<P>

Even if Baker's discovery responses in this case and its response to the EEOC's request

for information were not covered by the litigation privilege, Baker's failure to reveal

information that in 1987 and 1988"years before Plaintiff entered Baker's employ"Greenstein

had harassed female employees other than Plaintiff in Baker's Chicago office is not

evidence"let alone substantial evidence"that Baker adopted or approved Greenstein's

harassment of Plaintiff in California several years later. While Plaintiff used this

improper evidence to good effect in inflaming the jury, there simply is no logical

connection between Baker's alleged failure to disclose prior allegations of harassment of

other employees in another office in another state, and Baker's purported adoption or

approval of Greenstein's harassment of Plaintiff at a later time, at a different place and

in a different manner. 

<P>

C. Summary: Because Neither Basis For Punitive Damages Presented To 

<P>

The Jury Was Properly Supported By Substantial Evidence, The Award 

<P>

Of Punitive Damages Against Baker Must Be Reversed. 

<P>

In the Special Verdict Form, the jury was invited to rely on either of two bases,

corresponding to two alternative portions of Civil Code Section 3294(b), for assessing

punitive damages against Baker. In Part I(A), supra, we showed that the evidence could not

support a finding that Baker had a duty to terminate Greenstein. In Part I(B), supra, we

showed that no reasonable jury could have found ratification under Section 3294(b)[ii]

established by clear and convincing evidence. With both of these props knocked out from

under the punitive damages award, it must be reversed. 

<P>

II.

<P>

UNDER SECTIONS 3294(b) AND 3295(d) OF THE CIVIL CODE, 

<P>

BAKER CANNOT BE LIABLE FOR THE $3.5 MILLION 

<P>

IN PUNITIVE DAMAGES ASSESSED BASED ON BAKER'S 

<P>

FINANCIAL CONDITION BECAUSE THE JURY DID NOT FIND 

<P>

BAKER ITSELF GUILTY OF "OPPRESSION, FRAUD, OR MALICE." 

<P>

Even if the Court were to reject the arguments in Part I, it would be required to reduce

the award of punitive damages against Baker from $3.5 million to $225,000, the same amount

the jury assessed against Greenstein. That is because, as we now show, absent a finding of

oppression, fraud or malice, an employer's vicarious "liabil[ity] for [punitive] damages

based upon acts of an employee of the employer" (Civ. Code Section 3294(b)) is not to be

independently determined upon an evaluation of the employer's conduct and financial

condition, but is simply the amount of punitive damages assessed against the primary

wrongdoer, for which the employer is vicariously"and hence jointly and severally"liable.

Like the issues discussed in Part I(A), supra, the amount of punitive damages in the

absence of a finding of oppression, fraud, or malice appears to be an issue of first

impression. 

<P>

A. An Employer May Not Be Held Directly Liable For Punitive Damages 

<P>

Based On Evidence Of Its Own Financial Condition Unless The Jury 

<P>

Finds The Employer Itself Guilty Of "Oppression, Fraud, Or Malice." 

<P>

1. Civil Code Section 3294(a) Requires That Any Direct Personal 

<P>

Liability For Punitive Damages Be Based On A Finding Of 

<P>

"Oppression, Fraud, Or Malice" On The Part Of The Defendant To 

<P>

Be Punished.

<P>

Civil Code Section 3294(a) states the basic rule governing when a defendant may be held

directly liable for punitive damages: 

<P>

"In an action for the breach of an obligation not arising from contract, 

<P>

where it is proven by clear and convincing evidence that the defendant has 

<P>

been guilty of oppression, fraud, or malice, the plaintiff, in addition to 

<P>

the actual damages, may recover damages for the sake of example and by 

<P>

way of punishing the defendant." (Civ. Code Section 3294(a)) 

<P>

Section 3294(a) "codifies the universally recognized principle that '[t]he law does not

favor punitive damages and they should be granted with the greatest caution.'" Dyna-Med,

Inc. v. Fair Employment & Housing Comm'n, 43 Cal. 3d 1379, 1392 (1987). By its plain

terms, Section 3294(a) restricts the direct imposition of punitive damages to situations

in which the factfinder has determined, by clear and convincing evidence, that the

defendant's own conduct has met the stringent standards of culpability"oppression, fraud

or malice"the statute has defined. See Civ. Code Section 3294(c) (defining "oppression"

and "malice"). As the Supreme Court explained in College Hospital: 

<P>

"The basic elements of [punitive damage] claims are set forth in Civil 

<P>

Code Section 3294. . . . [T]here must be proof of 'oppression, fraud, or 

<P>

malice.' [Civ. Code Section 3294(a).] Moreover, the punishable acts 

<P>

which fall into these categories are strictly defined. Each involves 

<P>

'intentional,' 'willful,' or 'conscious' wrongdoing of a 'despicable' or 

<P>

'injur[ious]' nature." (8 Cal. 4th at 721 (emphasis added)) 

<P>

That a finding of oppression, fraud or malice is the sine qua non of direct liability for

punitive damages under Section 3294(a) is confirmed by Section 3295(d) of the Civil Code,

which was added in 1987. That provision states: 

<P>

"[i] The court shall, on application of any defendant, preclude the 

<P>

admission of evidence of that defendant's profits or financial condition 

<P>

until after the trier of fact returns a verdict for plaintiff awarding actual 

<P>

damages and finds that a defendant is guilty of malice, oppression, or 

<P>

fraud in accordance with Section 3294. [ii] Evidence of profit and 

<P>

financial condition shall be admissible only as to the defendant or 

<P>

defendants found to be liable to the plaintiff and to be guilty of malice, 

<P>

oppression, or fraud. [iii] Evidence of profit and financial condition shall 

<P>

be presented to the same trier of fact that found for the plaintiff and found 

<P>

one or more defendants guilty of malice, oppression, or fraud." (Civ. Code 

<P>

Section 3295(d) (emphasis added; bracketed subsection numbers added for convenient

reference). 

<P>

Section 3295(d) accomplishes several things. It makes bifurcation mandatory on motion of a

defendant. Id. Section 3295(d)[i]; see Las Palmas Assocs. v. Las Palmas Ctr. Assocs., 235

Cal. App. 3d 1220, 1242 (1991). It also provides that the same factfinder should hear both

trial phases. Id. Section 3295(d)[iii]. And, most important for present purposes, it

provides that for evidence of a defendant's financial condition to be admissible in the

second phase of a trial, that defendant must previously have been "found to be liable to

the plaintiff and to be guilty of malice, oppression, or fraud." Id. Section 3295(d)[ii]

(emphasis added). Because direct liability for punitive damages may not be assessed

against a defendant without evidence of that defendant's financial condition (Adams v.

Murakami, 54 Cal. 3d 105, 110-11 (1991); Tomaselli v. Transamerica Ins. Co., 25 Cal. App.

4th 1269, 1282-84 (1994)), the result is that without a prior finding of "oppression,

fraud, or malice" a defendant cannot be held directly liable for punitive damages based on

its conduct and financial condition. 

<P>

2. Section 3294(b) Defines The Circumstances In Which An Employer 

<P>

Not "Personally Guilty Of Oppression, Fraud, Or Malice" May Be 

<P>

Held Vicariously Liable For The Punitive Damages Assessed 

<P>

Against An Employee Based On That Employee's Conduct And 

<P>

Financial Condition.

<P>

a. Read In Context With The Procedural And Evidentiary 

<P>

Limitations Of Section 3295(d), The Employer Liability 

<P>

Provisions Of Civil Code Section 3294(b) Create Different 

<P>

Measures For Punitive Damages Awards Against Employers 

<P>

Under Different Circumstances.

<P>

Section 3295(d)'s requirement that a finding of "malice, oppression or, fraud" be made

before any defendant may be held directly liable for punitive damages critically informs

construction of Section 3294(b). That statute, which is quoted on pp. 13-14, supra, sets

out three circumstances in which employer may be liable for some punitive damages. Under

Section 3294(b)[iii], if the employer is found by the trier of fact to be "personally

guilty of oppression, fraud, or malice," the employer can be liable for punitive damages.

In that event, the employer is "personally guilty of oppression, fraud, or malice," and it

may be held directly liable for punitive damages under by Section 3294(a). That ground of

liability is inapplicable here because the jury was not asked to find, and did not find,

that Baker was "personally guilty of oppression, fraud or malice." See Part II(B), infra. 

<P>

Even if the employer is not found "personally guilty of oppression, fraud, or malice,"

however, Section 3294(b)[i] provides that the employer may still be vicariously liable for

some measure of punitive damages "based upon acts of an employee" where "the employer had

advance knowledge of the unfitness of the employee and employed him or her with a

conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others." See Part I(A), supra. Section

3294(b)[i] does not require a finding that the defendant be found personally guilty of

oppression, fraud or malice. Nor could it: if such a requirement were implied, it would

render Section 3294(b)[iii] superfluous. 

<P>

There thus is a critical distinction between Sections 3294(a) and 3294(b)[iii], on the one

hand, and Section 3294(b)[i] on the other. To fall within the former, plaintiff must

persuade the trier of fact, by clear and convincing evidence, that the employer's own

conduct was oppressive, fraudulent or malicious. Civ. Code Section 3294(a), (b)[iii]. This

is an extremely high standard, requiring proof either of an intent to injure the plaintiff

or of "despicable" conduct by the defendant. Id. Section 3294(c)(1), (3). This requirement

was defined by the Supreme Court in its recent decision in College Hospital: 

<P>

"[T]he statute's reference to 'despicable' conduct seems to represent a 

<P>

new substantive limitation on punitive damage awards. Used in its 

<P>

ordinary sense, the adjective 'despicable' is a powerful term that refers to 

<P>

circumstances that are 'base,' 'vile,' or 'contemptible.' As amended to 

<P>

include this word, the statute plainly indicates that absent an intent to 

<P>

injure the plaintiff, 'malice' requires more than a 'willful and conscious' 

<P>

disregard of the plaintiffs' interests. The additional component of 

<P>

'despicable conduct' must be found." (8 Cal. 4th at 725 (emphasis added; 

<P>

citations omitted).

<P>

Under Section 3294(b)[i], however, the plaintiff bears a far lighter burden. It need only

persuade the trier of fact that the employer knew of the employee's "unfitness" and, with

conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others, failed to terminate that employee.

The failure to fire an "unfit" employee, while blameworthy, may easily occur without an

actual intent to injure anyone and without engaging in "despicable" conduct. 

<P>

b. Sections 3294(a), 3294(b) And 3295(d) Can Be Harmonized By 

<P>

Interpreting Them To Provide For An Employer's Vicarious 

<P>

Liability For The Amount Of Punitive Damages Assessed 

<P>

Against The Employee Unless The Employer Itself Has Been 

<P>

Found Guilty Of "Oppression, Fraud, Or Malice." 

<P>

Given this distinction between Sections 3294(a) and 3294(b)[iii] on the one hand, and

Section 3294(b)[i] and [ii] on the other, a critical question of interpretation arises:

Section 3294(a) states plainly that punitive damages may be imposed only where "the

defendant has been guilty of oppression, fraud or malice"; and, as we have seen, Section

3295(d)[ii] confirms this by barring evidence of a defendant's financial condition unless

and until that defendant has been found guilty of oppression, fraud or malice. Yet

Sections 3294(b)[i] and [ii] appear to authorize punitive damages against an employer

based on the acts of an employee without a finding that the employer was guilty of

oppression, fraud or malice. And under Section 3295(d)[ii], that must mean that the jury

will not have before it any evidence of the employer's financial condition"evidence which,

under Adams v. Murakami, is the sine qua non of a punitive damages award. 

<P>

Harmonizing these two sets of provisions is not an easy task. Nevertheless, it is a

fundamental requirement that wherever possible, related statutes be interpreted together

and in harmony with one another. Here, the task of statutory harmonization can be

accomplished, and in a manner obedient to the precept that weight and meaning be given to

every word and phrase of the statutes, by recognizing the distinction between direct,

primary liability for punitive damages on the one hand, and vicarious, secondary liability

for damages on the other. Here is how the statutes draw that distinction: 

<P>

Section 3294(a) and Section 3295(d)[ii] provide for direct, primary liability for punitive

damages when the employer itself is found to be personally "guilty of oppression, fraud,

or malice." Only under these circumstances does Section 3295(d)[ii] authorize admission of

evidence about the employer's own financial condition, which is necessary for a punitive

damage award against the employer based on the employer's own financial circumstances. 

<P>

By contrast, when the Plaintiff seeks punitive damages under Section 3294(b)[i] or [ii] on

the ground that the employer has either "authorized or ratified" tortious behavior by its

employee, or has retained an "unfit[]" employee "with a conscious disregard of the rights

or safety of others," the employer's liability could not be direct and primary unless the

employer itself had also been found guilty of the "oppression, fraud, or malice." Rather,

the employer's liability for punitive damages based on this lesser degree of fault would

be vicarious because it would be based on a finding that the employee's acts"not the

employer's"had been malicious, oppressive or fraudulent. 

<P>

But where the law permits the employer to be vicariously liable for punitive damages under

Section 3294(b)[i] or [ii]"i.e., without a finding that the employer itself was guilty of

malice, oppression or fraud"how is the amount of punitive damages to be determined? No

California case appears to address (indeed, even to identify) that question. But logic and

the related provisions of Section 3295(d) do provide an answer. 

<P>

It has long been understood that when a party is derivatively liable under the doctrine of

vicarious liability, the amount of damages it must pay is limited to the amount assessed

against the person for whose conduct it is responsible. See, e.g., Ponce v. Tractor Supply

Co., 29 Cal. App. 3d 500, 505 (1972); Bradford v. Brock, 140 Cal. App. 47, 50-51 (1934);

Daniel v. Jones, 140 Cal. App. 145, 147 (1934); 29 Cal. Jur. 3d, Employer and Employee 

123 at 787 (1986) ("[i]f the judgment against the employer [in a respondeat superior case]

is greater in amount than that rendered against the employee, the former will be reduced

to conform to the latter"). Thus it follows that where an employer is vicariously liable

for punitive damages based not upon its own malicious, fraudulent or oppressive conduct

and intent but, rather, "based upon acts of an employee" (Civ. Code  3294(b)), the

employer's liability is limited to the amount of punitive damages assessed against the

employee. 

<P>

This commonsense conclusion is compelled by Section 3295(d) of the Civil Code, discussed

above. As we have already seen, Section 3295(d)[ii] provides that evidence of a

defendant's financial condition may be admitted only after that defendant has been found

guilty of oppression, fraud or malice. Thus where the plaintiff is proceeding under

Section 3294(b)[i] or [ii]"i.e., seeking punitive damages from an employer based on an

employee's oppressive, fraudulent or malicious acts without claiming oppression, fraud or

malice on the part of the employer"the plaintiff may present evidence of the employee's

financial condition but evidence of the employer's financial condition is inadmissible.

Since Adams v. Murakami holds that a defendant cannot be held directly liable for punitive

damages without sufficient proof by the plaintiff of that defendant's net worth (Adams, 54

Cal. 3d at 110-11), the effect of Section 3295(d)[ii] is that the only party whose net

worth and income may properly be considered by the jury in assessing punitive damages is

the employee's. In that circumstance the jury's determination of the amount of damages

properly imposed on the employee to reflect the reprehensibility of his or her conduct,

and to deter its repetition in light of the employee's financial circumstances, is the

sole basis on which the employer's vicarious liability for punitive damages may be

determined. 

<P>

Our analysis of the punitive damages statutes does not deprive plaintiffs of the

opportunity to recover punitive damages from employers on a direct liability basis,

measured by the reprehensibility of the employer's conduct and taking into account the

employer's financial condition. But to do so, a plaintiff must prove, and the trier of

fact must find by clear and convincing evidence, that the employer's own conduct was

oppressive, fraudulent or malicious as required by Section 3294(a) and defined in Section

3294(c). Such findings have been made on appropriate records. But where the employer's

liability is based on something less than the type of intentionally injurious or

"despicable" behavior by the employer that amounts to oppression, fraud or malice, the

employer's liability for punitive damages will be vicarious and limited to the punitive

damages assessed against its employee. 

<P>

B. The Absence Of A Jury Finding That Baker Was Itself Guilty Of 

<P>

"Malice" Or "Oppression" Precludes Baker's Direct Liability For 

<P>

Punitive Damages Based On Its Own Financial Condition. 

<P>

The jury found that Martin Greenstein had been "guilty of oppression or malice" (7 AA

1777) and imposed upon him punitive damages of $225,000. 7 AA 1786. But the jury made no

such finding of malice or oppression with respect to Baker. Baker explicitly raised this

defect in its post-trial motions. See 8 AA 2237-49. Despite the absence of any jury

finding that Baker was itself guilty of "malice" or "oppression," the trial court declined

to vacate the award of punitive damages. The trial court advanced several reasons for this

decision, each erroneous. 

<P>

1. The Jury Had No Opportunity To, And Did Not, Make Any Finding 

<P>

That Baker Itself Was Guilty Of "Malice" Or "Oppression," Or Of 

<P>

Anything Legally Equivalent That Would Be Sufficient To Support 

<P>

Holding Baker Directly Liable For Punitive Damages. 

<P>

The trial court first asserted that "when the jury instructions are read together with the

jury interrogatory, it is seen that . . 2966. Alternatively, the trial court concluded

that "whether or not the jury made an explicit finding of oppression or malice by Baker,

the findings made by the jury satisfied the requirements of Civil Code section 3294 and

supported an award of punitive damages against Baker in excess of those awarded against

Greenstein." 10 AA 2966. 

<P>

With all respect to the trial judge, the record illustrates nothing of the kind. There can

be no argument about the special verdict: It contains no finding of "oppression" and no

finding of "malice." The judge permitted the jury to award punitive damages against Baker

on the basis of the jury's affirmative answer to Question No. 6, which asked only whether

Plaintiff had proved Baker's liability for punitive damages under Civil Code Section

3294(b)[i] (failure to fire an employee known to be unfit) or [ii] (ratification). See 7

AA 1778. 

<P>

The trial court apparently was of the view that even though the jury made no express

finding of oppression or malice, given the court's instructions to the jury such a finding

could logically be inferred from the findings that the jury did make. 10 AA 2966. The

trial court was in error for two distinct reasons, one factual and one legal. 

<P>

In the first place, the trial court's factual premise was incorrect. Its jury instructions

did not require the jury to find oppression, fraud or malice as a prerequisite for an

affirmative answer to Question No. 6. Indeed, the jury was told just the opposite: that a

finding of ratification or of failure to fire an employee known to be unfit was a

prerequisite to a finding of oppression or malice. And though the instruction told the

jury that it "must decide" whether there was oppression or malice by Baker "in the conduct

on which you base your finding of liability on the part of the law firm" (RT 3546), the

special verdict form provided no opportunity for it to make that finding of oppression or

malice, or to communicate any finding it might have made. 

<P>

The jury was instructed: "With respect to plaintiff's claims against 

<P>

defendant Baker and McKenzie, if you find that plaintiff suffered actual 

<P>

injury, harm or damage caused by sexual harassment, you must decide 

<P>

whether by clear and convincing evidence you find that there was 

<P>

oppression or malice by Baker McKenzie in the conduct on which you 

<P>

base your finding of liability on the part of the law firm. You may find 

<P>

Baker McKenzie guilty of such oppression or malice if, but only if[,] you 

<P>

find by clear and convincing evidence that: 

<P>

"Baker McKenzie had advance[] knowledge of the unfitness of 

<P>

Mr. Greenstein and with a conscious disregard of the rights and safety of 

<P>

others continued to employ him, or Baker McKenzie ratified the conduct 

<P>

of Mr. Greenstein which is found to be oppression or malice." (RT 3547) 

<P>

The trial court's post hoc attempt to salvage this instruction stands it on its head. The

jury was told that it "may find Baker guilty of malice or oppression if, but only if," it

first found either knowledge and conscious disregard of unfitness or ratification. The

trial court's later assertion that this jury had to find oppression or malice before it

could find liability under Civil Code Section 3294(b)[i] or [ii] was flatly incorrect. 

<P>

Moreover, the jury was not"and could not properly have been"instructed that knowledge and

conscious disregard of unfitness (or ratification) is the same thing as "malice" or

"oppression." As the jury was instructed, "malice," "oppression," "conscious disregard,"

and "ratification" are all distinct legal concepts, each with its own distinct statutory

definition. A finding of one is not the same as a finding of another. "Malice" and

"oppression" are simply not elements of what the jury needed to find in order to render

the special verdict that it did. 

<P>

There is also another reason why the trial court was wrong, as a matter of law. Even if

(contrary to the preceding argument) the instructions were such that the jury should not

have found knowledge and conscious disregard of unfitness (or ratification) without also

finding either malice or oppression on Baker's part, the fact remains that the special

verdict form did not contain a place for them to record a finding of malice or oppression.

The whole purpose of a special verdict form is to ensure that the jury actually makes a

finding as to each of the necessary elements of the claim or issue entrusted to its

determination. And when the special verdict form fails to include an essential element of

the claim, the verdict cannot stand even if the evidence and the instructions would have

permitted the jury to make the omitted finding. 

<P>

Myers Building Industries, Ltd. v. Interface Technology, Inc., 13 Cal. App. 4th 949

(1993), is dispositive on this point. In that case, Myers sued Interface for breach of

contract and fraud, seeking compensatory and punitive damages. The court instructed the

jury on both theories of liability, but the special verdict form asked the jury only

whether Interface breached the contract. The jury answered this question "yes," and also

answered "yes" to the special verdict question asking if "there was any oppression, fraud,

or malice" in Interface's conduct. Id. at 957-58. In the second phase of trial, the jury

awarded Myers $1.1 million in punitive damages. Id. at 954. 

<P>

The Court of Appeal reversed the award of punitive damages on the ground that punitive

damages may not be awarded for breach of contract claims, which was the sole basis on

which the jury had found Interface liable. "[T]he jury was neither requested to nor did it

make the necessary factual findings for a fraud or other tort cause of action." Id. at

960. As there had been no jury finding of fraud to support the punitive damage award, the

court observed, there could be no punitive damages. The appellate court expressly

considered, and expressly rejected, the very arguments on which the trial court and

Plaintiff relied below: 

<P>

"Myers contends that the jury was properly instructed concerning the 

<P>

elements of a fraud cause of action and that there is substantial evidence 

<P>

to support a finding of fraud. Such a finding of fraud, however, was never 

<P>

expressly or impliedly made by the jury in its special verdict which found 

<P>

only that Interface had breached its contract with Myers. A jury instruction 

<P>

alone does not constitute a finding. Nor does the fact that the evidence 

<P>

might support such a finding constitute a finding. The jury was, in fact, 

<P>

instructed as to a fraud cause of action. Substantial evidence of fraud and 

<P>

damage may appear in the record. However, without an actual verdict by 

<P>

the jury on a fraud (or other tort) cause of action, the instructions and 

<P>

evidence cannot support the punitive damage award." (Id. at 961 footnotes 

<P>

omitted; emphasis added). 

<P>

In short, the jury instructions and special verdict form did not allow the jury to make

the specific findings statutorily necessary to hold Baker directly liable for punitive

damages, and the jury's actual findings thus omitted at least one "additional component"

(College Hospital, 8 Cal. 4th at 725) essential to a finding of either "malice" or

"oppression" as the Civil Code defines those terms. The trial court's conclusion to the

contrary was legally erroneous. 

<P>

2. Baker Had No Duty To Correct The Critical Omissions From The 

<P>

Special Verdict Form, And Timely Raised Those Omissions After 

<P>

Trial.

<P>

The trial court also rejected Baker's post-trial challenges to the punitive damage award

against it on the ground that, even if the jury's findings were insufficient, Baker was

"foreclosed" from arguing these issues in post-trial motions "under the doctrines of

waiver and estoppel." 10 AA 2967. The court observed that Baker had introduced evidence

concerning and argued the extent of its direct punitive damage liability during Phase 2 of

the trial without objecting that there had been no finding of its own "malice" or

"oppression," and had "stipulated to the pertinent jury instructions and jury

interrogatory and, having done so, may not now claim that they were inadequate for its

intended purpose." 10 AA 2966-67. 

<P>

Again, with all respect to the trial court, this fundamentally mistakes the relevant

procedural rules. It was exclusively Plaintiff's responsibility, not Baker's, to ensure

that the form of special verdict submitted to the jury required it to make all the

findings necessary to support the verdict Plaintiff sought. Again the Myers Building case

discussed above is dispositive. The Myers court rejected 

<P>

"[Plaintiff] Myers's contention that it was [Defendant] Interface's 

<P>

responsibility to obtain special verdict findings on the fraud cause of 

<P>

action and that Interface has waived its right to assert the deficiency 

<P>

in the verdict form by failing to object. Myers is attempting to enforce the 

<P>

judgment based on the special verdict and must bear the responsibility for 

<P>

a special verdict submitted to the jury on its own case. . . . [T]he absence 

<P>

of a tort special verdict finding could have been remedied prior to the 

<P>

discharge of the jury." (13 Cal. App. 4th at 961-62) 

<P>

As in Myers Building, Plaintiff here bore the burden of seeking and obtaining a finding of

malice or oppression on Baker's part in Phase 1 of the trial, or seeking such a finding in

a later phase, before the jury was discharged. She did not do so and, as a consequence,

the jury was never asked to make such a finding. "Parties should have one chance (by

request for special verdict forms) to have a jury's fact finding pinpointed." McCloud v.

Roy Riegels Chems., 20 Cal. App. 3d 928, 936-37 (1971); accord, Babcock v. Omansky, 31

Cal. App. 3d 625, 630 (1973). "The requirement that the jury must resolve every

controverted issue is one of the recognized pitfalls of special verdicts." Falls v.

Superior Court, 194 Cal. App. 3d 851, 855 (1987); see 3 California Trial Practice: Civil

Procedure During Trial Section 22.6 (3d ed. 1995) (same). 

<P>

For the same reasons, Baker's challenge to the sufficiency of the basis for the punitive

damage award against it was timely made in its post-trial motions. California courts have

consistently held that challenges based on special verdict forms are preserved if raised

at the time of a motion for a new trial. See All-West Design, Inc. v. Boozer, 183 Cal.

App. 3d 1212, 1220 (1986) (citing cases). Indeed, in Myers Building the appellant not only

failed to raise the deficiencies in the special verdict form at the close of Phase 1, it

did not raise them in post-trial motions, or even on appeal; the Court of Appeal itself

raised the issue sua sponte after the parties' appellate briefing was complete. 13 Cal.

App. 4th at 956-57 & n.3. In light of Myers Building, the trial court's conclusion that

Baker was "foreclosed" from raising these issues was simply incorrect. 

<P>

C. The Jury's Findings Allow Baker To Be Held Liable For Punitive 

<P>

Damages, If At All, Only Vicariously For The $225,000 In Punitive 

<P>

Damages Awarded Against Greenstein.

<P>

The jury's finding of knowledge and conscious disregard of unfitness (or ratification)

under Section 3294(b)[i] and [ii] is the sole record basis on which punitive damages may

be assessed against Baker. As a matter of law, this finding is sufficient only to impose

vicarious liability on Baker for the punitive damages assessed against its employee,

Greenstein. Thus, to the extent that punitive damages can be awarded at all against Baker,

the judgment must be modified to reduce Baker's liability for punitive damages to the

$225,000 awarded against Greenstein. 

<P>

III.

<P>

BECAUSE BAKER STIPULATED THAT UNDER FEHA BAKER 

<P>

WAS STRICTLY AND DIRECTLY LIABLE FOR COMPENSATORY 

<P>

DAMAGES CAUSED BY GREENSTEIN'S CONDUCT, PLAINTIFF'S 

<P>

ALTERNATIVE FEHA CLAIM THAT BAKER FAILED TO TAKE 

<P>

"ALL REASONABLE STEPS" TO AVOID HARASSMENT WAS 

<P>

MOOT; SUBMISSION OF THAT CLAIM"AND AN ERRONEOUS 

<P>

INSTRUCTION ON THE APPLICABLE STANDARD OF 

<P>

PROOF"WERE PREJUDICIAL ERROR.

<P>

A. Baker's Stipulation Rendered Plaintiff's Alternative FEHA Claim Moot. 

<P>

Under FEHA, an employer is directly and strictly liable for compensatory damages caused by

the sexual harassment of an employee by a "supervisor." Gov't Code Section 12940;

Kelly-Zurian v. Wohl Shoe Co., 22 Cal. App. 4th 397, 415 (1994); Fisher v. San Pedro

Peninsula Hosp., 214 Cal. App. 3d 590, 608 n.6 (1989). At (and before) trial, Baker

stipulated that Greenstein was a supervisor within the meaning of FEHA and that Baker

would therefore be jointly and severally liable for any compensatory damages caused by

Greenstein's harassment of Plaintiff. E.g., 6 AA 1673; RT 73. Plaintiff, of course,

concurred. 2 AA 486; see, RT 3312-13, 3245. 

<P>

This stipulation rendered moot Plaintiff's alternative FEHA claim against Baker, which

sought to hold Baker liable for compensatory damages caused by Baker's asserted failure to

"take all reasonable steps to prevent harassment from occurring." Gov't Code Section

12940(h)(1); Fisher, 214 Cal. App. 3d at 608 n.6 (an employer is liable for harassment by

a non-supervisor where it "knows of or should have known of this conduct and fails to take

immediate and appropriate corrective action"). The stipulation rendered Baker strictly

liable for any compensatory damages caused by Greenstein whether or not it "kn[ew] of or

should have known of [Greenstein's prior misconduct] and fail[ed] to take immediate and

appropriate corrective action." Gov't Code Section 12940(h)(1). 

<P>

B. The Trial Court Erroneously Refused To Eliminate The Redundant, 

<P>

Moot Alternative FEHA Claim From The Case. 

<P>

Baker's trial counsel repeatedly asked the trial court to remove Plaintiff's alternative

FEHA claim from the case on the ground that it had been rendered unnecessary and moot by

Baker's stipulation that Greenstein was a supervisor, objected to evidence that was

admissible only so long as that claim was in the case, and objected to instructions on the

"failure to take all reasonable steps" claim. See, e.g., RT 72-75, 86-87, 3121-25, 3126; 6

AA 1673. The trial court consistently rejected Baker's position, overruled its evidentiary

objections (e.g., RT 80-81, 86), and overruled Baker's objection to instructing the jury

on that claim: 

<P>

"[I]n the Court's view the fact that a party may have two separate causes 

<P>

of action against a defendant doesn't mean that one of them is limited as a 

<P>

matter of law because the other one is sufficient. I mean when you have 

<P>

two causes of action you have two causes of action. One doesn't go away 

<P>

because you happen to have another one under the law." (RT 3127) 

<P>

See also RT 3130-31.

<P>

Accordingly, the jury was instructed on Plaintiff's superfluous FEHA claim (RT 3543-44);

likewise, the Special Verdict Form included an interrogatory on that claim. 7 AA 1776.

This was entirely pointless, for as the special interrogatory was presented, the jury's

answer to that question had no impact on Baker's liability. 

<P>

The trial court's rulings retaining the "failure to take all reasonable steps" claim in

the case, admitting evidence relevant only to that claim, and sending the claim to the

jury were erroneous. Under California law, "the proof must be confined to the issues in

the case and . . . the time of the court should not be wasted, and the jury should not be

confused, by the introduction of evidence which is not relevant or material to the matters

to be adjudicated." Fuentes v. Tucker, 31 Cal. 2d 1, 4 (1947); see also Sumrall v. Butler,

102 Cal. App. 2d 515, 519 (1951). Fuentes was a wrongful death case in which the defendant

admitted liability for the accident. Nonetheless, plaintiffs were allowed by the trial

court to prove the circumstances of the accident (including the facts that defendant was

intoxicated and that the deceased children were thrown eighty feet by the force of the

accident). Id. at 3. The Supreme Court held that introduction of this evidence was error: 

<P>

"Evidence which is not pertinent to the issues raised by the pleadings is 

<P>

immaterial, and it is error to allow the introduction of such evidence. . . . It 

<P>

follows, therefore, if an issue has been removed from a case by an 

<P>

admission . . . it is error to receive evidence which is material solely to the 

<P>

excluded matter. . . . Such evidence is admissible [only if] it is relevant 

<P>

and material to an issue remaining in the case." (Id. at 4-5) 

<P>

In the present case, the "issue" of whether Baker had failed to take all reasonable steps

to avoid Plaintiff's harassment remained in the case only because the trial court refused

to declare Plaintiff's alternative FEHA claim redundant and moot. Armenta v. Churchill, 42

Cal. 2d 448 (1954), makes clear that this was error. Armenta was an action for wrongful

death resulting from a truck backing into the decedent. Plaintiffs (the widow and

children) sued the truck driver and his wife Alece, the registered owner of the truck,

alleging in two counts that (1) the driver (Dale) was the agent of the truck owner (Alece)

and acting within the scope of the agency, and (2) Alece was negligent in entrusting the

truck to a reckless driver. The Churchills admitted the first count"that Dale was acting

within the scope of his agency"but denied that Alece had negligently entrusted the vehicle

to her husband. Id. at 456. Alece "admitted her liability for all damages sustained by

plaintiffs in the event that her husband was found to be liable." Id. 

<P>

Plaintiffs nonetheless attempted to introduce at trial evidence to show that Dale "had

been found guilty of some 37 traffic violations, including a conviction of manslaughter,

and that Alece had knowledge of these facts. Defendants objected to the offered evidence

because it was directed to an issue which had been removed from the case." Id. On appeal,

Plaintiffs argued that the proffered evidence should have been admitted. Relying on the

rule of Fuentes v. Tucker, the Supreme Court rejected this contention: 

<P>

"It is true that defendant Alece Churchill's admission of vicarious liability 

<P>

as the principal for the tort liability, if any, of her husband was not directly 

<P>

responsive to plaintiffs' added allegations of fact contained in the second 

<P>

count relating to her personal negligence. But the only proper purpose of 

<P>

the allegations of either the first or second count with respect to Alece 

<P>

Churchill was to impose upon her the same legal liability as might be 

<P>

imposed upon Dale Churchill in the event the latter was found to be liable. 

<P>

Plaintiffs could not have recovered against Alece Churchill upon either 

<P>

count in the absence of a finding of liability upon the part of Dale 

<P>

Churchill; and Alece had admitted her liability in the event Dale was 

<P>

found to be liable.

<P>

Plaintiffs' allegations in the two counts with respect to Alece Churchill 

<P>

merely represented alternative theories under which plaintiffs sought to 

<P>

impose upon her the same liability as might be imposed upon her husband.  

<P>

. . . Alece Churchill . . . admitted that Dale Churchill was her agent and 

<P>

employee and that he was acting in the course of his employment at the 

<P>

time of the accident. Since the legal issue of her liability for the alleged 

<P>

tort was thereby removed from the case, there was no material issue 

<P>

remaining to which the offered evidence could be legitimately directed." 

<P>

(Armenta, 42 Cal. 2d at 457-58)

<P>

Armenta is squarely on point: There, as here, the plaintiff asserted alternative claims,

either of which would suffice to hold the principal liable for the acts of its agent;

there, as here, the principal (Alece; Baker) admitted its liability, along with the agent

(Dale; Greenstein), if the agent were found liable; and, there, as here, the plaintiff

nonetheless insisted that the alternative ground for holding the principal liable should

remain in the case even if it was not "legitimately directed" to any issue remaining in

the case. Armenta, 42 Cal. 2d at 458. When the trial court accepted this argument and let

the issue of Baker's "failure to take all reasonable steps" remain in the case, the trial

court committed error under Armenta. 

<P>

C. Baker Was Materially Prejudiced By The Trial Court's Refusal To 

<P>

Eliminate The Moot "Failure To Take All Reasonable Steps" Claim. 

<P>

Central to the issue of prejudice is the relationship"and differences"between Plaintiff's

alternative FEHA claim that Baker failed to take "all reasonable steps" to avoid her

harassment and her claim against Baker for punitive damages under Section 3294(b)[i] of

the Civil Code. Although at first blush the tunes may seem similar, they are in fact not

the same song. And therein lies the problem. 

<P>

As we have already shown in Part I(a), supra, Section 3294(b)[i] requires a determination

that a managing agent of the employer had actual knowledge of the employee's "unfitness"

such that the employer had a duty to terminate the employee. A "failure to take all

reasonable steps" claim under FEHA differs in important ways: 

<P>

First, FEHA's standard asks whether the employer "failed to take all reasonable steps to

prevent harassment." This is a classic negligence standard, and calls for consideration of

all of the possible remedial steps the employer might have taken. By contrast, Section

3294(b)[i] asks only whether the employer had knowledge of unfitness giving rise to a duty

to terminate the employee but continued to employ him. The sole issue, then, is whether or

not the employer should have fired the employee, not whether the employer should have

taken some steps short of that, such as warnings, counseling, salary or status reduction,

or other corrective or disciplinary steps short of termination. See Part I(A), supra. 

<P>

Second, like a classic negligence standard, whether or not an employer "failed to take all

reasonable steps" is based on what the employer knew or should have known. See Gov't Code

Section 12940(h)(1) ("if the entity, or its agents or supervisors, knows or should have

known of this conduct . . ."). But, as explained above (see Part I(A)(3), supra), the

punitive damages inquiry under Section 3294(b)[i] looks only to the actual knowledge of

the employer. 

<P>

Third, the two standards also differ as to whose knowledge is considered relevant to a

determination of liability: The "employer" under FEHA is defined to include the "agents or

supervisors" of the employer. Gov't Code  12940(h)(1). By contrast, under Section 3294(b)

the knowledge of the employee's "unfitness" must be on the part of a "managing agent" of

the employer, someone with "that broad degree of discretion in decision making which

determined [the employer's] corporate policy" (Hobbs v. Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards,

Inc., 164 Cal. App. 3d 174, 193 (1985); see RT 3547), which is not the same with an

ordinary supervisor. See Kelly- Zurian, 22 Cal. App. 4th at 421-22 (supervisor not a

managing agent when he "was not in a policymaking position"). 

<P>

Fourth, as shown in more detail below, the elements of a FEHA claim need be proved by only

the preponderance of the evidence, while the necessary factual elements of the punitive

damage claim under Section 3294(b) must be proved by clear and convincing evidence. 

<P>

1. Extensive And Prejudicial Evidence Was Admitted Relevant Only 

<P>

To The Moot Issue Of Baker's Failure To Take All Reasonable 

<P>

Steps.

<P>

Given the numerous differences between FEHA and Civil Code Section 3294(b), much evidence

that would be admissible to prove a "failure to take all reasonable steps" claim (if it

were properly in the case) would be irrelevant and inadmissible if offered to prove that a

managing agent of Baker had actual knowledge of Greenstein's unfitness such that Baker had

a duty to fire him. That possibility was anything but theoretical in this case. 

<P>

Throughout the trial, the court ruled evidence of any prior harassing conduct by

Greenstein towards employees at Baker admissible so long as some vague notice of even part

of the conduct came to the attention of a "supervisor" at Baker, even if that person was

not a "managing agent." See, e.g., RT 54, 61-62, 88, 675-77, 744; see also RT 512-13. For

example, Elyce Zahn testified that Greenstein had come up behind her in the office kitchen

at Baker on a Saturday and pulled her bra strap, asking her if she was wearing a black

bra; she immediately stopped working at Baker. RT 825-31. But all that any administrator

at Baker knew of this was a statement, made by a paralegal months after the event, that

Zahn had left Baker "because she did not like working for Mr. Greenstein." RT 612-14, 757.

And there was no evidence that any "managing agent" at Baker learned even this limited

information until well after this litigation began. See RT 615. Nonetheless, the full

testimony of Zahn was admitted against Baker, as relevant to the issue of "failure to take

all reasonable steps." See RT 62 ("I think that again raises questions of fact, issues of

fact, what if anything should the firm have done or what if anything should it have done

about what it did know. . . . I think I will allow it"); see also RT 833-34 (limiting

instruction admitting Zahn's testimony against Baker). 

<P>

Similarly, Donna Blow was allowed to testify that Greenstein had repeatedly asked her out

and then, when she told him she was gay, suggested that she and a girlfriend join him for

a "three-way." RT 789-94. The trial court admitted this damning testimony against Baker

because Ms. Blow's superior, Nancy Muller, testified that she (Muller) told the office

manager of the incident. RT 666, 774; see RT 676-77 ("The Court believes the proposed

evidence is relevant. The evidence goes to the issue of whether Baker McKenzie took all

reasonable steps to prevent harassment by, alleged harassment, by Mr. Greenstein from

occurring before plaintiff even started working at Baker McKenzie law firm"). However,

there was no evidence that the office manager ever passed what Muller told her on to any

"managing agent" of Baker. 

<P>

The admission of evidence of prior incidents never reported or known to a "managing agent"

of Baker was unquestionably prejudicial. Even worse, however, was the trial court's

refusal to eliminate the "failure to take all reasonable steps" claim. This resulted in

overwhelming attention at trial to what Baker should have known and whether the steps the

firm took in response to what it actually knew about Greenstein's conduct were reasonable,

appropriate and sufficient"all issues that were wholly irrelevant to Plaintiff's punitive

damages claim under Section 3294(b). Thus, there were literally hundreds of pages of

testimony concerning what Baker had or had not done in response to each piece of

information that may have reached any employee of Baker who qualified as a supervisor

under FEHA. For example, Mary Contreras, who was not a managing agent of Baker and who had

no power to discipline or terminate Greenstein (see RT 618; see also RT 3331), was

questioned at length about what she knew, what steps she took in response to the

information she learned, and what steps she failed to take. See, e.g., RT 590, 596-97,

601, 606-07, 610-20, 696-98, 699-705, 725-28, 754-61, 767. In addition, there were over

three hundred pages of expert testimony, almost all of it concerning whether Baker's

response to information a supervisor had received was "reasonable." See RT 1668-1797,

1799-1843, 2851-61, 2862-2986. This focus on Baker's asserted failure to take "all

reasonable steps" was practically to the exclusion of expert testimony on the only issue

that was actually relevant to Plaintiff's claim for punitive damages: whether "managing

agents" of Baker had actual knowledge of conduct by Greenstein prior to the employment of

Plaintiff that rendered him "unfit" such that Baker had no choice but to terminate him.

See Part I(A), supra. 

<P>

This misfocus of the trial is reflected in the closing argument of Plaintiff's counsel,

who spent approximately 72 transcript pages of argument contending that Baker failed to

take "all reasonable steps" to prevent the harassment of Plaintiff (see RT 3246-3317) and

barely four pages of argument asserting that Baker should be held liable for punitive

damages based on Baker's asserted knowledge and conscious disregard of Greenstein's

unfitness. See RT 3329-32, 3344-45. The attention of the jury thus was misdirected to an

issue"and evidence supporting it" that had no place in the case. 

<P>

The prejudice to Baker from the trial's obsession with a legally irrelevant issue is

obvious: The jury was presented with repeated and extensive evidence that Plaintiff

skillfully used to make Baker look bad"evidence and expert testimony that highlighted what

the jury found was an insufficient response by Baker to Greenstein's previous conduct. 7

AA 1776. And, for reasons discussed more fully below (see Part III(C)(2), infra), this

evidence likely contributed to the jury's conclusion that Baker should be held liable for

punitive damages. But under Section 3294(b), Baker could properly be held liable for

punitive damages based only on evidence of what was actually known to a "managing agent"

of the firm. Evidence of what a supervisor "knew or should have known" simply was not

relevant to the imposition of punitive damages against Baker. Testimony that Baker should

have taken steps short of terminating Greenstein to prevent further harassment was equally

irrelevant. Since Plaintiff's alternative FEHA claim should have been removed from the

case, there was no other proper reason for the admission of any of this evidence. 

<P>

"There can be no question that it was a great advantage to the [Plaintiff] to 

<P>

be able to let the jury know [of Baker's negligence in investigating and 

<P>

disciplining Greenstein's conduct] . . . . But that advantage is not one 

<P>

which a party is entitled to enjoy in the absence of any issue in the 

<P>

determination of which the evidence will be relevant and proper for the 

<P>

jury to hear. . . . That is so even though . . . the party offering the evidence 

<P>

is deprived of an important tactical advantage. Indeed, where the evidence 

<P>

is not relevant to any real issue, the advantage sought to be gained by its 

<P>

presentation must be recognized as unfair. Each side takes the risk that the 

<P>

'picture' of the case seen by the jury may be an unfavorable decisional 

<P>

context. But neither side is entitled to litigate a nonexistent issue for no 

<P>

purpose other than to alter the decisional context in his favor. It was error 

<P>

to refuse to accept appellant's admission . . . ." (Albrecht v. Broughton, 6 

<P>

Cal. App. 3d 173, 178 (1970) (citing Fuentes v. Tucker, 31 Cal. 2d 1 

<P>

(1947)) (emphasis in original).

<P>

2. Asking The Jury To Decide Both Whether Baker "Failed To Take All 

<P>

Reasonable Steps To Prevent Harassment" (An Issue Governed By 

<P>

The Preponderance Of The Evidence Standard) And Whether Baker 

<P>

Knew Of And Consciously Disregarded Greenstein's Unfitness (A 

<P>

Distinct Issue Governed By The Clear And Convincing Standard) 

<P>

Inevitably Confused The Jury.

<P>

In addition to the extensive prejudicial evidence that was admitted on an issue not

properly before the jury, the trial court's determination that the "failure to take all

reasonable steps" claim should remain in the case unnecessarily presented the jury with

two seemingly close, but actually quite distinct, issues. The jury was bound to confuse

the two issues, the evidence properly considered for each one, and the standard of proof

applicable to each. 

<P>

The "all reasonable steps" instruction asked the jury to determine whether "Baker McKenzie

failed to take all reasonable steps to prevent the harassment of plaintiff by Martin R.

Greenstein." RT 3543; see 7 AA 1776. The jury was also given the following instruction

about Baker's duty: 

<P>

"When an employer has received any complaint, notice or knowledge of 

<P>

facts such as to place the employer on notice of any sexual harassment by 

<P>

any employee, the employer has the duty to take all reasonable steps 

<P>

necessary to end such harassment"to end such sexual harassment and to 

<P>

prevent any further occurrence." (RT 3543-44) 

<P>

Under this standard, the jury had to consider each episode of previous harassment by

Greenstein presented at trial, and critically assess Baker's response to the information

that Mary Contreras (the office administrator of Baker's Palo Alto office) or any partner

at the firm received about the incident. Thus, the jury had to consider whether Baker took

every "reasonable step" in response to information that came to the firm. See RT 3543; cf.

RT 3246. And, of course, on these issues Plaintiff only had to prove its claim by a

preponderance of the evidence. See RT 3543. 

<P>

The jury then had to turn around and decide whether "Baker McKenzie had advance[]

knowledge of the unfitness of Mr. Greenstein and with a conscious disregard of the rights

and safety of others continued to employ him . . . ." RT 3547. As the jury was properly

instructed (see p. 61, supra), "[t]he advance knowledge and conscious disregard . . . must

be on the part of a managing agent of Baker" (RT 3547), which the court defined as "a

person who has sufficient discretion in the firm to make decisions that will ultimately

determine firm policy." RT 3547. 

<P>

For the reasons set forth above, this instruction therefore required the jury to determine

whether, based on what a "managing agent" of Baker actually knew of Greenstein's prior

conduct towards its female employees, it knew he was unfit such that the firm had a duty

to terminate him. Unlike the "failure to take all reasonable steps" claim, Plaintiff had

to prove every element of this claim by clear and convincing evidence. RT 3546-47. 

<P>

These two issues asked the jury to look at similar but actually distinct sets of

questions, and to assess them under different standards of proof. The potential for jury

confusion is plain. Faced with two similar issues, the jury may well have found Baker

liable for punitive damages on evidence that in fact only showed negligence (failure to

take "all reasonable steps") by the firm. And, as explained above, this strong potential

was entirely avoidable, as the issue of "all reasonable steps" was legally irrelevant and

moot. 

<P>

California courts have repeatedly emphasized "the concern that the giving of unnecessary

instructions"even if abstractly correct"increases the potential for jury confusion."

People v. Schultz, 192 Cal. App. 3d 535, 539 (1987) (citing cases); see People v. Jackson,

42 Cal. 2d 540, 546-47 (1954); Harris v. Chisamore, 5 Cal. App. 3d 494, 500 (1970) (same);

see also People v. Saddler, 24 Cal. 3d 671, 681 (1979) (similar); People v. Silver, 16

Cal. 2d 714, 722 (1940). As the Supreme Court explained many years ago: 

<P>

"The error of inapplicable instructions rests in the fact that they pertain to 

<P>

points not 'pertinent to the issue,' and contain matters of law for the jury's 

<P>

consideration not 'necessary for their information,' and, therefore, instead 

<P>

of enlightening, tend to confuse and mislead the jury. This is so because 

<P>

such instructions, in effect, either create a false issue or constitute a 

<P>

misstatement of the real issue, thereby distracting the attention of the jury 

<P>

from and befogging the real issue." (People v. Roe, 189 Cal. 548, 559 

<P>

(1922).

<P>

Here, the jury was unnecessarily instructed on an additional issue that was bound to

confuse it, making the error prejudicial. "An instruction correct in law, but upon a

subject that is outside the issues" is cause for a reversal if "it tends to mislead the

jury as to the question for decision." Estate of Clark, 180 Cal. 395, 398 (1919); see

Tomaselli v. Transamerica Ins. Co., 25 Cal. App. 4th 1269, 1286 (1994) ("Notwithstanding

accurate instructions by the court on the subject of punitive damages, the presentation to

the jury in terms of evidence and argument did not adequately distinguish between the

evidence necessary to support a tortious bad faith finding and that required for

imposition of punitive damages"); Klinger v. Henderson, 276 Cal. App. 2d 774, 781 (1969)

("Without an appropriate explanation which would have enabled the jury to properly

correlate and reconcile the two instructions, it is possible that they were confused and

even misled"). 

<P>

3. The Risk Of Jury Confusion Was Exacerbated By The Closing 

<P>

Argument Of Plaintiff's Counsel, Which Conflated The "Failure To 

<P>

Take All Reasonable Steps To Prevent Harassment" Claim With The 

<P>

Claim For Punitive Damages Based On Baker's Asserted 

<P>

Knowledge Of Unfitness And Failure To Terminate Greenstein. 

<P>

As noted above, Plaintiff's closing argument was overwhelmingly focused on the moot issue

of "failure to take all reasonable steps," rather than on the issue of employment with

knowledge of unfitness relevant to punitive damages. Unfortunately, Plaintiff's counsel

also conflated the two confusingly similar claims presented to the jury, suggesting that

the failure to take all reasonable "steps . . . to stop" Greenstein from harassing women

was the touchstone for Baker's liability for punitive damages. For example, after reading

to the jury the court's instruction on the issue of knowledge and conscious disregard of

unfitness, Plaintiff's counsel told the jury: 

<P>

"I don't think there's any question that is exactly the case. They have 

<P>

admitted that now . . . that they knew what [Greenstein] was doing and 

<P>

allowed him to continue and took no steps of any effect or import to stop 

<P>

him." (RT 3331 (emphasis added); see also RT 3516-17). 

<P>

Faced with this explanation, the jury was bound to focus on the negligence standard of the

moot FEHA claim rather than the "knowledge and conscious disregard of unfitness" standard

of Section 3294(b), and, as a result, find Baker liable for punitive damages based on

evidence of negligence. See Tomaselli, 25 Cal. App. 4th at 1286. 

<P>

4. The Trial Court Itself Confused The Standard Of Liability For 

<P>

Compensatory Damages Under FEHA (For Failure To Take All 

<P>

Reasonable Steps) With The Standard For Liability For Punitive 

<P>

Damages Under Section 3294(b).

<P>

If there were any doubt about the potential for confusion between Plaintiff's alternative

FEHA claim and her claim against Baker for punitive damages under Section 3294(b), it is

dispelled by the trial court's own confusion between the two in its disposition of the

post-trial motions. There the trial court stated that there was clear and convincing

evidence to support the imposition of punitive damages based on the jury's finding of

employment with knowledge of "unfitness," explaining that "Baker failed to take reasonable

steps to investigate the [prior] episodes [of alleged harassing conduct by Greenstein] and

the result necessarily was a failure to curtail Greenstein's pernicious conduct." 10 AA

2960 (emphasis added). In essence, the trial court found that Baker had been negligent. Of

course, this was not a proper basis for upholding the punitive damages verdict against

Baker. See n.28, supra. But more importantly for present purposes, the trial court's own

confusion between these two issues underscores the likelihood that the jury was equally

confused by being faced (unnecessarily) with two seemingly similar but distinct claims,

only one of which was properly submitted to it. 

<P>

D. The Trial Court Compounded Its Error By Giving An Insufficient 

<P>

Instruction On "Clear And Convincing Evidence." 

<P>

The risk of confusion between the two distinct claims presented to the jury was

exacerbated by an additional, independent error of the trial court. The court refused to

give a complete instruction defining "clear and convincing evidence" which tracked

language used in California decisions for nearly a century and which the courts have

repeatedly approved. Instead, the trial court gave an instruction which has been

questioned and disapproved. 

<P>

Section 3294 was amended in 1987 to require that a plaintiff "prove[] punitive damages at

trial [by] 'clear and convincing evidence.'" College Hospital, Inc. v. Superior Court, 8

Cal. 4th 704, 713 (1994). For nearly one hundred years, California courts have

consistently defined this very high standard of proof. As the Supreme Court explained in

1981: 

<P>

"This standard is not new. We described such a test, 80 years ago, as 

<P>

requiring that the evidence be '"so clear as to leave no substantial doubt"; 

<P>

"sufficiently strong to command the unhesitating assent of every 

<P>

reasonable mind."' It retains validity today." (In re Angelia P., 28 Cal. 3d 

<P>

908, 919 (1981) (citing Sheehan v. Sullivan, 126 Cal. 189, 193 (1899) and 

<P>

In re Terry D., 83 Cal. App. 3d 890, 899 (1978))) Accord, In re Marriage 

<P>

of Weaver, 224 Cal. App. 3d 478, 487 (1990) ("This characterization has 

<P>

been repeated and applied in many cases") (citing cases); In re David C., 

<P>

152 Cal. App. 3d 1189, 1208 (1984).

<P>

When the Legislature imposed this higher standard of proof in punitive damages cases, it

did so against the background of this consistent and uninterrupted line of decisions

following the Supreme Court's definition of "clear and convincing evidence" in Sheehan v.

Sullivan, 126 Cal. 189 (1899). Hence, it must be assumed to have incorporated these

decisions into the law governing punitive damages. See Tomaselli, 25 Cal. App. 4th at 1287

(amendment to require "clear and convincing evidence" "assuredly emphasized the greater

and more convincing proof desired at the trial level" (citing standard set forth in In re

Angelia P., 28 Cal. 3d 908, 919 (1981))). "'It is a generally accepted principle that in

adopting legislation the Legislature is presumed to have had knowledge of the existing

domestic judicial decisions and to have enacted and amended statutes in the light of such

decisions as have a direct bearing upon them.'" Estate of McDill, 14 Cal. 3d 831, 839

(1975) (citations omitted); see Anderson v. I.M. Jameson Corp., 7 Cal. 2d 60, 67 (1936);

Estate of Maron, 183 Cal. App. 3d 707, 712-13 (1986). 

<P>

Defendants asked the trial court to define "clear and convincing evidence" in language

which tracked this long line of cases: 

<P>

"'Clear and convincing' evidence means evidence of such convincing 

<P>

force that it demonstrates, in contrast to the opposing evidence, a high 

<P>

probability of the truth of the facts for which it is offered as proof. The 

<P>

evidence must be so clear as to leave no substantial doubt. It must be 

<P>

sufficiently strong as to command the unhesitating assent of every 

<P>

reasonable mind. Such evidence requires a higher standard of proof than 

<P>

proof by a preponderance of the evidence." (6 AA 1712 (emphasis in original). 

<P>

The emphasized sentences above are additions to the standard form instruction in BAJI 2.62

for, as counsel explained to the trial court, the BAJI instruction  

<P>





"is actually an understatement of the law and . . . requires further 

<P>

explanation to reflect what cases have decided . . . . [I]t doesn't accurately 

<P>

reflect what cases have decided with respect to what the burden is for clear 

<P>

and convincing evidence. . . . To the extent the instruction [BAJI 2.62] 

<P>

does not reflect what . . . cases have held, we believe that [it] is an 

<P>

inaccurate statement of the law. Therefore we object to it being given." 

<P>

(RT 3119-20) See also RT 3109 (joinder by Baker). 

<P>

However, encouraged by the erroneous assurance of Plaintiff's counsel that the BAJI

instruction had been approved by the courts and that "we risk error by going beyond it"

(RT 3120), the trial court declined to deviate from BAJI, stating (incorrectly): "This is

a common instruction given in a great number of cases and has withstood the test of time."

RT 3121. The trial court's instruction therefore omitted the language emphasized above. 

<P>

This was error. In fact, as made clear in the cases cited to the trial court (see RT 3119;

6 AA 1712), BAJI 2.62 has been disapproved as "unnecessarily limited" and "misleading." In

In re Marriage of Weaver, 224 Cal. App. 3d 478 (1990), the BAJI form instruction was

criticized as 

<P>

"an editing of the accepted full definition of the 'clear and convincing' 

<P>

standard and . . . both misleading and unnecessarily limited. Indeed, it 

<P>

seems to suggest an evidentiary test which is significantly less rigorous 

<P>

than the one which the Supreme Court has repeatedly characterized as 

<P>

requiring evidence which is 'clear, explicit and unequivocal,' 'so clear as 

<P>

to leave no substantial doubt,' and '"'sufficiently strong to command the 

<P>

unhesitating assent of every reasonable mind.'"'" (Id. at 487 n.8 (emphasis 

<P>

added; citations omitted).

<P>

The BAJI instruction has not been approved by the courts. The only two decisions that have

found the language of BAJI 2.62 adequate explicitly stated that they did so where no more

extensive instruction had been requested. See Mock v. Michigan Millers Mut. Ins. Co., 4

Cal. App. 4th 306, 333 n.29 (1992); Roberts v. Ford Aerospace & Communications Corp., 224

Cal. App. 3d 793, 804 (1990). Nor is the BAJI's decision to promulgate the instruction

tantamount to a judicial seal of approval. BAJI instructions are not received wisdom and

have often been disapproved by the courts as inadequate. See, e.g., Mitchell v. Gonzales,

54 Cal. 3d 1041, 1053-54 & n.9 (1991); Overgaard v. Johnson, 68 Cal. App. 3d 821, 823

(1977); see also Cal. R. Ct., Div. I, Standards of Judicial Administration Recommended by

the Judicial Council, App. Section 5 ("[A] trial judge in considering instructions to the

jury shall give no less consideration to those submitted by the attorneys for the

respective parties than to those contained in the latest edition of California Jury

Instructions: Civil (BAJI)"). 

<P>

The trial court's refusal to give the requested instruction was erroneous and, in the

context of this trial, especially prejudicial. The trial court's failure to give the

proper instruction added to the already considerable risk that the jury confused the FEHA

claim it should not have been asked to decide with the punitive damages claim. 

<P>

IV. EVEN AFTER THE TRIAL COURT'S REMITTITUR, THE $3.5 

<P>

MILLION PUNITIVE DAMAGES AWARD AGAINST BAKER IS 

<P>

EXCESSIVE.

<P>

In Part I supra, we showed that the evidence was not legally sufficient to support any

punitive damage award against Baker. Alternatively, in Part II, supra, we showed that

because the jury did not find Baker guilty of oppression, fraud or malice, at most Baker

could be vicariously liable for the $225,000 in punitive damages awarded against

Greenstein. In Part III, we showed that award of $3.5 million in punitive damages cannot

stand because the jury was improperly presented with a good deal of prejudicial evidence

and argument relevant only to a moot issue not properly in this case, and was needlessly

instructed on that issue, inevitably producing jury confusion. If the Court ultimately

rejects each of these arguments, the $3.5 million penalty imposed on Baker is excessive as

a matter of law and should be reduced to not more than $300,000. 

<P>

The jury in this case awarded an unprecedented $6.9 million in punitive damages against

Baker & McKenzie. This would have been the largest such award in favor of a single

plaintiff in the published annals of the California courts. It was twice as much as

Plaintiff's counsel told the jury in closing was the most he could legally ask them to

award (RT 3740), and was almost 140 times the $50,000 in compensatory damages that the

jury concluded fairly measured all the harm Plaintiff actually suffered. On Baker's motion

for new trial, the trial court acknowledged the disproportionality of the punitive damage

award to any of the factors by which a fair verdict is to be measured. The court also

expressly recognized an array of "mitigating factors," including: 

<P>

-- "Baker's conduct was not the product of a deliberate and purposeful policy aimed at

violating the rights of anyone" (10 AA 2964);   Greenstein consistently denied the

accusations against him, which required Baker "to exercise vigilance to protect the rights

of Greenstein as well as those of the complaining women" (though with the benefit of a

lengthy trial the court found those denials were not entirely credible) (10 AA 2960-61); 

<P>

-- Baker had required Greenstein to undergo professional counseling (10 AA 2961); 

<P>

-- Baker had forced Greenstein to resign (10 AA 2962); 

<P>

--  "After the events which gave rise to this lawsuit, and before the commencement of

trial, Baker substantially improved its approach to sexual harassment and introduced

throughout its offices in California a program designed to prevent repetition of the kinds

of events which occurred in this case" (10 AA 2962); 

<P>

-- Baker will be required to pay Plaintiff's attorney's fees in this case (10 AA 2962),

which may amount to nearly $2 million (16 AA 4475). Yet, despite these mitigating factors,

the trial court left the punitive damage award after remittitur at $3.5 million, an amount

still seventy times the size of Plaintiff's compensatory damages and the third largest

punitive damages award upheld in any published appellate decision in California. The court

conceded that the reduced award was still "large by almost any standard and 

<P>

For the reasons that follow, an award of $3.5 million punitive damages against Baker is

legally excessive. To be sure, the harassment that the jury found Greenstein to have

inflicted on Plaintiff was odious. But the issue here is not how much Greenstein's conduct

merited punitive damages, but how much Baker's did. If we have failed to persuade the

Court that Baker's failure to fire Greenstein prior to July 1991 should not be the basis

for punitive damages at all, at a minimum a clear-eyed focus on just what Baker did to

render itself liable for punitive damages compels a decision that an award of $3.5 million

punitive damages is excessive as a matter of law. 

<P>

A. This Court Has A Constitutional Duty To Review The Jury's 

<P>

Punitive Damage Award, And The Trial Court's Remittitur, 

<P>

Independently To Ensure That The Award Is Not Excessive. 

<P>

"Appellate courts must scrutinize punitive damage verdicts because they 'constitute a

windfall, create the anomaly of excessive compensation, and are therefore not favored in

the law.'" Las Palmas Assocs. v. Las Palmas Ctr. Assocs., 235 Cal. App. 3d 1220, 1258

(1991) (quoting Dumas v. Stocker, 213 Cal. App. 3d 1262, 1266 (1989)). There are limits to

the amount of punitive damages that may in any given case be awarded. See Adams v.

Murakami, 54 Cal. 3d 105, 109-18 (1991); Las Palmas, 235 Cal. App. 3d at 1255-59. Like any

other issue of law, the issue of excessiveness is one that calls for judicial oversight by

both trial judges and appellate courts to ensure that jury verdicts conform to legal and

constitutional norms. An award of punitive damages that exceeds legal limits is said to

have resulted from "passion or prejudice." Neal v. Farmers Ins. Exch., 21 Cal. 3d 910, 927

(1978). 

<P>

Appellate review of punitive damage awards plays a crucial role in achieving the

even-handed enforcement of the law and in conforming the system of punitive damages to the

requirements of the Constitution: 

<P>

"Punitive damages pose an acute danger of arbitrary deprivation of 

<P>

property. . . . [A state's] [d]enial of judicial review of the size of punitive 

<P>

damage awards violates the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth 

<P>

Amendment." (Honda Motor Co. v. Oberg, --U.S.--, 129 L. Ed. 2d 336, 

<P>

349-50 (1994) (footnote omitted). 

<P>

The California Supreme Court has been equally clear that meaningful judicial review of

punitive damage awards is a procedural requirement of constitutional dimension. Adams, 54

Cal. 3d. at 116-18 & n.8 (citing Pacific Mutual Life Ins. Co. v. Haslip, 499 U.S. 1

(1991)); accord, Las Palmas Assocs., 235 Cal. App. 3d at 1257-59. 

<P>

Although appellate courts will pay appropriate deference to a trial court's assessment of

the facts bearing on a punitive damage award, "deference is not abdication." Dumas, 213

Cal. App. 3d at 1266. "It is the duty and responsibility of an appellate court to

intervene where the award is so grossly disproportionate or palpably excessive as to raise

a presumption that it was the product or passion and prejudice." Id.; accord, Neal, 21

Cal. 3d at 928. The essence of that inquiry is whether the amount of the award "is greater

than reasonably necessary to punish and deter." Haslip, 499 U.S. at 22; accord, Adams, 54

Cal. 3d at 110; Neal, 21 Cal. 3d at 928. That is unquestionably the case here. 

<P>

The trial court reviewed the jury's award of $6.9 million in punitive damages against

Baker, found it to be excessive, and reduced those damages to $3.5 million. But that

ruling does not immunize the punitive damages award from appellate review for legal

excessiveness. Neal, 21 Cal. 3d at 927 (where trial court has reduced punitive damages

verdict, reviewing court determines whether revised award is legally excessive); Burnett

v. National Enquirer, Inc., 144 Cal. App. 3d 991, 997, 1012 (1983), appeal dismissed, 465

U.S. 1014 (1984) (trial court reduced punitive damages from $1.3 million to $750,000;

appellate court reduced them further to $150,000). Just as an appellate court must make

its own informed legal assessment of a trial court's interpretation of a statute, this

Court must determine for itself whether the $3.5 million punitive damages award is legally

excessive. 

<P>

That is not to say that this Court should ignore the trial court's factual determinations.

To the contrary, it is a "basic principle[]" of appellate review that 

<P>

"when a trial court grants a new trial on the issue of excessive damages, 

<P>

whether or not such order is conditioned by a demand for reduction, the 

<P>

presumption of correctness normally accorded on appeal to the jury's 

<P>

verdict is replaced by a presumption in favor of the order." (Neal, 21 Cal. 

<P>

3d at 932).

<P>

That is a critical principle here. The trial court made numerous factual findings which

show that the punitive damage award against Baker, even as reduced by that court, remains

drastically excessive. See p. 72, supra. Ironically, the trial judge asked the right

questions, got the right answers regarding the relevant facts, and then proceeded to an

erroneous conclusion of law when it found that $3.5 million was a legally permissible

award of punitive damages. 

<P>

B. Especially In Light Of The Facts The Trial Court Found In Granting 

<P>

Remittitur, The $3.5 Million Punitive Damages Award Is Excessive As 

<P>

A Matter Of Law.

<P>

1. Baker's Conduct Was Not Sufficiently Reprehensible To Support 

<P>

The Award Against It.

<P>

One of the principal components of the punitive damage review required in California is an

assessment of the "reprehensibility" of the defendant's conduct. Adams, 54 Cal. 3d at

111-12. There are cognate terms: despicable, evil, criminal. See, e.g., Civ. Code Section

3294(c); College Hospital, 8 Cal. 4th at 725; Tomaselli v. Transamerica Ins. Co., 25 Cal.

App. 4th 1269, 1288 (1994). Meaningful judicial review under Adams and the state and

federal Constitutions properly demands consideration of the punishment found fitting in

other reported cases, as well as comparison to conduct held not to warrant extraordinary

punitive damage awards. See Downey Sav. & Loan Ass'n v. Ohio Casualty Ins. Co., 189 Cal.

App. 3d 1072, 1098 (1987), cert. denied, 486 U.S. 1036 (1988); Devlin v. Kearny Mesa

AMC/Jeep/ Renault, Inc., 155 Cal. App. 3d 381, 388-90, 393-96 (1984). The starting point

for such analysis is, of course, the conduct of the defendant against whom the punitive

damages under review were awarded in this case, Baker. 

<P>

Judicial assessments of reprehensibility have weighed heavily the presence (or absence) of

one or more of the following: (1) an actual motivation, illustrated by a deliberate and

affirmative design at the highest corporate level, to hurt the plaintiff; (2) a corrupt

corporate policy, i.e., an explicit company-wide plan to cause harm to a particular group

of persons; or (3) a company-wide policy intentionally designed to secure a corporate

benefit, with foreknowledge of the risk of very serious (i.e., bodily) harm to members of

the public as a result. 

<P>

For example, in Downey Savings & Loan Ass'n, a corporate policy required claims adjusters

to try to defeat all claims, and explicitly directed the use of depositions "to cause

harassment, embarrassment, inconvenience or expense." 189 Cal. App. 3d at 1099. This

"invidious" policy (id.) was held to support a punitive damage award of $5 million"the

largest verdict ever affirmed on appeal in a published decision in California. Neal, 21

Cal. 3d 910 (1978), is also instructive. An undifferentiated award of compensatory and

punitive damages of $1.5 million was reduced by the trial court to $750,000, and upheld by

the California Supreme Court, where there was evidence of "established company policy,

designed to utilize the lamentable circumstances in which [the plaintiff in that case] and

her family found themselves." Id. at 923 (footnote omitted). The insured's family was in

extremis: Both the insured and her son had cancer. The insurer knew it, and adhered to its

deliberate policy of preying on human suffering in order to increase profit. Similarly,

Grimshaw v. Ford Motor Co., 119 Cal. App. 3d 757 (1981), involved deliberate corporate

policy, which the court found to include design of a fuel tank in the face of knowledge

that horribly disfiguring injuries, like those in fact suffered by the 13-year-old

plaintiff, would result. The award against Ford was reduced from $125 million to $3.5

million. Id. at 818-20. 

<P>

The present case is unique. A massive judgment for punitive damages"higher than all but

two reported California appellate cases"was entered without a finding that the defendant

acted with malice, fraud or oppression. That distinguishes this case from the notorious

punitive damages cases in which multi-million dollar awards have been upheld, including

Downey Savings, Grimshaw and Neal. To date, no reported decision upholds an award of

punitive damages under Section 3294(b)[i] without finding the employer itself guilty of

malice, fraud or oppression. Thus, if this Court finds that (despite the argument made in

Part II, supra) the California punitive damages statutes permit the imposition of punitive

damages on a direct liability basis against an employer not guilty of oppression, fraud or

malice, it will have recognized a category of punitive damages cases involving materially

less moral culpability than those well-known examples of reprehensible conduct that have

led to large punitive damages awards. It follows that the amount of punitive damages in

this case should be less than in cases where a defendant itself was actually guilty of

malice, fraud or oppression. 

<P>

If this Court upholds the jury's determination of liability for punitive damages and

rejects the arguments in Part I(A), supra, then Baker's liability will rest upon a

determination that Baker was on notice of Greenstein's "unfitness" but failed to

appreciate the severity of Greenstein's problems and the need to protect its female

employees. But while this failure is regrettable, it cannot support a multi-million dollar

award of punitive damages. Baker did not condone, encourage or permit the behavior in

which the jury found Greenstein to have engaged. See Part I(B), supra. It had an

established and unequivocal written policy that prohibited such misbehavior. See p. 35,

supra. And on numerous occasions, Baker reinforced that policy with admonitions that,

while ultimately ineffective, were sincerely intended to remind Greenstein of the firm's

clear policy and concerns. MA C:56; MA E:48; RT 1048-49, 1332, 1590-91, 2580-84, 2622,

2659, 2718, 2995-96, 3009. By comparison to the kinds of truly "reprehensible" behavior

that are the usual grounds for punitive damage awards, Baker's failure to recognize the

full severity of Greenstein's problems cannot possibly be placed near the high end of the

"reprehensibility" scale. 

<P>

There are explanations"though not excuses"for Baker's failure to have fired Greenstein

prior to July 1991 that are highly relevant to the issue of punitive damages. To begin

with, as this case has demonstrated, Baker's internal procedures at the time did not

require a single firm-wide repository or person to accumulate all complaints made about

Greenstein, or the steps taken to address them. Moreover, as the trial court expressly

noted (10 AA 2960-61), each time Greenstein was told of a complaint against him, he denied

the accusation. Several complainants (including Gardiner, Blow and Haydock-Davis) insisted

on remaining anonymous or declined to pursue any formal grievance. RT 479, 564, 568,

725-26, 773, 798, 803, 1585. The truth of their accusations therefore could not be fully

resolved. Moreover, Greenstein was a partner in the firm; Baker therefore owed him

fiduciary duties and the duty of good faith and fair dealing. See generally Page v. Page,

55 Cal. 2d at 197. 

<P>

This is at most a case of a law firm's institutional failure to collect and evaluate

evidence that one of its partners had a serious behavior problem, not one where the

defendant made a knowing and deliberate decision to engage in harmful conduct for its own

advantage. Indeed, even if the partners of Baker had"with all the facts assembled"gathered

around a conference table in June 1991 with full knowledge of all prior complaints about

Greenstein and made a considered decision that despite those complaints he should not be

fired, that would at worst have been a misjudgment, not a highly reprehensible wrong

justifying a multi-million dollar penalty. After all, a considered decision in June 1991

not to fire Greenstein would have been comparable to the unanimous decision that the

California Supreme Court made in 1995 when it declined to order the removal of a judge who

had engaged in even more egregious misbehavior. See Part I(A)(4), supra. Plaintiff may

disagree with the decision in Fitch v. Commission on Judicial Performance, as she does

with Baker's decision not to fire Greenstein, but it would be more than intemperate bad

manners to call either decision "reprehensible""let alone place them in the same league

with the heinous and calculated behavior that led to punitive damages of comparable

magnitude in cases such as Egan, Neal, Downey Savings and Grimshaw. In sum, Baker's

failure to recognize the severity of Greenstein's behavior problems as "unfit" does not

register high on the reprehensibility scale. 

<P>

Moreover, "[t]his is not a case . . . in which punitive damages are warranted to punish

for the maintenance of evil policies which damage the public in general." Tomaselli, 25

Cal. App. 4th at 1288. Corporate conduct that is "negligent" in failing to follow up

information does not suffice. Patrick v. Maryland Cas. Co., 217 Cal. App. 3d 1566, 1576

(1990). Even when such conduct is "callous," it does not meet the standard. Tomaselli, 25

Cal. App. 4th at 1288. And far from partaking of the requisite "character of outrage

frequently associated with crime" (Taylor v. Superior Court, 24 Cal. 3d 890, 894 (1979)),

Baker's conduct here was at worst "noniniquitous human failing." Tomaselli, 25 Cal. App.

4th at 1288 n.14. Indeed, as the trial court itself expressly found in its own review of

the punitive damage award: 

<P>

"Baker's conduct was not the product of a deliberate and purposeful policy 

<P>

aimed at violating the rights of anyone. Baker took aim neither at the 

<P>

plaintiff nor any other woman in its workplace." (10 AA 2964 (emphasis 

<P>

added).

<P>

2. The Punitive Damages Award Bears No Rational Relation To The 

<P>

Plaintiff's Actual Compensatory Damages. 

<P>

The award in this case exceeds a second limit imposed on punitive damages under Neal v.

Farmers Insurance (21 Cal. 3d at 928): it bears no reasonable relationship to the $50,000

in compensatory damages that the jury awarded. 

<P>

The requisite "meaningful judicial review" on which Adams and the state and federal

Constitutions insist does not reduce to any convenient formula; judges typically consult

assessments by their fellow jurists in reported cases to determine whether the ratio of

compensatory to punitive damages is appropriate in the particular case before them. See,

e.g., Devlin, 155 Cal. App. 3d at 388. On occasion, where corporate policy is particularly

pernicious and its actual or potential swath particularly wide, disproportionate punitive

damages may be countenanced. Such cases are marked by special factors, including those

noted in the preceding section: outrageous behavior specifically intended to harm the

plaintiff; wide-ranging corporate policies intended to cheat or injure whole classes of

innocent consumers; or deliberate corporate choices creating a high risk of serious injury

to large numbers of people. See Part IV(B)(1), supra. 

<P>

Any comparison between this record and the facts of cases in which large awards have been

affirmed reveals that the disproportion in this case is extreme. For example, in EEOC v.

Farmer Bros. Co., 31 F.3d 891, 894 (9th Cir. 1994), a FEHA gender-based termination case,

the ratio of punitive to compensatory damages was 10 to 1. In that case, the district

court, sitting without a jury, imposed that award for what it found to be a deliberate

company policy of gender discrimination. In Rosener v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 110 Cal. App.

3d 740 (1980), appeal dismissed, 450 U.S. 1051 (1981) involving actual fraud by the

defendant that affected many consumers, the initial ratio of punitive to compensatory

damages was 63 to 1. This Court deemed the 63:1 ratio such a "grossly disproportionate

recovery" that it raised a "presumption that it was the result of passion or prejudice,"

and required a remittitur by a factor of four. 110 Cal. App. 3d at 752, 757. A more recent

decision concluded that a ratio of only 5:1 was "some indication the award resulted from

passion and prejudice." Palmer v. Ted Stevens Honda, Inc., 193 Cal. App. 3d 530, 540

(1987). 

<P>

The $3.5 million punitive damages award here represents a ratio of seventy to one, despite

the absence of a jury finding of oppression, fraud or malice on the part of Baker, and

notwithstanding the trial court's finding that "Baker's conduct was not the product of a

deliberate and purposeful policy aimed at violating the rights of anyone." 10 AA 2964.

This result falls far outside the rough boundaries of proportionality that the

Constitution and the common law have set. 

<P>

3. The Trial Court Found Facts Establishing That The Award Is Far In 

<P>

Excess Of What Would Be Necessary To Deter Misconduct. 

<P>

Instruction No. 1 in Phase 2 of the trial asked the jury to consider "the amount of

punitive damages which will have a deterrent effect on [Baker] in the light of [Baker's]

financial condition." RT 3776. Thus, as the trial court instructed the jury, and again

reminded itself in ruling on Baker's post-trial motions (10 AA 2963), the calculus does

not permit punitive damages to be set at an amount that might deter others; it is the need

for deterrence of the party before the court, as judged by its actions both before and

after the accusations of misconduct arose, that provides the proper measure for the

punitive damage award. 

<P>

This case has taught Baker and its management a very painful lesson, one they already have

taken fully to heart. So far as Greenstein is concerned, Baker long ago took action to

ensure that he will not harass any other Baker employee: Greenstein was forced to resign

nine months before the trial began. More broadly, before this case went to trial Baker

delivered a clear and stern message to its partners and staff on this subject, and

implemented revised policies and procedures regarding sexual harassment that are not only

appropriate but on the cutting edge of such programs. As the trial court expressly found,

"[a]fter the events which gave rise to this lawsuit, and before the commencement of trial,

Baker substantially improved its approach to [the problem of] sexual harassment and

introduced throughout its offices in California a program designed to prevent repetition

of the kinds of events which occurred in this case." 10 AA 2962. 

<P>

Events since trial began have only reinforced that lesson. In addition to the Plaintiff's

compensatory damages, Baker will have to pay Plaintiff's reasonable attorney's fees.

Moreover, Baker has suffered substantial and widespread unfavorable publicity that has

extended far beyond the Bay Area legal community to courtrooms and boardrooms nationwide.

Even if no punitive damages were awarded at all, the record compels the conclusion that

Baker has "gotten the message" and appropriately responded to it. No further deterrent is

needed, let alone an award of $3.5 million. 

<P>

C. Conclusion: Taking All Three Factors Into Account, An Appropriate 

<P>

Award Of Punitive Damages Would Be $300,000; Any Greater Amount 

<P>

Would Be Excessive.

<P>

Each factor governing review of the punitive damage award"reprehensibility of conduct,

proportionality to actual damages, and the need to deter Baker in the future"points in the

same direction. Whether considered independently or together, each factor demonstrates

that neither the jury's extravagant award, nor the trial court's less but still

excessively punitive adjustment to that award, can stand. 

<P>

Under the standards reviewed in the preceding three sections, the maximum appropriate

award of punitive damages on this record is $300,000"six times the compensatory damages

awarded by the jury. That conclusion is reinforced by a highly appropriate analogy.

California courts have historically looked to federal Title VII decisions in applying

FEHA. See, e.g., Fisher v. San Pedro Peninsula Hosp., 214 Cal. App. 3d 590, 606 (1989).

Notably, federal law until 1991 did not permit punitive damages at all (42 U.S.C. Section

2000e-5(g)), and currently limits the sum of punitive and compensatory damages to $300,000

for major employers with more than 500 employees. 42 U.S.C. Section 1981a(b)(3)(D). This

standard reflects a typical case, like this one, in which the "complaining party" is an

individual. 

<P>

We close our discussion of this issue by stressing Baker's emphatic agreement that sexual

harassment in the workplace is wrong, and that employers should take all reasonable steps

to prevent it. Nothing in the relief sought here would detract from the lesson taught by

the judgment in this case. A judgment after appeal finding Baker liable for $50,000 in

compensatory damages, $300,000 in punitive damages and Plaintiff's reasonable attorney's

fees and costs is no mere slap on the wrist. Coupled with the pervasive unfavorable

publicity and the other burdens imposed by this case, such a judgment would send a

powerful and constructive message to Baker, the managers of other law firms large and

small, and to corporate America generally. 

<P>

D. The $3.5 Million Punitive Damages Award Against Baker Violates 

<P>

Due Process.

<P>

In addition to the requirements of California law, the federal Constitution requires that

punitive damage awards "comply with the Due Process Clause's '"general concern for

reasonableness."'" Pulla v. Amoco Oil Co., 72 F.3d 648, 658 (8th Cir. Dec. 19, 1995)

(quoting TXO Prod. Corp. v. Alliance Resources Corp., 509 U.S. 443, 125 L. Ed. 2d 366, 379

(1993) (plurality opinion) (quoting Pacific Mutual Life Ins. Co. v. Haslip, 499 U.S. 1, 18

(1991))). This concern requires that an award be "rational in light of [its] purpose to

punish what has occurred and to deter repetition." Haslip, 499 U.S. at 21. As Justice

White, sitting by designation, recently explained, 

<P>

"Whether a punitive damages award is reasonable for purposes of due 

<P>

process, turns on (1) the harm inflicted on the plaintiff; (2) the 

<P>

reprehensibility of the defendant's conduct; (3) the likely potential harm to 

<P>

others arising from the complained of conduct; and (4) the wealth of the 

<P>

defendant." (Pulla, 72 F.3d at 659 (citing TXO, 509 U.S. 443; 125 L. Ed. 

<P>

2d 366, 381 (plurality opinion) and id. at 386-387 2726 (Kennedy, J., 

<P>

concurring). For the reasons explained already above, the punitive damage award here

violates due process and is unconstitutional. See Pulla, 72 F.2d at 659-661. 

<P>

V. THE JUDGMENT MUST BE REVERSED DUE TO A JUROR'S 

<P>

CONCEALMENT OF MATERIAL FACTS ON VOIR DIRE. 

<P>

Baker moved for a new trial on the ground that a juror had failed to reveal material facts

on voir dire in response to questions clearly calling for their disclosure. 8 AA 2201-03.

Such juror misconduct gives rise to a presumption of prejudice, which has not been

rebutted. Because the vote of the juror in question was the necessary ninth vote for a

crucial finding on the Special Verdict form on which Baker's liability for punitive

damages depends, this concealment was unquestionably prejudicial to Baker. The trial

court's denial of the motion for a new trial therefore was reversible error. 

<P>

Juror William Carpenter's wife, Florine Carpenter, had been a claimant in a consolidated

class action gender discrimination lawsuit against Bechtel Corporation that was settled in

1981. 8 AA 2326. She received $7,340.14 in the settlement. 8 AA 2361. Alan Exelrod, who

was one of Plaintiff's two trial counsel in this case, was the lead attorney in the

earlier gender discrimination action, and thus represented Mrs. Carpenter and the other

successful claimants. 8 AA 2364, 2414, 2422. 

<P>

During voir dire, Mr. Carpenter, along with other panel members, was asked the following

questions: (1) "[A]re there any of you that know or are familiar with any of the parties,

their lawyers?" (RT 299-300); (2) "Have you or any members of your family or close friends

to your knowledge sued anyone or presented a claim against anyone in connection with a

matter similar to this case?" (RT 303); (3) "Has anyone close to you ever been sexually

harassed or subject to any type of discrimination in the workplace?" (RT 316) (emphasis

added)); and (4) "Have either you or anyone close to you made any type of claim for

damages, if so please raise your hand." RT 319 (emphasis added). In each instance, Mr.

Carpenter did not respond. As a result, his wife's gender discrimination claim against a

large employer, the settlement of her claim, and Mr. Exelrod's representation of Mrs.

Carpenter and the other claimants in that case were not revealed. Counsel for defendants

had no opportunity to explore these matters with Mr. Carpenter, to present a challenge for

cause or, had such a challenge been rejected, to exercise a peremptory challenge of this

juror. 

<P>

After the verdict, Mr. Carpenter stated in an interview with The Recorder that 

<P>

"I was sitting there waiting to answer [and] ready to tell . . . but they never 

<P>

asked. Carpenter said that aside from one 'brief discussion' during jury 

<P>

selection, he and his wife hadn't talked about the Bechtel settlement in a 

<P>

long time." (9 AA 2647 (quoting Recorder, October 25, 1994, at 1. 

<P>

However, after Baker filed its motion for a new trial which demonstrated that Mr.

Carpenter had been asked questions that should have elicited the information he did not

reveal"he submitted an affidavit stating that he "either did not understand or hear" the

question "[h]as anyone close to you ever been sexually harassed or subject to any type of

discrimination in the workplace?" 9 AA 2491. He also stated that he had not responded to

the question, "Have either you or anyone close to you made any type of claim for damages?"

because "I did not understand what my wife did to be a claim for damages; rather, I

understood it to be payment to her for back wages." 9 AA 2491. 

<P>

Despite Mr. Carpenter's failure to respond to voir dire questions, his inconsistent,

contrived and ultimately unpersuasive explanations for this failure to respond, and the

obvious relationship between the earlier lawsuit and this one, the trial court denied

Baker's motion for a new trial: 

<P>

"The class action and the instant case not only are distant in time but also 

<P>

are largely dissimilar in subject matter. The pertinent legal test is whether 

<P>

the questions to which the juror failed to respond bore '"a substantial 

<P>

likelihood of uncovering a strong potential juror bias."' In re Hitchings, 6 

<P>

Cal. 4th 97, 111 (1993). This Court finds and concludes that (a) the 

<P>

questions to which Mr. Carpenter failed to respond did not bear a 

<P>

substantial likelihood of uncovering a strong potential juror bias; (b) Mr. 

<P>

Carpenter's failure to mention the earlier lawsuit was neither willful nor 

<P>

reflective of bias on his part; (c) the deliberations and determinations of 

<P>

the jurors, including Mr. Carpenter himself, were unaffected by the class 

<P>

action; and (d) the defendants received a fair trial." (10 AA 2965) 

<P>

This Court "has the obligation to review 'the entire record, including the evidence, so as

to make an independent determination whether the error was prejudicial.'" Hasson v. Ford

Motor Co., 32 Cal. 3d 388, 417 n.10 (1982), cert. dismissed, 459 U.S. 1190 (1983)

(citation omitted). "If, on appeal from the judgment, the appellate court gives weight to

a lower court order denying a new trial, interfering only for an abuse of discretion, then

the appellate court abdicates"or at least seriously dilutes"its constitutional

obligation." Wilkinson v. Southern Pac. Co., 224 Cal. App. 2d 478, 483 (1964). And here,

with the possible exception of the trial court's conclusory assertion that the juror's

failure to disclose was not willful or reflective of personal bias, the pertinent facts

were uncontroverted, and the trial court's "find[ing]s and conclu[sion]s" were on issues

of law, which an appellate court always reviews de novo. 

<P>

"[C]ivil litigants are just as entitled [as criminal defendants] to a fair trial. The

right to a trial by a jury of 12 unbiased and unprejudiced jurors is jurisdictional."

Province v. Center for Women's Health & Family Birth, 20 Cal. App. 4th 1673, 1679 (1993)

(citation omitted). And "'[j]uror concealment, regardless whether intentional, to

questions bearing a substantial likelihood of uncovering a strong potential of juror bias,

undermines the peremptory challenge process.'" In re Hitchings, 6 Cal. 4th 97, 111 (1993)

(citations omitted). Mr. Carpenter failed to reveal highly relevant and pertinent

information on voir dire. "If the voir dire questioning is sufficiently specific to elicit

the information which [was] not disclosed . . . the defendant has established a prima

facie case of concealment." People v. Blackwell, 191 Cal. App. 3d 925, 929 (1987); see

People v. Kelly, 185 Cal. App. 3d 118, 126 (1986) (issue is whether the juror was "asked

the type of questions necessary to elicit the information which was later revealed");

Wiley v. Southern Pac. Transp. Co., 220 Cal. App. 3d 177, 189 (1990) ("In ruling on a

motion for a new trial premised on misrepresentation by a juror during voir dire, a trial

court is required to determine whether the questions propounded to the juror were relevant

and unambiguous"). The questions put to Carpenter"including whether anyone close to him

had been subject to discrimination in the workplace"were undoubtedly specific enough to

have elicited at least some disclosure of his wife's lawsuit. And, had Mr. Carpenter

simply raised his hand and mentioned this relevant experience, counsel would have had a

chance to ask additional questions about the nature of the earlier lawsuit and settlement,

no doubt leading to the revelation that the same lawyer representing Plaintiff had been

lead counsel in that earlier action. As it was, counsel had no opportunity to question Mr.

Carpenter about the earlier lawsuit. Cf. Jutzi v. County of Los Angeles, 196 Cal. App. 3d

637, 654-56 (1987) (no juror misconduct where juror revealed on voir dire that she had

been a patient years earlier at defendant hospital: "[o]nce her experience was revealed it

was the function of plaintiff's attorney to explore the subject if he wished and decide

for himself whether a potential for juror bias existed") (emphasis added; citation

omitted). 

<P>

The voir dire questions to which Mr. Carpenter failed to respond obviously had "a

substantial likelihood of uncovering a strong potential of juror bias." In re Hitchings, 6

Cal. 4th at 111 (emphasis added). His wife's lawsuit dealt with discrimination against

women in the workplace. Just as here, the earlier case was a case brought by Mr. Exelrod

against a large employer alleging discriminatory practices against women. It is simply

incorrect to say, as the trial court claimed, that the two cases "are largely dissimilar

in subject matter." 10 AA 2965. Sexual harassment is a form of gender discrimination. Rojo

v. Kliger, 52 Cal. 3d 65, 73 n.4, 90 (1990); Accardi v. Superior Court, 17 Cal. App. 4th

341, 347-48 (1993). Indeed, the complaint in the earlier action included explicit

allegations that female employees were subject to retaliation, including "harassment." 8

AA 2329. While the class action settlement for workplace gender based discrimination was,

as the trial court pointed out, some thirteen years earlier, it must have made a strong

impression on Mr. and Mrs. Carpenter, for they discussed it at the time of jury selection.

A juror whose wife had herself been the victim of gender-based discrimination in the

workplace sufficiently serious as to warrant a class action and substantial monetary

settlement is likely to have strong feelings on the subject that could affect his

evaluation of a suit concerning a related form of gender-based discrimination in the

workplace. 

<P>

Had Mr. Carpenter responded to voir dire with a reference to the earlier case, there would

have been a "substantial likelihood" of uncovering significant bias on his part. Moreover,

once it was revealed that Mr. Exelrod had been the Plaintiffs' counsel in the earlier

action, Mr. Carpenter would almost certainly have been excused for cause for that reason

as well. The undisclosed information was certainly "sufficiently material" to the issues

at trial, because Mr. Carpenter's knowledge of his wife's lawsuit and settlement"which

they discussed during jury selection at this trial"was "'inherently likely to have

influenced the juror.'" In re Hitchings, 6 Cal. 4th at 118 (citation omitted); see People

v. Blackwell, 191 Cal. App. at 930-31 (1987) (juror misconduct where juror failed to

reveal that she had been the victim of an abusive husband in prosecution of a woman for

killing her husband whom she claimed was abusive; court reversed order denying a new

trial). 

<P>

And even if Mr. Carpenter had not been removed for cause, Baker could have exercised a

peremptory challenge to remove him from the jury. Without the information Mr. Carpenter

failed to reveal, however, Baker's statutory right to exercise a peremptory challenge""'a

critical safeguard of the right to a fair trial before an impartial jury'" (In re

Hitchings, 6 Cal. 4th at 111 (citation omitted))"was eviscerated. See People v. Diaz, 152

Cal. App. 3d 926, 935 (1984) ("The failure of a juror to respond to a relevant, direct,

and unambiguous question leaves the examining attorney uninformed and unable to ask any

follow-up questions to elicit the necessary facts to intelligently reach a decision to

exercise a peremptory challenge or to challenge a juror for cause"). 

<P>

The trial court's order explaining its rejection of Baker's claim of juror misconduct also

included a conclusory statement that "Carpenter's failure to mention the earlier lawsuit

was neither willful nor reflective of bias on his part . . . ." 10 AA 2965. With all

respect, this statement cannot withstand critical scrutiny. Voir dire is a serious event

which courts expect jurors to take seriously. See generally In re Hitchings, 6 Cal. 4th at

110-11; Blackwell, 191 Cal. App. 3d at 929. It is neither credible, nor acceptable, for a

juror to claim that his untruthful answer to an unambiguous question posed at voir dire

occurred because he did not "understand or hear." But in this case, that explanation was

preposterous, for Mr. Carpenter has admitted that he had discussed the prior settlement

with his wife at the time of jury selection, and that at the time of his voir dire, he

"was sitting there waiting to answer [and] ready to tell . . . but they never asked." 9 AA

2647. In any event, even a negligent failure of a juror to truthfully answer sufficiently

specific questions properly posed during voir dire would be intolerable and would

constitute juror misconduct. 

<P>

"It is well settled that a presumption of prejudice arises from any juror misconduct."

People v. Honeycutt, 20 Cal. 3d 150, 156 (1977) (emphasis added); In re Hitchings, 6 Cal.

4th at 118 ("the concealment of material information on voir dire raises the presumption

of prejudice"); Young v. Brunicardi, 187 Cal. App. 3d at 1348 ("Once juror misconduct is

established in either a criminal or civil case, a presumption of prejudice will arise")

(citing cases). Of course, that presumption of prejudice "'"may be rebutted by an

affirmative evidentiary showing that prejudice does not exist or by a reviewing court's

examination of the entire record to determine whether there is a reasonable probability of

actual harm to the complaining party [resulting from the misconduct]."'" In re Hitchings,

6 Cal. 4th at 119 (citations omitted; bracketed insertion by Hitchings Court; emphasis

added). Here, the only evidence offered by Plaintiff to rebut the presumption of prejudice

was the "self- serving statement of impartiality" in Mr. Carpenter's declaration. Diaz,

152 Cal. App. 3d at 937 (noting "the lack of any rebuttal evidence other than [the

juror's] self- serving statement of impartiality"). But the trial court properly struck

these statements in Mr. Carpenter's declaration pursuant to Evidence Code Section 1150(a),

a ruling that Plaintiff has not challenged. 10 AA 2965-66. Plaintiff therefore produced no

admissible evidence to counter the presumption of prejudice. Given the lack of any

"'affirmative evidentiary showing that prejudice does not exist' . . . 'there is a

reasonable probability of actual harm to [appellant] resulting from the misconduct.'"

Blackwell, 191 Cal. App. 3d at 931 (citations omitted). 

<P>

Indeed, the record affirmatively shows that Baker was prejudiced by Mr. Carpenter's

participation in the verdict. It does not matter whether Mr. Carpenter's bias also

influenced other jurors during deliberations; that it may have influenced his vote is

enough. Question No. 2 of the special verdict form asked whether Plaintiff was caused

"injury, damage or harm" by sexual harassment. Only if the jury answered "Yes" to this

question could it go on to assess compensatory damages and liability for punitive damages.

7 AA 1776. The jury voted 9 to 3 in the affirmative on Question No. 2. RT 3560-61. It was

polled and juror Carpenter stated that he cast his vote with the majority. RT 3560; see RT

370. Juror Carpenter's vote necessarily was a deciding one. In this circumstance, where

there was concealment of material facts on voir dire by a juror whose vote was

indispensable for the finding of liability, the judgment against Baker must be reversed

and a new trial ordered. See Weathers v. Kaiser Found. Hosps., 5 Cal. 3d at 110 ("Since

the verdict was nine to three, the disqualification for bias of any one of the majority

jurors could have resulted in a different verdict"); Province v. Center for Women's Health

& Family Birth, 20 Cal. App. 4th at 1680 ("Even if we were to assume that Frith convinced

no other juror to find for defendant, his conduct is prejudicial because the final tally

was nine to three"). 

<P>

VI. THE TRIAL COURT'S AWARD OF ATTORNEY'S FEES MUST BE REDUCED. 

<P>

A. The Trial Court's Award Of Attorney's Fees Must Be Recalculated If 

<P>

This Court Reverses Or Revises The Judgment On The Merits. 

<P>

If the Court accepts any of the arguments made in Parts I through V, the judgment will

either be reversed (Part V), or the $3.5 million punitive damages judgment against Baker

will be eliminated (Part I), remanded for a new trial (Part III), or reduced to $225,000

(Part II) or to some other amount (Part IV). If both the compensatory and punitive damages

judgments are reversed, Plaintiff's award of attorney's fees must similarly be reversed,

and determination of Plaintiff's entitlement to attorney's fees and the amount of any fee

award will have to await relitigation of the merits. See California Grocers Ass'n v. Bank

of America, 22 Cal. App. 4th 205, 220 (1994) ("An order awarding . . . fees [under Code of

Civil Procedure Section 1021.5] falls with a reversal of the judgment on which it is

based"). 

<P>

The fee award will also have to be reversed if the $3.5 million punitive damages award is

reversed or reduced, even though the $50,000 compensatory damages award is left

undisturbed. In that event, this Court's ruling will have "significantly altered"

Plaintiff's entitlement to attorney's fees, and Plaintiff's fee claim will have to be

redetermined in light of that decision. See Neecke v. City of Mill Valley, 39 Cal. App.

4th 946, 965-66 (1995) (fee award vacated where appellate decision deprived Plaintiff of

victory on significant issue). 

<P>

That redetermination can be done by either this Court or the trial court. Laurel Heights

Improvement Ass'n v. Regents of the University of California, 47 Cal. 3d 376, 426-27

(1988). This Court may not wish to determine the amount of any revised award itself, in

light of the voluminous factual record. But there is an obvious public interest in

resolving the fee issue without another round of costly appellate litigation. Accordingly,

if a remand of the fees issue is necessary, this Court should set forth in its opinion the

principles that should guide the trial court's redetermination of attorney's fees. 

<P>

Those principles are simple and straightforward. Under California law, the starting point

for every fee award is determination of counsel's lodestar"the reasonable number of hours

worked times a reasonable hourly rate. Press v. Lucky Stores, Inc., 34 Cal. 3d 311, 322

(1983). But the court "may adjust that product upward or downward in light of the results

obtained, among other factors." Wallace v. Consumers Cooperative, 170 Cal. App. 3d 836,

850 (1985). "[U]nder state law as well as federal law, a reduced fee award is appropriate

when a claimant achieves only limited success." Sokolow v. County of San Mateo, 213 Cal.

App. 3d 231, 249 (1989); accord, Feminist Women's Health Ctr. v. Blythe, 32 Cal. App. 4th

1641, 1674 (1995), cert. denied, 133 L. Ed. 2d 423 (1995). Accordingly, courts in numerous

cases have awarded less than the lodestar because the plaintiff was unsuccessful on one or

more claims. See, e.g., Californians for Responsible Toxics Management v. Kizer, 211 Cal.

App. 3d 961, 973-75 (1989) (reducing fee award to 35 percent of lodestar in view of

plaintiff's limited success). Indeed, the lodestar itself may be reduced when "a plaintiff

has achieved only partial or limited success," because in such cases "the product of hours

reasonably expended on the litigation as a whole times a reasonable hourly rate may be an

excessive amount." Feminist Women's Health Ctr., 32 Cal. App. 4th at 1674 n.8 (quoting

Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424, 435-36 (1983)). 

<P>

Plaintiff's claim for a multi-million dollar fee relied heavily on the size of the

punitive damage award. See, e.g., 9 AA 2677 ("The significant results obtained in this

case similarly support a substantial enhancement of plaintiff's relatively modest

lodestar, above the enhancement ordinarily awarded to compensate for contingency risk").

The trial court similarly relied on the punitive damages judgment as a basis for its fee

award, stating that "despite the difficulty of the case, plaintiff's counsel achieved

large, if not unprecedented, financial success." 16 AA 4466. 

<P>

If the punitive damage award against Baker is eliminated or drastically reduced, however,

the basis for a multi-million dollar fee award will have been eliminated. Indeed, "[a]n

appellate decision reducing the plaintiff's damages requires a reconsideration of the

original fee award." R. Pearl, California Attorney Fee Awards  12.16 at 12-17 (2d ed.

1995). Thus, in McGinnis v. Kentucky Fried Chicken, 51 F.3d 805, 810 (9th Cir. 1995), the

Court of Appeals required the trial court to reconsider plaintiff's attorney's fee award

after reversing the plaintiff's award of punitive damages, decreasing plaintiff's total

damage award from $234,000 to $34,000. 

<P>

If the punitive damages judgment is eliminated altogether (because Plaintiff has failed to

show sufficient evidence under Civil Code Section 3294(b)), Plaintiff should not be able

to recover for the time her lawyers spent pursuing such relief. "[I]t is generally

undesirable to award fees for time expended unsuccessfully on major portions of a

lawsuit." Bingham v. Obledo, 147 Cal. App. 3d 401, 407 (1983). Plaintiff's effort to

obtain punitive damages was unquestionably a "major portion" of this case. 

<P>

The fee award must similarly be reduced if the punitive damages award is substantially

reduced. "[W]here the plaintiff achieve[s] only limited success, the [trial] court should

award only that amount of fees that is reasonable in relation to the results obtained."

Daniels v. McKinney, 146 Cal. App. 3d 42, 55 (1983) (quoting Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461

U.S. at 440). Baker conceded below that the more than 3,350 hours that Plaintiff's counsel

spent litigating this case to judgment was reasonable to secure a punitive damages award

of $3.5 million. See 16 AA 4463; 13 AA 3752. But it would have been manifestly

unreasonable to spend 3350 hours to secure an award of $225,000 or some similar sum.

Consequently, if the punitive damages award is eliminated or reduced, the attorney's fee

award must be reduced commensurately. 

<P>

B. Because Plaintiff's Counsel Stood To Receive Almost $2.4 Million If 

<P>

The Trial Court Awarded The Lodestar, The Trial Court Should Not 

<P>

Have Enhanced Plaintiff's Fee Award Through The Use Of A Multiplier. 

<P>

Even if the damages award is not reduced, the attorney's fee award must be modified. In

the unique factual context of this case, in which Plaintiff's counsel stood to receive a

multi-million dollar fee award whatever the trial court did, the trial court's decision to

award Plaintiff's counsel a "multiplier" of almost $650,000 was an abuse of discretion. 

<P>

The fee agreement between Plaintiff and her counsel provides that, if the case is

appealed, counsel will receive fifty percent "of any and all moneys or other compensation

that may be paid or become due through . . . judgment, or otherwise; which includes

attorney's fees awarded in the . . . matter." 13 AA 3774. Thus, even if Plaintiff were not

entitled to an award of attorney's fees under FEHA, if the existing judgment were affirmed

her counsel would receive an attorney's fee of $1,887,500, plus interest from the date of

judgment at 10 per cent. 

<P>

Nevertheless, as the prevailing party in this action, Plaintiff is also entitled to

receive an additional award of attorney's fees. But that award must be reasonable.

Government Code Section 12965(b) provides that, in an action to enforce FEHA, the court

"may award to the prevailing party reasonable attorney's fees and costs . . . ." (Emphasis

added). Similarly, while no requirement of reasonableness can be found in the text of Code

of Civil Procedure Section 1021.5, "[t]he limitation to a reasonable fee is so inherent

and essential to section 1021.5 that it must be considered 'necessarily implied.'"

California Labor Federation v. Occupational Safety & Health Standards Bd., 5 Cal. App. 4th

985, 995 (1992). 

<P>

In an effort to narrow the issues in dispute and minimize the expense of fee- related

proceedings, Baker stipulated in the trial court that the hours Plaintiff's counsel

expended in securing the judgment as modified by the post-trial rulings were reasonable,

and stipulated as well to the reasonableness of counsel's hourly rates and billing

practices. 13 AA 3752. Multiplying the hours worked by Plaintiff's counsel times the

hourly rates gives the "lodestar," which in this case is $921,565. 16 AA 4464. If the

trial court had only awarded the lodestar, Plaintiff's counsel would have received a total

fee of $2,348,282.50"i.e., the $1,887,500 counsel would have received in the absence of

any fee award plus half of the $921,565 lodestar ($460,782.50)"plus interest at 10%. This

figure is 2.55 times the lodestar fee. But the trial court was not satisfied with this

amount. It decided to enhance the lodestar by a "multiplier" of 1.7, which resulted in a

fee award of $1,566,660.50 for work on the merits. 

<P>

If the trial court's award of attorney's fees is affirmed, Plaintiff's counsel will

receive a total fee of $2,783,330.25, i.e., 50 per cent of the judgment plus half of the

merits-related fee award ($1,566,660.50) plus interest at 10 interest. Plaintiff's two

trial counsel and their paralegal worked a total of 3,628.7 hours. 16 AA 4463. Thus, the

trial court's fee award effectively compensates these three individuals at a "blended

rate" of $767 per hour, even though the stipulated hourly rates for the two attorneys and

the paralegal were $300, $250, and $100, respectively. 16 AA 4463. Moreover, counsel's

total fee of $2.783 million is 73.72 per cent of the $3.775 million in total damages won

by Plaintiff. 

<P>

This fee is plainly unreasonable. Indeed, "[o]ur Supreme Court has observed that an

attorney fee award of this proportion would be 'grossly excessive' and 'unconscionable.'"

People ex rel. Dep't of Transp. v. Yuki, 31 Cal. App. 4th 1754, 1772 (1995) (quoting

Jackson v. Campbell, 215 Cal. 103, 106 (1932)). Thus, in Yuki, the Court of Appeal

invalidated a fee award that would have given the prevailing parties' counsel "over 70

percent of the net amount recovered by [the prevailing parties] at trial." Id. And the

effective hourly rate of the fee award invalidated in Yuki was $870 per hour (id. at 1774

n.12), comparable to the effective hourly rate in this case of $767. 

<P>

The trial court in this case attempted to justify this exorbitant fee by using a

multiplier to calculate the award. But while the court stated that the multiplier was

justified in order to provide "added incentive to plaintiff's counsel and other counsel to

undertake in the future meritorious civil rights litigation on a contingency fee basis"

(16 AA 4468), the court did not even begin to inquire whether an effective hourly rate of

$767 was necessary to induce counsel to litigate civil rights cases. Instead, based on a

misreading of state and federal law (see pp. 96-98, infra), it simply refused to consider

the impact of Plaintiff's contingency fee agreement on her fee request: 

<P>

"Defendants contend that the lodestar for merits work should be adjusted 

<P>

downward, rather than upward, because the fee agreement between 

<P>

plaintiff and her counsel provides generous compensation to counsel, 

<P>

calculated as a percentage of plaintiff's total recovery, including 

<P>

compensatory damages, punitive damages, and attorney's fees awarded by 

<P>

the court. The Court rejects defendant's contention. 

<P>

"Federal courts recognize that 'reasonable fees should be granted 

<P>

regardless of the individual plaintiff's fee obligations'. Blanchard v. 

<P>

Bergeron, 489 U.S. 87, 93 (1989). Similarly, the California Supreme Court 

<P>

has declined to decrease attorney's fee awards based upon whether 

<P>

attorneys could look to other sources for payment, saying that this 'would 

<P>

create a windfall to the defendants.' Serrano v. Unruh, 32 Cal. 3d 621, 642 

<P>

(1982).

<P>

"In the Court's view, the provisions of plaintiff's fee agreement do not 

<P>

alter the conclusion that, for all the reasons previously stated, a multiplier 

<P>

of 1.7 for merits work is fair and reasonable." (16 AA 4468-69) 

<P>

The trial court's ipse dixit is both legally and factually erroneous. To begin with, the

trial court was quite wrong in holding the fee agreement irrelevant. Under California law,



<P>

"[a] trial court may not determine a 'reasonable attorney fee solely by 

<P>

reference to the amount due under a contingency agreement. However, the 

<P>

court may consider the contingent nature of the fee agreement as one 

<P>

factor in determining a reasonable fee." (People ex rel. Dep't of Transp. v. 

<P>

Yuki, 31 Cal. App. 4th 1754, 1770-71 (1995) (citations omitted) 

<P>

(emphasis in original).

Numerous other California cases reach the same result. See, e.g., Camacho v. Schaefer, 193

Cal. App. 3d 718, 724 (1987); Salton Bay Marina, Inc. v. Imperial Irrigation Dist., 172

Cal. App. 3d 914, 956 (1985); Vella v. Hudgins, 151 Cal. App. 3d 515, 520-21 (1984). 

<P>

In support of its conclusion that the fee agreement did not affect Plaintiff's entitlement

to a multiplier, the trial court cited two cases, Blanchard v. Bergeron, 489 U.S. 87

(1989) and Serrano v. Unruh, 32 Cal. 3d 621 (1982). Neither supports the trial court's

ruling. The quote from Blanchard ("reasonable fees should be granted regardless of the

individual plaintiff's fee obligations") is not the court's statement of the law, but

simply a paraphrase of one of four decisions of the lower federal courts cited in the

legislative history of the federal Civil Rights Attorney's Fees Award Act. 489 U.S. at

92-93. And the quote from Serrano is taken from the portion of the Court's opinion holding

that a fee award sought by a public interest law firm should be decreased because such

groups pay lawyers lower salaries than do private law firms. That holding is irrelevant to

the issue presented here. Whether legal services lawyers should receive the same fee

awards as private practitioners has nothing to do with whether private practitioners and

their legal assistants should receive an effective rate of $767 per hour. 

<P>

Two cases from the First Circuit make this point clear, and show why the trial court's use

of a multiplier was error. The language quoted by the trial court from Serrano is, in

fact, a portion of a quote from the decision of the First Circuit in Palmigiano v.

Garrahy, 616 F.2d 598, 602 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 839 (1980). But the First

Circuit has since held (without citing Palmigiano) that a multiplier is inappropriate

where a pre-existing fee agreement assures the attorney of generous compensation even

without a fee award. In Biggins v. Hazen Paper Co., 953 F.2d 1405 (1st Cir.), cert.

denied, 505 U.S. 1222 (1992), vacated on other grounds, 507 U.S. 604 (1993), the plaintiff

had a contingency fee agreement with counsel that, as in this case, provided for a fee of

more than twice the lodestar even without a fee award. Under these circumstances the First

Circuit held that Plaintiff was not entitled to a multiplier: 

<P>

"It appears to us that in this case fee enhancement is not warranted. . . . 

<P>

[P]laintiff's attorneys are entitled to fees under their contingent fee 

<P>

arrangement of more than twice the amount of the lodestar fee award. 

<P>

Plaintiff's counsel . . . will in fact be rewarded with a premium in excess 

<P>

of his normal hourly rates.

<P>

"The substantial recovery of damages in this case stands in contrast to the 

<P>

situations in a majority of civil rights cases in which the damages are so 

<P>

low that fees based on a contingent fee agreement are less that the lodestar 

<P>

recoverable as attorney's fees. . . . Under the circumstances of this case, 

<P>

fee enhancement is not necessary because the contingency arrangement 

<P>

more than adequately compensates [plaintiff's] attorneys for the risk 

<P>

undertaken in accepting this case." (Id. at 1428) 

<P>

Biggins is by no means unique. In Price v. Marshall Erdman & Associates, 966 F.2d 320 (7th

Cir. 1992), the Seventh Circuit made a similar point in affirming the denial of a

multiplier in a damages case: 

<P>

"[I]n a substantial money case on behalf of a client with whom a lawyer 

<P>

can negotiate a contingent fee, the lawyer can protect himself against the 

<P>

risk of coming up empty without the judge's having to increase the court 

<P>

-awarded fee to which the plaintiff will become entitled if he wins; and 

<P>

therefore the plaintiff does not require the prospect of a multiplier in order 

<P>

to obtain representation. . . . When the lawyer can protect himself through 

<P>

the market against the risk of not being able to collect a fee, there is no 

<P>

need for the court to protect him against that risk as well in order to make 

<P>

sure that civil rights plaintiffs can obtain adequate representation." (Id. at 

<P>

328) Accord, In re Continental Illinois Sec. Litig., 962 F. 2d 566, 573 (7th 

<P>

Cir. 1992) (contingent fee contract "takes care of the risk of loss and thus 

<P>

makes the inclusion of a risk multiple in the statutory award redundant"). 

<P>

Biggins and Price destroy the trial court's rationale for awarding a multiplier. The

private fee agreement reached between Plaintiff and her counsel would have provided

counsel with a fee of 2.55 times the lodestar if the trial court had simply based the

award on the lodestar amount. While the trial court stated that additional compensation

was necessary in order to provide "added incentive to plaintiff's counsel and other

counsel to undertake in the future meritorious civil rights litigation on a contingency

fee basis" (16 AA 4468), it provided no basis for the startling conclusion that a total

fee of 2.7 times the lodestar was necessary to provide an "added incentive" for lawyers to

take civil rights cases. Indeed, because the trial court misread Blanchard and Serrano to

prohibit consideration of the fee agreement, it did not need to even ask"much less

answer"why a multiplier was necessary in light of counsel's contractual right to

multi-million dollar compensation. Had it done so, it could only have concluded"like the

courts in Biggins and Price"that the contingent fee agreement in this case made a

multiplier unnecessary to provide "added incentive." 

<P>

As the Court of Appeal stated in Washburn v. City of Berkeley, 195 Cal. App. 3d 578

(1987), the primary purpose of a fee award is to "reimburse[] the plaintiff for some of

the expense incurred in seeking relief." Id. at 587. The need for such reimbursement is

greatest when a plaintiff's recovery consists primarily of compensatory damages; in such

cases, a fee award ensures that the plaintiff's need to pay her attorney will not prevent

her from receiving full compensation for her injuries. But that goal is irrelevant in this

case, where the plaintiff's recovery consists almost entirely of punitive damages. Such

damages "constitute a windfall, which, though supported by law in proper cases . . . ,

creates the anomaly of excessive compensation . . . ." 16 AA 4466 (quoting Rosener v.

Sears Roebuck & Co., 110 Cal. App. 3d 740, 750 (1980), appeal dismissed, 450 U.S. 1051

(1981)); see also Adams v. Murakami, 54 Cal. 3d 105, 120 (1991). 

<P>

The trial court stated that "[w]here a plaintiff has secured a substantial windfall in the

form of punitive damages, a more moderate approach may be appropriate in determining what

multiplier to select." 16 AA 4467. For the reasons discussed, that was an understatement,

as no multiplier at all was warranted. But the court eschewed even a "moderate approach"

and awarded counsel a multiplier worth almost $650,000 on top of a $2,348,282.50

contingency fee based on the total recovery and the lodestar. While the court based the

multiplier on the supposed need to provide "added incentive" to bring civil rights cases,

neither logic nor evidence demonstrates that such extraordinary compensation is necessary

to accomplish this laudable goal. The trial court's use of a multiplier therefore must be

reversed. 

<P>

<B>CONCLUSION</B>

<P>

For the foregoing reasons, the judgment should be reversed insofar as it imposes upon

Baker liability for punitive damages of $3.5 million. Alternatively, the punitive damages

should be reduced to $225,000 (for the reasons stated in Part II) or $300,000 (for the

reasons stated in Part IV). In addition, the trial court's award of attorney's fees should

be reduced (for the reasons stated in Part VI).

<P>Editor's Note: Chief Justice of the United States William Rehnquist

made these remarks regarding an independent judiciary following the

recent controversy over President Clinton's public pressure on

federal judge Harold Baer. Among the remarks of the Chief Justice:  </P>

<PRE>



</PRE>

<P>"The framers of the United States Constitution came up with two quite

original ideas -- the first was the idea of a chief executive who was

not responsible to the legislature, as Chief Executives are under the

parliamentary system.  The second was the idea of an independent

judiciary with the authority to declare laws passed by Congress

unconstitutional. The first idea -- a President not responsible to

Congress -- has not been widely copied by other nations in the

western world when they have come to review their systems of

government.  But the second idea -- that of an independent judiciary

with the authority to finally interpret a written constitution -- has

caught on with many other nations, particularly since the end of the

Second World War. It is one of the crown jewels of our system of

government today." </P>





<P align=center><B>REMARKS OF THE CHIEF JUSTICE</P>



<P align=center>WASHINGTON COLLEGE OF LAW CENTENNIAL CELEBRATION </P>



<P align=center>PLENARY ACADEMIC PANEL: THE FUTURE OF THE FEDERAL COURTS </P>



<P align=center>AMERICAN UNIVERSITY<BR>

April 9, 1996</B></P>





<P>It is a great pleasure to be here this evening and participate in

American University Washington College of Law's celebration of its

centennial.  And since the federal judiciary celebrated its

bicentennial only a few years ago, this is an appropriate occasion to

speak about the future of the federal courts.  But it will be

helpful, in trying to forecast the future of the federal courts, to

look briefly at how they have evolved over the more than two hundred

years they have been in existence. </P>





<P>The federal court system in the United States got off to a remarkably

slow start two hundred years ago.  The Supreme Court ruled quite

early in the game that there were no common law crimes in the federal

courts, and therefore no criminal prosecutions could be had unless

authorized by an act of Congress criminalizing certain conduct.  The

federal trial courts had no "federal question" jurisdiction until

1875; this meant that if an individual wished to bring a lawsuit

claiming that a right secured him by the federal constitution had

been violated, that lawsuit had to be brought in state court.  The

Supreme Court of the United States could review a decision by the

highest court of a state which decided a federal question, but the

lower federal courts were not involved.  Thus for nearly the first

century of their existence, the staple of the business of the lower

federal courts was admiralty cases and cases in which jurisdiction

was based on diversity of citizenship. </P>



<P>But this distribution of business between the state court systems and

the federal courts changed quite dramatically after the Civil War. 

In the aftermath of the conflict, the so-called Civil War amendments

to the Constitution were adopted, and of those the Fourteenth

Amendment has been a prolific source of judicial business. In 1875

federal district courts were given federal question jurisdiction, so

that from then on cases involving constitutional claims could be

initiated in the federal courts.  Finally, the public view of the

appropriate role for the federal government changed after the Civil

War - - although the change moved in fits and starts at first, it

inexorably moved in the direction of greater federal regulation of

the citizenry.  Until well after the Civil War, the general view was

that the federal government should provide for the common defense,

coin money, carry the mails, and pay for itself by collecting customs

duties. But the increasing pace of the Industrial Revolution, the

rapid spread of the railroad into every nook and cranny of the

nation, the increasing size of manufacturing enterprises all provoked

calls for regulation of what was increasingly a commerce which paid

scant attention to state borders. </P>



<P>Before the turn of the twentieth century, Congress had passed the

Interstate Commerce Act, giving a federal commission some control

over railroad rates and practices, and the Sherman Anti-Trust Act,

forbidding conspiracies in restraint of trade.  As we moved into the

twentieth century, the coming of the automobile and the airplane

continued the transportation revolution.  The pace of increase in

federal regulation continued, driven partly by the interstate nature

of so much of the country's business, and partly by a number of

reform movements seeking to ameliorate the plight of those who did

not share in the generally rising tide of prosperity.  The typical

pattern was for reform movements to originate in the states, only to

discover that the practices which they sought to prohibit or limit

could not be prohibited or limited to their satisfaction without the

intervention of the federal government. </P>



<P>First came concern about wages and hours worked in factories, and

child labor there.  States adopted maximum hour and minimum wage

laws, and laws prohibiting child labor.  But as often as not the

manufacturing plants which would be effected by these laws would pick

up and move to a state which did not have such laws.  Congress,

viewing this phenomenon with dismay, finally itself enacted federal

prohibitions against child labor, and later a federal maximum hour

and minimum wage law.  This pattern has continued in various areas of

the law.  A wave of reform lead to the enactment by the states of

"blue sky" laws in the first part of this century, regulating the

business of issuing and selling stock, and punishing fraud.  But

these laws were deemed inadequate, and the federal government stepped

in as a part of President Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal to enact

federal regulations in that field.  In the 1950s, many states enacted

fair employment practice laws and anti-discrimination laws governing

public accommodations and the like.  But some states chose not to

enact such laws, and dissatisfied reformers went to Congress to

nationalize this field of lawmaking.  The result was the Civil Rights

laws enacted in the 1960s. </P>



<P>The wave of federal regulatory statutes also brings with it related

problems that give rise to legal disputes. In the first place,

disputes arise as to whether an agency or commission that is

empowered to issue regulations under a statute has exceeded its

authority with respect to one or more particular regulations. 

Federal courts must decide these questions, as well as basic

questions of statutory interpretation.  Second, because of the

Supremacy Clause in our Constitution, every time Congress enacts a

new statute dealing with some phase of the economy it very likely

supersedes some of the laws of the various states which previously

governed that area.  For example, in 1974 Congress enacted the

modestly titled Employees Retirement Income Security Act, which had

as its basic purpose the introduction of some federal supervision

over employer plans to provide various health and retirement benefits

to employees.  In the twenty years in which that statute has been on

the books, our Court has decided twenty-one cases involving the

question of whether or not the federal law preempted a particular

state law dealing with the same general subject matter.  And that, of

course, is only the tip of the iceberg; if the Supreme Court has

decided that number of cases, the federal appeals courts will have

decided fifteen or twenty times that number of cases dealing with

preemption under this particular federal statute.  </P>



<P>The result of this two hundred year evolution has been that although

ninety-five percent of the judicial business in the United States is

still transacted in state courts, there has been a remarkable

increase in the business of the federal courts because of these

changes which I have described.  And the federal courts are now awash

in the most recent of these changes, which is the federalization of

more and more crimes which once were thought to be matters of

exclusive concern to the states. </P>



<P>Forty some years ago when I began the practice of law in Arizona,

there were not many federal criminal statutes on the books.  There

were some very esoteric crimes, but the staple of the criminal

business of federal courts outside of the metropolitan areas was

confined to prosecutions for transporting a stolen car in interstate

commerce, using the mails for interstate communications to commit

fraud, and a very few other similar crimes. </P>



<P>But that landscape has entirely changed in the last forty years. 

Congress, understandably concerned with the increasing traffic and

drugs and the violence resulting from the use of guns, has legislated

again and again to make what once were only state crimes federal

offenses. The same sort of dissatisfaction with state treatment of

the cases in this area of the law has obtained as obtained earlier

with welfare legislation and civil rights laws. Congress has been of

the opinion that even though these gun and drug crimes could be

prosecuted under state law, the state penal systems were too lenient

in paroling serious offenders after having served only a fraction of

the time to which they were sentenced.  So Congress has stepped in,

prescribed very severe sentencing guidelines for federal crimes, and

federalized countless crimes involving drugs and guns.  </P>



<P>All of this means that in talking about the future of the federal

courts, we must understand that Congress will probably continue to

enact new legislation which provides new causes of action for

litigants on the civil side of the docket, and new federal crimes to

be prosecuted on the criminal side of the federal docket. </P>



<P>It is the federal district courts of appeals that are being hit

hardest by this ever increasing wave of litigation.  The Supreme

Court's docket is actually down from what it was several years ago. 

With the district courts, it is largely a question of having enough

judicial manpower to adjudicate the incoming cases.  The same is true

to a large extent of the courts of appeals, except that indefinite

enlargement of the number of judges on the courts of appeals poses

problems of collegiality, maintaining a coherent body of law in the

circuit, and the like.  The majority of federal judges, if the

Judicial Conference of the United States accurately reflects their

views, think that the federal judiciary should remain a limited and

somewhat specialized system of administering justice.  Possible

alternatives to indefinite enlargement of the courts of appeals would

be the creation of specialized appellate courts for a particular

subject matter, or the limitation of the automatic right of appeal

from district courts to the courts of appeals.  We have on our panel

tonight two distinguished judges of the courts of appeals, Judge

Reinhardt and Judge Becker, and a distinguished district court judge,

Judge Barker, who can discuss these aspects of the federal courts

more knowledgeably than I can. </P>



<P>It would be a mistake to think that just because a certain kind of

judicial business has always been conducted in a particular way in

the past, it therefore ought to be conducted that way in the future. 

The federal courts, like other governmental institutions, must, where

necessary, change with the changing times.  A Long Range Planning

Committee of the Judicial Conference, of which both Judges Becker and

Barker were members, has recently peered into the future and come up

with a number of recommendations for how the federal judiciary can

cope with the changes which the future will assuredly bring.  But all

of the planning and discussion by judges as to the future of the

federal judiciary has a somewhat tentative, conditional air about it:

in this area we are not masters in our own houses and any major

change will have to be approved by Congress. </P>



<P>I have said that the judiciary must change with the changing times. 

But there are a very few essentials that are vital to the functioning

of the federal court system as we know it.  Surely one of these

essentials is the independence of the judges who sit on these courts.</P>





<P>Article III of the Constitution guarantees to federal judges the

right to continue in office during good behavior, and prohibits the

diminution of their compensation.  But these two constitutional

provisions did not settle every question about the independence of

the judiciary.  As a result, there have been several actions by

Congress over the years which have fleshed out the constitutional

provision in a manner akin to the development of an "unwritten

constitution" in Great Britain. </P>



<P>Article I of the Constitution provides that civil officers --

including judges -- may be impeached by the House of Representatives

for "high crimes and misdemeanors," and if convicted by the Senate

may be thereupon removed from office.  The term "high crimes and

misdemeanors" was sufficiently amorphous to leave open the

possibility that a federal judge could be removed from office, not

only for conduct that was criminal, but for rulings from the bench

that seemed flagrantly wrong.  </P>



<P>An important episode early in our nation's history in effect resolved

this question.  This was the impeachment trail of Samuel Chase, then

an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court, in 1805.  Chase had been

appointed to the Supreme Court by George Washington in 1796, but in

those days the Supreme Court docket was even lighter than it is

today; Supreme Court justices spent most of their judicial time

riding circuit trying lawsuits in tandem with the resident judge. 

Chase was a striking figure physically - - over six feet tall, with a

ruddy complexion which earned him the sobriquet (behind his back, of

course) of "Old Bacon Face."  He was able but imperious, and totally

lacking in the patience necessary for a trial judge. </P>



<P>Two years after Thomas Jefferson took office as President, in 1803,

Chase delivered a partisan charge to a grand jury in Baltimore. 

Jefferson, learning of this, wrote to his lieutenants in the House of

Representatives suggesting that they do something about it.  The

House proceeded to impeach Chase on a number of counts.  The first

count was the charge to the Baltimore grand jury. Other counts were

based on his conduct of the trial of John Fries for treason in

Philadelphia in 1800, and still others were based on his conduct in

the trial of James Callender in Richmond for violation of the

Sedition Act in the same year.  The trial before the Senate began in

February, 1805, presided over by the Vice President, Aaron Burr. 

Burr himself was a fugitive from justice at the time, having killed

Alexander Hamilton in a duel at Weehawken, New Jersey the preceding

summer.  Criminal indictments were out for him in both New Jersey and

New York, which caused one wag to remark that whereas in most courts

the criminal was arraigned before the judge, in this court the judge

was arraigned before the criminal. </P>



<P>More than fifty witnesses testified before the Senate. The charges

pertaining to the Fries trial did not amount to much -- at the most

they showed him to be headstrong and somewhat domineering, a trait

not unknown in other federal judges.  The charges in connection with

the Callender trial were a good deal more serious.  Callender was

charged under the Sedition Act with bringing President John Adams

into disrepute, inasmuch as he called him a toady to British

interests in a long and incredibly turgid book entitled "The Prospect

Before Us."  The evidence showed that Chase had actually taken the

book with him from Baltimore to Richmond in order to allow the grand

jury to consider it, and that during the stagecoach trip from

Baltimore to Richmond he referred to Callender as a "scoundrel" to

another passenger.  </P>



<P>On March 1, 1805, the Senate convened to vote on the articles of

impeachment against Chase.  At that time there were thirty-four

senators, twenty-five of whom were Jeffersonian Republicans.  If

these senators voted a party line, there would be the necessary

two-thirds majority to convict Chase and remove him from office. 

Happily, they broke ranks.  On the articles based on the Fries trial,

the vote was sixteen to convict, and eighteen to acquit.  The vote on

the articles relating to the Callender trial was eighteen to convict,

and sixteen for acquittal.  On the count based on the charge to the

Baltimore grand jury, the House managers came closest to prevailing

-- nineteen senators voted guilty, and fifteen voted not guilty.  But

even this number fell four votes short of the two-thirds majority

required, and Chase was therefore acquitted on all of the counts

against him. </P>



<P>This decision by the Senate was enormously important in securing the

kind of judicial independence contemplated by Article III.  Coming

only two years after the seminal decision of the Court in Marbury v.

Madison, it coupled with the authority of the federal courts to

declare legislative acts unconstitutional the assurance to federal

judges that their judicial acts -- their rulings from the bench --

would not be a basis for removal from office by impeachment and

conviction.  And that has been the guiding principle of the House of

Representatives and the Senate from that day to this; federal judges

have been impeached and convicted -- happily, only a very few -- but

it has been for criminal conduct such as tax evasion, perjury, and

the like.  </P>



<P>This principle only goes so far.  It obviously does not mean that

federal judges should not be criticized for the decisions which they

make; they are frequently so criticized by the media and by law

reviews, and there is certainly no reason why other citizens should

not engage in the same practice.  And the doctrine of judicial

independence does not mean that the country will be forever in sway

to groups of non-elected judges.  When vacancies occur through death

or retirement on any of the federal courts, replacements are

nominated by the President, who has been elected by the people of the

entire nation, subject to confirmation by the Senate, whose members

have been elected by the people of their respective states. Both the

President and the Senate have felt free to take into consideration

the likely judicial philosophy of any nominee to the federal courts. 

Thus there is indirect popular input into the selection of federal

judges.  </P>



<P>This principle is perhaps best illustrated by the experience of

President Franklin Roosevelt with appointments to the Supreme Court. 

Dissatisfied with decisions of that court which invalidated some

provisions of his New Deal program, he asked Congress to enact what

soon became known as a "court-packing plan," which would allow him to

replace any Justice over seventy who did not retire with an

additional Justice, up to the number of fifteen.  This rather bald

effort to change the philosophy of the Court was rejected by the

United States Senate in 1937.  But although Roosevelt lost that

battle, he eventually won the war by serving three full terms as

President and appointing eight of the nine members of the Court. 

This simply shows that there is a wrong way and a right way to go

about putting a popular imprint on the judiciary.  </P>



<P>The framers of the United States Constitution came up with two quite

original ideas -- the first was the idea of a chief executive who was

not responsible to the legislature, as Chief Executives are under the

parliamentary system.  The second was the idea of an independent

judiciary with the authority to declare laws passed by Congress

unconstitutional.  The first idea -- a President not responsible to

Congress -- has not been widely copied by other nations in the

western world when they have come to review their systems of

government.  But the second idea -- that of an independent judiciary

with the authority to finally interpret a written constitution - -

has caught on with many other nations, particularly since the end of

the Second World War.  It is one of the crown jewels of our system of

government today. </P>



<P>Change is the law of life, and the judiciary will have to change to

meet the challenges which will face it in the future.  But the

independence of the federal judiciary is essential to its proper

functioning and must be retained. </P>

Magistrate Judge Robert J. Kaufman</B></P>



<H2>NATURE OF THE ACTION</H2>



<P>This is an action under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as

amended, 42 U.S.C. &#167;  2000e et seq. ("Title VII"), and Title I

of the Civil Rights Act of 1991, 42 U.S.C. &#167;  1981 (A), to

correct unlawful employment practices on the basis of sex and

retaliation and to provide appropriate relief to a class of female

employees who were adversely affected by such practices.  As alleged

with greater particularity in paragraph 7, below, since at least

1990.  Defendant Mitsubishi Motor Manufacturing of America, Inc.,

f/k/a "Diamond-Star Motors Corporation," has engaged in a pattern and

practice of discrimination against a class of female employees by

subjecting them to sexual harassment and sex-based harassment,

retaliation, and constructive discharge. </P>



<H2>JURISDICTION AND VENUE</H2>



<P>1.  Jurisdiction of this Court is invoked pursuant to 28 U.S.C.

&#167; &#167; 451, 1331, 1337, 1343 and 1345.  This action is authorized

and instituted pursuant to &#167; &#167; 706 (f)(1) and (3) and &#167; 

707 of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. &#167; &#167; 2000e-5 (f)(1) and (3), and -6 </P>



<P>2.  The employment practices alleged to be unlawful were and are now

being committed within the jurisdiction of the United States District

Court for the Central District of Illinois, Peoria Division. </P>



<H2>PARTIES</H2>



<P>3.  Plaintiff, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (the

"Commission"), is the agency of the United States of America charges

with the administration, interpretation and enforcement of Title VII

and is expressly authorized to bring this action by &#167; &#167; 706

(f)(1) and (3) and &#167;  707 of title VII, 42 U.S.C. &#167; &#167;

2000e-5 (f)(1) and (3), and -6. </P>



<P>4.  At all relevant times, Defendant has continuously been an

Delaware corporation doing business in the State of Illinois and the

City of Normal, Illinois, and has continuously had at least fifteen

(15) employees. </P>



<P>5.  At all relevant times, Defendant has been and is now an employer

engaged in an industry affecting commerce within the meaning of

&#167; &#167; 701(b),(g), and (h) of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. &#167; &#167;

2000e(b), (g), and (h). </P>



<H2>STATEMENT OF CLAIMS</H2>



<P>6.  More than thirty (30) days prior to the institution of this

lawsuit, a Charge was filed with the Commission by R. Gaull

Silberman, a member thereof, alleging violations of Title VII by

Defendant.  All conditions precedent to the institution of this

lawsuit have been fulfilled. </P>



<P>7.  From at least 1990 until the present, Defendant has engaged in a

pattern and practice of unlawful employment practices at its Normal,

Illinois facility, in violation of &#167; &#167; 703(a) and 704 of Title

VII, 42 U.S.C. &#167; -2(a) and -3.  Such unlawful employment

practices include, but are not limited to: </P>



<P>(a)  sexually harassing a class of female employees because of their

sex by creating a hostile and abusive work environment based on

unwelcome verbal and physical sexual conduct, including sexual

graffiti, sexually derogatory and explicit comments and innuendo, and

unwanted groping, grabbing, and touching; </P>



<P>(b)  sexually harassing a class of female employees because of their

sex by conditioning their employment, benefits of their employment,

and/or terms and conditions of their employment on their acquiescence

in sexual harassment and/or sexual relationships; </P>



<P>(c)  harassing on the basis of sex a class of female employees by

creating a hostile and abusive work environment based on unwelcome

sex-based comments and conduct; </P>



<P>(d)  failing to take immediate and appropriate corrective action in

response to complaints or other notice of sexual or sex-based

harassment and/or retaliation; </P>



<P>(e)  retaliating against a class of female employees who have opposed

practices made unlawful by Title VII; and </P>



<P>(f)  causing a class of female employees to resign their employment

because of continued sexual and sex-based harassment and retaliation,

thus constructively discharging them. </P>



<P>8.  The effect of the practices complained of in paragraph 7, above,

has been to deprive a class of female employees of Defendant of equal

employment opportunities and otherwise adversely affect their status

as employees because of their sex and because of retaliation. </P>



<P>9.  The unlawful employment practices complained of in paragraph 7,

above, were and are intentional. </P>



<P>10. The unlawful employment practices complained of in paragraphs 7

and 8, above, were and are done with malice or with reckless

indifference to the federally protected rights of a class of female

employees of Defendant. </P>



<H2>PRAYER FOR RELIEF</H2>



<P>WHEREFORE, the Commission respectfully requests that this Court: </P>



<P>A.  Grant a permanent injunction enjoining Defendant, its officers,

successors, assigns, and all persons in active concert or

participation with it, from engaging in any employment practice which

discriminates on the basis of sex or retaliation. </P>



<P>B.  Order Defendant to institute and carry out policies, practices,

and programs which provide equal employment opportunities for women

and for individuals who have opposed practices make unlawful by Title

VII, and which eradicate the effects of its past and present unlawful

employment practices. </P>

affected by the unlawful practices alleged above by providing

appropriate backpay with pre-judgment interest, in amounts to be

determined at trial, and other affirmative relief necessary to

but not limited to rightful place reinstatement for a class of

employees who were constructively discharged by Defendant. </P>



<P>D.  Order Defendant to make whole a class of individuals adversely

affected by the unlawful practices alleged above by providing

compensation for past and future pecuniary losses resulting from the

unlawful employment practices described in paragraph 7, above,

including job search expenses and medical expenses, in amounts to be

determined at trial. </P>



<P>E.  Order Defendant to make whole a class of individuals adversely

affected by the unlawful practices alleged above by providing

compensation for past and future nonpecuniary losses resulting from

the unlawful practices complained of in paragraph 7, above, including

emotional pain, suffering, inconvenience, loss of enjoyment of life,

and humiliation, in amounts to be determined at trial. </P>



<P>F.  Order Defendant to pay to a class of individuals adversely

affected by the unlawful practices alleged above punitive damages for

its malicious and reckless conduct, as described in paragraph 7,

above, in amounts to be determined at trial. </P>



<P>G.  Grant such further relief as the Court deems necessary and proper

in the public interest. </P>

<P>SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT</P>





<P>COUNT I

VIOLATION OF TITLE VII AND 1991 CIVIL RIGHTS ACT (GENDER) </P>



<P>1. This Court has jurisdiction of Counts I and III pursuant to 28

U.S.C. Sections 1343 (a)(4) and 42 U.S.C. Section 2000e-5(f), in that

these Counts are actions under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of

1964, as amended ("Title VII"). This Court has jurisdiction of Count

II pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1343(a)(4), 42 U.S.C. &#167;

12117(a) and 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e-5(f), in that Count II is an

action to redress violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act

("ADA"). </P>



<P>2. All plaintiffs have filed timely charges with the Equal Employment

Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and the Illinois Department of Human

Rights (IDHR). All plaintiffs except Bledsoe, Cosby, Farris, Hasler,

and Jackson have received right-to-sue letters from the EEOC and have

filed this lawsuit within the time specified by those letters, as

extended by agreement between the plaintiffs and defendant.

Right-to-sue letters have been requested by the remaining plaintiffs.</P>





<P>3. Plaintiffs, Linda Evans, Terry Paz, Margaret Bajic, Kim Becker,

Debbie Bledsoe, Betty Blue, Christine Bonesteel, Nellie Ray Boswell,

Desiree Cawthon, Michelle Colvin, Julia Cosby, Debra Emmons, Karen

Eslinger, Lori Farris, Darlene Feiste, Allene Gregory, Lori Hampton,

Sylvia Hampton, Deanna Hasler, Pat Hosea, Stacy Jackson, Elizabeth

Keefe, Patricia Kich, Christine McGrath, Jenny Mallicoat, Robbin

Mattingly, Christina Morris, and Cledith Wellenreiter are present or

former female employees of defendant Mitsubishi Motor Manufacturing

of America, Inc., formerly known as Diamond Star Motors Corporation

(hereinafter "Mitsubishi"), which manufactures automobiles at its

plant in Normal, Illinois Diamond Star began as a joint venture

between Chrysler Corporation and Mitsubishi Motors of Japan, but is

now controlled entirely by Mitsubishi and is known as Mitsubishi

Motor Manufacturing of America, Inc. </P>



<P>4. From the time Mitsubishi opened its plant in 1987, and continuing

through the present, Mitsubishi has created and fostered an

environment at the plant that has been severely hostile towards it

female employees. As a result, plaintiffs and many of the plant's

other female employees have been continually subjected, on an ongoing

basis, to relentless sex discrimination, sexual harassment and sexual

abuse from their male colleagues and, in may cases, from their male

supervisors. Such discrimination, sexual harassment and abuse have

taken many forms, including, but not limited to, the following: </P>

<OL type="a">

<P><LI> All plaintiffs have been subjected to a continuing barrage of

unwelcome comments and conduct of a sexual nature from male

Mitsubishi employees. For example, plaintiffs and other females at

Mitsubishi have been, and continue to be, routinely referred to, both

to their faces and behind their backs, as "cunts," "bitches,"

"whores," and other degrading teens of a sexual nature. Male

colleagues have also regularly harangued them with unwelcome comments

about the plaintiffs' bodies, about sexual acts, about the men's

sexual fantasies and about other sexual matters; </P>



<P><LI> Many of the plaintiffs have been regularly subjected to unwelcome

grabbing, touching, fondling, kissing, assaults and/or other sexual

conduct by male co-workers and/or male supervisors; </P>



<P><LI> Many of the plaintiffs have been subjected by male co-workers to

"dirty tricks" and sabotage of their work, in some cases resulting in

physical injury; </P>



<P><LI> Many of the plaintiffs and other women employed by Mitsubishi have

been subjected to unwelcome sexual graffiti, documents and pictures,

including photographs and writings which depict women in a sexually

degrading manner and/or depict sexual acts or subjects making the

women the brunt of degrading jokes and/or comments. </P>



<P><LI> Many of the plaintiffs have been subjected to repeated and

unwelcome requests or demands by co-workers, supervisors and/or other

managerial officials to engage in sexual acts or sexual relationships

with them. Plaintiffs who refused such requests and/or demands have

been retaliated against in a variety of ways regarding the terms and

conditions of their employment; </P>



<P><LI> Much of the work at the plaint involves heavy physical labor, and

injuries, both to men and women, are commonplace. Many of the

plaintiffs have suffered such injuries and have had to be placed in

assignments with restricted physical demands. When this has happened

to plaintiffs, or to other women employed by Mitsubishi, they have

been subjected to merciless harassment and abuse by their male

co-workers and/or supervisors, including accusations of malingering,

epithets, comments about the supposed inability of women to do

factory work and other abusive conduct. Mitsubishi has also refused

to accommodate the injuries received by many of the plaintiffs who

have been injured; </P>



<P><LI> Male employees have been shown preference with respect to work

assignments that provide them with wider and better experience

thereby making men more likely than women to be promoted; </P>



<P><LI> Many of the plaintiffs and other women employed by Mitsubishi have

been denied training regularly given to male employees; </P>



<P><LI> Many of the plaintiffs and other women employed by Mitsubishi have

been denied promotions and special assignments given to males despite

having equal or superior job qualifications and/or equal or more

experience. </P>



<P><LI> Many of the plaintiffs and other women employed by Mitsubishi have

been placed into work assignments in which they have been required to

engage in repetitive or severely taxing physical work, resulting in

injury. Frequently, management has unreasonably refused, on account

of their sex, to rotate them from those assignments. When the

plaintiffs and other women have complained about such conditions and

the resulting injuries and/or when they complained about the unlawful

sexual discrimination and/or harassment they were receiving,

Mitsubishi has frequently taken inadequate steps to alleviate the

situation, treat their injuries and/or accommodate their conditions,

untie they have, in some instances, been retaliated against because

of their complaints. </P>

</OL>

<P>5. Management at Mitsubishi has affirmatively fostered this hostile

working environment and has failed to correct it despite being

thoroughly knowledgeable of it. Actions fostering such hostile work

environment include, but are not limited to, the following: </P>

<OL type="a">

<P><LI> Much of the top management at Mitsubishi has been made up of

Japanese males. During their formal orientation as new Mitsubishi

employees, most of the plaintiffs, and most new Mitsubishi employees

in general, whether male or female, were told that Japanese mangers

do not believe that women belong in the workplace. T.his information

had the effect of encouraging male employees to believe that sexual

harassment, abuse or mistreatment of their female colleagues would be

tolerated by the plant's management, which, in fact, it was; </P>



<P><LI> Plaintiffs and other women at the plant have been told that when

male members of management have been taken to Japan for training,

they have routinely been treated by Mitsubishi company officials to

sexually explicit entertainment such as "audience participation

bars," in which male members of management watch and/or participate

in live sex acts in public. Reports of such practices, which

plaintiffs on information and belief believe to have taken place as

reported, have contributed to an atmosphere in which males in the

plant widely believe that management will tolerate abusive practices

toward women; </P>



<P><LI> When plaintiffs and other women have reported the harassment and

abuse they have experienced to their unit group leaders, group

leaders, branch managers and/or other management officials, the

response has normally been to ignore their complaints, to refuse to

take timely effective action and/or to retaliate against them because

of their complaints. Frequently, male co-workers, supervisors and/or

other male company officials of the harasser have joined together to

further harass and retaliate against the women. This has contributed

to a widespread unwillingness of many women to report such abuse,

since they fear the day-to-day consequences of such complaints. In

the handful of instances in which a complaint of sexual harassment

has been acted upon, Mitsubishi acted only after first ignoring, for

months or years, repeated complaints made to supervisors of

absolutely intolerable conduct. Further, many acts of sexual

harassment and abuse and sex discrimination have taken place in the

presence of supervisors and other higher management officials, who

have either participated, acquiesced, approved and/or failed to take

effective action to stop it. This pattern of inaction and

indifference has promoted the prevalent view among male Mitsubishi

employees that women can be abused or mistreated with impunity; </P>



<P><LI> Rather than taking effective action to put an end to the practices

described herein, plant management has deliberately and

systematically told its employees that all the allegations of the

plaintiffs are false and that there is not and never has been any

substantial problem of sexual harassment within the plant. Further,

top management has deliberately encouraged plant employees to believe

that the women's lawsuit (and the related lawsuit by the Equal

Employment Opportunity Commission) is a threat to the jobs of

everyone in the plant. As a result of this propaganda campaign by top

management, the plaintiffs have found themselves subjected to hatred,

ostracism, and sometimes physical threats by other plant employees

who fear for their jobs; </P>



<P><LI> Mitsubishi has provided little or no training to its supervisors

in how to control sexual harassment and other sex-based misbehavior

by its male workforce, or even as to what constitutes unacceptable

behavior, despite having been informed for many years of the

magnitude of the problem in its plant; and </P>



<P><LI> Sexual harassment or misbehavior at the plant among supervisors

has not been confined to merely low-level management, such as unit

group leaders or group leaders, but has also been engaged in by

branch managers and other high-level company officials. </P>

</OL>

<P>6. The conduct described in this complaint has been, and continues to

be, sufficiently severe, and occurs so regularly and pervasively,

that it would have detrimentally affected the work performance or

well being of a reasonable person in plaintiffs' positions. </P>



<P>7. Despite the filing of charges of discrimination by a large group

of the plaintiffs in 1992 and 1993, practices fostering a hostile

work environment against women have continued to be common. For

example, on a number of occasions from at least 1994 through 1996,

parties were organized, in some occasions on the occasion of visits

from abroad of Mitsubishi employees who were to work and assist in

the plant. These parties were organized and invitations distributed

within the plant during working hours, and financed by collections

done at the plant during working hours. They were attended not only

by associates but by management personnel, including Unit Group

Leaders, Group Leaders, and higher-level management. At these

parties, women were hired to engage in public, sexual acts with the

attendees. Numerous photographs were taken of the male employees

engaging in these acts with the women, and the photographs were then

brought to the plant and widely circulated. Employees were invited to

take whatever pictures they wanted. Numerous members of management

saw the pictures thus being passed around and did nothing to object

to the practice or to discipline the organizers of it. On information

and belief, the Employee Relations section of the plant has known of

these parties, and the practice of circulating the pictures from them

within the plant for many months, but has taken no action to

discipline those responsible for them. </P>



<P>8. The environment created and tolerated by Mitsubishi has caused

severe injury to certain plaintiffs and to many other women at the

plant. Among other things: </P>

<OL type="a">

<P><LI> All the plaintiffs have suffered severe and ongoing humiliation,

mental anguish and other forms of emotional distress, leading them,

in many cases, to seek psychotherapeutic treatment and in some cases

to suffer emotional breakdowns; </P>



<P><LI> The continuing abuse plaintiffs have suffered has affected the

quality of their work performance, led them to be unfavorably

evaluated by hostile male managers and has deprived them of

promotional opportunities, of compensation, of training, of job

assignments, and has resulted in some cases in unfair terminations,

demotions, transfers, refusals to rehire and/or other adverse

employment actions. </P>



<P><LI> Some of the plaintiffs have suffered physical injury as a result

of the abusive conditions in which they have been forced to work and

the abusive behavior of their male colleagues and/or supervisors; and</P>





<P><LI> The abusive working conditions to which plaintiffs were subjected

were so severe that several plaintiffs were terminated and/or felt

compelled to resign or take unpaid medical leaves of absence, or take

leaves for which they were terminated, in circumstances where a

reasonable person would have felt compelled to resign or taken an

unpaid or medical leave of absence. Such persons have lost

substantial salary and benefits from temporary to permanent loss of

their employment. </P>

</OL>

<P>9. In taking the actions described above, Mitsubishi acted with

malice or with reckless indifference to the federally protected

rights of the plaintiffs and other women in the plant. </P>



<P>WHEREFORE, plaintiffs pray:</P>

<OL type="a">

<P><LI> That Mitsubishi, upon a trial by jury, be adjudicated to have

violated Title VII; </P>



<P><LI> That each plaintiff be awarded appropriate damages to compensate

that plaintiff for any and all back pay and other benefits, including

but not limited to reinstatement, promotion, transfers, and any other

appropriate relief to which plaintiffs are entitled by virtue of

defendant's violation of Title VII; </P>



<P><LI> That each plaintiff be awarded appropriate "compensatory damages"

within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1981a or as otherwise allowed

by law; </P>



<P><LI> That each plaintiff be awarded punitive damages in an appropriate

amount; </P>



<P><LI> That each plaintiff be awarded prejudgment interest on the above

damages; </P>



<P><LI> That the court issue a permanent injunction enjoining the

continuation of the above unlawful practices; </P>





<P><LI> That the court require defendant to adopt an appropriate

affirmative action plan, specifically tailored to the circumstances

proved at trial, designed (1) to eliminate all aspects of the hostile

working environment in the plant, (2) to assure appropriate

discipline or discharge of those who have been or who will henceforth

be guilty of unlawful employment practices, (3) to assure that female

victims of unlawful practices will feel free to step forward with

complaints without fear of retaliation and (4) to otherwise correct

the unlawful conditions complained of in this count; </P>



<P><LI> That this Court appoint a special master to supervise compliance

with the above affirmative action plan and require periodic progress

reporting to the court; </P>



<P><LI> That the court retain jurisdiction of this matter until such time

as it is assured that the defendant has remedied the unlawful

policies and practices complained of herein; </P>



<P><LI> That the court award plaintiffs their reasonable attorneys' fees,

costs, and litigation expenses; and </P>



<P><LI> That the court grant such other and further relief as it deems

just. </P>

</OL>

<H3>COUNT II VIOLATION OF THE ADA</H3>



<P>10. This count is brought under the Americans with Disabilities Act,

42 U.S.C. Section 12101, et seq. The plaintiffs in this count are

Linda Evans, Margaret Bajic, Rim Becker, Betty Blue, Christine

Bonesteel, Nellie Ray Boswell, Desiree Cawthon, Debra Emmons, Karen

Eslinger, Lori Farris, Darlene Feiste, Allene Gregory, Lori Hampton,

Deanna Hasler, Pat Hosea, Elizabeth Keefe, Patricia Kich, Christine

McGrath, Robbin Mattingly, Christina Morris, and Cledith

Wellenreiter. </P>



<P>11. Plaintiffs here reallege paragraphs 1, 2, 4 and 5 of Count I. </P>



<P>12. The plaintiffs in this count, and many other persons at

Mitsubishi, are, or at various times relevant hereto have been,

"qualified individuals with a disability" within the meaning of 42

U.S.C. &#167; 12111(8). Some of these persons have suffered sexual

harassment, abuse, discrimination and/or retaliation in their

employment of such a drastic nature that they have suffered mental

impairments consisting of severe psychological trauma of an

essentially permanent nature. Other persons have acquired physical

impairments through physical injury from the work they performed in

their employment. </P>



<P>13. Defendant has unlawfully discriminated against plaintiffs and

other employees who are qualified individuals with disabilities by

systematically failing to make reasonable accommodations for

plaintiffs and other qualified persons with disabilities. Plaintiffs

and other persons with disabilities have been assigned to tasks which

it was obvious they could not perform in light of the disabilities

they had developed, rather than being found alternative tasks in the

plant they would be able to perform. Plaintiff could have performed

the essential functions of their jobs had they been afforded

reasonable accommodations of their disabilities. </P>



<P>14. Defendant has further discriminated against plaintiffs and other

employees by allowing a hostile work environment toward persons with

disabilities to prevail throughout the plant. Plaintiffs and other

persons who have suffered disabilities, whether through the abuse

described in this complaint or through ordinary physical injury both

on and off the job, have been and continue to be harassed, abused

and/or ostracized by their co-workers and supervisors. This happens

with particular frequency when Mitsubishi assigns these persons to

jobs that cannot be properly performed on account of their

disabilities. It also happens, however, even when defendant's medical

department allows these persons to be placed in jobs with certain

restrictions placed on the activities they are required to perform.

In either case, an environment prevails throughout the plant under

which these person are treated by their colleagues and supervisors

and malingerers and are then subjected to continuous and merciless

abuse, harassment, discrimination and retaliation. Plaintiffs have

complained about this abuse to management; nothing of substance has

been done to end the abuse or eliminate this hostile environment and,

in many instances, plaintiffs and others have been retaliated against

because of their complaints. </P>



<P>15. Defendant has further discriminated against persons with

disabilities by inquiring into, and taking into account in its hiring

decisions, the fact that an employee has filed a workers'

compensation claim in prior employment. One of the plaintiffs,

plaintiff Cawthon, was discharged from her employment when defendant

accused her of failing to disclose on her employment application the

fact that she had filed a workers' compensation claim against a prior

employer. Making such inquiries about prior workers' compensation

claims violates the ADA, as the EEOC has specified in its guidelines

interpreting the ADA, and finding a person for the manner in which he

or she responded to such an inquiry likewise violates the ADA. </P>



<P>16. The violations of the ADA described in this count have caused

severe injury to the plaintiffs and to many other women at the plant.

Among other things: </P>

<OL type="a">

<P><LI> All the plaintiffs have suffered severe and ongoing humiliation,

mental anguish and other forms of emotional distress, leading them in

many cases to seek psychotherapeutic treatment and in some cases to

suffer emotional breakdowns; </P>



<P><LI> The continuing abuse plaintiffs have suffered has affected the

quality of their work performance, led them to be unfavorably

evaluated by hostile male managers and has deprived them of

promotional opportunities, of compensation, of training, of job

assignments, and has resulted in some cases in their termination,

demotion, transfer, refusal to rehire and/or other adverse employment

actions. </P>



<P><LI> Some of the plaintiffs have suffered physical injury (further

aggravating their disabled condition) as a result of the abusive

conditions in which they have been forced to work and as a result of

the abusive behavior of their male colleagues and/or supervisors; and</P>





<P><LI> The abusive working conditions to which plaintiffs were subjected

were so severe that several plaintiffs were terminated and/or felt

compelled to resign or take unpaid medical leaves of absence, or take

leaves for which they were terminated, in circumstances where a

reasonable person would have felt compelled to resign or taken an

unpaid or medical leave of absence. Such persons have lost

substantial salary and benefits from temporary or permanent loss of

their employment. </P>



<P><LI> Plaintiff Cawthon lost her employment, as described in paragraph

14. </P>

</OL>

<P>17. In taking the actions described above, Mitsubishi acted with

malice or with reckless indifference to the federally protected

rights of the plaintiffs and other women in the plant. </P>



<P>WHEREFORE, plaintiffs pray:</P>

<OL type="a">

<P><LI> That Mitsubishi, upon a trial by jury, be adjudicated to have

violated the ADA; </P>



<P><LI> That each plaintiff be awarded appropriate damages to compensate

that plaintiff for any and all back pay and other benefits, including

but not limited to reinstatement, promotions, transfers, and any

other appropriate relief that the plaintiff has lost by virtue of

defendant's violation of the ADA; </P>



<P><LI> That each plaintiff be awarded appropriate "compensatory damages"

within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1981a or as otherwise allowed

by law; </P>



<P><LI> That each plaintiff be awarded punitive damages in an appropriate

amount; </P>



<P><LI> That each plaintiff be awarded prejudgment interest on the above

damages; </P>



<P><LI> That the court issue a permanent injunction enjoining the

continuation of the above unlawful practices; </P>



<P><LI> That the court require defendant to adopt an appropriate

affirmative action plan, specifically tailored to the circumstances

proved at trial, designed (1) to eliminate all aspects of the hostile

working environment in the plant, (2) to assure appropriate

discipline or discharge of those who have been or who will henceforth

be guilty of unlawful employment practices, (3) to assure that

victims of unlawful practices will feel free to step forward with

complaints without fear of retaliation and (4) to otherwise correct

the unlawful conditions complained of this in Count; </P>



<P><LI> That this Court appoint a special master to supervise compliance

with the above affirmative action plan and require periodic progress

reporting to the court; </P>



<LI> That the court retain jurisdiction of this matter until such time

as it is assured that the defendant has remedied the unlawful

policies and practices complained of herein; 





<P><LI> That the court award plaintiffs their reasonable attorneys' fees,

costs, and litigation expenses; and </P>



<P><LI> That the court grant such other and further relief as it deems

just. </P>



</OL>

<H3>COUNT III VIOLATION OF TITLE VII AND 42 U.S.C. 61981 (RACE) </H3>





<P>18. This count is brought pursuant to Title VII of the 1964 Civil

Rights Act as amended, and 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1981. </P>



<P>19. Plaintiffs in this count are all African American. They are Linda

Evans, Betty Blue, Patricia Hosea, Sylvia Hampton and Stacy Jackson. </P>



<P>20. Plaintiffs herein reallege paragraphs 1 and 2 of Count I. </P>



<P>21. The plaintiffs named in this count and other African American

employees of Mitsubishi have been discriminated against on account of

their race and have been subjected to a racially hostile work

environment. Examples of the types of conduct to which the plaintiffs

have been subjected include but is not limited to the following

conduct: </P>

<OL type="a">

<P><LI> Racial insults and slurs such as "black bitch," "black nigger

bitch," "nigger bitch;" </P>



<P><LI> Racially hostile jokes, pranks, and other insulting conduct. For

example, white male employees have dressed up as Klu Klux Klan

members in order to frighten and intimate the plaintiffs; </P>



<P><LI> Physically threatening remarks and conduct For example, white

males have made statements such as "blacks should be killed," and

made other threats to physically injure and/or attack plaintiffs due

to their race; </P>



<P><LI> Racially charged sexual remarks, such as referring to the

reproductive anatomy of African American women as "deep black boxes,"

and </P>



<P><LI> Denial of promotion, training, transfers and/or other employment

opportunities. </P>

</OL>

<P>22. All plaintiffs in this count have filed timely charges with the

Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and the Illinois

Department of Human Rights (IDHR) of race discrimination and have

<P><LI> That Mitsubishi, upon a trial by jury, be adjudicated to have

violated Title VII and &#167; 1981a; </P>



<P><LI> That each plaintiff be awarded appropriate damages to compensate

<P>Editor's Note:  John Grisham, famous author of mystery novels in the legal millieu, is suing his own

attorney. Grisham's suit alleges breach of fiduciary duty, fraud, and legal malpractice against Grisham's

<P align=center><B>IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT

FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF MISSISSIPPI 

<BR><BR>

<BR><BR>

CIVIL ACTION NO. 3:96cv045-B

<BR><BR>

JOHN GRISHAM, JR.

<BR><BR>

PLAINTIFF,

<BR><BR>

vs.

<BR><BR>

JAY GARON-BROOKE ASSOCIATES, INC., and ESTATE OF JORDAN GARONSKY a/k/a JAY GARON by ELLIOT

J. LEFKOWITZ, Executor, and ELLIOT J. LEFKOWITZ 

<BR><BR>

DEFENDANTS</B></P>



<H3>COMPLAINT</H3>



Plaintiff, John Grisham, Jr. by his attorneys, The Tollison Law Firm, P.A. and Gold, Farrell & Marks,

alleges for his complaint, upon knowledge with respect to his own acts and upon information and belief with

respect to the acts of all others  as follows: 



<H3>INTRODUCTION</H3>



<BLOCKQUOTE>1.   This is a civil action in which plaintiff John Grisham, Jr. is asserting claims for fraud, breach of

fiduciary duty, legal malpractice, declaratory relief determining the rights of the parties to an agreement

and violation of New York's General Business Obligations Law, Article 11, against Jay Garon-Brooke

Associates, Inc., the Estate of Jay Garon, Grisham's former agent, and Elliot J. Lefkowitz, Grisham's

former attorney. </BLOCKQUOTE>



<H3>JURISDICTION, VENUE AND PARTIES</H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>2.  This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action on the basis of diversity of citizenship

pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Section 1332, because this action is between citizens of different states and the

amount in controversy exceeds $50,000, exclusive of interest and costs. </P>



<P>3.  Venue is proper in the Northern District of Mississippi pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Section 1391(a) and (c),

because a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claims asserted herein occurred in

this District. </P>



<P>4.  Plaintiff, John Grisham, Jr.  ("Grisham") is a novelist, who is an adult resident citizen of Oxford,

Mississippi. </P>



<P>5.  Defendant Jay Garon-Brooke Associates, Inc. ("Garon-Brooke") is a corporation organized and existing

under the laws of the State of New York with its principal place of business located within the State of New

York. </P>



<P>6.  Jay Garon ("Garon") was, at all relevant times, the sole stockholder, owner, and person exercising

complete control of defendant Garon-Brooke, and was a resident of the State of New York.  Garon was

Grisham's sole and exclusive agent and representative from on or about May 13, 1987, until Garon's death

on August 23, 1995. Garon controlled and dominated Garon-Brooke at all relevant times herein, and Garon

and Garon-Brooke were alter egos. Garon's Last Will and First Codicil were offered for probate to

Surrogate's Court, New York County, State of New York, and Preliminary Letters Testamentary were

issued thereunder on September 21, 1995, to Elliot J. Lefkowitz, as Executor thereunder.  Defendant The

Estate of Jay Garon ("Estate") is a resident citizen of the State of New York. </P>



<P>7.  Defendant Elliot J. Lefkowitz ("Lefkowitz") is a resident of the State of New York who is licensed to

practice law in, and is a member of the bar of, the State of New York. Lefkowitz was Grisham's lawyer

from in or about 1991 through the date of Garon's death, and was his sole entertainment lawyer in all

matters relating to, inter alia, Grisham's books, the exploitation of his books through other media, including

film and television, and Grisham's participation in projects, including film and television productions.  As

alleged in greater detail below, Grisham retained Lefkowitz as his attorney in response to the repeated

urgings of Garon; Lefkowitz represented Garon and Garon-Brooke at the same time that he represented

Grisham and Lefkowitz was a close personal friend of Garon.  Indeed, Garon named Lefkowitz the executor

of his Estate and in his will appointed Lefkowitz trustee of trusts created thereunder. </P>



<P>8.  This Court has personal jurisdiction over the defendants in this case because Garon-Brooke, Garon (as

Garon- Brooke's alter ego), and Lefkowitz made contracts with plaintiff Grisham, a resident of Mississippi,

which contracts were to be performed in whole or in part in Mississippi as required by M.C.A. Section

13-3-57.  In addition, Garon-Brooke, Garon and Lefkowitz had sufficient "minimum contacts" with

Mississippi so that this Court's exercise of personal jurisdiction over them does not violate the DueMississippi so that this Court's exercise of personal jurisdiction over them does not violate the Due</H3>

Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Defendants created continual contractual obligations between

themselves and Grisham, a resident of Mississippi. Both contracts were partially performed in Mississippi

and have substantial connections and ties to Mississippi. Given these connections to Mississippi, defendants

should have reasonably anticipated being subjected to the jurisdiction of the courts in Mississippi.  Further,

this Court has personal jurisdiction over the defendants based upon torts against Grisham that were

committed by Garon-Brooke, Garon and Lefkowitz in whole or in part in Mississippi and caused injury within

Mississippi. </P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>FACTS</H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>The Grisham-Garon Relationship</H3>



<P>9.   Prior to May 1987, Grisham had written a manuscript which was to become his first published novel,

"A Time to Kill." </P>



<P>10.  In early 1987, Grisham read about Garon's success as an agent in obtaining a million dollar

hardcover/paperback advance for an unpublished novelist. Thereafter, Grisham sought out Garon's

representation and sent Garon a copy of his unpublished manuscript.  Shortly thereafter, on April 15,

1987, Garon telephoned Grisham at his office in Southaven, Mississippi, and said that he wanted to

represent Grisham.  Garon made no mention of Garon-Brooke during the telephone conversation. </P>



<P>11.  This was the start of what became a very close and personal author-agent relationship.  For more than

eight years, until the time of Garon's death, Garon was Grisham's only agent. Garon represented Grisham

with respect to all of his activities in the entertainment industry, including, without limitation, Grisham's

publishing contracts, Grisham's contracts pertaining to the exploitation of his work in motion pictures and

on television, and contracts employing Grisham to work on such projects. </P>



<P>12.  Grisham relied on Garon personally to perform this work.  Indeed, at the time that Garon became

Grisham's exclusive and sole representative, and for years thereafter, Garon did not work with, and

Garon-Brooke did not employ, any other agent. Further, throughout the period that Garon represented

Grisham, Garon was the sole stockholder, owner and person exercising complete control of Garon-Brooke. 

For a substantial portion of the period of representation, Garon operated his company from the same floor

of the residential apartment building in which he lived. </P>



<P>13.  Garon was the only person who handled Grisham's entertainment and book-related matters and Garon

was the only person to communicate with Grisham about them. All agency matters were entrusted to Garon,

as Grisham's fiduciary.  Indeed, as Garon acknowledged to Grisham, no one else at Garon-Brooke was

capable of handling this responsibility and he never sought to have anyone else perform agency work for

Grisham. </P>



<P>Garon and Garon-Brooke Are Legally Inseparable; Garon Controlled and Dominated Garon-Brooke and Was Its

Alter Ego </P>



<P>14.  Garon and Garon-Brooke were inextricably intertwined, and functioned as a single entity without legal

separateness throughout the period that Garon represented Grisham. </P>



<P>15.  Throughout the period that Garon served as Grisham's exclusive agent, Garon spent extended periods

of time at his home in the Florida Keys.  During these intervals, Garon communicated with Grisham between

Florida and Mississippi on a regular and systematic basis, exchanging faxes, communicating by telephone,

and sending manuscripts and other materials. </P>



<P>16.  While Garon was in Florida, he continued to act as Grisham's agent in his personal capacity. </P>



<P>17.  Beginning in or about March 1993, Garon caused multiple contracts for foreign rights to books written

by Grisham to be drawn in the name of another of Garon's wholly owned corporations, a Florida company

called Script Representatives of the Keys, Inc.  This company, which Garon -- not Garon-Brooke -- formed,

owned and controlled, enabled Garon -- not Garon-Brooke to conduct business for Grisham through a

separate corporation. Garon repeatedly sent contracts relating to the exploitation of Grisham's works that

bore the name of Script Representatives of the Keys, Inc., to Grisham in Mississippi and Grisham executed

these contracts in Mississippi pursuant to Garon's instruction. These contracts set forth the commissions,

based on compensation earned or received by Grisham, which were to be paid to Script Representatives of

the Keys, Inc. -- not to Garon-Brooke.  Garon also caused Script Representatives of the Keys, Inc. to send

statements and checks to Grisham in Mississippi.  Grisham never entered into an agency agreement with

Script Representatives of the Keys, Inc. </P>



<P>18.  Garon's formation and operation of Script Representatives of the Keys, Inc. demonstrates that

Garon-Brooke was merely a facade that Garon used for his personal benefit and convenience.  Garon's

appropriation to Script Representative of the Keys, Inc. of assets of the ostensibly independent

Garon-Brooke (i.e., contracts and commissions that he caused Script Representative of the Keys, Inc., not

Garon-Brooke, to receive) demonstrates the complete control and domination that Garon exercised over

Garon-Brooke.  Garon also revealed his own disregard for corporate formalities with respect to

Garon-Brooke by, on occasion, signing contracts as Grisham's agent in his personal capacity, and not on

behalf of Garon-Brooke, and approving othe~r documents that referred to Garon personally, and not

Garon-Brooke, as Grisham's agent. </P>



<H3>The Agency Agreement</H3>



<P>19.  In or about May 1987, shortly after Garon informed Grisham that he wanted to represent him, Garon

prepared and sent to Grisham, in Southaven, Mississippi, a proposed agreement. Grisham signed the draft

that he received from Garon without making any changes. </P>



<P>20.  The agreement that Garon sent to Grisham (the "Agreement") was signed in New York by Garon-Brooke

on or about May 14, 1987, and in Mississippi by Grisham on or about May 30, 1987.  Among other things,

it set forth the duration of the Agreement, Garon/Garon-Brooke's obligations to Grisham, the commission

rate and the materials upon which commissions could be taken. </P>



<P>(a)  The Agreement provided for a five year term beginning on or about May 13, 1987, and ending on or

about May 13, 1992.  The Agreement further provided that it would be "automatically renewed every two

(2) years thereafter, unless [Garon-Brooke] or [Grisham] terminate same upon sixty (60) days notice

prior to the end of any such period." </P>



<P>(b)  The Agreement also sets forth Garon/Garon- Brooke's obligations to Grisham.  Garon/Garon-Brooke

became Grisham's "sole and exclusive representative and agent" with respect to Grisham's services in "all

branches of the literary, publication and related theatrical, motion picture and television fields..."  In

addition, Garon/Garon-Brooke agreed, without any limitation whatsoever, to "counsel and advise" Grisham

throughout the term of the agreement "regarding matters which concern the development or advancement

of [Grisham's] professional career in the above-mentioned fields."  As such, Garon and Garon-Brooke

undertook the strict duties of a fiduciary to Grisham, including (1) the duty of loyalty to Grisham,  (2) the

duty of full disclosure of all things material to Grisham's professional career, including, by way of

example, disclosure of all facts pertinent to Garon/Garon-Brooke's representation of Grisham, and (3) the

duty to put the interests of their principal (i.e., Grisham) ahead of their own interests. </P>



<P>(c)(i) The Agreement further provided for Garon/Garon-Brooke to receive a commission of fifteen percent

(15%) of Grisham's gross compensation on certain specified "material" (which is a defined term in the

Agreement), whether such compensation is earned or received during or after the term of the Agreement. 

Specifically, the Agreement provides for a commission to be paid during the Term in conjunction with the

exploitation of "literary or dramatic material and all other material herein described, and after the

expiration hereof, in connection with any contracts for the sale or other disposition of or dealings with

such. literary or dramatic material, when any such contracts or agreements were negotiated for or entered

into during the term hereof..."  With respect to contracts pertaining to the exploitation outside the United

States of "literary and related materials referred to in this agreement," the Agreement provided for a

thirty percent (30%) commission. </P>



<P>(c)(ii) The commission clauses in the Agreement restrict commissionable gross compensation, both for the

periods prior to and after termination of the Agreement, to sums earned or received from the exploitation

of "material", as defined in the Agreement.  The Agreement defines "material" as "books, plays,

screenplays of any kind, ideas or characters and any and all rights or interest in such material now owned

by [Grisham] 03 which [Grisham] acquire[s] or write[s] during the term hereof..." As such, the

exploitation of any books, plays, screenplays, ideas or characters that Grisham either writes or acquires

any right or interest in subsequent to the termination of the Agreement cannot give rise to any

commissionable income. </P>



<P>The Agreement Is A "Personal Services" Contract For Garon's Services </P>



<P>21.  Garon was the only agent at Garon-Brooke who represented Grisham and Garon never suggested to

Grisham that any other agent, would, could or should have any responsibility for, or involvement in,

Grisham's career. </P>



<P>22.  The distinctively personal relationship between Grisham and Garon is further demonstrated by the fact

that Garon effectively selected for Grisham his attorney,  (i.e., Lefkowitz), his California based agent, his

foreign agent for all territories other than the United Kingdom and his foreign agent for the United Kingdom.

Indeed, in addition to representing Grisham with respect to his publishing contract, Garon also procured and

attempted to procure employment for Grisham for, among other things, producing and writing screenplays

for motion pictures and television and securing speaking engagements, acts which, as hereinafter alleged,

violated Article 11 of New York's General Business Law. </P>



<P>23.  Garon never trained or employed anyone else at Garon-Brooke to handle Grisham's agency matters.  To

do so would have violated the personal relationship that was formed in 1987 and blossomed and flourished

with Grisham's consistently increasing popularity and success. </P>



<P>24.  Garon intentionally directed his personal activities concerning Grisham into Mississippi by, inter alia,

originally telephoning Grisham in Mississippi to agree to represent him, sending the Agreement to Grisham

in Mississippi for execution, and regularly and systematically sending faxes, correspondence, checks and

contracts to Mississippi and making telephone calls to Grisham in Mississippi in order to fulfill his

obligations to Grisham, satisfy Grisham's expectations of him, and reap benefits from his relationship with

Grisham. </P>



<P>At Garon's Persistent Urgings, Grisham Retained Lefkowitz </P>



<P>25.  Defendant Lefkowitz and Garon were close personal friends, and Lefkowitz was also Garon's attorney.

After publication of "The Firm" in 1991, on repeated occasions Garon recommended that Grisham retain

Lefkowitz with respect to his entertainment career.  Finally, in or about the summer of 1991, Grisham

agreed to retain. Lefkowitz as his attorney. </P>



<P>26.  From this point forward, Lefkowitz acted as Grisham's attorney, and was his sole attorney with

regard to all of Grisham's entertainment related matters. Lefkowitz regularly communicated with Grisham

concerning the legal matters that he was handling for Grisham during the approximately four years that he

represented him. These communications included making telephone calls to Grisham in Mississippi and

sending correspondence to Grisham there.  Lefkowitz also sent copies of draft contracts, deal memos and

other documents to Grisham in Mississippi in connection with his provision of legal services. Similarly,

Grisham called and corresponded with Lefkowitz from Mississippi with respect to Lefkowitz's

representation of him in such matters. </P>



<P>27.  Lefkowitz rendered bills for his services to Grisham in Mississippi.  Grisham paid Lefkowitz with

checks drawn on a Mississippi bank account . </P>



<P>28.  As Grisham's entertainment attorney, Lefkowitz was knowledgeable about all exploitations made of

Grisham's works and the compensation that Grisham was entitled to receive in respect of such

exploitations. Further, both as an experienced entertainment attorney and through his relationship with

Grisham and Garon, Lefkowitz knew the material terms of the Agreement. </P>



<P>29.  Lefkowitz was Grisham's entertainment attorney both in 1992 and in 1994 during the periods when,

under paragraph 1 of the Agreement, Grisham had the right to notify Garon that he was terminating the

Agreement in order to avoid its automatic renewal.  Nevertheless, Lefkowitz never advised Grisham with

respect to the automatic renewal provision, or of Grisham's right to prevent such renewal, even though the

commissions called for in the Agreement constituted Grisham's single largest entertainment-related

expense and resulted in his paying substantial commissions. </P>



<P>30.  In light of the stature and accomplishment that Grisham had achieved by 1992 and 1994, the

commission rates in the Agreement were, at both the time of the 1992 renewal and the time of the 1994

renewal, totally unwarranted and excessive. </P>



<P>31.  As an experienced attorney with fiduciary obligations to Grisham arising from his retention as

Grisham's entertainment attorney, Lefkowitz's failure to advise Grisham in 1992 and 1994 of, inter alia, 

(i) the renewal provision, and (ii) that the commissions that Grisham was obligated to pay under the

Agreement were higher than an artist of Grisham's stature and accomplishment should pay was an

inexcusable breach of his fiduciary duty to Grisham. </P>



<P>32.  Further, although Lefkowitz represented Garon -- including drawing his will -- and was beholden to

Garon for his employment as Grisham's attorney -- Lefkowitz never explained to Grisham the implications

and risks to Grisham of this dual and adverse representation; nor did Lefkowitz ever seek to obtain a

conflict of interest waiver from Grisham.  Due to his conflict of interest arising from his friendship and

business relationships with Garon, Lefkowitz's representation of Grisham was adversely affected.  For

example, although he knew that he was Grisham's only entertainment attorney, Lefkowitz never advised

Grisham to retain a separate attorney to review the Agreement on Grisham's behalf and to advise him with

respect to, inter alia, the automatic renewal and commission clauses.  By his silence in connect on with the

Agreement's renewal provisions, Lefkowitz benefited his close friend and client Garon at Grisham's

expense. Lefkowitz also never advised Grisham about, or sought to obtain a conflict of interest waiver from

Grisham relating to, the commission clause set forth in Grisham's agreement with the publishing company

Doubleday and Dell, divisions of Bantam Doubleday Publishing Group, Inc.  ("Doubleday") dated October 10.

199  ("Doubleday Agreement") </P>



<P>33.  Moreover, pursuant to their close

relationship, which pre-dated both fiduciaries' relationship with Grisham, beginning in or about 1991,

Garon/Garon-Brooke and Lefkowitz devised and effected a scheme to divert secret payments to Lefkowitz

arising in connection with his representation of Grisham.  They accomplished this wrongful scheme by

arranging for payments to be made to Lefkowitz without Grisham's knowledge from motion picture

companies with whom Lefkowitz was dealing on Grisham's behalf.  Garon and Lefkowitz deliberately

concealed these payments from Grisham by the device of secret side letters or other writings not referred

to in agreements or other papers that they provided to Grisham concerning the movie deals to which the

secret payments related. </P>

<H3>FIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF</H3>



<P>(Against all Defendants)</P>





<P>Declaratory Relief Terminating the Agreement and Judgment for Return of Commissions and Damages for

Fraud </P>



<P>34.  Plaintiff repeats and realleges the allegations contained in Paragraphs 1 through 33 as if fully set forth

he rein. </P>



<P>35.  In or about 1991, Garon/Garon-Brooke and Lefkowitz devised and implemented a scheme to secretly

funnel to Lefkowitz unauthorized payments from motion picture companies with whom he was dealing on

Grisham's behalf.  To implement this scheme, Garon/Garon-Brooke and Lefkowitz caused secret letter

agreements and other writings to be drafted and executed pursuant to which substantial payments were

made by motion picture companies to Lefkowitz.  Grisham was never provided with copies of such letters or

other writings and was not otherwise informed of the payments made to Lefkowitz thereunder.  In addition

to deliberately withholding this information from Grisham, Garon/Garon-Brooke and Lefkowitz provided

Grisham with copies of "deal memos" relating to these motion picture agreements, and other writings, all

from which Garon/Garon-Brooke deliberately omitted any mention of these payments.  Grisham reasonably

relied on the documents that he was provided as containing a full description of all material terms of the

agreements made with the motion picture companies on his behalf.  Lefkowitz separately billed Grisham for

legal fees in connection with the same motion picture agreements, making no reference to such secret

payments received by him. </P>



<P>36.  The foregoing constituted a scheme to defraud Grisham by withholding material facts from Grisham, as

a result of which Grisham suffered damage. </P>



<P>37.  As a result of the said fraud, Grisham is entitled to judgment against the defendants, jointly and

severally, declaring the Agreement to have been terminated on the first date of the said fraud of

Garon/Garon-Brooke, abrogating all rights of Garon/Garon-Brooke thereunder, directing an accounting of

all sums received by Lefkowitz pursuant to the said fraudulent scheme and granting judgment therefor, and

directing an accounting of all sums received by Garon/Garon-Brooke after the date of the said termination

of the Agreement and granting judgment therefor. </P>





<H3>SECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF</H3>



<P>(Against The Estate and Garon-Brooke) Breach of Fiduciary Duty </P>



<P>38.  Plaintiff repeats and realleges the allegations in paragraphs 1 through 33 and 35 and 36 of the

complaint, as if fully set forth herein. </P>



<P>39.  As Grisham's sole and exclusive agent, Garon/Garon-Brooke stood in a fiduciary relationship to

Grisham, owing him all the duties of a fiduciary, including the duties of good faith, fair dealing, loyalty,

fairness, confidentiality and full disclosure. </P>



<P>40.  Garon/Garon-Brooke breached fiduciary duties owed to Grisham by, inter alia: </P>



<P>(a)  deliberately concealing from Grisham the secret payments to Lefkowitz and their role in arranging for

Lefkowitz to receive such payments; </P>



<P>(b)  failing timely to advise Grisham in 1992 and in 1994 of Grisham's right to terminate the Agreement as

of May 13, 1992 and May 13, 1994.  By withholding knowledge of this right from Grisham,

Garon/Garon-Brooke wrongfully secured for itself successive two-year contract extensions without

advising its principal of such fact; and </P>



<P>(c)  convincing Grisham to retain Lefkowitz as his entertainment attorney while concealing from Grisham

that Lefkowitz, who was beholden to Garon for his retainer as Grisham's attorney, would not advise

Grisham concerning his right to terminate the Agreement.  Further, by placing his own attorney and trusted

friend in charge of Grisham's entertainment contracts, Garon ensured that Grisham would not receive the

advice of a wholly loyal and independent attorney when that advice centered on the Agreement and

Garon/Garon-Brooke's commissions. </P>



<P>41.  As a result of the said breach of fiduciary duty, Grisham is entitled to judgment against the

defendants, jointly and severally, declaring the Agreement to have been terminated on the first date of the

said fiduciary duty breach, abrogating all rights of Garon/Garon-Brooke thereunder, directing an accounting

of all sums received by Garon/Garon-Brooke after the date of the said termination of the Agreement and

granting judgment therefor. </P>





<H3>THIRD CLAIM FOR RELIEF</H3>



<P>(Against Defendant Lefkowitz)</P>





<P>Breach of Fiduciary Duty</P>



<P>42.  Plaintiff repeats and realleges the allegations in paragraphs 1 through 33 and 35 and 36 of the

complaint, as if fully set forth herein. </P>



<P>43.  Lefkowitz, as Grisham's attorney, stood in a fiduciary relationship with Grisham, owing him all the

duties of a fiduciary, including the duties of loyalty, integrity, fairness, ~fidelity candor, confidentiality

and full disclosure. </P>



<P>44.  Lefkowitz breached his fiduciary duties to Grisham by, inter alia,  (i) failing to fully inform Grisham of

the conflicts of interest arising from his simultaneous representation of Grisham and Garon,  (ii) failing to

explain to Grisham 'hat, in light of his simultaneous representation of Grisham and Garon, his loyalty to

Grisham might be divided and his representation of Grisham impaired both with respect to contracts with

third parties exploiting Grisham's works and with respect to the Agreement;  (iii) receiving, accepting and

concealing secret payments that he received from film companies with whom Grisham entered into

contracts to exploit the film rights to certain of Grisham's novels; and (iv) failing to inform Grisham that

the commissions to Garon/Garon-Brooke under the Agreements were excessive for an author of Grisham's

stature and that the Agreement would be automatically renewed at the same commission rates for

successive two-year terms unless terminated by Grisham prior to May 13, 1992 and May 13, 1994. </P>



<P>45.  By such conduct, Lefkowitz acted in a manner incompatible with his fiduciary relationship to Grisham. </P>



<P>46.  By reason of the foregoing, Grisham is entitled to recover compensatory damages in an amount to be

determined at trial. </P>





<H3>FOURTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF</H3>



<P>(Against Defendant Lefkowitz) Legal Malpractice </P>



<P>47.  Plaintiff repeats and realleges the allegations in paragraphs 1 through 33, 35 through 37 and 39

through 41 of the complaint, as if fully set forth herein. </P>



<P>48.  At all relevant times herein, Lefkowitz held himself out to Grisham as possessing the requisite skill,

ability and experience to render competent legal advice to Grisham.  As such, Lefkowitz's duties to Grisham

included, inter alia, informing him of all matters of reasonable importance relating to his representation of

Grisham or arising therefrom to the extent necessary to allow Grisham to make informed decisions. </P>



<P>49.  By reason of the foregoing, Grisham is entitled to recover compensatory damages in an amount to be

determined at trial </P>





<H3>FIFTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF</H3>



<P>(Against The Estate and Garon-Brooke)</P>





<P>Declaratory Judgment That The Agreement Terminated At Garon 18 Death </P>



<P>50.  Defendant repeats and realleges the allegations in paragraphs 1 through 33 as if fully set forth herein. </P>



<P>51.  In early 1987, after reading of Garon's successful representation of another unpublished author,

Grisham specifically sought to obtain the personal services of Garon as his literary agent.  When Garon

contacted Grisham after receiving the manuscript of "A Time to Kill," Garon said that he wanted to

represent Grisham, without making any mention whatsoever about Garon-Brooke.  Both Grisham and Garon

understood that the services for which Grisham would pay Garon were for his personal services as his

agent. </P>



<P>52.  The understanding of the parties of the personal services nature of Grisham's relationship with

Garon/Garon-Brooke was manifested and confirmed by the conduct of the parties during the eight years

that Garon represented Grisham.  Grisham never sought advice from anyone at Garon-Brooke other than

Garon. Likewise, no one at Garon-Brooke other than Garon ever sought to advise or otherwise perform

obligations due to Grisham under the Agreement. </P>



<P>53.  Upon Garon's death, Garon-Brooke could no longer perform the required services under the Agreement.

As a result of Garon-Brooke's inability to perform, the agency relationship created in the Agreement

terminated upon Garon's death. </P>



<P>54.  On or about September 8, 1995, Grisham advised Garon-Brooke in writing of the termination of the

Agreement as a result of Garon's death.  However, Garon-Brooke has claimed that the Agreement survives

Garon's death.  Now, in total and complete contradiction of the manner of its representation of Grisham

prior to Garon's death, Garon-Brooke wrongfully seeks to force Grisham to continue to use it as his agent,

and have two individuals that Grisham has never met and with whom he has never communicated perform

agency services for him. </P>



<P>55.  In light of the parties' adverse legal interests, there exists a justiciable controversy, and the Court

should grant declaratory relief that, as a result of Garon's death, Garon-Brooke can no longer perform its

obligations under the Agreement, thereby resulting in the termination of the Agreement as of the date of

Garon's death, and directing an accounting. </P>





<H3>SIXTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF</H3>



<P>(Against The Estate And Garon-Brooke)</P>





<P>Declaratory Judgment that Garon-Brooke Was the Alter Ego of Garon Such That The Agreement Terminated

Upon His Death </P>



<P>56.  Plaintiff repeats and realleges paragraphs 1 through 33 as if fully set forth herein. </P>



<P>57.  As hereinabove alleged, Garon controlled and dominated Garon-Brooke and was its alter ego.  Among

other things,  (l) Garon was the president of Garon-Brooke,  (ii) Garon was Garon-Brooke's sole

stockholder, owner and person exercising complete control of Garon-Brooke,  (iii) Garon operated Garon-

Brooke from his apartment building and residence,  (iv) Garon signed agreements, as Grisham's agent, in his

personal capacity and not on behalf of Garon-Brooke,  (v) Garon approved documents referring to himself

personally -- and not Garon-Brooke -- as Grisham's agent,  (vi) Garon caused a separate company, Script

Representatives of the Keys,  Inc. which was solely owned and controlled by Garon (not Garon-Brooke), to

represent Grisham with respect to various contracts exploiting Grisham's works, and (vii) Garon caused

commissions to be paid to Script Representatives of the Keys, Inc. </P>



<P>58.  As a result of Garon's domination and control of Garon-Brooke and his use of the corporation as a mere

facade, and in light of the parties' adverse legal interests, there exists a justiciable controversy, and the

Court should grant declaratory relief that Garon-Brooke was the alter ego of Garon, and that the Agreement

terminated upon the death of its principal, and the Court should order an accounting. </P>





<H3>SEVENTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF</H3>



<P>(Against The Estate And Garon-Brooke)</P>





<P>Declaratory Judgment That Compensation Earned or Received From Contracts (i) Entered Into After

Termination of the Agreement, or (ii) Concerning "Material" That Grisham Writes Or Acquires Rights or

Interests In After Termination of the Agreement Is Not Commissionable </P>



<P>59.  Plaintiff repeats and realleges the allegations in paragraphs 1 through 33 of the complaint, as if fully

set forth herein. </P>



<P>60.  On or about September 8, 1995, and again on or about October 12, 1995, Grisham tendered written

notice to Garon- Brooke of the termination of the Agreement as of the date of Garon's death, or,

alternatively, and at the very latest, on May 13, 1996, pursuant to paragraph 1 of the Agreement. 

Lefkowitz, as attorney for the Estate and for Garon-Brooke, acknowledged receipt of Grisham's September

8, 1995 letter. </P>



<P>61.  Under the Agreement, Grisham is only obligated to pay commissions on "material", which is defined in

paragraph 2 of the Agreement as "books, plays, screenplays of any kind, ideas or characters and any and

all rights or interests in such materials now owned by [Grisham] or which [Grisham] acquire[s] or write[s]

during the term hereof...."  Further, with respect to such "material", Grisham is only obligated to pay

commissions on gross compensation earned or received from contracts "negotiated for or entered into

during the term [of the Agreement]." </P>



<P>62.  On or about October 10, 1991, Grisham entered into the Doubleday Agreement which was subsequently

amended on March 12, 1993.  Pursuant to the Doubleday Agreement, as amended, Grisham is obligated to

deliver to Doubleday five (5) novels. Delivery to Doubleday of Untitled Novel #4, as referred to in the

March 12, 1993 amendment to the Doubleday Agreement, is expected to occur in March 1996, and this

novel (hereinafter referred to as "The Runaway Jury") is expected to be published in or about May 1996.

Grisham has not created and does not own any rights or interests in any "material" pertaining to Untitled

Novel #5, as referred to in the March 12, 1993 amendment to the Doubleday Agreement, which is the final

novel due under the Doubleday Agreement, as amended. </P>



<P>63.  Accordingly, under the Agreement,

Garon-Brooke is not entitled to receive any commission in respect of Untitled Novel #5. </P>



<P>64.  Grisham has not entered into any agreement of any kind to exploit the film rights to "The Runaway

Jury", and no negotiations for such an agreement are underway. </P>



<P>65.  Grisham has sold film rights to a number of his prior novels.  On several occasions, including Grisham's

two most recent sales of film rights, with respect to "A Time To Kill" and "The Rainmaker", Grisham did

not sign contracts exploiting the film rights until after publication of the novels.  For good and sufficient

reasons, Grisham intends to wait until after publication before negotiating or signing a film rights contract

with respect to "The Runaway Jury". </P>



<P>66.  Accordingly, under the Agreement,

Garon-Brooke is not entitled to receive any commission in respect of compensation Grisham earns or

receives in connection with the exploitation of the film rights to "The Runaway Jury". </P>



<P>67.  Grisham has communicated to Garon-Brooke his contentions that Garon-Brooke is entitled to no

commission with respect to proceeds derived from the exploitation by Doubleday of Untitled Novel #5 and

no commission with respect to the film rights to "The Runaway Jury", and Garon-Brooke disputes these

contentions. </P>



<P>68.  In light of the parties' adverse legal interests, there exists a justiciable controversy, and the Court

should grant declaratory relief that, under the Agreement, Garon-Brooke is not entitled to any commission

with respect to proceeds derived from the exploitation by Doubleday of to Untitled Novel #5 (as referred to

in the Doubleday Agreement, as amended) and no commission with respect to the film rights to "The

Runaway Jury", and granting judgment to Grisham in the amount of any commissions received by

Garon-Brooke in respect of Untitled Novel #5. </P>





<H3>EIGHTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF</H3>



<P>(Against The Estate and Garon-Brooke)</P>





<P>The Agreement Violates New York General Business Law Article 11 And All Commissions Paid by Grisham

to Garon-Brooke for Employment Procured Should be Returned </P>



<P>69.  Plaintiff repeats and realleges the allegations contained in Paragraphs 1 through 33 as if fully set forth

herein. </P>



<P>70.  The Agreement required Garon-Brooke to act as "sole and exclusive representative and agent... with

respect to [Grisham's] services in all branches of the literary, publication and related theatrical, motion

picture and television fields throughout the world including but not limited to merchandising, testimonials

and commercial tie-ins." </P>



<P>71.  Pursuant to this requirement, Garon sought and obtained employment for Grisham to render services

as, inter alia, executive consultant for the television series "The Client", executive producer for a motion

picture based on "The Chamber", and a screenwriter for the motion pictures "The Gingerbread Man" and

"The Rainmaker".  In addition to these positions, Garon also sought and procured employment for Grisham in

other positions, including speaking engagements. </P>



<P>72.  Garon sought and received a fifteen percent (15%) commission on all sums paid to Grisham in respect

of the employment that he procured. </P>



<P>73.  As a corporation organized and doing business under New York law, Garon-Brooke is subject to Article

11 of the New York General Business Law ("GBL") regarding the operation of theatrical employment

agencies, including Sections 171(2)(b), 171(8) and 172, which set forth requirements for the operation of

theatrical employment agencies.  Similarly, as a resident of New York, Garon was also subject to these

provisions. </P>



<P>74.  GBL Section 171(2)(b) defines an "employment agency" as "any person (as hereafter defined) who, for

a fee, procures or attempts to procure (l) employments or engagements for persons seeking employment or

engagements, or (2) employment for employees seeking the services of employees."  Section 171(8)

specifically defines a "theatrical employment agency" as "any person...  who procures or attempts to

procure employment or engagements for... motion pictures, radio, television, phonograph recordings... GBL

Section 172 provides that "no person shall keep, maintain, operate or carry on any employment agency

unless such person shall have procured a license therefor as provided by this article." </P>



<P>75.  Garon's actions in procuring employment in television and motion pictures for Grisham, and in taking a

fifteen percent (15%) fee from Grisham in connection therewith constituted the operation of a theatrical

employment agency pursuant to GBL Sections 171(a)(2) and 171(8). </P>



<P>76.  Neither Garon nor Garon-Brooke held a license to operate a theatrical employment agency, as required

by GBL Section 172, at any time. </P>



<P>77.  In addition to failing to hold a license in violation of GBL Section 172, Garon/Garon-Brooke charged

Grisham fees in excess of the statutory amounts allowable under GBL Section 185, which limits fees to ten

percent (10%) of the compensation paid in connection with the employment procured. </P>



<P>78.  Accordingly, in light of the parties' adverse legal interests, there exists a justiciable controversy,

and the Court should grant declaratory relief that the Agreement is unlawful and null and void because it

violates the policy and practice of New York law as set forth in General Business Law Article 11.  Further,

under GBL Section 186(1), all commissions paid by Grisham to Garon or to Garon-Brooke for employment

procured in violation of the provisions of GBL Article 11 governing theatrical employment agencies must be

returned to Grisham, with interest. </P>





<H3>NINTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF</H3>



<P>(Against Lefkowitz and Garon-Brooke)</P>





<P>Punitive Damages</P>



<P>79.  Plaintiff repeats and realleges the allegations in paragraphs 1 through 78 of the complaint, as if fully

set forth herein. </P>



<P>80.  Based upon the foregoing, Grisham should be awarded punitive damages in a sum sufficient to deter

these defendants and other persons acting in similar situations from committing frauds and breaching

fiduciary duties owed to their principal. </P>



<P>WHEREFORE PREMISES CONSIDERED, Plaintiff Grisham sues and demands judgment against defendants

Garon-Brooke, the Estate and Lefkowitz, jointly and severally, as follows: </P>



<P>(a)  on the First Claim for Relief, against all defendants, jointly and severally: </P>



<P>(1)  a declaratory judgment that the

Agreement terminated on the first date that Garon/Garon-Brooke defrauded Grisham and directing an

accounting of all sums received by Garon/Garon-Brooke after the date of the said termination of the

Agreement and granting judgment therefor, </P>



<P>(2)  A declaratory judgment that all of the Estate's and Garon-Brooke's rights under the Agreement are

abrogated; and </P>



<P>(3)  directing an accounting of all sums received by Lefkowitz pursuant to his fraudulent conduct and

granting judgment therefor; </P>



<P>(b)  on the Second Claim for Relief, against defendants Garon-Brooke and the Estate, jointly and severally: </P>



<P>(1)  a declaratory judgment that the

Agreement terminated on the first date that Garon/Garon-Brooke breached fiduciary duties owed to

Grisham and directing an accounting of all sums received by Garon/Garon-Brooke after the date of the said

termination of the Agreement and granting judgment therefor; and </P>



<P>(2) a declaratory judgment that all of the Estate's and Garon-Brooke's rights under the Agreement are

abrogated. </P>



<P>(c)  on the Third Claim for Relief, against defendant Lefkowitz, compensatory damages in an amount to be

determined at trial. </P>



<P>(d)  on the Fourth Claim for Relief, against defendant Lefkowitz, compensatory damages in an amount to be

determined at trial. </P>



<P>(e)  on the Fifth Claim for Relief, against defendants Garon-Brooke and the Estate, jointly and severally: </P>



<P>(1)  a declaratory judgment determining that as a result of Garon's death, Garon-Brooke can no longer

perform its obligations under the Agreement, thereby resulting in the termination of the Agreement as of

the date of Garon's death, and </P>



<P>(2)  directing an accounting of all sums that Garon/Garon-Brooke received on Grisham's behalf and all

commissions that were taken thereon. </P>



<P>(f)  on the Sixth Claim for Relief, against defendants Garon-Brooke and the Estate, jointly and severally: </P>



<P>(1)  a declaratory judgment determining that as a result of Garon's domination and control of Garon-Brooke

and his use of the corporation as an alter ego, plaintiff is entitled to a declaration that Garon-Brooke was

the alter ego of Garon and that the Agreement terminated upon the death of Garon, its principal, and </P>



<P>(2)  directing an accounting of all sums that Garon/Garon-Brooke received on Grisham's behalf and all

commissions that were taken thereon. </P>



<P>(g)  on the Seventh Claim for Relief, against defendants Garon-Brooke and the Estate, jointly and severally:</P>





<P>(1)  a declatory judgment determining that, under the Agreement, Garon-Brooks is entitled to no

commission with respect to Untitled Novel #5, as referred to in the Doubleday Agreement, as amended, and

no commission with respect to the film rights to "The Runaway Jury", and </P>



<P>(2)  granting judgment to Grisham in the amount of any commissions received by Garon-Brooks in respect

of Untitled Novel #5. </P>



<P>(h)  on the Eighth Claim of Relief, against defendants Garon-Brooke and the Estate, jointly and severally, a

declatory judgment determining that the Agreement, to the extent it covers procuring employment, is

unlawful and void because it violates the policy and practice of New York law as set forth in General

Business Law Article 11, and that, under GBL Section 186 (1), all commissions paid by Grisham in respect

of employment procured by Garon/Garon-Brooke must be returned because they were received in violation

of the provisions of GBL Article 11 governing theatrical employment agencies, and granting judgment

therefor. </P>



<P>(i)  on the Ninth Claim for Relief, against defendants Lefkowitz and Garon-Brooke, jointly and severally,

punitive damages in an amount sufficient to deter these Defendants and other persons acting in similar

situations from committing frauds and breaching fiduciary duties owed to their principal. </P>



<P>(j)  awarding plaintiff the costs and expenses of this action, including attorneys' fees; and </P>



<P>(k)  granting plaintiff such other and further relief as the Court may deem just and proper. </P>

<H3 align=center>Court Puts Secret Service in Sunshine</H3>

<h3 align=center>Civil Libertarians Cheer Ruling In Hacker

Case</h3>

It was a setback for the Secret Service in court and a

significant victory for civil

libertarians seeking information about federal law

enforcement's campaign against

cybercrime.

<P>

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit ruled Jan. 2

that the Secret Service must

disclose documents concerning its role in a bizarre raid on

a group of computer hackers

at the Pentagon City mall three years ago.

<P>

The three-judge panel's decision was not an unqualified

victory for

freedom-of-information activists. The court allowed the

government to block aCounsel

Connectess to

certain information about the case to protect the privacy of

those being investigated by

the law enforcement agency. Indeed, it is not clear exactly

how much information the

Secret Service will have to fork over.

<P>

Still, the appeals court ruling came as a pleasant surprise

to sunshine advocates, who

say it will help clarify a 1993 Supreme Court decision

narrowing federal law

enforcement's ability to withhold information under the

Freedom of Information Act

(FOIA). The implications of the decision extend beyond

computer crimes, potentially

improving access to information about a wide range of

criminal probes.

<P>

The litigation itself, moreover, prompted significant

government disclosures about the

mysterious raid, according to the Electronic Privacy

Information Center

(EPIC), the

cyberspace civil liberties group that handled the case.

<P>

"The Secret Service was forced . . . to give out far more

information than they were

originally prepared to give," says David Sobel, legal

counsel for the three person

non-profit, who argued the case before the appellate panel.

<P>

EPIC may just be getting started. The group has a spate of

other FOIA challenges about

encryption, security policy, and the like pending in federal

court here_all involving

the sensitive fault line between legitimate law enforcement

interests about computer

security and civil libertarians' fears that those efforts

could lead to oppressive

policing of the electronic frontier.

<P>

"The purpose of FOIA has always been to give citizens a

right to see what they want to

see, not what the agency wants them to see," says Sobel.

"The bottom line is to hold

agencies accountable for their actions and to go beyond the

official

pronouncements that

are contained in agency press releases."

<P>

Secret Service officials declined comment, referring

inquiries to the Justice

Department, which represented the agency in the case.

Justice spokesman Carl Stern says

that while he is not personally familiar with the decision,

department lawyers seem

happy with it.

<P>

"In sum and substance, the case was won. I didn't perceive

this as a loss," says Stern,

who adds that the government has not made any decisions

regarding possible appeals.

<P>

While EPIC's absolutist civil-libertarian positions on many

issues are often criticized

as uncompromising, the group's FOIA work attracts widespread

praise.

<P>

Sobel and EPIC head Marc Rotenberg are "skilled at using the

FOIA to begin to peel the

onion and really find out what's going on in these really

important areas that other

people are unwilling to touch," says former White House

staff secretary John Podesta.

"By pursuing these cases not just as individual cases, but

by thinking about this in a

more global environment . . . they've really done the public

a great service," adds

Podesta, who now teaches at Georgetown University Law

Center.

<P>

The Secret Service case began in November 1992, when a group

of young techies gathered

in Pentagon City's food court for a monthly meeting of their

hacker discussion group. At

the time, public awareness of the threat that hackers could

pose to computer and

telephone security was crystallizing. And these hackers

happened to be fans of a

magazine called 2600, which deals with security flaws in

computer systems_and, critics

complain, publicizes those flaws to eager computer

intruders.

<P>

According to The Washington Post, which wrote about the

incident six days

later, several

mall security guards, along with at least one Secret Service

agent, and with Arlington

County Police officers at the scene, surrounded the group.

The mall security officers

demanded to see identification from the roughly 20 hackers,

rifled through and

confiscated bags containing computer books and printouts,

and then evicted the youths

from the mall. No one was arrested, and the Secret Service

later declined to confirm to

the Post that it had any involvement in the incident.

<P>

EPIC, however, picked up on the story, and filed a FOIA

request for documents relating

to the incident. The Secret Service claimed it had no

information concerning its own

involvement, but that it had documents concerning third

parties related to the incident;

it turned over various press reports it had about the raid,

but not the two documents it

had identified.

<P>

While the agency was processing the request, Sobel, whose

group was then part of the

California-based Computer Professionals for Social

Responsibility_filed suit.

<P>

The Secret Service, which investigates financial and

computer crimes in addition to

protecting the president, ultimately admitted in court that

it had eight documents

concerning the raid. Moreover, in an affidavit in the case,

William Burch, who heads the

Secret Service's Washington field office, acknowledged that

those documents were

obtained during a fraud investigation related to

long-distance telephone hacking.

Through these admissions, Sobel claims, the Secret Service

effectively confirmed that it

had been behind the incident at Pentagon City.

<P>

Although the Secret Service all but acknowledged that the

raid was conducted in the

course of an investigation, agency officials argued that it

should not have to hand over

the material. Doing so, the agency claimed, would violate

source confidentiality and the

privacy of the targets of the investigations.

<P>

"At the request of my office, the records at issue in this

case, with the exception of

the newspaper articles, were withheld from release due to

the ongoing nature of the

enforcement proceeding, as to release information could

constitute an invasion of the

privacy of certain individuals, as the records at issue had

been provided to the Secret

Service by a confidential source, and as to release the

records would reveal the

identity of confidential sources," said agent Burch in his

affidavit.

<P>

Burch added, in response to Sobel's charge that the Secret

Service was merely engaged in

monitoring private individuals, "I would state that there is

absolutely no truth to

plaintiff's suggestion."

<P>

U.S. District Senior Judge Louis Oberdorfer, however, ruled

that Sobel was entitled to

most of the information he had requested. In his July 1,

1994 decision in Computer

Professionals for Social Responsibility v. U.S. Secret

Service, Oberdorfer cited a 1993

Supreme Court ruling in which the court held that law

enforcement cannot exempt material

from the FOIA simply by blithely citing source

confidentiality. Unless the government

specifically promises confidentiality_or unless the type of

crime being investigated

would make retribution against any informant likely_the

government cannot withhold

material for confidentiality reasons, the high court ruled

in Department of Justice v.

Landano.

<P>

The appeals court reversed part of Oberdorfer's decision,

but left his interpretation of

the Landano ruling intact.

<P>

"The Service offered no evidence that a fear of retaliation

by hackers is sufficiently

widespread to justify an inference that sources of

information relating to computer

crimes expect their identities and the information they

provide to be kept

confidential," wrote Judge James Buckley on behalf of the

panel, which also included

Judges Stephen Williams and Karen Henderson. The court

remanded the case to the District

Court to determine which documents could be withheld on

other grounds.

<P>

The appeals court's ruling, say sunshine activists, should

give teeth to the earlier

Landano decision.

<P>

"I expected [Landano] to be somewhat hollow," says Robert

Gellman, a privacy consultant

who served as longtime chief counsel to the House

Subcommittee on Information, Justice,

Transportation, and Agriculture until the GOPtakeover of

Congress in 1994. "I expected

the courts to find that as a matter of fact, every informant

is confidential in every

case, and the court really did not do that at all here."

<P>

Adds James Dempsey, deputy director of the Center for

National Security Studies: "It has

become increasingly difficult to use the FOIA to obtain

information about federal law

enforcement practices. This case plus Landano . . . may

signify the end, if not the

reversal, of that trend."

<P>

George Terwilliger III, who served as deputy attorney

general under President George

Bush, acknowledges that Landano and its progeny have opened

the door for greater

scrutiny of law enforcement. But he says that this does not,

in principle, jeopardize

police operations.

<P>

"I would not sense that [the appeals court ruling]

represents any kind of a major breach

of the ability of law enforcement to protect the kinds of

relationships that are

essential to good law enforcement work," says Terwilliger,

now a partner in the D.C.

office of Richmond, Va.'s McGuire, Woods, Battle & Boothe.

"The attitude of

investigators is that everything they are told in a matter

that is an active or semi

-active investigation should be confidential and shielded

from FOIA. . . . And what the

courts are saying is that the confidential source exemption

cannot be broadly applied to

anyone who provides information to law enforcement."

<P>

For his part, Sobel claims victory not only because the

decision preserves what he

describes as the core of the lower court ruling, but also

because the litigation itself

has largely answered his questions. While he does not

believe that the documents he will

ultimately receive will prove particularly revealing, the

Secret Service has already

made disclosures in the case he considers highly

significant.







<H3>'BLATANTLY ILLEGAL'</H3>







The Secret Service even admitted that the meeting was of

interest because of the reading

choices of the club's members. A footnote in the agency's

appellate brief notes that a

meeting of 2600 readers would "obviously" be interesting to

the Secret Service "because

those individuals have, by their conduct, evidenced an

interest in the technical

intricacies of the telephone system."

<P>

Says Sobel: "The [search] was blatantly illegal. . . . It

was basically a privatized

search and seizure."

<P>

He adds, "It's important that FOIA not just be a statute

that is on the books but one

that is being actively and aggressively used."

<P>

If anyone is actively and aggressively using FOIA, it's

EPIC. The group, which last year

had a budget of roughly $200,000, has three other pending

FOIA cases and has litigated

three others over the past few years.

<P>

EPIC is suing the Commerce Department, seeking a copy of a

department survey of

encryption software availability abroad. It has a pending

suit against the National

Security Council seeking information about the Security

Policy Board, the executive body

established in 1994 to take charge of governmentwide

security policy.

<P>

And the group is suing the NSC and the National Security

Agency seeking documents

related to the Clipper Chip initiative, the government's

proposed national encryption

standard.

<P>

In two now completed cases against the Federal Bureau of

Investigation, the group sought

and received some of the FBI's documentation of the need for

the 1994 digital telephony

law, a measure which guaranteed continued law-enforcement

wiretapping authority as

telecommunications technology progresses. Many of the key

documents were heavily

redacted.

<P>

And a suit against the National Institute of Standards and

Technology sought documents

dealing with development of the Digital Signature Standard,

a means of verifying the

origin of computer files. The suit was thrown out, but a

significant cache of documents

was released, says Sobel.

<P>

EPIC's FOIA work gets high marks from a diverse range of

people interested in computer

policy.

<P>

"This is what Congress intended when it passed the law,"

says Stewart Baker, who served

as general counsel at the NSA, where he helped shepherd the

Clipper proposal, which EPIC

opposes.

<P>

"It's probably a better use of FOIA than 90 percent of FOIA

use, which is big law firms

submitting requests to inform their rich clients," adds

Baker, now a partner at D.C.'s

Steptoe & Johnson.

<P>

Even Jerry Berman, director of the Center for Democracy and

Technology, which has often

clashed with EPIC, speaks admiringly of the group's

anti-secrecy crusade:

<P>

"I think that David Sobel has done some very important work

under the FOIA, whether its

getting the documents under the digital telephony bill or

the Secret Service case," he

says. "It's important in the public accountability sense,

and it's

important in framing

the debate over civil liberties."

MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF MOTION<P>



<B>I. Introduction</B><P>



The District Court has ordered F. Lee Bailey to be incarcerated tomorrow,

Friday, March 1, 1996, because he has not paid approximately $3.0 million. The

District Court imposed the incarceration in the exercise of its civil contempt

power, but the order is illegal. It was entered without the essential elements

of due process; indeed, there never has been a show-cause order. Moreover, the

order is impermissibly punitive, not coercive. The unrebutted evidence is (a)

that Mr. Bailey has approximately $50,000 cash, (b) that the remainder of his

assets consist of illiquid real estate, boats and airplanes, and (c) that Mr.

Bailey has offered to pledge or hand over all of his assets to the court

immediately. <P>



The government argued that it is not sufficient for Mr. Bailey to give the

court all he has (and there is no dispute that he has offered and will do this

immediately). Instead, without evidence of any kind -- not a single witness or

document -- the government argued, and the district court accepted, that

millions of dollars might be forthcoming in some unspecified way if Mr.

Bailey's "feet are held to the fire" by incarceration. In the face of a pledge

or transfer to the Court of Mr. Bailey's entire financial statement, which

consists of about $50,000 cash and illiquid assets, incarceration as a tool to

coerce payment of $3.0 million is illogical, crude and unfair. It constitutes,

in truth, a decision to remand Mr. Bailey to debtors' prison to punish him for

perceived misconduct, not to coerce payment of money. <P>



We show here that all of this has occurred almost immediately after the

government claimed a right to stock it transferred to Mr. Bailey, and well

before any trial of the merits issues. In essence, there is a pre-judgment

attachment to secure the government's claim. Mr. Bailey can do no more than

pledge or transfer to the Court all that he has. In fairness, it is

overwhelmingly sufficient. In the law of civil contempt, anything else would

illegally punitive. <P>



We stand ready to pursue the appeal of the civil contempt order on any

expedited basis the Court should order. We will appear immediately if the Court

wishes argument on this motion. Pending appeal, and certainly pending decision

on this motion, we urge that the district court's order of incarceration be

stayed. <P>



<B>II. Summary of Facts and Proceedings Below Mr. Bailey's Representation of

Claude Duboc </B><P>



Mr. Claude Duboc, Mr. Bailey's client, was indicted for various drug

trafficking offenses by the United States. Following his extradition to the

United States in early 1994, Duboc contacted Los Angeles attorney Robert

Shapiro to represent him. (Tr. 197 - 98, 215.)<<Note 1 - References to the

transcript (Tr.) refers to the transcript of proceedings held in the District

Court on February 2 and 3, attached hereto as Exhibit 2.>> Shapiro contacted

Bailey and the two undertook to represent Duboc, with Bailey acting as lead

counsel. Bailey had numerous meetings with the prosecutors and case agents in

April 1994. (Tr. 208, 242-43.) Bailey determined that a guilty plea and

cooperation with the government would be in Duboc's best interests given the

nature of the case and the possibility of life imprisonment. (Tr. 222, 224,

237. ) The plea would involve the turnover of a vast array of assets held by

Duboc outside of the United States. (Tr. 224-25, 240. ) Some were probably

forfeitable. Others would have been difficult to repatriate, either because

they were located in foreign jurisdictions unwilling to allow the transfer of

the asset to the United States, (Tr. 244), or because it could not reasonably

be shown that the foreign asset was purchased with the proceeds of illegal drug

transactions in the United States. (Tr. 238-29. ) During debriefings in April,

Bailey and Duboc provided a list of all of Duboc's assets. (Tr. 148, 165-66.)

<P>



Among Duboc's overseas assets were two yachts and two very expensive homes

(total value as much as $50 million) and other illiquid assets held by Duboc in

France. (Tr. 265, 316.) As part of the plea discussions in April of 1994, it

was agreed that these assets would be forfeited. (Tr. 318- 19.) Forfeiture of

such assets, however, was complicated because of their location in France and

their illiquid nature. (Tr. 244.) It was agreed among the government, Bailey

and Duboc that Bailey would undertake to maintain, market and sell the

properties so that the proceeds could be repatriated to the United States. (Tr.

265.) Apparently, the government was concerned that it would not be able to

obtain the proceeds from the property without using Mr. Bailey, there being no

treaty between France and the United States allowing for the transfer of French

property allegedly purchased with the proceeds of illegal drug transactions.

<P>



Major expense would be involved in the upkeep of the assets, particularly the

homes. Taxes, staff costs, some repairs, and related expenses were required to

be borne by Bailey for whatever period the homes were to be kept until they

could successfully be marketed. (Tr. 209-11.) Marketing and transaction costs

and other related expenses would also be involved. <P>



In discussions on April 26, 1994, the government sought a vehicle by which

Bailey (and perhaps other counsel) would be reimbursed for the expected

substantial costs of upkeep for these massive and valuable properties. (Tr.

315, 321, 370-71, 374.) <P>



In addition, the government and Bailey sought a vehicle that would cover

Bailey's legal fees and those of co-counsel. (Tr. 22728, 320, 370-71). All of

the parties contemplated that the order of magnitude of the legal fees

substantially exceeded a million dollars (Tr. 227-28, 241, 269, 277, 340),

although the government declined to "authorize" any particular fee (Tr. 370).

It was also understood that expenses, as well, would be substantial. (Tr.

26566, 315, 321, 370-71, 374.) <P>



<B>The Agreement of April 26, 1994</B><P>



Bailey, Assistant United States Attorney Gregory Miller and a case agent had

discussions on April 26, 1994, about dedicating an asset that might be made

available to serve both as the source of legal fees and the funding for the

expenses incurred in connection with the properties. (Tr. 319-20, 370-71.)

There were discussions about a substantial cash account held by Duboc. (Tr.

373, 398.) Thereafter, the government suggested 602,000 shares of Biochem

Pharma, Inc. stock, held by Duboc in an account in his name at UBS, a

Luxembourg brokerage. (Tr. 278, 294, 300.) The shares may well have been

purchased in Canada with Canadian funds and there apparently was doubt at the

time about their actual forfeitability. <P>



The Biochem shares were selling in the range of $9 to $10. (Tr. 292.) Duboc,

however, believed that there was a significant chance that the shares might

appreciate. (Tr. 248, 292, 314-15.) <P>



Bailey agreed to take the shares as the source of the payment of his and other

counsel's legal fees and expenses. (Tr. 248, 300, 338.) He was warned by Miller

of the risk involved due to the possibility the price of the stock would in

fact decline. (Tr. 248-49, 324-25.) Miller testified that in his mind, if the

shares had gone down (which he viewed as unlikely), there would be no other

source to which Bailey could look for his legal fees and expense

reimbursements, and the government would not permit other assets to be used

that for purpose. (Tr. 324-26, 338-41, 373.) Thus, if the value of the stock

declined, Bailey might have gotten no fee and been reimbursed no expenses. (Tr.

339-340.) <P>



Within a few hours of having settled on the Biochem shares as the funding

source for all of the legal fees and all of the expenses incurred in connection

with the properties, Miller and case agent Carl Lilley prepared stock transfer

documents for Duboc to execute authorizing the transfer of the shares from the

UBS account in Luxembourg to an account that Bailey had at Credit Suisse in

Switzerland. (Tr. 255-56.) The document was executed by Duboc transferring to

Bailey 602,000 Biochem Pharma shares in fee simple and without limitation on

April 26, 1994. (Tr. 255-56.) The shares arrived in Bailey's account on or

about May 9, 1994. (Tr. 250.) <P>



<B>The Absence of Writings</B><P>



Excluding the stock transfer document, no representative of the government

prepared any writing concerning the agreement with Bailey pursuant to which the

shares were given him. (Tr. 260, 35859.) There is no written agreement with

Bailey regarding the shares, no internal memorandum prepared by any Assistant

United States Attorney, no statement on the record of any court proceeding, no

documentation with the Department of Justice or the Asset Forfeiture Division

pursuant to any Attorney Fee Forfeiture Guideline. (Tr. 264, 296, 336-37, 376.)

(There may be a memorandum prepared by United States Attorney Patterson two

days after the plea in late May 1994 for an official at the Department of

Justice. The government has declined to produce that memorandum or describe it,

and it is unclear whether it articulates the April agreement with Bailey in any

detail or significant specificity.) In addition, as it seems the transfer to

Bailey occurred on the day the government first conceived it, (Tr. 255.), it

does not appear that any Department of Justice official was consulted regarding

the transfer. <P>



<B>The Differing Understandings</B><P>



It is now clear that the oral discussions concerning the Biochem stock yielded

distinctly different impressions of what was agreed and intended. Bailey

understood that the government had agreed to transfer to him in fee simple for

counsels' legal fees, and for expenses in connection with the properties, stock

which the government determined to be nonforfeitable and hence available for

use as legal fees. (Tr. 246, 284, 287, 306-07.) He understood that he was being

given full right, title and interest in the stock (Tr. 256, 258), and that the

shares were his to invest, protect, or use as he saw fit, since he bore the

risk that their loss in value would diminish his capacity to look to the shares

for fees or expenses. (Tr. 268-69, 295, 296.) As a consequence, he had the

right to act as he saw fit to protect himself. (Tr. 249.) He believed that he

was entitled to the upside gain since he bore the risk. (Tr. 52, 250-52, 270,

295, 297, 305.) <P>



He conceived the understanding with the government as one in which he had an

obligation to ultimately return to the government a sum certain, computed as

the value of the shares on the day he received them, less what the Court

ultimately approved for his legal fees and expenses. (Tr. 249.) Assuming that

the shares were worth $6 million on the date of receipt, May 9, 1994, he had an

obligation eventually to return to the government in dollars that amount less

legal fees and expenses that were approved. (Tr. 25051, 268, 296, 298.) While

he viewed himself as obliged ultimately to obtain that approval, he did not

believe that he was required to obtain approval for every disbursement for

expenses or fees in advance of their distribution to him, but rather in

connection with a final accounting. (Tr. 253, 269, 276.) As a consequence, he

made distributions without court approval to himself both for expenses incurred

and time invested in the matter. (Tr. 76, 83, 267-69. ) <P>



The shares did not diminish in value during 1994. In 1995 they began to

appreciate substantially. Bailey took a fraction of this appreciation, in

addition to his fees, on the understanding that he owned the shares outright

and that title had been transferred to him for good or ill. (Tr. 271. )     

<P>



The government viewed the arrangement differently. Assistant United States

Attorney Miller's conception was that the government had simply "parked" the

shares with Bailey. The idea was that Bailey would hold the shares, allowing

the government effectively to "speculate" that their value would increase. This

would give the government the benefit of any increased value in the shares and

avoid depressing their value by unloading 602,000 shares at one time in to the

market. (Tr. 314-15, 318, 342. ) The government would retain its ultimate

ownership of the shares and its remainder interest in the shares as forfeitable

property by this parking mechanism. (Tr. 319, 342. ) The government would delay

the filing of a forfeiture claim until the French properties were sold, legal

fees paid to counsel, and other expenses retired. (Tr. 318-19, 34950. ) The

remaining shares, having appreciated presumably, would then be forfeited. (Tr.

328-29. ) Throughout the period in which Bailey held the shares, he was not to

hold them as his in fee but instead would simply hold them "in trust," though

no trust instrument was ever prepared. (Tr. 318-319, 322, 355-56, 378. ) <P>



<B>The Colloquy in Chambers</B><P>



Duboc pled guilty on May 17, 1994, represented by Bailey and co-counsel. The

written plea agreement prepared by the government does not contain any

reference to the arrangement with Bailey. The plea agreement does not reference

the 602,000 Biochem shares directly or indirectly. There is no list of

forfeitable assets appended to the plea agreement nor is there any textual

basis upon which to conclude that the 602,000 Biochem shares were intended to

be subject to forfeiture. Duboc appeared and entered his plea in open court.

There is no reference in the record of that proceeding to the understanding

that the government had negotiated with Bailey regarding legal fees. <P>



The only reference to the Biochem transaction occurred during a brief colloquy

in chambers before Chief Judge Paul prior to the plea proceeding on the morning

of May 17, 1994. (Tr. 375. ) The chambers conference was not transcribed. All

parties agree that the judge was told that counsel's fees would be subject to

court approval. (Tr. 262, 321, 334, 378. ) Bailey and the government differ as

to when court approval was required. (Tr. 253, 269, 276, 320-22. ) The nuances

of the understanding as regards who held title to the shares, who bore the risk

of their loss, who bore the benefit of their gain, or a half dozen other

contingencies associated with the understanding were apparently not addressed.

<P>



<B>The Government's Conduct from May of 1994 through Early January 1996</B> <P>



From the time of the plea until early January 1996, the government can point to

nothing it said or did that is consistent with its present claim that it

believed it had, beyond its claim for the original $6 million dollars less fees

and expenses, a remainder interest in the potentially increased value of the

Biochem shares. No prosecutor or case agent ever followed the price of the

shares, (Tr. 383-85.), even though the value of the shares could easily be

obtained since the stock price is reported daily in the NASDAQ listings in the

newspaper (Tr. 384, 3875-88, 390, 393.) No prosecutor or case agent was aware

that the shares appreciated substantially in 1995. (Tr. 383, 385-88.) No

inquiry was made of Bailey or any other counsel regarding the value of the

shares. (Tr. 383-84.) No effort was made to capture the increasing value of the

shares by liquidating portions of them as the price rose, although the value in

1995 began vastly to exceed the original $6 million. (Tr. 384-85.) The

government could offer no explanation, either, why if it believed itself the

ultimate owner of the shares, it allowed them to be deposited in the first

instance in a Swiss bank account, vastly complicating repatriation, instead of

a U.S. bank or brokerage account. (Tr. 359-60, 363.) <P>



At no time through all of 1994 and 1995 did the government seek an order of

forfeiture or file a civil forfeiture complaint as to the Biochem shares, (Tr.

364-66.), although it did so with respect to other of Duboc's assets. And, as

noted, it never produced any writing, memorandum, court pleading, record

representation, or any other reasonably reliable memorialization of its

purported continuing ownership in the shares. (Tr. 364, 367, 392.) Simply put,

up until January 11, 1996, the government acted as if it had given the shares

to Bailey, caring no further about them and allowing the risk of loss or risk

of gain to be Bailey's. (Tr. 389.) <P>



On or about January 11, 1996, Duboc sought to terminate Bailey's services and

substitute new counsel. At the hearing on his motion to substitute counsel,

Duboc's new attorneys advised that the value of the Biochem shares had risen

from approximately $10 to something in the range of $40 a share. It is at this

point that the government first learned of the increase in value. Only

thereafter did the government begin to assert in the district court its

entitlement to the remainder interest in the Biochem shares on grounds that the

shares were "forfeitable" and that Bailey was simply a "trustee". <P>



<B>The Order to Appear on February 2, 1996</B><P>



On January 22, 1996, the government filed an Emergency Motion to Surrender

Property (Doc. 67) in which it claimed the shares were forfeitable. The motion

sought a court order requiring Bailey to immediately place the remaining

Biochem shares in the court's repository and deliver to the court an accounting

of his handling of the stock. <P>



The court acted upon the government's Emergency Motion to Surrender Property by

ordering (Doc. 68) on Thursday, January 25, 1996, that Bailey appear in court

the next week "to answer, in person, the Government's Motion," and to bring

with him the Biochem stock or any assets into which it may have been converted,

plus a full accounting, with documentation, of "all assets he received from

Claude Duboc, directly or indirectly, and all disbursements made, including the

purpose for such disbursement," as well as "all bank records * * * pertaining

to all assets, or proceeds from the sale/mortgage/pledge/ hypothecation

thereof, received by him, directly or indirectly, as attorney or agent for

Claude Duboc." Under the Order, the date for Bailey to appear was Thursday,

February 1, but on January 26, the court reset the hearing for Friday, February

2. <P>



On January 25, upon receipt of the court's order of that date, Bailey contacted

counsel to represent him with respect to the order and his appearance the next

week. Bailey met with counsel on Saturday, January 27. Counsel had four

business days thereafter to prepare for Bailey's response on February 2. <P>



Before court was called to session on the morning of February 2, Bailey filed a

motion to continue the hearing to permit sufficient time to prepare; a motion

to permit him to take discovery; a motion to vacate the order requiring the

turnover of stocks and assets on the grounds that the order was one to effect a

seizure ancillary to a forfeiture and must be conducted in accordance with the

statutorily required procedures; motions to recuse the judge and to disqualify

government counsel, the First Assistant United States Attorney for the

district, on the grounds that they both were material witnesses to undocumented

discussions concerning the terms of the oral agreement between Bailey and the

government; and a demand for a jury trial. All of the motions were summarily

denied. <P>



<B>The February 2-3 Hearing</B><P>



Prior to the commencement of the February 2-3 hearing, there was never any

motion for contempt filed by the government and no show cause order issued by

the court. Indeed, the court's order fixing the hearing date required not that

Bailey appear to defend a contempt proceeding, but rather "to answer, in

person," the government's "Emergency Motion to Surrender Property" and to

produce shares of stock, plus pertinent records and accountings. <P>



The government's Emergency Motion was not a contempt motion and does not even

mention the word. <<Note 2 - The government wrote a letter to Bailey, dated

January 29, indicating an intention to "seek" contempt sanctions if Bailey were

not to comply with the court's order, i.e., to "answer in person" the

allegations of the emergency motion and to produce the stock and documentation.

The letter does not suggest that Bailey must show cause why he should not be

held in contempt. Moreover, the court, which was copied with the letter,

dispelled any notion that such correspondence would be the functional

equivalent of a motion. Rather, the court emphasized it had not and would not

read letters from either side. "THE COURT:* * * Any time you want to talk to

the Court, you file a motion. MR. ZUCKERMAN: Is that same rule apply to the

government? THE COURT: Absolutely. I haven't read -I don't have any motion or

any letter from the government that I've read in this case. I don't intend to,

and I don't want either side favoring me with a copy of a letter between

lawyers." (Tr. 28.)>> Indeed, it is apparent from counsel's comments during the

first stages of the proceedings on February 2, that he believed the hearing

would cover, at most, the government's contentions in its Emergency Motion to

Surrender Property and the status of efforts to comply with the production and

documentation requirements of the January 25 order.<<Note 3 - Counsel argued

that it would be unfair to force Bailey to present his case on the "merits" --

that is, the meaning and provisions of an undocumented oral agreement -- on

only one week's notice and without discovery or access to witnesses. (Tr.

35-36.) A hearing on the merits was, therefore, postponed until a future time.

As of the date of this motion. there has been no merits hearing.>> (Tr. 2, 6,

27, 38.) <P>



The government did raise the issue of contempt at the hearing, stating that if

the hearing indicated Bailey was not in full compliance with the provisions of

the court's orders "it is the government's intention to request that he be held

in contempt of court, civil contempt." (Tr. 23, 39.) It cited as due notice the

January 29 letter to Bailey -- a letter that the court refused to read

precisely because it was not a proper motion. The court, however, did not

endorse the government's suggestion to treat the proceedings as a contempt

hearing and, instead, called Bailey to take the stand without once indicating

that contempt was to be an issue at this hearing. In fact, prior to the

commencement of testimony, the court had never, either before the hearing or

during it, written or spoken the words "contempt" or "show cause". <P>



The taking of testimony proceeded to the end of the day. Bailey testified until

the lunch break. (Tr. 43-100.) After lunch, the government pressed the notion

that the hearing was really one on the issue of contempt and sanctions for

contempt. (Tr. 110-114.) Again, the court did not endorse this view of the

proceedings, but does appear to have begun gravitating toward that position,

commenting, for example, "Well, I think what I'm interested in today is where

are the assets, what happened to the assets, why the information has or has not

been produced here in open court." (Tr. 112.) <P>



The government then called Edward Shohat and Robert Shapiro, both of whom had

been co-counsel with Bailey on the Duboc defense. Their testimony consumed the

remainder of the day on Friday. After that, and as the court was adjourning for

the evening at 5:44 p.m., the court for the first -- and only -- time uttered

the words "show cause," finally making it clear that the hearing had become a

hearing on contempt: "We are going to recess until the morning, and we're going

to determine only the question to show cause." (Tr. 231.) Thus, at close of

business on a Friday night in Ocala, Florida, without access to records,

witnesses or legal research, Bailey and his counsel were told that the hearing

had been transformed into a hearing to show cause why Bailey should not be held

in contempt. <P>



The hearing resumed at 9 o'clock on Saturday morning and continued until

shortly past 2:00 p.m. Mr. Bailey was called as his only witness, no other

witnesses being unavailable under the circumstances. (See Tr. 307, 424.)

Bailey's testimony was directed to the facts surrounding the agreement by which

Bailey was to receive and hold the Biochem stock. The government called as

rebuttal witness Assistant United States Attorney Gregory Miller. He testified

at length about the government's understandings and assumptions about the

agreement, the absence of documentation of it, and various meetings and

conversations, including an unrecorded conference in Judge Paul's chambers (Tr.

321, 334, 375-79), in which terms of the agreement were discussed. <P>



In his closing argument, Bailey's counsel recounted efforts made to comply with

the Court's prior directive, including the involvement of an accounting firm to

produce the accounting demanded by the court. (Tr. 412-13.) Counsel frankly

stated that the process of compliance, while underway, was not completed. It

had not been possible in the time available to extract the shares from

Switzerland, to identify or produce assets that may have been purchased with

proceeds from the sale or encumbrance of the stock, or to obtain all the

records. (Tr. 412-20.) Moreover, Bailey had been legitimately unavailable to

give full-time effort to the cause due to his obligations to a client facing

trial in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York

in a life-count murder case. (Tr. 413, 415, 418.) <P>



Counsel, however, repeatedly stated Bailey's willingness and intention to

undertake diligently to achieve compliance. (Tr. 414 ("He will undertake any

task reasonably put to him to get the shares back." "[H]e has expressed * * *

his willingness to abide by the Court order."), 415 ("I place on the record

that Mr. Bailey will and I will undertake whatever steps we are directed to

undertake * * *."), 416 ("And I represent to the Court now * * * that he will

provide Your Honor with the electronic banking data that constitutes the

records * * *."), 417 ("[H]e is willing to do whatever is needed to repatriate

the shares from Switzerland;" "[H]e is willing to provide books and records"),

428 ("So, I just * * * say to the Court, Mr. Bailey will provide compliance; I

will provide compliance.").) In light of these representations, counsel pointed

out, "it's a little extreme to say that his willingness to produce the required

material, as expressed to the Court now, is so willfully disobedient that it

requires the sanction of contempt, much less incarceration." (Tr. 418.) <P>



Despite Mr. Bailey's willingness to comply, the court issued its order of

contempt. <P>



<B>The Court's Order of Civil Contempt</B><P>



The Court's Order of Civil Contempt finds Mr. Bailey in contempt for his

failure to produce the documents and accountings previously ordered or to show

his legal inability to do so. For such contempt, it orders him "sentenced to

the Custody of the Attorney General for a period of six months", such sentence

to commence on March 1, 1996, should he fail to purge himself of contempt. In

order to purge himself of contempt, Mr. Bailey is not only ordered to produce

the documents and accountings by February 29, but ordered to "produce the

stocks themself". Further, to purge himself of contempt and avoid

incarceration, Mr. Bailey is ordered by February 29 to "repay the approximately

$3,000,000 that he has withdrawn from the Swiss account for his own personal

expenses and attorneys fees". <P>



<B>Bailey's Efforts to Comply</B><P>



Immediately after the Court's February 3 Order, Mr. Bailey and his counsel

continued their efforts to produce a complete accounting of Mr. Bailey's

expenditures since April, 1993, and to collect all documents relating to the

stock and the expenditures of proceeds derived therefrom. They also commenced

efforts to have the Biochem stock transferred from Credit Suisse and to raise

in excess of $3 million. While those efforts are set forth in the affidavit of

Michael R. Smith, Esq., which is included as part of Exhibit 6 attached hereto,

they may be summarized as follows: <P>



A. Document Production<P>



On February 14, 1996, Mr. Bailey's counsel produced to the Court and the

government thousands of pages of documents, including (a) the HUD-1 closing

statement on the purchase of the home owned jointly by Mr. Bailey and his wife;

(b) invoices and related documents showing expenditures by Mr. Bailey in

connection with the properties the government asked him to maintain in France

by using the Credit Suisse account; (c) all check registers, monthly statements

and canceled checks from April 1994 through December 1995 for Mr. Bailey's

money market account, for Mr. Bailey's personal account, for Mr. Bailey's law

office account, and for the other subaccounts to which funds may have been

transferred from the money market account and through the personal account; (d)

the Credit Suisse statements then available in the United States; and (e)

redacted records from Bailey, Fishman, Ferrin & Freeman showing Mr. Bailey's

deposits into that law firm. <P>



On February 21, 1996, Mr. Bailey's counsel produced to the government all

records in the possession of Mr. Bailey's Swiss counsel regarding the relevant

Credit Suisse account, including monthly statements and backup documents

showing sales, wire transfers, and pay orders. <P>



On February 23, 1996, Mr. Bailey's counsel produced two notebooks of records

documenting expenditures incurred by Mr. Duboc and Mr. Bailey as well as an

additional notebook containing miscellaneous documents reflecting expenditures

incurred during the Duboc representation. <P>



After being notified by the government on February 23 that it sought additional

documents, additional records were produced on February 27. Mr. Bailey and his

counsel have indicated his willingness to provide all records that can be

located responsive to the government's requests. <P>



B. The Accounting<P>



Mr. Bailey retained the services of Kenneth Barker, a C.P.A. with the

accounting firm of Arthur Andersen, to perform an accounting. Mr. Barker has

produced to the Court and the government a comprehensive accounting which

traces funds from Mr. Bailey's Credit Suisse account to their ultimate

disposition for any amounts in excess of $5000. <P>



C. The Return of the Stock from Switzerland <P>



In addition, Mr. Bailey sought through his Swiss counsel, Charles Poncet, to

cause Credit Suisse to transfer the Biochem Pharma shares to the Court. Again,

those efforts are set forth at some length in the affidavit of Michael R.

Smith. (See Exhibit 6.) These efforts included, through motions to the Court,

to approve an account to which the stock could be transferred and arranging

with Paine Webber for such an account in the United States. They also included

dealing with a freeze order placed on the Credit Suisse account by Mr. Duboc's

lawyers and a freeze order placed upon the account by Swiss prosecutors. <P>



Despite the obstacles presented by language, distance, time zones, freeze

orders, obscure banking laws and regulations, as of February 27, 164,00 shares

of Biochem Pharma stock have been released by Credit Suisse for transfer. These

shares have an approximate present value of $7 million. <P>



The approximate remaining 240,000 shares, however, are subject to a $2.3

million lien of Credit Suisse. That $2.3 million lien was imposed on the shares

prior to January, 1996, for withdrawals made by Mr. Bailey from the account in

1994 and 1995. While Mr. Bailey and his attorneys have sought authorization

from the government and the Court to authorize Credit Suisse to sell some

shares in order to discharge the lien and to transfer the remainder to the

Paine Webber account, the United States has objected and the Court has not

approved such action. While this would have produced a transfer of stock valued

at approximately $15 million, no further stock will be transferred by Credit

Suisse unless and until they are authorized to discharge their lien. <P>



D. Depositing Approximately $3 million Into the Court Registry <P>



As set forth again in the affidavit of Michael R. Smith, Mr. Bailey has made

all reasonable efforts to raise money not only to deposit with the Court, but

to pay off the Credit Suisse lien. The vast bulk of Mr. Bailey's net worth

consists of the value of boats and aircraft owned by a Subchapter S corporation

which he wholly owns. These assets have equity of somewhat over $2 million.

Based upon his net worth, Mr. Bailey has repeatedly sought to borrow money from

banks and other conventional lenders, to no avail. He has contacted numerous

individuals with the aim of obtaining personal loans secured by his assets,

also to no avail to date. While he has made inquiries regarding sale of-the

assets, given their nature, they will take time to sell, at least for anything

close to their real value. Given the failure of all possible avenues to realize

money from his present assets sufficient to purge himself of contempt, Mr.

Bailey has offered to provide the Court with the titles to these and other

assets, as well as to take any steps the Court requires. He simply does not

have the money and has not, despite all reasonable efforts, been able to raise

the money by financing based essentially on boats and airplanes as collateral.

<P>



<B>Hearing of February 27-28</B><P>



On February 23, Mr. Bailey requested by motion that the Court hold a status

conference and hearing. On Monday, February 26, Mr. Bailey filed his Motion Not

to Execute on Order of Incarceration and to Provide Additional Time For

Compliance, attached hereto as Exhibit 6. The hearings on this motion commenced

on Tuesday, February 27 were continued all day February 28. <P>



Unfortunately, there is no transcript of the hearings at this time. Indeed,

given the emergency nature of this motion, there will be no transcript for this

Court's consideration prior to the end of business on March 1, the time

scheduled for Mr. Bailey to report for his imprisonment. However, because of

the importance of the evidence taken at these hearings, we describe them below.

<P>



Four witnesses testified to Mr. Bailey's compliance with the Court's order of

civil contempt and to explain his need for an additional 21 days to raise the

millions of dollars ordered to be placed in the court registry. They were

Michael R. Smith, his attorney, Kenneth Barker, the Arthur Andersen accountant,

Philip Vitello, a lawyer and international businessman who is an expert in the

liquidation of assets, and Mr. Bailey. <P>



Mr. Smith testified at length to the matters set forth in his affidavit

regarding Bailey's document production and other matters. As he established, no

documents in Mr. Bailey's possession, custody, or control that are either

within the scope of the Court's order or the government's request have been

intentionally withheld. Rather, every potentially relevant piece of paper, over

ten thousand pages, have been produced. While the government at the hearing

pointed to a handful of peripheral documents not yet produced that are

mentioned in the records already produced, there can be no dispute based upon

Mr. Smith's testimony that Mr. Bailey has made every reasonable effort to

comply with the document production requirements of the Court's Order of Civil

Contempt. <P>



Mr. Smith also testified regarding the efforts made to transfer the Biochem

Pharma shares from Credit Suisse. These included the efforts in a short period

to overcome the hurdles imposed by the Duboc freeze order, the freeze order

obtained by the Swiss prosecutor, and the pre-existing Credit Suisse lien. To

date, Mr. Bailey has succeeded in obtaining the transfer of 164,000 shares. Mr.

Smith also testified about the Credit Suisse lien and how the transfer of the

remaining shares is contingent on the release of the lien. The release of the

lien is, of course, only a matter of money; if Mr. Bailey could pay off the

lien, the Swiss would release the remaining 400,000 shares. <P>



Mr. Barker submitted his detailed accounting and testified at length regarding

the expenditures made by Mr. Bailey for 1994, 1995 and the first month of 1996.

In effect, he expanded on the brief accounting he had performed prior to the

hearings of February 2 and 3. The accounting was both massive and detailed.

Indeed, the government did not seek to attack or discredit the accounting in

any fashion. Rather, the government appeared at the hearings to be completely

satisfied with the accounting presented. <P>



Mr. Vitello testified to the impossibility of liquidating Mr. Bailey's primary

assets in the time available under the Court's order and further testified to

the orderly procedures that would be necessary to properly liquidate the

properties. He also testified to the virtual impossibility of obtaining

financing in the time frame set forth by the Court's order. Mr. Vitello's

testimony was not challenged in any meaningful manner. <P>



Mr. Bailey also testified at length. Most critically. he testified that he

would pledge turn over to the Court. or otherwise alienate every asset he had

accumulated over his lifetime including his home. to comply with the Court's

order. <P>



The government's position, presented through its witness, Assistant United

States Attorney Miller, and through its cross examination of Bailey, was that

Bailey deserved to be punished. According to the government, Bailey deserved to

be incarcerated not because he had failed to prove that he had taken all

reasonable steps to comply with the contempt order, but because he had written

checks for personal expenses and legal fees prior to February 3, the date the

Court signed the contempt order. Apparently, these expenditures violated a

freeze order entered by the court in January, of which both Mr. Bailey and his

counsel Mr. Smith testified they were unaware. In other words, the government's

position at the hearings was that Mr. Bailey had failed to comply with a court

order other than the contempt order and, therefore, could and should be

incarcerated for this newly alleged violation. <P>



On February 29, 1996, the District Court entered its order denying Mr. Bailey's

request for a 21-day extension. The Order, attached hereto, requires

incarceration to begin at 5:00 p.m. on February 29, 1996, but that has been

orally modified to 10:00 a.m. On tomorrow, March 1, 1996. The Order, on the

last day of possible compliance, announces new monetary obligations, reducing

the obligation to pay $5.3 million to an obligation to pay $2.3 million to

Credit Suisse to release shares and to pay $700,000 to the court. The court has

held that incarceration is required to compel the production of any documents

that remain outstanding, although none were specified. Finally, the court

suggested that the earlier 6-month prison sentence actually is subject to purge

at any time. The court gave Mr. Bailey less than twenty-four hours to comply

with this reconstruction of the earlier order. Notably, half of the order

contains criticism of Mr. Bailey's conduct before the civil contempt order

signed January 3, 1996, and compliance with the civil contempt order, such that

the order is infused with the feel of affront and punishment, not a proper

evaluation of compliance and coercion. <P>



The Denial of the Motion to Stay Pending Appeal by the District Court <P>



Mr. Bailey moved in the district court for a stay pending appeal on Wednesday,

February 28, 1996. On Thursday, February 29, 1996, the district court denied

the motion. A transcript reflecting the order, delivered orally, is attached.

<P>



<B>ARGUMENT</B><P>



Standard for Granting a Stay<P>



A motion for stay pending appeal requires consideration of four factors: <P>



1) the movant is likely to prevail on the merits of the appeal; <P>



2) absent a stay the movant will suffer irreparable damage; <P>



3) the adverse party will not suffer substantial harm from issuance of the

stay; and <P>



4) granting the stay will cause no harm to the public interest. <P>



See In re Grand Jury Proceedings (Cohen), 975 F.2d 1488, 1492 (llth Cir. 1992);

Garcia-Mir v. Meese, 781 F.2d 1450, 1453 (llth Cir. 1986); Ruiz v. Estelle, 650

F.2d 555, 565 (5th Cir. Unit A 1981) (binding precedent in the Eleventh

Circuit), cert. denied, 460 U.S. 1042 (1983); Dillard v. City of Greensboro,

870 F. Supp. 1031, 1033 (M.D. Ala. 1994); Int'l Blvd of Boilermakers v. Local

Lodge, 667 F. Supp. 870, 873 (M.D. Ga. 1987). <P>



The degree of likelihood of success on the merits that must be shown varies

depending on how heavily the balance of equities favors the movant. Thus the

motion may be granted upon a showing of "a substantial case on the merits" when

"the balance of the equities [identified in factors 2, 3, and 4] weighs heavily

in favor of granting the stay." United States v. Hamilton, 963 F.2d 322, 323

(11th Cir. 1992); Garcia-Mir, 781 F.2d at 1453; Ruiz, 650 F.2d at 565; In'tl

Bhd of Boilermakers, 667 F. Supp. at 870. <P>



Where the other three factors favor interim relief, the court may grant a stay

"if the movant has made a substantial case on the merits". Ruiz, 650 F.2d at

565 (quoting Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Comm'n v. Holiday Tours.

Inc., 559 F.2d 891, 843 (D.C. Cir. 1977)). "The court is not required to find

that ultimate success by the movant is a mathematical probability, and indeed,

* * * may grant a stay even though its own approach may be contrary to movant's

view of the merits. n 1a- (quoting Holiday Tours). <P>



Thus, an order maintaining the status quo is appropriate when a serious legal

question is presented and the other equities favor granting the stay. Id. <P>



A. Bailey Is Likely To Succeed on the Merits of His Appeal. <P>





Bailey has today (February 29, 1996) filed a Notice of Appeal with the clerk of

the district court. This notice appeals from the February 7 Order of Civil

Contempt; the February 21 denial of Bailey's Motion to Reconsider and Motion to

Amend Judgment Pursuant to Rule 59 or for Relief from Judgment Pursuant to Rule

60; and the February 28 denial of Bailey's Motion Not to Execute on Order of

Incarceration and to Provide Additional Time for Compliance. The appeal will

raise the following substantial issues. <P>



1. Bailey Has Demonstrated Present

Inability To Comply<P>



"Present inability to comply" is a defense to contempt. CFTC v. Wellington

Precious Metals. Inc., 950 F.2d 1525, 1529 (11th Cir. 1992). The alleged

contemnor must demonstrate that he has made 'in good faith all reasonable

efforts' to meet the terms of the court order he is seeking to avoid." Id. If

sufficient showing is made, "[T]he burden shifts back to the initiating party *

* *. The party seeking to show contempt, then, has the burden of proving

ability to comply." Id. at 1529. "The party seeking the contempt citation

retains the ultimate burden of proof." I:- (quoting In re Battaglia, 653 F.2d

419, 423 (9th Cir. 1981)). <P>



Even under the constraints of the February 2-3 proceeding that preceded the

contempt citation, Bailey made a substantial showing that inability was very

much an issue. As to the production of stock, it was then established that

Credit Suisse had a lien on it that prevented its transfer. As to the

production of other assets obtained with proceeds of the stock, the creation of

a full accounting, and the production of all related documentation, Bailey and

counsel demonstrated that there simply had not been enough time to accomplish

compliance. This could hardly have been surprising since the order to produce

the stock, the other assets, and the documentation had only been in existence a

total of five business days. Under these circumstances, the burden should have

been on the government to prove ability to comply. <P>



The showing made by Bailey of his present inability to comply became even more

starkly compelling during the hearing of February 27-28, at which Bailey sought

in vain for relief from the imminent sentence of incarceration. <P>



Bailey produced a report and full accounting of all of his expenditures for the

last two and a half years. The report and accounting were performed by Arthur

Andersen & Company. The partner in charge, Kenneth Baker, testified at the

hearing at length. The government did not contend that this accounting was less

than sufficient. <P>



Bailey produced approximately 10,000 pages of documents and records, including

bank records, American Express accounts, mortgage related documents and much

more. He and one of his attorneys testified as to the extraordinary efforts

that had been made to produce this documentation to the government in several

waves of production in the preceding weeks. When the government midstream sent

a detailed letter to Bailey's counsel listing a staggering array of records it

wanted, the response was a redoubling of effort and further production to meet

the government's specifications. By the time of the hearing, the government was

able to point to only a small handful of additional documentation it thought

should be produced, most of which had never been mentioned before by them or

even thought of by Bailey. Bailey responded by promising to produce them in

full, most of which has already been accomplished. <P>



As to the Biochem stock, Bailey demonstrated that he had succeeded, through

exceptional determination, in persuading Credit Suisse to release 164,000

shares worth some seven million dollars. Credit Suisse refused to release the

rest held under its lien. <P>



The lien secures a $2.3 million credit. Bailey repeatedly sought agreement from

the government to permit him to direct Credit Suisse to sell $2.3 million worth

of shares so that all the remaining shares could be returned (about 16 million

dollars worth). See Bailey's Memorandum In Support of Motion to Execute at p.

26 through 30. See Exhibit 6. <P>



Bailey presented proof that his cash accounts total about $50,000, not many

millions. His net worth is represented by boats and planes held by a Subchapter

S corporation. He testified, and he presented testimony from a financing expert

he engaged to help him seek a way of packaging all his assets to raise cash of

that magnitude, about efforts made to obtain such funds. The expert testified

that it was simply impossible in the span of at most twenty business days to

put together such a complicated financing transaction or to realize substantial

proceeds from a fire sale. <P>



No other means of compliance being available, Bailey told the court, in an act

of utter compliance, that he was willing immediately to pledge or turn over to

the court all his assets, every item of value he has accumulated in his

lifetime. <P>



There being copious evidence of unstinting compliance efforts, actual

compliance on all requirements it was possible to meet, detailed and unrebutted

testimony from Bailey and a financing expert establishing present inability to

raise the sum of $3.0 million, and Bailey's offer of his entire net worth in

pledge to the court, a dispassionate tribunal reviewing this record cannot

uphold the contempt finding in this case. <P>



2. The Imposition of the Contempt Citation in this. Case Did Not Comport With

the Requirements of Due Process <P>



The imposition of the initial contempt citation in this case did not comport

with the requirements of due process. Summary contempt is available only to

"address contumacious conduct which is committed fully within the presence of

the court. n United States v. KS & W Offshore Engineering. Inc., 932 F.2d 906,

909 (11th Cir. 1991). Such conduct, for example, disruptive behavior in the

courtroom, is denoted "direct contempt" and is considered amenable to summary

adjudication "to maintain order in the courtroom and the integrity of the trial

process." International Union. UMW v. Bagwell, U.S. , , 114 S. Ct. 2552,

2559-60 (1994); see KS & W Offshore, 932 F.2d at 909 ("such summary powers are

essential for the maintenance of control within the courtroom"). It is only in

these circumstances that summary proceedings "have been tolerated." Maxwell,

114 S. Ct. at 2560. <P>



Other contempts, including the failure to produce items or documents in court,

are treated as "indirect" contempts that can be sanctioned only upon the

provision of adequate notice and opportunity to defend. See, Bagwell, 114 S.

Ct. at 2560 ("summary adjudication of indirect contempt is prohibited"); FDIC

v. LeGrand, 43 F.3d 163, 166 (5th Cir. 1996) (failure to produce tax returns in

court sanctioned after motion for contempt, show cause order and contempt

hearing); Citronelle-Mobile Gathering Inc. v. Watkins, 943 F.2d 1297, 1300-1301

(lath Cir. 1991) (failure to return assets to court's jurisdiction sanctioned

after motion for contempt, show cause order and contempt hearing). <P>



The procedural requirements appurtenant to the imposition of civil contempt

sanctions for indirect contempts have been elaborated by the Eleventh Circuit

in Mercy v. Mitchell, 908 F.2d 763 (llth Cir. 1990). "Although a district court

has a certain amount of discretion in fashioning civil contempt sanctions and

the procedure by which those sanctions are imposed, the court must stay within

the bounds of due process." 908 F.2d at 766. <P>



"[D]ue process requires, with very few exceptions, that the defendant (1) be

informed, through a show-cause order, of his purportedly contumacious conduct,

and (2) be given a hearing at which he can be represented by counsel, call

witnesses, and testify in order to show cause why he should not be held in

contempt." Id. at 767. <P>



The due process framework contemplates an orderly adjudication in several

stages: <P>



a) There is first "a court order that requires the defendant to act in some

defined manner." Mercer, 908 F.2d at 768. The defendant must have actual

knowledge of the order and the order must be sufficiently specific to be

enforceable. Hazen v. Reagan, 16 F.3d 921, 924 (8th Cir. 1994). <P>



b) "The defendant then acts, or refuses to act, in violation of the order."

Mercer, 908 F.2d at 768. <P>



c) The plaintiff then "requests the court to order the defendant to show cause

why he should not be held in contempt and sanctioned until he complies."

Mercer, 908 F.2d at 768. Typically, this is accomplished by a motion served

upon the defendant. See id. at 767 n.7. The motion serves as first notice that

contempt is in issue. <P>



d) "If the court finds that the conduct as alleged would violate the prior

order, it enters an order requiring the defendant to show cause why he should

not be held in contempt and conducts a hearing on the matter." Mercer 908 F.2d

at 768. The showcause order is a "required element of civil contempt

proceedings." Id. at 767 n.5. The court must enter a show-cause order and

conduct a hearing "whether or not it is requested to do so by defendant." Id.

at 767 n.7. <P>



e) "At the hearing, the defendant is allowed to show either that he did not

violate the court order or that he was excused from complying.  Mercer, 908

F.2d at 768. The court must allow the defendant an opportunity to request

modification of the order based on circumstances that would make strict

enforcement of the order unjust. Id. at 768, 769. <P>



f) If the court "concludes that the order should not be modified and that the

defendant did not comply with the order, then the court may hold him in

contempt and impose sanctions designed to ensure compliance." Mercer, 908 F.2d

at 768. <P>



The proceedings in this case bear no resemblance to the typical procedure

described by the Eleventh Circuit, and there is no reason whatsoever that they

could not have been conducted in conformity with the normal procedural

framework. <P>



There was no show-cause order. Absence of this "required elements alone

mandates reversal. Mercer 908 F.2d at 768, 769 (notice and hearing are required

elements of due process; contempt order vacated where court did not enter a

show-cause order or conduct a hearing); see Citronelle-Mobile Gathering. Inc.,

943 F.2d at 1034 (due process requires that the court inform the alleged

contemnor of the contemptuous conduct and provide a hearing). <P>



There was no notice, by motion or court order, that the February 2 hearing

would in fact be a contempt hearing. Neither Bailey nor defense counsel could

have perceived, prior to going to Ocala and finding themselves in the midst of

it, that Bailey was to be on trial, then and there, for contempt. <P>



When the Court finally, on Friday night, uttered the words "show cause", there

was practically speaking no opportunity to mount a meaningful defense by

Saturday morning. Nor was there any reason that the Court could not have issued

a real show-cause order at that time setting the contempt hearing for a

reasonable time in the future. See Armstrong v. Manzo, 380 U.S. 545, 552 (1965)

(to satisfy due process, hearing must be at meaningful time and in meaningful

manner). <P>



Nor was Bailey given a reasonable opportunity to establish grounds to request a

modification of the order. Having had just five days business notice of the

hearing, having counsel for only a brief period of time, and being completely

preoccupied with the defense of a life-count murder case in New York, Bailey

was not in a position to present a meaningful defense. Potential witnesses on

compliance issues, on matters regarding the Swiss shares and the obstacles to

their transfer, and on the complications of producing an accounting could not

be called. Not knowing prior to the hearing of its true nature, neither Bailey

nor counsel could have perceived the need for such proof to defend against a

contempt. Clearly, a measured contempt proceeding with an order to show cause

and a proper hearing in conformance with the requirements of Mercer would have

allowed Bailey the opportunity to make a meaningful presentation to the Court

which reasonably would have materially affected the court's findings, the

content of its order, and its decision whether to issue a contempt citation at

all. <P>



3. It Was Error to Require Bailey to "Repay" Funds in Order to Purge Contempt

and Error to Include Other Purge Conditions Not Tied to the Specified Act of

Contempt      <P>



The February contempt order contained two purge clauses, both of which are

invalid. One of them imposes a wholly new undertaking -- the "repayment" of $3

million. The other, requiring the production of stock, fails to tie the purge

obligation strictly to the purview of the contempt delineated in the order. (On

February 29, 1996, the Court modified these to require a $2.3 million payment

to Credit Suisse and a $700,000 payment to the court.) <P>



The fundamental premise in a contempt proceeding is that there is an

outstanding, prior order for the defendant to do some act, and the outstanding

order has been violated. See CFTC v. Wellington Previous Metals. Inc., 950 F.2d

1525, 1528 (llth Cir. 1992) (must be shown that defendant "violated an

outstanding court order"), cert. denied, 113 S. Ct. 66. Coercive sanctions may

be applied to cause the defendant "to conform to the terms required in the

order." International Union. UMW v. Bagwell, U.S. , 114 S. Ct. 2552, 2557

(1994). The whole purpose is to compel obedience with the court's outstanding

order. <P>



The obvious corollary to these basic concepts of contempt is that a person

cannot be held in contempt for failing to do something that he was not in fact

required to do by the outstanding order, nor, logically, can the conditions to

purge exceed the requisites of the original order. See Armstrong v. Executive

Office of the President, 1 F.3d 1274, 1289 (D.C. Cir. 1993) (reversing contempt

judgment against agencies based in part on their failure to promulgate new

regulations where outstanding court order did not contain direct order for them

to do so). <P>



In this case, the court has imposed a new and additional affirmative duty, one

that was not an element of any prior outstanding order. The court has obligated

Bailey to raise and Repay" $3 million, an entirely new requirement. <P>



At the February 2-3 hearing, Bailey testified that the Biochem stock, worth at

the time of its transfer to him about $6 million, had appreciated to

approximately $24 million, and that some $3 million of proceeds from it had

been taken into his bank account in Florida and spent in accordance with his

understanding of his rights to it under his agreement with the government. The

liquidated shares obviously could not be returned to the court as contemplated

by the outstanding January 25 order. <P>



Apprised of these facts at the hearing, the court simply appended a new

affirmative requirement that Bailey now raise and "repay" $3 million in cash.

In the court's February 29, 1996 order, the $3.0 million is structured so that

$2.3 million is paid to Credit Suisse and $700,000 to the court, the overall

payment obligation reduced thereby from $5.3 million to $3.0 million. This

requirement appeared for the first time in the Order of Civil Contempt, read

from the bench at the close of the hearing on Saturday, February 3. As there

was no pre-existing order requiring Bailey to "repay" spent funds, the purge

clause, which imposes an obligation to raise $3 million in less than four

weeks, is not directed at effectuating compliance with the terms of any

outstanding order. It is not a valid purge clause precisely because it exceeds

the bounds of any outstanding order. <P>



Beyond that, the obligation to deposit $3 million with the Court is in reality

a new substantive order, requiring Bailey to undertake a new task. Then, if he

fails in that task, he is automatically subject to incarceration by operation

of the final paragraph of the Order -- with no order to show cause, no hearing,

no opportunity to defend, no due process whatsoever. The provision is plainly

unconstitutional and cannot be enforced. See Mercer v. Mitchell, 908 F.2d 763,

769-70 (llth Cir. 1990) (sanctions imposed without due process must be

vacated). <P>



The contempt order also directs that Mr. Bailey may purge himself of contempt

by producing "the stocks themselves" by February 29. This clause is defective

for a different reason. The Order of Civil Contempt specifically circumscribes

the finding of contempt, limiting it to the failure to produce "documents and

accountings": <P>



It is clear, and the court so finds, that Mr. Bailey has not demonstrated any

good reason as to why he did not produce the requested documents and

accountings as ordered, nor has he shown a good faith effort to comply

therewith. Having failed to either produce the documents, shown his legal

inability to do so, or demonstrate a good faith effort at compliance, Mr.

Bailey is sentenced to the custody of the Attorney General for a period of six

months. * * * <P>



(Order at 4.) Bailey was not cited for contempt for failing to return the

Biochem stock. <P>



4. The Sanction Imposed Must Be Vacated Because It Is Criminal. Not Civil. in

Nature  The district court originally sentenced Mr. Bailey for a determinate

six-month sentence. On February 29, 1996, it suggested that the earlier order

may not mean what it says and may permit purging at any time. <P>



For a contempt sanction to be categorized as civil it must remain conditional

and subject to cure at all times. Imprisonment for a fixed term thus is civil

in nature only where the defendant can obtain early release at any point in the

term through compliance. International Union. UMW v. Bagwell, _ U.S. 114 S. Ct.

2552, 2558 (citing Shillitani v. United States, 384 U.S. 364, 370 n.6 (1966)).

Because the defendant remains always able to obtain his release, he "thus

'carries the keys of his prison in his own pocket'." Bagwell, 114 S. Ct. at

2558 (quoting Gompers v. Bucks Stove & Range Co., 221 U.S. 418, 442 (1911)). On

the other hand a fixed sentence of imprisonment is criminal if the defendant

"cannot avoid or abbreviate the confinement through later compliance." Bagwell,

114 S. Ct. at 2558. <P>



While the sanction in this case has some civil characteristics in that Bailey

has the ability to purge during the period the sentence is suspended, i.e.,

until February 29, it thereafter may be criminal in that an unconditional

six-month sentence begins. When a contempt order contains both a criminal and a

civil dimension, it must be classified as a criminal contempt order for

purposes of review. Bagwell, 114 S. Ct. at 2561; FDIC v. LeGrand, 43 F.3d 163,

168 (5th Cir. 1995). (By order of February 29, 1996, the district court

suggested that the determinate six-month sentence is actually subject to purge,

although that does not appear on the face of the earlier order.) <P>



"Criminal contempt sanctions are entitled to full criminal process." Bagwell,

114 S. Ct. at 2560. "Criminal penalties may not be imposed on someone who has

not been afforded the protections that the Constitution requires of such

criminal proceedings." I:at 2556 (quoting Hicks v. Feiock, 485 U.S. 624, 632

(1988)). These protections include notice of charges in the form of a show

cause order specifically stating that the hearing will be a criminal contempt

proceeding, LeGrand, 43 F.3d at 169; Lamar Financial Corp. v. Adams, 918 F.2d

564, 567 (5th Cir. 1990); assistance of counsel, Bagwell, 114 S. Ct. at 2557; a

hearing and opportunity to present a defense, id.; proof beyond a reasonable

doubt, i:.; United States v. Maynard, 933 F.2d 918, 920 (llth Cir. 1990); jury

trial if imprisonment over six months could be involved, Bagwell, 114 S. Ct. at

2557, an impartial decisionmaker, LeGrand, 43 F.3d at 169 n.6, and proof of

criminal mens rea, Maynard, 918 F.2d at 920; Taberer v. Armstrong World

Industries, Inc., 954 F.2d 888, 908 (3d Cir. 1992); Krasnow v. Navarro, 909

F.2d 451, 452-53 (llth Cir. 1990). <P>



When a criminal contempt sanction is imposed without full criminal process, the

sanction must be vacated, even if the sentence is never in fact executed.

LeGrand, 43 F.2d at 169-70. <P>



5. The Court Erred in Failing to Recuse Itself <P>



The court could not properly sit as factfinder in this contempt proceeding and

was required to recuse itself. Section 455(b) of Title 28 sets forth a series

of circumstances in which a federal judge must be disqualified. This section

"delineates specific circumstances where recusal is mandated". Liteky v. United

States, 114 S. Ct. 1147, 1163 (1994)(Kennedy, J. concurring). A judge is under

a self- enforcing obligation to recuse himself whenever proper grounds exist,

and the statute requires judges to resolve any doubts they may have in favor of

disqualification. United States v. Kelly, 888 F.2d 732,744 (llth Cir. 1989).

Among the circumstances requiring disqualification are when a judge has

"personal knowledge of disputed evidentiary facts concerning the proceeding"

and when he is "likely to be a material witness in the proceeding". 28 U.S.C.   

455(b)(1) and (b)(5)(iv). Because judges normally recuse themselves whenever

they may be required to be a witness at an evidentiary hearing, there are few

appellate court decisions dealing with these circumstances. See, e.g:, United

States v. Crowell, 359 F. Supp. 489, 490 n.6 (M.D. Fla. 1973) (original trial

judge recused himself because he might be a witness at an evidentiary hearing).

<P>



This case had the extraordinary feature of a material, off the record

discussion involving the judge, about a central issue in dispute, the nature of

the agreement between Bailey and the government. That conversation was a

critical evidentiary element and the judge was a party, and witness, to it.

Bailey brought the matter to the court's attention through a disqualification

motion filed on the morning of February 2, prior to the hearing in which that

very discussion would be in issue. In spite of the unambiguous dictates of the

controlling law, the judge denied the motion without statement of reasons. <P>



It was clear error for the court to adjudicate a matter in which it was a

material witness to off the record events in dispute at the hearing. <P>



6. Bailey Was Improperly Denied the Right to a Trial by Jury <P>



Bailey was entitled to a jury trial as provided in 21 U.S.C.   882(b).

Subchapter I ("Control and Enforcements, 21 U.S.C.    801-904) of Chapter 13

("Drug Abuse Prevention and Control") of Title 21 of the United States Code

contains a grant of jurisdiction for injunctive enforcement of the provisions

of that Subchapter: <P>



<B>Jurisdiction</B>  <P>



(a) The district courts of the United States and all courts exercising general

jurisdiction in the territories and possessions of the United States shall have

jurisdiction in proceedings in accordance with the Federal Rules of Civil

Procedure to enjoin violations of this chapter. <P>



21 U.S.C.   853(e)(1).<P>



Amongst the forms of injunction available under this grant of jurisdiction are

"restraining order[s] or injunction[s] to preserve the availability of property

described in [Section 853(a)] for forfeitures 21 U.S.C.   853 (3)(1). The

property at issue in this case, the Biochem stock, or other assets into which

it was converted, is alleged to be forfeitable because it constitutes or

derives from drug trafficking proceedings. As such it would be property

forfeitable under Section 853(a)(1). <P>



The express foundation for the government's January 22, 1996 "Emergency Motion

to Surrender Property" is that the stock is "forfeitable property that Claude

Duboc "obtained as a result of involvement in illegal drug trafficking

activities and transferred to Bailey. That was, as well, the position pressed

by the government at the February 2-3, 1996 hearing. (E.g;, Tr. at 32-33.) <P>



The court's January 25 order in response to the government's motion to

surrender property required Bailey to return the stock, or other assets, to the

court. This order was quite plainly a mandatory restraint or injunction

intended "to preserve the availability of property * * * for forfeitures as

contemplated by 21 U.S.C.   853(e)(1). <P>



Bailey filed prior to the hearing a motion and demand for a jury trial. Counsel

at the outset of the hearing pointed out that the proceeding appeared to be a

proceeding ancillary to a forfeiture and reiterated the demand for a jury. (Tr.

at 34, 36.) The court did not grant a jury trial and ultimately imposed a

contempt citation based, inter alia, on Bailey's failure to turn over the

allegedly forfeitable property. <P>



Section 882(b) of Title 21 specifically provides that contempt proceedings for

violation of injunctive orders issued pursuant to the grant of jurisdiction in

Section 882(a) carry with them the right to a jury: <P>



<B>Jury Trial</B><P>



(b) In case of an alleged violation of an injunction or restraining order

issued under this section, trial shall, upon demand of the accused, be by a

jury in accordance with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. <P>



21 U.S.C.   882(b).<P>



Because Bailey was denied the right to trial by jury, the contempt order must

be vacated. <P>



B. Bailey Will Be Irreparably Harmed If No Stay is Granted "An injury is

irreparable 'if it cannot be undone through monetary remedies.' Dillard v. City

of Greensboro, 870 F. Supp. 1031 (M.D. Ala. 1994) (quoting Cate v. Oldham, 707

F.2d 1176, 1189 (llth Cir. 1983)). <P>



Respondent is subject to incarceration if the order is executed. Incarceration,

whether for six months, six weeks, six days, or six hours, is unquestionably a

profound and irreparable injury. Indeed as the Eleventh Circuit has held,

"[t]here is, perhaps, no injury more substantial and less reparable than

improper denial of the right to liberty." Garcia-Mir, 781 F.2d at 1455. <P>



C. There Will Be No Substantial Harm to the Government if a Stay is Granted       

<P>



As regards the issuance of a stay in this case, the purpose of which would be

merely to maintain the status quo pending appeal, the government's sole

material interest is the preservation of the assets to which it makes claim.

Where there is no imminent threat of dissipation of the disputed assets, the

government is in no way prejudiced by a stay. <P>



There is no dispute that Bailey did, as he understood he had the right to do

under his agreement with the government, use some proceeds from the Biochem

stock account in 1994 and 1995, before the government's contrary position was

asserted. There is also no dispute that since the parameters of the controversy

have come into focus, Bailey has endeavored diligently to replace spent funds

and has accomplished the return of some of the shares. Indeed, these efforts

have yielded the return of $7 million worth of shares -- more than the value of

what Bailey received in the first place. The rest of the shares remain safely

in the custody of Credit Suisse. Moreover, Bailey has offered to pledge or

transfer to the court every asset he owns. There being no threat that the stock

or any other assets will be dissipated during the pendency of this appeal,

there is no substantial harm to the government in the grant of the stay. <P>



Further, it must be noted that incarceration in the present circumstances has

no real continuing coercive effect. Bailey has already done as much as he could

do in the time permitted to restore the corpus of stock and monies to the

possession of the court, and he and counsel have repeatedly represented that

continuing efforts will be made to maximize compliance. He has offered all his

worldly assets. Under these circumstances, imprisonment would be punitive, not

coercive, and hence improper in a civil contempt case, and would only serve to

impede further efforts at compliance. <P>



D. No Harm to the Public Interest<P>



Where the government is a party, the public interest often coincides, at least

in part, with the government's interests. The public also has an interest in

the safety of the assets, and in an appropriate case, in the coercive function

of a contempt sanction. But as shown, in this case the interest in preservation

is secure and the coercive purpose of incarceration is absent. Indeed,

incarceration would likely only inhibit compliance. <P>



There are also individual third-party interests involved here. Bailey is a

criminal defense lawyer whose clients, many of whom face the most serious of

criminal charges, rely on him to attend to their interests. Incarcerating

Bailey would only harm these uninvolved third parties. Since incarceration here

would serve no legitimate function, the interest of these uninvolved third

parties in Bailey's liberty during the pendency of this appeal should weigh

prominently in the consideration of the motion for stay. <P>



The public interest will be best served by an orderly, and if necessary,

expedited resolution of the contempt issue on this appeal, and then of the

important underlying issues. The public has a strong interest in fair and

comprehensive judicial scrutiny of the actions of those who serve it in the

agencies of law enforcement. Here there are significant issues of government

conduct that figure heavily in the mix when considering whether Bailey should

be immediately subject to the opprobrium and deprivation of liberty presently

threatened. <P>



The government's position is that it parked with Bailey property that was

forfeitable as the proceeds of illegal narcotics activity, from which Bailey

would be paid legal fees. <P>



If this is true, the government failed to conform its conduct to Supreme Court

directives in Caplin & Drysdale v. United States, and United States v.

Monsanto, 491 U.S. 617 (1989). Those cases proscribe the use of forfeitable

funds for payment of legal fees. The "relation back" doctrine makes the assets

obtained with unlawfully derived proceeds government property at the time they

are unlawfully obtained. Thereafter, such forfeitable property cannot be used

for payment of legal fees. <P>



In an effort to deal with a variety of circumstances surrounding the

complexities of this doctrine, the Department of Justice has set forth policy

and guidelines in an extensive policy and guideline statement. See generally,

9- 111.100, et sea. These policy statement and guidelines, which were in effect

in April of 1994, require such things as approval by the Assistant Attorney

General, Criminal Division, before any asset transfer to an attorney as a fee

for legal services may be forfeited (9-111.300); similar approval in the event

civil forfeiture proceedings are directed at an asset transfer to an attorney

for legal fees (9-111.300); the approval of the Assistant Attorney General,

Criminal Division, for any "formal or informal, written, or oral agreements

made regarding the exemption of an asset transfer to an attorney as fees for

legal services from forfeiture (9-111.300). The guidelines specifically require

careful review by the Department of Justice for these kinds of agreements

(9-111.400). They require "written notice" of the government's intention to

seek forfeiture of an asset made available to an attorney for payment of legal

fees (9111.530). They require senior Departmental approval before attorney fee

records are subpoenaed or otherwise sought by the government (9-111.620). Most

significantly, the guidelines in 9-111.700 make clear that, when the government

provides an asset for payment of legal fees, of necessity that decision carries

with it a finding that "reasonable grounds to believe that the particular asset

is not subject to forfeiture exist. <P>



The government, therefore, cannot as a matter of Supreme Court doctrine and its

own regulations make available forfeitable assets for payment of legal fees.

Its decision to make available an asset for payment of legal fees ineluctably

carries a finding that the asset is not subject to forfeiture, not to be

forfeitable, and is otherwise free of any future claim. For the government to

act otherwise would be a breach of Caplin & Drysdale and Monsanto, a violation

of its internal guidelines, and a violation of common sense and logic. <P>



Put simply, the government's "understanding" of the agreement here is an

understanding profoundly at odds with Supreme Court doctrine and its own

guidelines. One need only read Guideline 9-111.700 to see that the government

cannot "park" forfeitable assets with an attorney for interim use as payment

for his legal fees and thereafter for subsequent forfeiture. The transfer to an

attorney, particularly if undertaken in fee simple, without written limitation,

and without conduct thereafter evincing any ownership of a remainder interest

in the property, profoundly disentitles the government from the claim it is now

making. <P>



<B>CONCLUSION</B><P>



For the foregoing reasons, this Court should issue a stay of the contempt

judgment pending respondent's appeal. <P>

F. Lee Bailey<P>



Dated: March 4, 1996<P>



The government urges that incarceration of Mr. Bailey is necessary (a) to force

him to pay $3 million, which will permit the return of stock, and (b) to force

him to produce financial documents. The government has omitted to say the

undisputed record evidence is that Mr. Bailey does not have $3 million but can,

and desires to, pledge or transfer all of his assets to the court. And the

government has not mentioned the thousands of financial documents Mr. Bailey

produced, instead identifying a French "mortgage" document without

acknowledging that not a single penny has changed hands pursuant to it. The

document does not fit within the district court's demand for documents. <P>



As for the lawfulness of the February 3, 1996 order of civil contempt, the

government makes important concessions: that there never was a show cause

order, that the order of civil contempt illegally imposed a six-month prison

sentence, and that the contempt adjudicated was the failure to produce

documents and an accounting (not a failure to produce money or stocks). The

government also omits other key facts: that the district court is a witness to

the purely oral, off-the- record contract sought to be enforced and that the

government has asserted the court made and has the only writing reflecting that

oral contract. <P>



We show here compliance by Mr. Bailey with the civil contempt order's purge

requirements and submission to the will of the court as expressed in the order.

And we show that it was an abuse of discretion to order Mr. Bailey's

incarceration. The court failed to find that financial documents had been

withheld and failed to identify any such document; the record is uncontroverted

that document production has been overwhelming in scope, such that any implied

finding to the contrary is clearly erroneous. As for the payment of millions of

dollars, the court failed to find that Mr. Bailey had the ability to pay before

February 29, 1996, and the record is uncontroverted that he did not have the

ability. Most critically, the district court and the government ignored Mr.

Bailey's act of ultimate financial submission -- a transfer or pledge of all of

his assets to the court. <P>



<B>A. Mr. Bailey Has Demonstrated Compliance, and Incarceration Would Be

Pointless and Punitive.</B> <P>



At the hearing on February 26 and 27, 1996, Mr. Bailey agreed immediately to

pledge or transfer a11 of his assets to the court (Tr. C 178, 179, 181,

206).<<Note 1 - Tr. A is the February 2-3 hearing. Tr. B is the February 14

hearing. Tr. C is the February 27-28 hearing.>> Mr. Bailey took this act of

complete submission because he then had only about $40,000 in cash, a limited

borrowing capacity, and illiquid assets less than the $5 .3 million the court's

February 3, 1996 order required Mr. Bailey to pay (Tr. C 160, 167) .

Remarkably, the district court's order of February 29, 1996 does not mention

that Mr. Bailey sought to pledge or transfer all of his assets to the court.

And the matter is not mentioned anywhere in the government's opposition to a

stay. <P>



A person can do no more to meet a financial obligation than to offer all that

he has. In the related context of a supersedeas bond, which is highly relevant

here because the ultimate merits of the dispute between Mr. Bailey and the

United States have not been litigated and the court essentially has ordered a

pre-judgment attachment to secure the claim of the United States, the Seventh

Circuit held that a pledge of assets is sufficient when a defendant is

financially unable to obtain a bond against a multimillion dollar judgment.

Olympia Equipment Leasing Co. v. Western Union Telegraph Co., 786 F.2d 794 (7th

Cir. 1986) (Posner, J.); accord, Waffenschmidt v. Mackay, 763 F.2d 711, 727

(5th Cir. 1985); see generally United States v. Antar, 53 F.3d 568, 578 (3d

Cir. 1995).       <P>



Again, the court ignored the offer to pledge or transfer all assets. Instead,

at page 8 of the February 29, 1996 order, the district court made the

unexplained finding that Mr. Bailey "has the ability to pay at least $3.0

million," but there is no consideration of the uncontradicted evidence that a

loan of this magnitude on illiquid assets takes more time to arrange than the

less than 20 business days available to Mr. Bailey (Tr. C 150-65). Indeed,

there is no examination at all of Mr. Bailey's finances. <P>



The government also fails to explain how Mr. Bailey could have paid millions of

dollars to the court by February 29, 1996 -- or why a pledge or transfer of all

assets is insufficient. We do not mean to say that the government's explanation

is wrong; we mean to say that there is nQ explanation. The government chose to

present as evidence below concerning compliance issues. This is a fatal failure

because, if the government wishes to argue that Mr. Bailey was capable of

further compliance, it bears the burden of proof by clear and convincing

evidence under CFTC v. Wellington Precious Metals. Inc., 950 F.2d 1525 (11th

Cir. 1992). The government simply misreads Wellington's "burden of production"

as the equivalent of a burden of proof, never acknowledging that a "burden of

production" is a burden shifting concept and that the government bears the

ultimate and heavy burden under Wellington. <P>



Mr. Bailey met his burden of production. He presented an accounting by Arthur

Andersen (Exh. 30, 2/27/96) and the testimony of one of its partners tracing

funds and proving the absence of hidden funds or assets (Tr. C 89-95). (Neither

the district court nor the government appear to challenge this accounting.) He

presented his financial statement (Exh. 13, 2/27/96)(Tr. C 154-60, 167) showing

about $42,000 in cash and the remainder in illiquid assets, mostly airplanes

and boats. Mr. Bailey testified in detail about his inability to obtain bank

financing on the strength of such assets (Tr. C 160-62, 179-80, 205-06, 262),

as did a financing specialist engaged by Mr. Bailey to "liquefy" Mr. Bailey's

assets by obtaining other financing (Tr. C 150-65, 176-77). Mr. Bailey and the

financing specialist made it clear that financing would be very difficult, but

doable, something that will take more than the days Mr. Bailey had available

before February 29, 1996 (Tr. C 16466, 267-69). And Mr. Bailey made it crystal

clear that he wished to pledge or transfer all his assets to the court (Tr. C

178, 179, 181, 206, 266, 279).<<Note 2 - Financing on the strength of any asset

is uncertain because of the government's contention that the equity in the

assets reflected Mr. Bailey's receipt, with notice, of forfeitable property. A

prudent lender would require assurance from the government, endorsed by the

court, that the lender will have a valid security interest.>> All of this

evidence was unrebutted. <P>



Finally, evidence concerning massive document compliance was unrebutted. The

Arthur Andersen accounting and its schedules constitute a complete outline of

Mr. Bailey's personal and professional financial life. In addition, Mr. Bailey

produced thousands of financial records, which are exhibits (Doc. 95 & 111).

One need only to flip through the documents to realize that Mr. Bailey's bank

statements, cancelled checks, check registers, home purchase documents, law

firm documents, Credit Suisse documents, credit card documents, and numerous

other documents are there. The district court's description of this as a

"start" is without any basis in the record. The record demonstrates beyond

doubt that document collection and production began February 5, 1996 and that

thousands of documents were produced to the court on February 14, and

thereafter to the government during the week of February 19, and the remainder

at the February 27 and 28 hearing Mr. Bailey requested (Tr. B 2-32; Tr. C

15-26, 61, 144-45; Transcript of "Sealed Proceedings Held in Jury Room",

February 27, 1996) . Critically, the district court made no finding that there

is any additional record to produce. The government purports to identify one

record, a "mortgage" on a property in France which the government approved, but

the record is uncontroverted that Mr. Bailey does not have such a record (it is

in France) and that no penny has changed hands pursuant to this "mortgage" (Tr.

C 253-56, 274-76. ) The "mortgage" is in the nature of a mechanic's lien, there

being no promissory note or mortgage to fund. Most important, the so-called

"mortgage" is not within the court's description of documents demanded to be

produced because there were no "proceeds" from it. <P>



<B>B. The District Court and the Government Impermissibly Rely upon

Pre-February 3. 1996 Conduct to Justify Incarceration.</B> <P>



The government urges that incarceration is required because of pre-February 3

conduct, with the not-so-subtle premise that punishment is appropriate. The

government spent most of its time below pursuing the allegation that, in

January 1996, Mr. Bailey transferred assets in violation of a freeze order Mr.

Bailey testified he had not seen. In its response filed in this Court, at pages

13 through 19, the government restricts its argument concerning financial

impossibility to events allegedly occurring before the February 3, 1996

contempt order. Almost unbelievably, the government never asserts that it was

possible, or not impossible, for Mr. Bailey to pay millions of dollars. <P>



The district court took pains to explain that incarceration is required because

of pre-February 3, 1996 events. Nearly 100% of the court's order is devoted to

these irrelevant events. The evidence concerning them is recounted at length

(pages 1 to 6 of the order), and then findings concerning them are made at

length (pages 6 through 8 of the order). <P>



Finally, the district court finding that Mr. Bailey knew in January of a freeze

order, in addition to being irrelevant to compliance issues, rests on a single

piece of evidence, the recollection of an AUSA that Mr. Bailey said several

weeks ago he had read the freeze order (Tr. C 294- 95). The government does not

claim that Mr. Bailey was in court when the freeze order was entered; he was in

New York. The AUSA who later spoke with Mr. Bailey prepared several typed pages

of minutes of the meeting with descriptions of Mr. Bailey's statements (Exh.

44, 2/28/96)(Tr. C 303-10). Those minutes contain no reference to the statement

that the AUSA recollects now. The January 12, 1996 order does not mention Mr.

Bailey's bank accounts and does not apply to loans made by Credit Suisse; those

loans were not, in the words of the order, "monies . . . received . . . from or

on behalf of Duboc." <P>



Similarly, the courts later order of January 25 did not purport to "freeze"

anything but merely required the return of BioChem stock and replacement

"stock." See Atiyeh v. Capps, 449 U.S. 1312, 1317 (1981) (Rehnquist, Circuit

Justice). <P>



<B>C. The February 3. 1996 Order of Civil Contempt Was Illegal.</B> <P>



By order of January 25, 1996, the court ordered Mr. Bailey to appear in court

to produce stock, financial information and an accounting. When Mr. Bailey

appeared, it is undisputed that, without a prior order to show cause, he was

called as the first witness and, in the same proceeding, adjudicated in civil

contempt. Counsel for Mr. Bailey informed the court that he needed additional

time to prepare and to present his case (Tr. A 169-71). Mercer v. Mitchell, 908

F.2d 763 (llth Cir. 1990), is clear that due process requires a prior order to

show cause. <P>



It also is undisputed that the February 3, 1996 contempt order was rendered

illegal by the imposition of a fixed six-month prison sentence. The government

sought a modification of this defect on the last day of the possible compliance

period. The district court thereupon issued its February 29, 1996 reimposing a

fixed six-month sentence, but saying it could be purged at any time. This

ignores, however, that the February 3, 1996 order of civil contempt was itself

illegal and, thus, unenforceable. <P>



Further, the government does not dispute that the court below is a key witness

to, indeed a party to, the contract it seeks to enforce, a contract not

embodied in any document other than in notes the government claims were made by

the court. No aspect of this oral contract was made on the record, and the

government contends it has no piece of paper reflecting the contract. The

decision requires on-the-record revelation and cross-examination of the key

evidence the government says the court has. The issue is not one of bias; the

court is a material witness. <P>



The government also concedes that Mr. Bailey was held in contempt on February

3, 1996 only for failure to produce financial information and an accounting.

According to the contempt order, however, Mr. Bailey could not purge even if he

produced all of the requested financial records and an accounting. To purge, he

was required also to pay millions of dollars and to produce stock. The

government cites no authority that a purge obligation can extend beyond the

scope of the underlying contempt. See United States v. Smallwood, 870 F.2d 658

(6th Cir. 1989). <P>



Finally, the government contends Mr. Bailey was not entitled to a jury trial

under 21 U.S.C.   882(b) because the forfeitures at issue are criminal. The

government does not tell the Court that the forfeitures below were civil

forfeitures when they actually were made, that no order of criminal forfeiture

was entered, and that the plea agreement did not mention the stock. <P>



<B>D. The Government Incorrectly Describes the Merits Issues and the Public

Interest.</B> <P>



In its opposition to a stay, at pages 4, 5, 14 and 15, the government retreats

to its "merits" position that Mr. Bailey wrongly sold or borrowed against the

BioChem shares and thereby seeks to bootstrap Mr. Bailey into a contempt.

Discovery has not even begun on these "merits" issues. We are constrained,

however, to point out here that the government omits or misstates the

following: (1) Mr. Duboc, assisted by an AUSA and a DEA agent, made a fee

simple transfer of the shares to Bailey by wire on April 26, 1994 (Tr. A

255-56); (2) the transfer was not accompanied by any document establishing a

trust or otherwise restricting the transfer (Tr. A 331-33); (3) Mr. Bailey bore

the full risk of loss of the value of the stock, 1088 of his fees and 1088 of

the expenses he advanced (Tr. A 324-26, 339-40, 347); (4) DOJ guidelines

preclude transfer of a forfeitable asset to an attorney for use as fees (as do

Caplin & Drysdale and Monsanto); (5) Mr. Bailey was able to make interim

expenditures without prior court approval and believed himself similarly free

to take interim distributions for his time investment, all subject to eventual

court approval (Tr. A 262, 268, 335, 378); (6) the government was silent at the

May 17, 1994 recorded plea proceeding about any trust arrangement with respect

to Mr. Bailey and the stock (Tr. A 264); (7) the written plea agreement (Doc.

16) does not mention the stock and referred only to a list of assets which had

not been created yet (Tr. A 351- 52); (8) Mr. Shohat, Mr. Duboc's other

attorney, drafted an unexecuted fee agreement after the stock transfer

specifying that his fees were to come from nonforfeitable assets (Tr. A 187);

(9) after transfer of the shares, the government took no interest in them and

never acted as if it owned them (Tr. A 36467, 383- 93); and (10) the government

will agree that it filed numerous civil forfeiture actions against Duboc

property but never did 80 with respect to the shares of stock (Tr. 364- 66).

<P>



As for the public's interest in the government's management of the BioChem

stock, we note that Mr. Bailey, for weeks, has sought vainly the government's

agreement to the immediate sale of enough shares to remove the $2.3 million

lien, which amount can be secured by Mr. Bailey's property, all in order that

a11 the remaining shares be transferred to the United States forthwith. The

government has resisted this approach demonstrating more interest in

maintaining the perception of Mr. Bailey's noncompliance than in achieving the

transfer of stock. <P>

Editor's Note: An 11th Circuit panel denied F. Lee Bailey's motion to stay

his contempt incarceration pending appeal.</P>

<PRE>



</PRE>

<P>IN THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS</P>



<P>FOR THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT</P>



<P>No. 96-2280</P>



<P>UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,</P>



<P>Plaintiff-Appellee,</P>



<P>versus</P>



<P>CLAUDE LUIS DUBOC, aka</P>



<P>HARRY SIMPSON, aka</P>



<P>ANTHONY LARKIN,</P>



<P>Defendant,</P>



<P>F. LEE BAILEY,</P>



<P>Appellant.</P>



<P>Appeal from the United States District Court for the Northern District of

Florida </P>



<P>Before KRAVITCH, EDMONDSON and CARNES, Circuit Judges. </P>



<P>PER CURIAM:</P>



<P>Appellant F. Lee Bailey has filed an emergency motion for stay pending

appeal. The district court has found Bailey to be in contempt and has ordered

his incarceration: the incarceration was to begin 1 March. On 29 February, we

temporarily stayed the order directing him to be incarcerated.  </P>





<P>Since 29 February, we have carefully examined the submissions from the

parties (including briefs) and transcripts of hearings. And we have heard oral

argument. We now lift our stay and remand to the district court for the limited

purpose of setting the time and place for Bailey to report to the United States

Marshal. </P>



<P>Where the district court had discretion, we cannot say that it is plain now

that the court abused this discretion. Particularly considering the number and

nature of the district court hearings, considering the factual determinations

underlying the district court's 29 February order, considering that credibility

is a matter for the judicial officer who listens to and personally observes the

witnesses, and considering the standard of review for factual determinations is

under the clearly erroneous rule, we conclude that Bailey has shown less than a

substantial likelihood of prevailing on the merits of his appeal. We also

cannot say that the equities among the parties or the public interest weigh

heavily in favor of the stay. </P>



<P>The appeal on the merits in this case will be expedited. Appellant's brief

align=left src="/images/spt2.gif" alt=" * ">



The Federal Election Commission (FEC) is

moving 

for summary judgment on two

counts of its complaint against GOPAC,  a political action

committee that has supported Republican  candidates for Congress over the last

several years. They allege that GOPAC sought to circumvent federal election

laws by representing the group as primarily interested in local elections.  The

Memorandum supporting the motion details the relationship between GOPAC and

Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich. The  relationship included paying several

political consultants to  "help Newt think." The aid provided to Newt Gingrich

also  included travel costs for these consultants to be available to  Mr.

Gingrich, spending an estimated $250,000 on those costs in 1990 alone.

According to an audio tape of a GOPAC meeting, "If  Newt decides he's got a

Saturday free in Georgia, he wants people  a[r]ound him. And GOPAC pays those

bills. I mean we pay for them  to fly down there. We pay for them to stay at

the Buckhead Ritz  Carlton."<p>

PLAINTIFF FEDERAL ELECTION COMMISSION'S MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES IN

SUPPORT OF ITS MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT ON COUNTS 1 AND 2<p>

<p>

 Plaintiff Federal Election Commission ("Commission") submits this memorandum

in support of its motion for summary judgment as to Counts 1 and 2. Fed. R.

Civ. P. 56.<p>

<p>

<a name=one><h2>I. INTRODUCTION</h2></a>

<p>

The Commission asks this Court to find that the defendant GOPAC, Inc.

("GOPAC"), a partisan political organization, became a federal political

committee by 1989 when it made expenditures and accepted contributions of more

than $ 1,000 to influence federal elections./1 Congress enacted a broad

definition of a federal political committee in the Federal Election Campaign

Act of 1971, as amended (the "Act"), 2 U.S.C. Sections 431 et seq., which the

Supreme Court narrowed only to the extent necessary to avoid First Amendment

concerns about issue advocacy organizations. See 2 U.S.C. 431 (4). However,

GOPAC's sole politics, and the Act should be applied broadly to such

organizations to give full prophylactic effect to its provisions that prevent

corruption and the appearance of corruption, give voters information essential

to cast informed votes, and facilitate the enforcement of the Act. Because

there are no material facts in genuine dispute, the Commission is entitled to

judgment as a matter of law. Matsushita Electric Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio

Corp., 475 U.S. 574 (1986); Tao v. Freeh, 27 F.3d 635, 638 (D.C. Cir. 1994)

(citing Andersen v. Liberty Lobby Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 250, 255 (1986)).<p>

<p>

<a name=two><h2>II. PRIOR PROCEEDINGS</h2></a>

<p>

The Commission alleged that GOPAC should have registered as a federal political

committee in 1989 because its 1989 national ruling titled "Campaign For Fair

Elections" contained an electioneering message advocating the defeat of all

incumbent Democratic members of Congress and the election of Republican

candidates. GOPAC failed to register with the Commission and file required

reports from 1989 until May 1991, when it did register. GOPAC filed a motion to

dismiss arguing that its sole purpose in the 1989-90 election cycle was the

election of state legislative candidates (the "farm team"), and that its letter

could not be considered a federal expenditure because it did not expressly

advocate the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate. This Court

denied GOPAC's motion to dismiss holding that "[h]ere the controlling relevant

question is not whether the communication expressly advocates' the election or

defeat of such candidates for federal office, but whether, at the times in

question, the organization's major purpose . . . [was l the nomination or

election of an identified candidate or candidates for federal office." FEC v.

GOPAC, Inc. ("GOPAC I"), 871 F. Supp. 1466, 1471 (D.D.C. 1994) (citation

omitted, emphasis and ellipsis in original).<p>

<p>

 As discussed more fully below in section IV. C., the evidence obtained in

discovery shows that GOPAC satisfies the most stringent test for political

committee status. However, the Commission respectfully requests that this Court

reconsider its initial view of the legal standard to be applied in light of the

decision in Akins v. FEC, 66 F.3d 348 (D.C. Cir. 1995), pet. for rehearing

filed, requiring deference to the Commission's construction of the term

"political committee." The Court's initial view, if not modified, might permit

avowedly partisan political groups and individual politicians to sponsor

organizations that could hide their contributors' identities and their partisan

electoral activities by artfully avoiding naming a particular federal

candidate. Such organizations might be able to engage in every other aspect of

modern federal campaigns -- such as coordinating its communications and other

activities with the Party's leaders, committees and consultants; engaging in

and distributing the results of campaign research, polling, focus groups;

recruiting and training partisan political activists; sponsoring candidate

forums and other political meetings; distributing advertisements and soliciting

contributions for the election of the Party's candidates, etc. -- everything

except making contributions to, or expenditures naming, a specific federal

candidate. Hiding the identity of large contributors to organizations

associated with elected officials and federal candidates, such as the major

national political parties, creates the appearance of corruption, prevents

voters from knowing with whom or what entities a political party or politician

is associating, and makes enforcement of the Act's other provisions

unnecessarily difficult. Indeed, this is exactly what GOPAC did, and it did it

for the avowed purpose of electing a majority of Republicans to the United

States House of Representatives. GOPAC's failure to register and file

disclosure reports creates the appearance of corruption and has deprived the

electorate of information that Congress considered essential to the public's

electoral decisions. Approval of GOPAC's failure to report the source of its

funds and expenditures would create a black hole in the Act's disclosure

scheme, hiding contributions for and support of candidates for federal office.

Because GOPAC was a political committee that sought to influence the 1990

congressional elections, the Commission requests that this Court find that

GOPAC violated the Act by failing to register as a political committee and

failing to file the required public disclosure reports of its 1989-90 election

cycle activities.<p>

<p>

 <a name=three><h2>III. SUMMARY OF FACTS</h2></a>

<p>

Defendant GOPAC was and is an avowedly partisan political organization that was

considered, and has advertised itself as, the fourth national Republican

committee, working alongside the Republican National Committee ("RNC"),

National Republican Senatorial Committee ("NRSC") and National Republican

Congressional Committee ("NRCC"). Exh. l; Facts 2, 3, 41-45. As clearly stated

in its correspondence "GOPAC's mission ... since its inception, is to create

and disseminate [a doctrine for the Republican Party] . . . to elect

candidates, capture the U.S. House of Representatives and become a governing

majority at every level of government." Exh. 31 at [2030](emphasis added); Exh.

66 at [5408].2<p>

<p>

In 1986, Congressman Gingrich became General Chairman of GOPAC and changed its

projects to reflect his belief that the "primary problem of the Republican

Party was ideas, not money." Exh. 23 at [Gingrich 15]. "[W]e had not been able

to win in the '80s despite a tremendous amount of resources and . . . we had to

rethink where we were. We had to rethink what wasn't working." Exh. 23 at

[Gingrich28]. Gingrich himself had "a lot of ideas" regarding campaigns and

"wanted to begin to implement them in the field. " Exh. 19 at [Morgan20] .

These included ideas both on how to train candidates and on what they should

say, specifically how "Republican beliefs could be best articulated . . . to be

best received." Exh. 20 at [Callawayl6].<p>

<p>

Gingrich believed that GOPAC "should be the leading research and teaching

institution for candidates and should try to move [the Republican Party] into a

more aggressive, positive majority style politics." Exh. 23 at [Gingrichl6].

Unlike the RNC and the other two Republican Party committees where   Gingrich's

ideas might be "too controversial," GOPAC could be "as bold as it wanted to,

and its [only] restriction was whether or not its donors wanted to keep

donating." Exh. 23 at [Gingrichl6]. It "could be much more focused, much more

mobile, much more responsive." Exh. 21 at [Riddle104]. Gingrich proposed his

ideas for re-shaping GOPAC to other Republican leaders "[a]nd they were pretty

amenable to my idea of making it an idea-oriented institution." Exh. 23 at

[Gingrich15]. From at least 1987 to 1990, GOPAC's sole purpose was to "elect~

Republicans at all levels of Government," to make the Republican Party the

"governing majority at every level of government." Exh. 31 at [2030]; Exh.19 at

[Morgan 15, 165]; Exh. 66 at [5408].<p>

<p>

During the 1989-90 election cycle, GOPAC's second largest expenditure, $958,723

or 19% of the $5,016,303 in total expenses, was for mailings that urged the

readers to throw the purportedly corrupt incumbent Democratic members of

Congress out of office and solicited contributions to do so. Facts 285-291.

Most of these letters, like the "Campaign For Fair Elections" letter attached

to the Commission's complaint, stated that the nation's problems were caused by

the Democratic incumbents in Congress and would not be solved until there was a

majority of Republicans in the United States House of Representatives. The

letters frequently discussed topical, politically charged issues and noted,

almost in passing, the need to support Republican state legislative candidates

to form a "farm team" as a step toward eliminating the Democratic majority in

the House. Some of the mailings focused on specific federal candidates, e.g.

the election of George Bush as President, the defeat of Speaker Wright, and the

continuation of Congressman Newt Gingrich's tenure so that he could continue

opposing the corrupt Democratic incumbents in the House. Exh. 30; Exh. 31;

Facts 224-247. But almost all these letters, mailed into virtually all

congressional districts, specifically advocated the defeat of the Democratic

incumbents in the House and the election of a majority of Republicans. Id.<p>

<p>

Research and development projects, GOPAC's largest category of expenditures,

after fundraising, at more than $ 1 million during the 1989-90 election cycle,

were designed to determine how Republican candidates could best win elections

at all levels of government. Facts 285-291. The results were distributed widely

among Republican candidates and committees, with no attempt to restrict

recipients to state candidates. For example, focus groups were used to

determine the campaign effectiveness of various national topics and messimages.

Facts 88-104. An experiment was conducted to broadcast a conservative

Republican electoral message directly into hundreds of sites simultaneously by

television satellite to encourage individuals to become conservative political

activists. Facts 152- 173.<p>

<p>

GOPAC sponsored meetings among the ]Republican Party leadership and provided a

forum for Republican federal candidates to meet large: contributors to

Republican causes and candidates -- GOPAC's Charter Members -- to discuss

national issues. Facts 54, 55, 64, 76-87.<p>

<p>

In contrast to GOPAC's protestations in its motion to dismiss that GOPAC's sole

purpose was the election of a "farm team" consisting of state legislators,

under Gingrich's leadership, GOPAC ceased making large contributions to state

candidates and state parties. "In the days when Pete [duPont] ran the

committee, GOPAC gave money wholesale. State Parties and candidates alike were

the beneficiaries. When Newt came on board in 1986, the focus moved to a

bilateral support of candidates and support for Newt's vision of the Republican

Party and America." Exh. 66 at [3792]; Facts 19-23, 33-:37. In fact, state

candidate contributions became one of GOPAC's lowest spending priorities --

behind direct mail, recruiting Charter members, research and development

projects, and training. GOPAC's cash contributions during the 1989-90 election

cycle to state candidates totaled only $350,975, or 7 percent of expenditures.

Facts 285-291. Training costs for programs any Republican candidate or activist

could attend only added another $379,295 or 7.6 percent of total expenditures.

Id. To induce legislative candidates to attend the sessions and hear GOPAC's

message, candidates were told they would not be eligible for a contribution

from GOPAC unless they attended a GOPAC session (candidates were not informed

about GOPAC's other candidate  contribution criteria). As Gingrich testified,

"[w]e saw our niche as a very unique research and development and training kind

of institution." Exh. 23 at [Gingrich23].<p>

<p>

In sum, GOPAC expended funds and sought contributions for political projects

that would elect Republican candidates to both state and federal office, with

the primary purpose of electing a majority of Republican members of the United

States House of Representatives.<p>

<p>

<a name=four><h2>IV. ARGUMENT</h2></a>

<p>

After this Court's earlier opinion, the D.C. Circuit decided Akins v. FEC, 66

F.3d 348 (D.C. Cir. 1995), pet. for rehearing filed, which provides additional

guidance on construction of the term "political committee" and the application

of the "major purpose" test under the Act. The court held that Congress

intended the Act's definition of political committee to be read broadly and

that the Commission's construction must be given deference. The facts in this

case do not present a Constitutional question sufficient to require the Act to

be construed more narrowly than the Commission has in its advisory opinions.<p>

<p>

Like the groups in the advisory opinions discussed below, GOPAC's primary, if

not exclusive, purpose was admittedly partisan electoral politics, and

therefore, this Court should find that GOPAC was required to register and file

reports when it, like the groups in the advisory opinions, expended more than $

1,000 to influence federal elections by advocating the election of a specified

class of candidates, such as all Republicans. Moreover, GOPAC meets the Act's

definition of political committee in that it both expended more than $ 1,000,

and solicited more than $ 1,000 in contributions, to influence federal

elections. This is evident in the "Campaign For Fair Elections" letter attached

to the Commission's complaint. Accordingly, the Commission respectfully

requests that this Court reconsider its preliminary ruling requiring the

Commission to show that GOPAC's major purpose was to elect particular federal

candidates.<p>

<p>

In any event, a review of all of GOPAC's activities during the 1989- 90

election cycle snows that GOPAC's major purpose was the defeat of Democratic

congressional candidates and the election of their Republican opponents, in

particular Congressman Gingrich. Thus, even under the Court's unnecessarily

narrow preliminary ruling, GOPAC was required to register with the Commission

as a political committee in 1989.<p>

Political

Committee.</a></B><p>

<p>

1. The Federal Election Campaign Act's Definition of Political Committee.<p>

<p>

 "Congress addressed broadly the problem of political campaign financing" in

the Act and "wished to promote full disclosure of campaign-oriented spending to

insure both the reality and the appearance of the purity and openness of the

federal election process." Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 78 (1976). The Court

found the burdens on First Amendment activities caused by the Act's disclosure

requirements were justified by three compelling governmental interests:<p>

<p>

First, disclosure provides the electorate with information "as to where

political campaign money comes from and how it is spent by the candidate" in

order to aid the voters in evaluating those who see+ federal office.... Second,

disclosure requirements deter actual corruption and avoid the appearance of

corruption by exposing large contributions and expenditures to the light of

publicity.... A public armed with information about a candidate's most generous

supporters is better able to detect any post-election favors that may be given

in return. . . Third, and not least significant, recordkeeping, reporting, and

disclosure requirements are an essential means of gathering the data necessary

to detect violations of the [Act. <p>

<p>

Id. at 66-68 (footnotes omitted).<p>

<p>

The Act defines "political committee" broadly to include "any committee, club,

association, or other group of persons which receives contributions aggregating

in excess of $1.000 during a calendar year or which makes expenditures

aggregating in excess of $1,000 during a calendar year." 2 U.S.C. 431 (4)(A).

"Contribution" is also defined broadly to include<p>

<p>

"any gift, subscription, loan, advance or deposit of money or anything of value

made by any person for the purpose of influencing any election for Federal

office." 2 U.S.C. 431 (8)(A)(i). Likewise, the term "expenditure" includes "any

purchase, payment, distribution, loan, advance or deposit of money or anything

of value made by any person for the purpose of influencing any election for

Federal office.'' 2 U.S.C. 431 (9)(A)(i). The Act requires an organization to

"file a statement of organization within 10 days after becoming a political

committee within the meaning of section 431 (4)," 2 U.S.C. 433, and thereafter

to file periodic reports of its receipts and disbursements with the Commission.

2 U.S.C. 434(a). The Act also limits contributions that can be made to a

political committee. 2 U.S.C. 441a(a); 441b(a).<p>

<p>

The Court of Appeals for this Circuit recently held that "the Act has a broad

definition of political committee; Congress intended to address broadly the

problem of political campaign financing,' and wanted to 'promote full

disclosure of campaign- oriented spending."' Akins v. FEC, 66 F.3d 348, 353

(D.C. Cir. 1995) (citation omitted, emphasis added).3 In 1976, the Supreme

Court decided that for issue advocacy groups the "general requirement that

political committees' . . . disclose their expenditures could raise . . .

vagueness problems, for 'political committee' is defined [in the Act] only in

terms of amounts of annual contributions' and expenditures,' and could be

interpreted to reach groups engaged in issue discussion." Buckley, 424 U.S. at

79 (emphasis added). Construing the Act's definition of "political committee"

to avoid chilling the speech of such issue advocacy groups, the Supreme Court

concluded that " [t]o fulfill the purposes of the Act [political committee]

need only encompasses organizations that are under the control of a candidate

or the major purpose of which is the nomination or election of a candidate."

Buckley, 424 U.S. at 79. See FEC v. Massachusetts Citizens For Life ("MCFL"),

479 U.S. 238, 252 n.6 (1986); Akins, 66 F.3d at 353; FEC v. Machinists

Non-Partisan Political League ("Machinist Non-Partisan"), 655 F.2d 380, 391-92

(D.C. Cir.), cert. denied, 454 U.S. 897 (1981). The Court concluded that

"[e]xpenditures of . . .  'political committees' so construed can be assumed to

fall within the core area sought to be addressed by Congress. They are, by

definition, campaign related." Buckley, 424 U.S. at 79. Thus, an organization

whose "major purpose" is the election of candidates, as opposed to issue

advocacy, is a federal political committee under the Act, if it either makes

more than $1,000 in expenditures or receives more than $ 1,000 in contributions

"for the purpose of influencing any election for Federal office."2 U.S.C.

431(8)(A)(i) and 431(9)(A)(i).<p>

<p>

 Contrasting political committees with issue-oriented groups, Buckley and MCFL

explicitly relied upon concerns about unnecessarily burdening the speech of

issue advocacy groups in formulating the major purpose test. Buckley, 424 U.S.

at 79; MCFL, 479 U.S. at 252 n.6. The Court's test was designed to distinguish

between organizations whose primary focus is electoral advocacy and

organizations whose primary focus is on issues that occasionally become a point

of contention in an electoral campaign. The Court held that requiring

registration and the filing of financial reports by groups devoted to electoral

politics was justified by the same compelling governmental interests that

applied to the historical nomination and campaigning functions of traditional

political committees and committees used by politicians for partisan electoral

advantage. Applying the statute to groups whose major purpose is electoral

activity and who spend or receive $1,000 for the purpose of influencing federal

elections serves this compelling governmental interest. This construction of

the Act also removes any vagueness issues by establishing a clear distinction

from the issue, advocacy groups that were the object of the Court's vagueness

concerns. Thus, neither the Supreme Court, the circuit courts, nor the state

courts have expressed any constitutional vagueness or overbreath concerns about

federal or state legislation requiring the registration of groups whose major

purpose is electoral activity.<p>

<p>

 With respect to the Act, the Court did not distinguish between federal and

state candidates in formulating the major purpose test because it was giving

effect to Congress' intent to enact a broad definition of "political committee"

to the full extent permissible without unnecessarily burdening the First

Amendment activities of issue-oriented groups. The distinction between federal

and non-federal committees is contained not in the "major purpose" test, but in

the statutory threshold exempting political committees with little federal

electoral activity. The Act's registration requirements only apply to groups

meeting the "major purpose test" that also have expended or received at least $

1,000 to influence a federal election. 2 U.S.C. 431 (4).<p>

<p>

 GOPAC does not deny that its sole purpose is electoral activity. Indeed, it

advertises itself as the fourth national Republican Party committee; its

purpose is not issue discussion but electing Republican candidates. Thus, under

the Supreme Court's analysis, disclosure of its expenditures does not raise the

same First Amendment concerns as issue-oriented groups "because '[t]hey are, by

definition, campaign related."' Akins, 66 F.3d at 353 (quoting Buckley, 424

U.S. at 79). Accordingly, GOPAC satisfies the definition of a political

committee in the Act. As discussed below, it should have registered with the

Commission because, through its "Campaign For Fair Elections" solicitation

letter in 1989, GOPAC spent more than $1,000, and it accepted more than $ 1,000

in contributions, to influence the 1990 Congressional elections.<p>

<p>

 2. Requiring GOPAC to Register And File Financial Reports Serves A Compelling

Governmental Interest.<p>

<p>

 Considering the compelling governmental interests underlying the Act's

disclosure requirements, GOPAC's failure to disclose its contributions and

expenditures was particularly egregious because of the magnitude of its

activity and the appearance of impropriety caused by its secrecy. During the

1989-90 election cycle, GOPAC raised and spent more than $5 million. Facts

282-291. In connection with the "Campaign For Fair Elections" letter alone,

GOPAC expended $280,812 to produce and distribute that letter and received

$275,710 in contributions in response to it. Facts 238-239. Neither the sources

of those funds nor the use of the contributions has been disclosed to the

electorate by GOPAC. In addition, GOPAC solicited large contributions, at least

$ 10,000 a year, from more than 100 of its Charter Members. As a result of

their contributions, these large contributors were able to meet with federal

office holders and Republican party officials. 5 GOPAC's failure to disclose

the use of these funds creates just the appearance of corruption the Act was

designed to avoid and deprives "the electorate [of] information as to where

political campaign money comes from . . .  [required] to aid the voters in

evaluating those who seek federal office ...." + Buckley, 424 U.S. at 66-67

(internal citation omitted). "As the Court said of quid pro quos for campaign

contributions in Buckley v. Valeo, 'the scope of such pernicious practices can

never be reliably ascertained.' . . . Although the record contains only

allegations, no smoking gun is needed where, as here, the conflict of interest

is apparent, the likelihood of stealth great, and the legislative purpose

prophylactic." Blount v. SEC, 61 F.3d 938, 945 (D.C. Cir. 1995).<p>

<p>

 The appearance of impropriety was acknowledged by GOPAC in an internal

analysis. "There is no hint of any contributor who gives money in return for

influence.... Nevertheless, there is concern among some that we could be

criticized by your friends in the [Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee]

or in the press with the false allegation that those who give large sums of

money (12 have given over $10,000  in the last year) are doing so to gain

special treatment  from you or the Whip office." Exh. l56 at [287]./6  This is

just the sort of the appearance of corruption that Buckley and Machinists

Non-Partisan found the Act was properly designed to prevent.<p>

<p>

 3. The Commission's Interpretation of "Political Committee" Is Entitled To

Deference By This Court.<p>

<p>

 The Commission, balancing the concern, identified by Congress and the Supreme

Court, has interpreted the term "political committee" used in the Act in a

series of advisory opinions. See 2 U.S.C. Section 437f. In Akins, a decision

issued after this Court's initial ruling on the motion to dismiss, the D.C.

Circuit held that the Commission's construction of this statutory definition,

and in particular its application of the "major purpose" test, is entitled to

substantial deference from the courts. Akins, 66 F.3d at 352. As the Supreme

Court has stated, "if the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the

specific issue, the question for the court is whether the agency's answer is

based on a permissible construction of the statute." Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v.

Natural Resources Defense Council, 467 U.S. 83,', 843 (1984). Moreover, the

Supreme Court has recognized that the Commission "is precisely the type of

agency to which deference should presumptively be afforded." FEC v. Democratic

Senatorial Campaign Committee, 454 U.S. 27, 37 (1981); Akins, 66 F.3d at 352;

FEC v. National Republican Senatorial Committee, 966 F.2d 1471, 1476-78 (D.C.

Cir. 1992); Common Cause v. FEC, 842 F.2d 436, 448 (D.C. Cir. 1988).<p>

<p>

 In particular, this Circuit has held recently that the Commission's

construction of the words "political committee" as a "construction of its own

statute cannot be disturbed if it is a permissible one." See, 66 F.3d at 352

(citing, Chevron, 467 U.S. at 842-45). Accordingly, it is now clear that the

Commission's construction in its advisory opinions regarding organizations that

qualify as a federal "political committee" is entitled to deference by this

Court.<p>

<p>

 In the advisory opinions described below the Commission has for more than a

decade, consistently found that groups whose sole purpose is to support the

election of a category of candidates for office -- such as all Republicans --

at any electoral level, becomes a federal political committee, and must

register and report, if its expenditures to support the election of federal

candidates exceed $1,000. These advisory opinions are, at least, a permissible

construction of the definition of political committee under the Act, and are

well within the Commission's area of expertise to determine when the major

purpose of an organization is electoral politics. Akins, 66 F.3d at 352 ("The

Commission determined that AIPAC's campaign-related expenditures, . . ., were

not its major purpose . . .)." It was certainly reasonable, if not necessary,

for the Commission to conclude that partisan political organizations that only

exist to urge support for one political group, such as "all Republicans" or

"conservatives," meet the "major purpose" test This specific application of the

Act to admittedly partisan political groups is consistent with Akins and MCFL,

which were concerned with a chilling effect on the speech of issue-oriented

organizations. The Commission's construction of the Act resolves constitutional

vagueness problems, gives effect to Congress's intent that the statute be read

broadly, and does not infringe on or chill the speech of the issue advocacy

groups that concerned the Court in Buckley, 424 U.S. at 79 or MCFL, 479 U.S. at

252 n.6. Thus, this Court, under Chevron, should not add any additional

requirements of its own to the "major purpose test," such as requiring that a

partisan political organization's major purpose be to elect a particular

federal candidate, as opposed to electoral activity generally.<p>

<p>

 The Commission's advisory opinions also resolve the issue of whether

expenditures for a particular federal candidate are required or whether any

categorical appeals to vote for all Republicans, all Democrats or all

conservative, running for federal office are enough to satisfy the $1,000

expenditure test. The advisory opinions hold that such generic advertisements

meet the expenditure test. Without referring to the advisory opinions, this

Court has already held that an expenditure urging the election of all

Republican candidates is "for the purpose of influencing" a federal election

under the Act. (GOPAC I, 871 F. Supp. at 1470-71.<p>

<p>

a. AO 1980-126: Independent Voters For A Republican Victory Would Solicit Funds

And Purchase Advertisements For All Republican Candidates.<p>

<p>

 In 1980, the Commission found that an individual who established a bank

account in the name of "Independent Voters for a Republican Victory," described

"Independent Voters" as a "National Committee," solicited contributions by

telephone and distributed letters that urged voters to "vot[e] for all

Republican candidates in the 1980 general election" triggered the Act's

registration and reporting requirements for political committees. + Exh. 44 AO

1980-126, Fed. Election Camp. Fin. Guide (CCH) 11 5577 at 10,713. The

Commission concluded that "the operation of an organization which solicits

funds from a broad range of persons across the country which funds were used to

advocate the election of +11 Republican candidates in the 1980 election" made

the organization a political committee within the meaning of the Act. Id.

(emphasis added). The Commission found that the individual "held out the entity

called Independent Voters for a Republican Victory' as an on-going organization

engaged in the making of expenditures to advocate the election of Republican

candidates." Id. Therefore, even though the individual did not identify

particular Republican candidates to support, or focus specifically on

candidates for federal office, but rather supported all Republican candidates

as a group in the 1980 election, which included federal candidates, the

individual's organization was required to register. Id. at 10,714.<p>

<p>

 The Commission also found that expending more than $1,000 and accepting more

than $1,000 in contributions for generic "Republican candidates" in the next

general election met both of the alternative $ I ,000 federal political

committee tests.<p>

<p>

 b. AO 1986-38: Individual Would Purchase Advertisements For Conservative

Candidates.<p>

<p>

 In 1986, the Commission determined that a radio and television advertisement

that "urg[ed] viewers and listeners to 'vote on No+u mber 4th[,]' and 'send the

right people [conservatives] to Washington' [was] clearly designed to influence

voting in elections for Federal office." Exh. 45 AO 1986-38, Fed. Election

Camp. Fin. Guide (CCH) 11 5876 at 11,330. The Commission concluded that

payments for the proposed advertisements would constitute expenditures for the

purpose of influencing a Federal election, even though the advertisements did

not identify a particular candidate. L. The Commission found that the cost of

these advertisements would count toward the  $1,000 threshold for reporting

expenditures if made by a group. However, because the expenditures in this case

were made by one individual instead of a group, the Commission found that

registration was not required. Id. at 11,330-31.<p>

<p>

 c. AO 1988-22: San Joaquin Valley Republican Associates Engaged in Electoral

Activity For All Republicans.<p>

<p>

 In 1988, the Commission considered whether the San Joaquin Valley Republican

Associates ("Republican Associates") qualified as a federal political committee

under the Act. See Exh. 46 AO 1988-22, Fed. Election Camp. Fin. Guide (CCH) 11

5932 at 11,465. The Articles of Incorporation of the Republican Associates

described its "'specific purpose' as being 'to help elect more Republicans to

office by enhancing significantly the visibility of the Republican Party,

Republican ideas, Republican thought and Republican personalities within the

San Joaquin Valley of California,"' L. at 11,466. The Commission examined

whether the four activities proposed by Republican Associates (publication and

distribution of a newsletter, sponsorship of luncheons, sponsorship of debates

and operation of a "campaign library") constituted contributions or

expenditures for the purpose of influencing federal elections that would

trigger the Act's registration and reporting requirements. I+l. at 11,467-70.

Given the exclusively electoral purpose of the Republican Associates as

represented by the organization itself, its major purpose was never an issue,

even though there was no indication the organization's electoral activities

were primarily focused on federal, rather than state and local, elections.<p>

<p>

 The Commission concluded that the activities described did constitute

contributions and expenditures that counted against the $1,000 threshold for

qualifying as a political committee. Id. As three concurring Commissioners

noted, "in determining whether a particular group or organization is engaging

in activities 'for the purpose of influencing any election for Federal office'

(2 U.S.C. 431(8)(A)(i), (9)(A)(i)),'the Commission relies heavily on the

apparent nature and purposes of the group itself." Id. at 11,472./7<p>

<p>

 4. This Court Should Follow Akins And Defer to The Commission's Construction

Of "Political Committee."<p>

<p>

 In denying GOPAC's motion to dismiss., this Court relied heavily on Machinists

Non-Partisan, 655 F.2d at 391-92, to support its holding that "if the

Commission were able to establish that, at a particular point in time before

GOPAC registered and began reporting, its major objective was, in fact, to

elect a particular candidate or particular federal candidates, then it should

follow that GOPAC was, at that time, a political committee obligated to

register and report." GOPAC I, 871 F. Supp. at 1470 (emphasis in original).

Citing Bucklev, 424 U.S. at 79, this Court found that "any payment of $ 1,000

or more by an organization whose major purpose has been determined to be the

nomination or election of an identified candidate for federal office (as

distinguished from an organization which has some other major purpose) is, 'by

definition, campaign related' and hence, constitutes an 'expenditure' by a

'political committee."' GOPAC I, 871 F. Supp. at 14 70-71 (emphasis in

original). This Court concluded that "[h]ere, the controlling relevant question

is not whether the [Campaign For Fair Elections] communication 'expressly

advocates' the election or defeat of such candidates for federal office, but

rather whether, at the times in question, the organization's 'major purpose . .

. [was] the nomination or election' of an identified candidate or candidates

for federal office." Id.  at 1471 (quoting Buckley, 424 U.S. at 79).<p>

<p>

 In view of the D.C. Circuit's subsequent Akins decision holding that courts

should give deference to the Commission's construction of the term "political

committee" under the Act, the Commission respectfully requests that this Court

reconsider its earlier view and give deference to the Commission's advisory

opinions. The Commission has found that once an organization solely devoted to

partisan electoral politics spends more than $1,000 for the purpose of

influencing a federal election or receives contributions in excess of $ 1,000

for the purpose of influencing a federal election, the compelling governmental

interests underlying the Act justify requiring that organization to register

with the Commission as a federal political committee and file periodic reports

of its financial activity. This Court should follow the Akins precedent by

deferring to the Commission's construction of the definition of a federal

political committee, as described in the advisory opinions.<p>

<p>

 In addition to Chevron deference, this Court should reconsider its holding to

take into consideration Congress' intent to protect these compelling interests

by defining political committee as broadly as permitted by the First Amendment.

As discussed above, the Supreme Court's concern was about a potential ambiguity

that might burden the speech of groups primarily engaged in issue advocacy,

rather than electoral politics. GOPAC is not one of those organizations; it is

an avowedly partisan political organization. None of the constitutional issues

that concerned the Supreme Court apply to purely partisan groups. In fact, the

Court has held that there are compelling governmental interests, including the

prevention of corruption and the appearance of corruption in the electoral

process, that justify the Act's "broad definition of political committee,"

Akins, 66 F.3d at 353, and the requirement that such organizations file reports

of their "campaign-oriented spending" with the Commission, Buckley, 424 U.S. at

78, and these interests are fully applicable to organizations like GOPAC.<p>

<p>

 This Court's decision prior to Akins relied heavily on Machinists

Non-Partisan, 655 F.2d at 391-396, but Machinists Non-Partisan was a very

narrow holding about organizations that are very different in material ways

from GOPAC. As Akins explained, "[t]his Circuit [in Machinists]...  adopted a

narrow construction to determine whether a 'draft group,' that is, an

organization that seeks to encourage a specific candidate to run for office, is

a political committee under FECA." Akins, 66 F.3d at 354 (citing Machinists,

655 F.2d at 394-96.) That decision held that the Act's contribution limits did

not apply to a "draft group" because such a group, by definition, was only

trying to convince an individual to run for office. Machinist Non- partisan,

655 F.2d at 391-92. This stands in contrast with groups like GOPAC, which spent

large amounts to support and elect candidates of a particular party, working in

close association with that party's officials and its campaign committees.

Thus, Machinists Non-Partisan does not apply to a partisan organization, like

GOPAC, whose activities were undertaken for the avowed purpose of supporting

the election of the Republican Party's candidates.<p>

<p>

 Moreover, when the Machinists Non-Partisan court examined the 1979 Amendments

to the Act, which "delete[d] any reference to 'supporting a candidate or

candidates for election to federal office,"' it found that the amendment would

require that even "'draft' groups file reports as political committees." Id. at

395. This disclosure requirement for "draft" groups, and more so for admittedly

partisan groups like GOPAC, is justified by the need to inform the electorate

"as to where political campaign money comes from" and to deter corruption by

"exposing large contributions and expenditures to the light of publicity."

Buckley, 424 U.S. at 66-67.<p>

<p>

<B> <a name=threeb> B. GOPAC And Its "Campaign For Fair Elections" Letter Satisfied The

Act's

Definition Of Political Committee As Construed In The Advisory Opinions.</a></B><p>

<p>

 1. GOPAC'S Major Purpose Was The Election Of Republican Candidates.<p>

<p>

 The Act's disclosure requirements were designed to apply specifically to

organizations like GOPAC whose mission was "to generally support Republican

candidates and principles at all levels of government." GOPAC's Memorandum of

Points and Authorities in Support of its Motion to Dismiss at 3. It was

registered as a political committee in several states. In its "Campaign for

Fair Elections" letter, GOPAC describes itself as "the Republican committee

dedicated to building a Republican majority at all levels of government." Exh.

1 at 2. Thus, there should be no dispute that during the 1989-90 election cycle

GOPAC's sole purpose was the election of Republican candidates.<p>

<p>

 GOPAC's avowed purpose is comparable to the organizations in the previously

described advisory opinions. GOPAC meets the major purpose test in AO 1980-126

where the sole purpose was the election of Republican candidates. Similarly,

the San Joaquin Valley Republican Associates, like GOPAC, distributed

literature, sponsored meetings and debates, and operated a campaign library --

GOPAC's campaign research and distribution of the results obviously was more

sophisticated than Repub]ican Associates -- and, therefore, both were political

committees. Exh. 46 AO 1988-22. There is no material distinction between the

major purpose of GOPAC and the organizations in the advisory opinions whose

purpose was the election of "Republican" candidates across the board To be

sure, GOPAC far outstripped these groups in its size, sophistication and

coordination with the Republican Party leadership. But, these factors only

enhanced GOPAC's effectiveness in accomplishing the major purpose that was

common to all of these organizations: to influence the election of a class of

federal and state candidates, such as all "Republican" and/or "conservative"

candidates in the advisory opinions.<p>

<p>

 If this Court required GOPAC's major purpose to be "'the nomination or

election' of an identified candidate or candidates for federal office,'' GOPAC

I, 871 F. Supp. at 1471 (quoting Buckley, 424 U.S. at 79), it would provide an

easy avenue for GOPAC and other similar partisan political organizations to

avoid the Act's disclosure requirements. Indeed, GOPAC demonstrated how

millions of undisclosed dollars could be raised and spent by an organization

closely associated with party committees and candidates to make valuable

polling information and other campaign research available to the party's

candidates. Such a group could even expend millions advocating the election of

all Democrats or all Republicans and explain why the party's candidates should

be elected and/or the opposing party's candidates defeated. As long as such

groups are careful not to identify a particular candidate, they may not meet

the GOPAC I test for political committee status under the Act. It is difficult

to believe that this Court contemplated such a result in GOPAC I, which would

confound Congress' purposes of preventing corruption and the appearance of

corruption by requiring disclo ,ure of such use of campaign funds by political

committees. Buckley has already held that this is a sufficiently compelling

purpose to justify necessary First Amendment burdens on such organizations.<p>

<p>

 2. GOPAC Made Expenditures For The Purpose Of Influencing Federal Elections.<p>

<p>

 GOPAC admits that it was the fourth national Republican Party committee, and

it spent millions during the 1989-90 election cycle to help elect Republicans

at all levels of government, particularly to elect Republican candidates to the

United States House of Representatives. A comparison of the expenditures by the

political committees described in the above-described Commission advisory

opinions with GOPAC's expenditures, particularly GOPAC's mass mailings, shows a

remarkable similarity in everything except size and number of activities. The

advisory opinions specifically relied on the expenditure of more than $ 1,000

for communications to vote for all "Republican" and all "conservative"

ccmdidates to find that the organizations would be federal political committees

under the Act. In 1989, GOPAC spent well in excess of $1,000 to produce and

distribute its "Campaign For Fair Elections" mailings, which called for the

defeat of all Democrats and the election of all Republican candidates to the

United States House of Representatives during the 1990 and 1992  elections.

This letter was plainly for the purpose of influencing those federal elections.

Exh. 1.  From June 1989 through August 1990, prior to registering as a federal

political committee with the Commission, GOPAC distributed its "Campaign For

Fair Elections" solicitation to the general publiG. The "Campaign For Fair

Elections" communication included a letter from Congressman Newt Gingrich,

General Chairman of GOPAC, a "CITIZENS VETO" addressed to the "Members of the

101st Congress" opposing the ('ongressional mail franking privilege, and a

separate solicitation for contributions. In the letter, GOPAC describes itself

as "the Republican committee dedicated to building a Republican majority at all

levels of government." Exh. 1 at 2.<p>

<p>

 In relevant part, Congressman Gingrich's letter stated:<p>

<p><blockquote>

 "[T]he Democrats in Congress have set themselves up as the highest authority

in the land -- above the will of the American people who elected Ronald Reagan

and then George Bush to be their president.<p>

<p>

 The only way to clean up the mess and restore honesty and decency to Congress

is to break the Democrats stranglehold on power . . .<p>

<p>

     * * * <p>

<p>

 Your VETO is the first step in our two-step plan to gain a Republican majority

in the House of Representatives by 1992.<p>

<p>

 The Campaign for Fair Elections is a project of GOPAC, the Republican

committee dedicated to building a Republican majority at all levels of

government."<p> </blockquote>

<p>

 Id. The letter claimed that "[w]ith your help, our Campaign for Fair Elections

will defeat or seriously weaken a large number of Democrats in 1990. And that

will give us the momentum we need to sweep in a majority of Republicans in 1992

.... Our plan is ambitious. We're aiming to overturn a Democrat reign that's

lasted 35 years." Id. at 3. In conclusion, Congressman Gingrich stated "[w]ith

your help, we can break the liberal Democrats' iron-grip on the House of

Representatives and build a new Republican majority." Id. at 4. The

solicitation reply form addressed to Congressman Gingrich accompanying the

letter asked the addressee to check a box indicating: "YES! I want to help

break the Democrats' iron grip on Congress by building a new Republican

majority in the House of Representatives." Id. at 6 (emphasis in original).<p>

<p>

 In the same way that the organizations described in the Commission's advisory

opinions were federal political committees as a result of expenditures on their

electoral communications, GOPAC was a federal political committee because it

expended more than $1,000 to produce and distribute its "Campaign for Fair

Elections" letters for the purpose of influencing a federal election. In its

letter, GOPAC held itself out to the general public as a national "Republican

committee dedicated to building a Republican majority at all levels of

government." FEC Exh. 1 at 2. From June 1989 through August 1990, GOPAC

distributed, through Stephen Winchell and Associates, a direct mail firm,

773,515 "Campaign for Fair Elections" letters to the general public at a cost

of $265,291. Facts 239. On June 27, 1990, GOPAC, using its own mailing list,

distributed an additional 25,227 "Campaign for Fair Elections" letters to the

general public at a cost of $15,521. Facts 238. As in AO 1980-126, where the

organization, through its solicitations, advocated the election of all

Republican candidates in the 1980 election and in AO 1986-38, where the

individual, through advertisements, urged voters to support conservative

candidates in the 1986 election, GOPAC, in its' solicitation, urged voters to

contribute to its "Campaign for Fair Elections" to help "defeat . . . a large

number of Democrats in [the] 1990" election and "to sweep in a majority of

Republicans in the 1992" election. FEC Exh. 1 at 3.<p>

<p>

 As discussed above, the Commission found that funds spent to advocate the

election of "all Republicans" in the 1980 election, funds spent to advocate

election of "the conservatives" in the 1986 election, and during the

administrative proceeding in this case, funds spent urging voters to help

"defeat . . . Democrats" in the 1990 election and elect a "majority of

Republicans" in the 1990 and 1992 election qualified as expenditures for the

purpose of influencing federal elections even though particular federal

candidates were not identified by name.<p>

<p>

 Therefore, because GOPAC produced and distributed its "Campaign for Fair

Elections" solicitation at a total cost of $280,812 for the purpose of

influencing federal elections, GOPAC was required to register with the

Commission by June 1989. GOPAC, however, did not file a statement of

organization with the Commission until May 8, 1991. Accordingly, GOPAC violated

2 U.S.C. 433 by failing to register with the Commission in a timely manner.

GOPAC also violated 2 U.S.C~ 434 by failing to file the required disclosure

reports.<p>

<p>

 3. GOPAC Received Contributions For The Purpose Of Influencing Federal

Elections.<p>

<p>

 As noted above, the Act defines a political committee as an organization that

either makes expenditures or accepts contributions in excess of $1,000 for the

purpose of influencing Federal elections. GOPAC accepted more than $1,000 in

contributions: GOPAC's "Campaign for Fair Elections" letter solicited

contributions for the political purpose of helping to elect Republican

candidates and defeat Democratic incumbent candidates for the United States

House of Representatives -- GOPAC's "two-step plan to build a Republican

majority in 1992."<p> <blockquote>

<p>

  "Our plan is ambitious. We're aiming to overturn a Democrat reign that's

lasted 35 years.<p>

<p>

 The time has never been better. The American people have never been more

ready.<p>

<p>

 But we're going to need your help to succeed. That's why I'm asking you to

send in a generous contribution .... which must cover the cost of:<p>

<p>

 -- raising . . . money . . .<p>

<p>

 -- working to get a response . . . from Congress,<p>

<p>

 -- conducting the massive publicity campaign . . .<p>

<p>

 -- and building the cash reserve for our candidates.<p>

<p>  

 * * *<p>

<p>

 With your help, we can break the liberal Democrats' iron grip on the House of

Representatives and build a new Republican majority.<p> </blockquote>

<p>

 Exh. 1 at 3-4. Enclosed with the letter was a "Reply Memorandum" addressed to

Congressman Newt Gingrich, to be signed by the addressee and returned with the

contribution. Exh. 1 at 5. The "Reply Memorandum" stated:<p>

<p> <blockquote>

 YES!<p>

<p>

 I want to help break the Democrat's iron grip on Congress by building a new

Republican majority in the House of Representatives.<p>

<p>

 * * *<p>

<p>

 I am enclosing my contribution, made payable to GOPAC, for $25[,] $50[,]

$100[,] $500 [,] $ Other[,]"<p> </blockquote>

<p>

 Exh. 1 at 5 (emphasis in original).<p>

<p>

 In response to this solicitation, GOPAC received $275,710 in contributions.

Facts 238- 239. As the "Reply Memorandum" itself stated, addressees were asked

to take two actions: 1) send contributions to GOPAC "to help break the

Democrat's iron grip on Congress by building a new Republican majority in the

House of Representatives," and 2) sign a "CITIZENS VETO" to be delivered to

Congress. Exh. 1 at 5. GOPAC's self professed method for building a Republican

majority in the House of Representatives included building cash reserves for

Republican candidates. Money donated to GOPAC for the purpose of building a

Republican majority in the House is plainly a contribution under the Act when

it is received. United States v. Hankin, 607 F.2d 611, 613 (3d Cir. 1979),

regardless of what GOPAC actually did with the money later. Contributions

received by GOPAC in response to its "Campaign for Fair Elections" solicitation

letter were for the purpose of influencing a federal election. Accordingly,

because GOPAC received contributions totaling $275,710, well in excess of the

$1,000 threshold, GOPAC was required to register as a federal political

committee and report its receipts and disbursements to the Commission.<p>

<p>

 Therefore, because GOPAC accepted contributions in response to its "Campaign

For Fair Elections" solicitation totaling $275,710 for the purpose of

influencing federal elections, GOPAC was required to register with the

Commission by June 1989. Accordingly, GOPAC violated 2 U.S.C. 433 by failing to

register with the Commission in a timely manner, and also violated 2 U.S.C. 434

by failing to file the required disclosure reports.<p>

<p>

<B><a name=threec> C. Even If The "Major Purpose" Test Required More Than An

Organization

Devoted

Solely To Partisan Politics, GOPAC's Actual Activities And Public Statements

Demonstrate That Its Major Purpose Was to Influence Federal Elections.</a></B><p>

<p>

 GOPAC was "one of the four major nationwide or national organizations in the

Republican Party," Exh. 23 at [Gingrich51], and in its letters it called itself

a National Republican Committee. See. [], Exh. 29 at [2749]. To []GOPAC the

concepts of a "Republican majority" and recapture of the House of

Representatives were synonymous: "capturing the House of Representatives" was a

'+metaphor for a Republican majority . . .; one would know that the Republican

Party had become a majority party when it controlled the majority in the House

of Representatives." Exh. 22 at [Eisenach44-45] Thus, even if the "major

purpose" test required more than an organization devoted solely to partisan

politics, GOPAC's actual expenditures, its public statements, and the support

it provided to the particularly identified class of Republican candidates for

Congress in the 1990, all demonstrate that its major purpose was to influence

federal elections. Even if the strictest construction of the term "political

committee" were used, GOPAC's focus on named federal candidates -- George Bush,

James Wright and Newt Gingrich -- clearly demonstrates GOPAC's major purpose

was to influence federal elections.<p>

<p>

 1. GOPAC's 1989-90 Election Cycle Expenditures.<p>

<p>

 The vast majority, approximately 85 percent, of GOPAC's 1989-90 expenditures

were for the purpose of electing Republican candidates to the United States

House of Representatives. Letters, such as the "Campaign For Fair Elections,"

were sent almost every month across the nation explaining why, in GOPAC's view,

it was imperative to elect Republican candidates to the House. Research was

conducted and the results disseminated to Republican candidates and activists

about the best campaign themes and how to present those themes. Congressman

Gingrich used this information himself; he signed most of the letters including

the "Campaign For Fair Elections" letters; and he received more than $ 100,000

in contributions to his 1990 congressional campaign committee from GOPAC's

Large contributors. These activities to influence the elections of the

particular Republican House candidates, and Congressman Gingrich in particular,

demonstrate that GOPAC's major purpose was to influence particular federal

elections.<p>

<p>

 Admittedly, much of the research and some of the letters would benefit

Republican candidates at every level. However, the research was based on

national issues and concerns rather than those at issue in particular state

legislative races, and one of the goals of GOPAC's training program

(approximately 7.5% of expenditures) was to teach candidates how to modify

their own campaign message to take advantage of the national research, and at

the same time to campaign on GOPAC's national themes. In short, GOPAC's goal

was to nationalize local campaigns. While it is not possible to allocate

GOPAC's expenditures among specific election campaigns during the 1989-90

electoral cycle +with an accountant's certainty, the obvious purpose for

GOPAC's development of an election agenda focusing on national concerns was the

election of Republican congressional candidates. In fact, that is exactly what

GOPAC told potential contributors in its "Campaign For Fair Elections" and

other letters.<p>

<p>

 a. Coordination With the Republican National Committee And The National

Republican Congressional Committee.<p>

<p>

 During 1989-90, General Chairman Gingrich was in the Republican House

leadership, while Executive Director Riddle was the Vice Chair of the RNC

executive committee. Fact 30. After consultation with the RNC and the National

Republican Congressional Committee ("NRCC"),/9 GOPAC expended funds to develop

campaign messimages that could be used by Republican candidates for the state

legislative and for the Congress. Facts 59-66. The topics of the election

messimages were selected based on their usefulness and expected ability to

attract voters to Republican candidates nationwide. Id. Once the wording was

perfected to have the greatest impact on voters, Gingrich incorporated them

into speeches which were taped and distributed to thousands of Republican

incumbents, activists and anyone else who requested them. Fact 72. GOPAC

regularly mailed thousands of audio tapes containing the same information and

messimages to everyone on its mailing list. Facts 134-147. In addition, GOPAC

also produced videotapes of Gingrich and others, which were shown at GOPAC

training sessions and provided to other candidates and to anyone else who

requested them. Facts 125-133. After notification to the RNC and the NRCC,

these messimages were taught to national and state Republican candidates and

activists at state party-sponsored and NRCC-sponsored classes. Id.<p>

<p>

 Campaign research, development and dissemination of winning messimages began as

a "team effort" involving the Republican National Committee, the National

Republican Congressional Committee, "a lot of different people." Exh. 23 at

[Gingrich34]. "[T]here were meetings where people would get together and say,

'All right, where are we going and what are we trying to do as a team?"' Exh.

23 at [Gingrich68]. In January 1989, Congressman Gingrich, GOPAC Chairman

Callaway, Executive Director Riddle and GOPAC's consultants "had several

discussions . . . actually to begin planning for the 1992 [congressional]

elections." Exh. 22 at [Eisenach41]. GOPAC's senior officials had "conclude[d]

that 1992 was an election in which there would be unique opportunities for

Republicans . . . in the U.S. House of Representatives." Exh. 22 at

[Eisenach1-10].<p>

<p>

 On February 10-11, 1989, GOPAC sponsored a meeting in Washington, D.C. where a

"number of conservative and Republican and intellectual leaders," essentially a

"national leadership group," spent two days discussing "how to make the

Republican Party a majority party." Exh. 22 at [Eisenach38, 43]. One of the

topics discussed was Republican capture of the U.S. House of Representatives.

Gingrich and the others wanted "to begin a 'revolution' that will end in

Republican control of the House." Exh. 66 at [4369].<p>

<p>

 In August 1989, GOPAC sponsored a two week meeting in a remote part of

Colorado, the first North Pole Basin meeting. Facts 76-87. Attendees were the

Republican Party leadership, including the NRCC leadership and the most active

GOPAC Charter members. Id. The meeting was an "effort to go from the general to

the specific." Exh. 22 at [Eisenach91]. "It began with an effort to understand

at the very broadest level +what the nature really of the world at that time

was and then proceeded [to] become more specific to end up with the discussion

of what GOPAC's role should be and what specific projects GOPAC should

undertake." Exh. 22 at [Eisenach91].<p>

<p>

 At the first of four parts of the meeting, [Gingrich and GOPAC senior staff,

along with "big thinkers," "visionary Republican strategists," "[m]embers of

Congress and political consultants," Exh. 22 at [Eisenach89-91], discussed the

"structure of the Republican Party nationally" and GOPAC's plans. Exh. 19 at

Morgan 134]. During the second session, attended by Co-Chair of the NRCC Ed

Rollins, NRCC :Executive Director Marc Nuttle and NRCC Director of Finance and

Administration Wyatt Stewart, as well as Joe Gaylord who represented NRCC's

American Campaign Academy, Exh. 66 at [:3593, 3726, 3728-3729], the

participants "focused on the 1990 and 1992 Congressional elections." Exh. 66 at

[3838]. The participants "developed a set of campaign themes for 1990." Exh .

66 at [3579, 3839]. The third session, entitled "Congressional Planning," in

turn "concentrated on developing key platform planks for the 1990 and 1992

elections," including a "100-Day Agenda." Exh. 66 at [3675; 3839]. This session

was attended by then Republican House Whip Gingrich, Deputy Whip Joe Barton and

Republican Congressmen Jon Kyl and Bob Walker. Exh. 30 at [2737]. More than

half of the participants were current or former members of Congress or their

spouses. Exh. 66 at [3727].<p>

<p>

 During the fourth session, the "majority of our discussion was focused on what

specific things GOPAC can do to substantially speed up political realignment."

Exh.66 at [3840]. Gingrich and the GOPAC Charter Members discussed focusing

GOPAC's efforts on five areas: "research and development;" "product

development;" "training;" consulting; and "legislative and local races." Exh.

35 at 14. According to Gingrich, the first four were "universal" in that they

would be available to "any Republican or Republican group or Republican

institution or Republican candidate who would like our help with the top four"

and would "enhance their ability to do anything at whatever level they happen

to be at from down to the President, down to the Federal Government to the

State level to the local level." Exh. 35 at 14-15. The fifth area of GOPAC

activities, direct contributions to state parties and candidates (later

described as "traditional GOPAC" or the "farm team"), now was of only secondary

importance. Exh. 35 at 16. Because GOPAC believed it was important that all

Republican candidates espouse the same message that GOPAC had researched and

disseminated, as one Charter Member candidly put it, contributions to state

candidates were "the tribute we pay to state parties to let us be friendly."

Exh. 35 at 16 ("the money is only important because the state party likes it,"

Id.; it makes it easier to attract attendance to training sessions). Facts

113.<p>

<p>

 As GOPAC later explained, "we rethought our mission and expanded it to meet

the new challenges of the 1990 ' s . . .  We are now the creator and

disseminator of the new republican doctrine. Our extended mission will take

GOPAC into the exciting new decade of the '90s." Exh. 66 at [3850]. GOPAC

embarked on what Congressman Gingrich later described as "by far the largest

and most encompassing recruiting, training and funding effort ever attempted by

any group." Exh. 66 at [4796].<p>

<p>

 It is noteworthy that these were national meetings involving national

Republican party leaders discussing national issues to be used by Republican

candidates for federal office.<p>

<p>

 b. Research and Development Projects.<p>

<p>

 During 1989 and 1990 GOPAC took the lead in planning, research and development

for the entire Republican Party. As Callaway stated, "[i]t is my conviction

that GOPAC continues to be the Bell Laboratories of the Republican Party." Exh.

66 at [4580, 4588, 4612]. GOPAC conducted "research and development" to choose

and test "issues and strategies" to "help Republicans win in the coming

election." Exh. 66 at [4610]. "[W]e are doing issue research to help our

candidates articulate a winning message for 1990." Exh. 66 at [4575]. Gingrich

discussed these issues with many people, essentially "whoever's judgment I

trusted that year." Exh. 23 at [Gingrich20]. By 1990, GOPAC was one of the

Republican Party's leading planning, research and training entities. Exh. 31 at

[2786]. Gingrich "believe[d] GOPAC is an extremely effective tool for advancing

our cause. We not only train, fund, and recruit Republican candidates to run

for Congress, we also shape and guide the language and the issues which the

Republican Party should address [sic]." Exh 66 at [4278-4279; 4282]. In his

view, GOPAC was "quite literally[] changing the face of American Politics."

Exh. 66 at [6099-6102]. During the 1989-90 election cycle, GOPAC spent

approximately $1 million on these projects to develop the winning message for

Republican candidates for state and federal office.<p>

<p>

 GOPAC's research revealed "[t]hat there was a natural cultural majority that

we were failing to reach and that we had to redesign the campaigns to fit more

accurately a broad cultural majority." Exh. 22 at [Gingrich38]. GOPAC therefore

recommended that candidates use a "thematic approach which allows all of the

campaigns to be able to subsume themselves into a larger pattern so that . . .

you create an echo effect, a resonance, which fits about 88 percent of the

country." Exh. 23 at [Gingrich38]. "[I]f you get every straight Republican

voter to show up, it helps everybody at every level vote and win." Exh. 23 at

[Gingrich69]. Thus, GOPAC's research developed one of GOPAC's campaign tactics,

to nationalize state and congressional elections. This campaign tactic is

mirrored in GOPAC's own national mailings such as the "Campaign For Fair

Elections" and others described below.<p>

<p>

 GOPAC also sponsored research "to help our candidates articulate a winning

message for 1990." Exh. 66 at [4610]. Like other results of GOPAC's research

and development efforts, the development and dissemination of a common national

"agenda," on which all Republican state and congressional candidates should

run, became part of GOPAC's political activities. Congressman Gingrich gave

speeches urging Republican candidates to run on a common agenda and "gave them

some examples of things that we know are universal," such as a balanced budget

and crime. Exh. 23 at [Gingrich48-49]. In fact, creation and dissemination of a

"broad, national doctrine and an 'Agenda Worth Voting For"' became one of the

stated goals for GOPAC. "Our focus in 1990 will be to create the 'Agenda Worth

Voting For' and to help candidates articulate this message." Exh. 66 at

[4802-4803].<p>

<p>

 "GOPAC conducted a wide variety of research activities . . .,  all of them in

order to gain a better understanding of public opinion, the history,

contemporary history, the major forces that work on society and the

opportunities and challenges that those things presented to the Republican

Party, not as an institution but as a community." Exh. 22 at [Eisenach40]. All

of this research into "political issues of the day" was "part of GOPAC's

overall effort . . .  to make the Republican Party a majority party." Exh. 22

at [Eisenach60]. GOPAC would know it had accomplished that goal when

Republicans were in the majority in the House. Exh. 22 at [Eisenach40, 108].<p>

<p>

 i. Expenditures For Campaign Consultants.<p>

<p>

 GOPAC held many meetings in its own conference room with consultants who

provided campaign research and theories about the best electoral message for

Republican candidates for Congress. Paid political consultants and literally

"hundreds" of volunteers provided input. "[I]t was like a revolving door." Exh.

21 at [Riddlel 8]. For example, at a June 1989 "long-range planning" meeting,

Gingrich and other GOPAC officials and consultants discussed a "three-year plan

designed to ensure that a governing center-right coalition [was] in control of

Congress and the Executive Branch by 1992." Exh. 66 at [4007]. The group

concluded that "Republicans [would] need to emerge from the 1992 elections with

56 Senate seats, 240 House seats, the Presidency, and victories in the

corresponding state and local races. Newt must be reelected. A given measure of

success in 1990 is a subgoal of this objective." Id.<p>

<p>

 The results of GOPAC's planning and strategy sessions, shirt sleeve sessions

where Charter Members were invited, and the political research and development

reports from its consultants were widely distributed. Facts. 45-47, 59-67.

Incumbent members of Congress who were running for re-election in 1990,

including Gingrich, often attended GOPAC meetings where GOPAC's research

results and future research projects were discussed. National Republican Party

officials and consultants also were routinely informed of, and frequently

participated in, GOPAC's activities. Id. In fact, during this time period "[i]t

was almost standard operating procedure," Exh. 22 at [Eisenach34], to

tape-record GOPAC meetings and written summaries often were prepared. "Whoever

had been at the meetings would typically get a summary" and "[t]here were many

cases in which people who did not attend meetings were provided copies of notes

from those meetings." Exh. 22 at [Eisenach32].<p>

<p>

 Input from these campaign consultants provided the steering mechanism for the

rest of GOPAC's activities. Jeffrey Eisenach, Eddie Mahe, Steve Hanser, Ed

Rollins, Joseph Gaylord and many others provided advice on national trends and

how to bring about a Republican majority in the House.<p>

<p>

 ii. Expenditures For Focus Groups.<p>

<p>

 GOPAC paid for research using focus groups around the country to test topics

and messimages to be used by Republican candidates, including congressional

candidates in the 1990 election. In 1989, GOPAC conducted eight focus groups in

four cities in an attempt to "validat[e] the proposition that education choice

was a potentially useful issue for Republican candidates. * * * Useful . . . in

the course of explaining a set of views and building a political platform."

Exh.22 at [Eisenach59]. GOPAC was "trying to divine national implications,

which is to say the ability to make statements about the issue which are

applicable in various regions of the country." Exh. 22 at [Eisenach61]. A

written "manual," Exh. 66 at [3849], and video tape excerpts, Exh. 21 at

[Riddle51-52,55], were distributed "very broadly, including to the press and

the national media so it was made available to the world." Exh. 22 at

[Eisenach62]. "It essentially was distributed to the general public, which

includes Federal officeholders." Exh. 22 at [Eisenach63].<p>

<p>

 Another GOPAC focus group project was the "most extensive focus group research

project conducted by the Republican Party in recent years," Exh. 66 at [3885,

3935], to determine what people who had become "self-disenfranchized from the

political process" -- "who had chosen not to register to vote or had registered

to vote but had failed to vote in two or three preceding elections" -- thought

and "what needed to be done to re-engage them in the political process." Exh.

19 at [Morgan128]. The purpose of the study was to "determin[e] ways to ensure

that young adults (who associate strongly with the GOP) are motivated to vote

for Republican candidates." Exh. 31 at [2784] (emphasis in original).

Specifically, the focus groups sought to identify "specific proposals of change

(our products)" and "specific examples of the obstacles to change from

left-wing values and the bureaucratic welfare state . . . (their anger points)"

which would motivate them to vote for the Republican Party, and " [h]ow can we

package all this?" Exh. 66 at [401]. "The goal [wa]s to find the six best

proposals, the six best critiques, and the best worked generic argument and

package for an American Opportunities Agenda." Id. This included tests of

specific slogans. Exh. 66 at [405]. Eighteen focus groups were conducted in

nine cities throughout the country. Exh. 66 at [3935]. "We literally tested

language and ideas that we believe[d] will help us better communicate with

voters and will help candidates articulate the values of Americans who are

neither Democrat nor Republican." Exh. 66 at [3792].<p>

<p>

 An "extensive" 200 page report was produced on GOPAC's national focus groups,

"including transcripts [and] verbatim quotations." Exh. 22 at [Eisenach81]. The

report "identified language and ideas that would motivate young people to

become active in the political process and encourage them to vote Republican."

Exh. 66 at [3885]. It was "widely disseminated to Republican Party and

Congressional leaders, as well as key cabinet officials." Exh. 31 at [2784],

Exh. 66 at [3930].<p>

<p>

 In fact, GOPAC's Finance Director wrote that "[t]he focus group project is a

difficult product to describe and/or defend. However, ] do think it is

important to remember that Newt has used that research in countless speeches

and we produced a series of training tapes for candidates using information

gleaned from those groups. * * * I am told that the next generation of tapes

and videos . . . also incorporate[s] this research." Exh. 66 at [3792]

(ellipses in original).<p>

<p>

 iii. Expenditures To Develop The "Agenda Worth Voting For".<p>

<p>

 As described above, GOPAC's consultants and research projects indicated that

there would be a campaign advantage if the Republican congressional candidates

all campaigned on the same basic issues that could be reinforced in the voters'

minds if the state legislative candidates echoed the same themes. Therefore, by

at least 1989, GOPAC began developing a " 100-day agenda" of campaign proposals

that would be used as the basis of congressional campaigns and enacted by a

Republican controlled House. Exh. 66 at [3578]. This agenda was later described

as "a series of sweeping legislative initiatives put forth as a gentleman's

agreement between the Republican Party and the American people regarding how

G.O.P. leaders propose to govern given the control of the House of

Representatives and Administration ...." Exh. 66 at [3502]. This "agenda" later

evolved into the "Contract With America." Fact 73.<p>

<p>

 "GOPAC believes that these reforms are desirable but that their adoption

depends on whether they can pass the test of American democracy -- i.e, whether

they can win the support of the electorate at the local, state and Federal

levels. Electoral support, in turn, depends on the ability to describe why

reform is needed, what general principles should be followed and why specific

proposals are desirable in a way that enlists support by average citizens,

activists, opinion leaders and, ultimately, elected officials. Furthermore,

GOPAC believes that the success of these particular ideas depends on whether

they can attract support from outside the current set of political

participants, i.e., whether they can be molded into an "agenda worth voting

for" that would attract current non-voters to the polls."<p>

<p>

 Exh. 66 at [393]. Of course, this "agenda" of legislative proposals was

selected based on their national appeal and usefulness for Republican

congressional candidates to be only enacted by a Congress controlled by

Republicans. The primary purpose for the development was to influence the

congressional races in 1990. It was refined. and used in the subsequent two

federal elections.<p>

<p>

 iv. Expenditures For A Satellite Broadcast Experiment.<p>

<p>

 GOPAC also experimented with disseminating its political message directly to a

national audience by interactive satellite television, testing its view "about

how powerful it would be to be able to put interactive grassroots political

training workshops on television accessible to anybody who could hook up to a

satellite . . ., how much bigger we could make the political movement in the

country and how many more citizens [we could] activate." Exh. 19 at

[Morgan117]. Thus, GOPAC produced the "American Opportunities Workshop," Exh.

19 at [Morgan117-118]; Exh. 21 at [Riddle57,130], a May l9, 1990 television

program broadcast by satellite from Newman, Georgia to 655 remote sites. Four

of the remote sites were fully interactive; they could both send and receive a

television signal. Altogether, more than 40,000 people participated at the host

and remote sites, and an estimated television audience of 250,000 watched the

broadcast. Exh. 66 at [3926]. GOPAC believed it was the "largest satellite

network ever put together." Exh. 66 at [3885]./10 In addition, the program was

broadcast to the general public on The Family Channel, "one of America's

largest cable networks," Exh. 66 at [3931], which was received in more than

half of the homes in America.<p>

<p>

 According to Congressman Gingrich, it "literally [was] an experiment to see if

we were at the state of the art where a nationwide delivery by downlink was

competitive with tapes as a way of communicating ideas and generating

interest." Exh. 23 at [Gingrich45]. "It was an unusual R&amp;D project." Exh.

22 at [Eisenach46]. Thus, as GOPAC Chairman Callaway described the workshop, it

was "in every way, consistent with all that GOPAC wishes to accomplish. The

workshop will be a method through which we will be able to reach more

candidates and incumbents than ever before and provide them with the same

winning messimages and themes that has [sic] proven successful for our present

farm team members." Exh. 66 at [465, 3787, 3797]. "Our May 19 project will go a

long way toward helping Republicans set an agenda and persuading Americans to

realign with us." Exh. 66 at [4561+462; 4574]. As GOPAC Finance Director

described it, " [w]e are launching the 'movement' a la Newt on May 19." Exh. 66

at [4633].<p>

<p>

 The program provided both national and local exposure for Gingrich, who

together with a professional broadcaster, was one of the two principal hosts.

Gingrich was selected because of "his role as chairman of GOPAC and as someone

who effectively portrays, arguably more effectively than any other national

leader, a set of ideas and issues that we were attempting to convey." Exh. 22

at [Eisenach75]. Of course, this was the same agenda that GOPAC's research

already had shown to be advantageous in Republican congressional campaigns.<p>

<p>

 c. GOPAC Video And Audio Tape Program.<p>

<p>

 During the 1989-90 election cycle, GOPAC mailed to potential federal and state

Republican candidates tape recordings of speeches by Newt Gingrich and other

national Republican leaders. Facts 125-151. The purpose of this tape program

was to provide campaign topics and messimages that all Republican candidates

should use in their campaigns. Facts 148-149. During 1989 GOPAC adopted a

formal "Mission Statement" reflecting its expanded objectives: "GOPAC's mission

for the 1990s is to create and disseminate the doctrine which defines a caring,

humanitarian reform Republican Party in such a way as to elect candidates,

capture the U.S. House of Representatives and become a governing majority at

every level of Government." Exh. 66 at [281-282; 3847]. Contemporaneous

documents describe as one of GOPAC's goals the creation and execution of

"fundamentally and essentially a COMMUNICATIONS PLAN." Exh. 66 at [3.583]

(emphasis in original). "Because we don't control the news media . . ., we must

create our own propaganda machine for the widespread distribution of broadcast,

print and computer communications to supply our activists and potential

followers with ideas, information and rhetoric." Exh. 66 at [3583]. As Gingrich

explained, "[t]he Republican Party must become the vehicle for this reform

movement. Training Republican activists in the new language and doctrine needed

as the vehicle for reform must be one of our highest priorities." Exh. 66 at

[383'3].<p>

<p>

 Since GOPAC believed that "[o]nly a national mobilization of popular will

[would] dislodge the Democratic machine in the House," GOPAC concluded that it

was essential to create a sense of public "rage by proving there is a corrupt

liberal welfare state sustained and protected by a selfish, entrenched

Democratic machine." Exh. 66 at [4021-22]. As part of this effort, during 1989

GOPAC distributed video +apes of a speech by Congressman Gingrich entitled

"Challenge to Reform." Exh. 66 at [3849]. This tape was "used in advance

activist seminars and incumbency seminars to help frame thinking on creating a

new doctrine for the 90s." Exh. 66 at [3849]. In addition, GOPAC initiated an

"intensive national direct mail effort . . . pushing the agenda of

congressional reform." Exh. 66 at [3850]. These letters accused incumbent

Democratic Representatives of abuse of power and corruption, and specifically

attacking the integrity of then-Speaker Wright. [Sic]<p>

<p>

 Accordingly, GOPAC mailed video and audio tapes to incumbent state

legislators, potential candidates who attended GOPAC seminars, and anyone else

who requested them to provide common campaign themes and messimages. Facts

138-147. This included the American Campaign Academy, a separate training

organization whose sole source of funding was the National Congressional

Campaign Trust, an affiliate of the NRCC. Facts 128. GOPAC also mailed audio

tapes "on a more or less monthly basis . . ., typically less" to everyone in

GOPAC's database, between 5,000 and 10,000 people at various times. Exh. 22 at

[Eisenach99]. During 1989, GOPAC mailed more than 45,000 copies of nine new

cassette tapes. Exh. 66 at [3848]. During 1990 GOPAC mailed 36,000 copies of

six new audio tapes to legislators, candidates, activists and others. Exh. 31

at [2031, 2784],1 Exh. 66 at [3885 3905-3906, 3919]. GOPAC's Political Director

Thomas Morgan testified it was likely there were federal candidates on GOPAC's

mailing list. Exh. 19 at [Morgan162-163]. In addition, copies of audio tapes

were routinely mailed to all members of the RNC, and both the chairman and

executive director of each Republican state party. Facts 143.<p>

<p>

 GOPAC's tapes provided candidates and activists with a "replacement language

with which we will be able to more accurately describe our optimistic and

hopeful outlook of the future." Exh. 31 at [2030]. By providing common campaign

themes from the "Agenda Worth Voting For" (based on advice from GOPAC's

consultants and its own research and development) to Republican candidates,

GOPAC's tape programs created a unified "national agenda"; they "got

Republicans . . . talking the same language nationwide." Exh. 19 at [Morgan76;

4802]. Many of these tapes were of Gingrich's speeches espousing the campaign

themes from the "Agenda Worth Voting For." For example, "[i]f everyone in

Alabama was using the same kind of language and talking at the same level and

developing the same kind of concepts for governing, then that strengthened the

whole Republican effort across the board and therefore created a synergistic

output that helped our candidates." Id.<p>

<p>

 Because the training and tapes were so effective, no other coordination with

candidates was necessary. Exh. 21 at [Riddle47]. "Imagine thousands of

Republican candidates and activists driving to work, to meetings, to campaign

events, even on vacation, all listening to the most recent audio tape from

GOPAC -- all of these people getting a personal lesson in the latest message or

campaign technique from GOPAC." Exh. 66 at [3919]. As GOPAC stated in its 1989

annual report to its Charter Members, " [t]he impact of that broad

dissemination of message cannot be measured!" Exh. 66 at [3848].<p>

<p>

 d. GOPAC State Candidate Contributions and Training.<p>

<p>

 As described above, GOPAC spent approximately 15 percent of its expenditures

during the 1989-90 election cycle directly on state candidate cash

contributions and training. It did so as an enticement to state candidates to

use GOPAC's national campaign "agenda" in the hope that all Republican

candidates would proclaim the same message. This, in GOPAC's theory, would

increase the number of Republican state legislative and members of the United

States House of Representatives.<p>

<p>

 During 1989, "GOPAC began to include segments on creating an agenda worth

voting for." Exh. 66 at [385-6]. "Our training filled a gap in the way

Republicans trained candidates. * * * GOPAC training is now used as the

foundation for most national level Republican political seminars." . Exh. 66 at

[3856, 3857]. No steps were taken to limit attendance and GOPAC's political

director, who conducted many of the sessions, is "sure" that occasionally some

congressional candidates and/or some of their campaign managers attended. Exh.

19 at [Morgan52]. In addition, GOPAC's Political Director Tom Morgan became a

"regular teacher at the [NRCC's] American Campaign Academy[,] where the best

and brightest campaign managers are trained." Exh. 66 at [3857].<p>

<p>

 Even GOPAC's cash contributions to state candidates were part of GOPAC's goal

to elect a majority of the House. GOPAC targeted particular congressional

districts./11 During 1988, GOPAC had a "hard line rule" that it would only

contribute to legislative candidates who "live[d] in a district represented by

a Democrat in Congress." Exh. 66 at [3942]. Furthermore, during 1990 one of the

written criteria GOPAC used to determine where it could "have an impact on

elections," and thus where it should "target" its efforts, was whether there

was "an important governor's race or a key U.S. Senate campaign." Exh. 66 at

[3947-3948]. For example, during 1989 GOPAC had solicited contributions for a

Detroit city council candidate, in part to influence the upcoming U.S. Senate

election in Michigan: "But the stakes are bigger than just the city of Detroit.

There is the whole of Michigan, with a U.S. Senate election up this year. We

win statewide when we get at least 23% in Wayne County. We lose the state when

we get our usual ].9% in Wayne County. As a City Councilor, Dr. Butler will

have a forum to help get at least the 23% we need to win the Senate race. * * *

I need your help. We are asking that our Charter Members take this extra chance

to make a difference  that will affect the entire national agenda." Exh. 66 at

[3785-3786]. GOPAC Charter Members subsequently forwarded $17,000 in

contributions to the Butler Campaign. Exh. 66 at [4414, 4559]. In another

example, GOPAC's political director wrote "there is a US Senate race [in

Montana] that could benefit from significant legislative activity," Exh. 66 at

[3945], see also Exh. 66 at [3898], and in Texas there is a "[s]trong Governor

race and Gramm is up," Exh. 66 at [3946], apparently a reference to Republican

United States Senator Phil Gramm who was a candidate for re-election that year.

Another document states that GOPAC targeted "three legislative seats in this

area to help create ground swell" for 1990 Texas congressional candidate Dick

Waterfield. Exh. 66 at [5519].<p>

<p>

e. Recruiting Congressional Candidates<p>

<p>

 During 1989, GOPAC also began searching for and recruiting Republican

candidates for Congress. GOPAC mailed a questionnaire, Exh. 66 at [5869-5870],

to every Republican state legislator in America soliciting "demographic

:information," including the recipient's congressional district and the name

and party affiliation of the incumbent Representative and asking: "While we

know that the political winds often change the best laid plans, at this time

would you consider a campaign for Congress in your future? * * * If no, is

there any particular reason." Exh. 66 at [5688; 5870]. By June 1990 Gingrich

was already discussing "recruiting 300 serious candidates" who could be

competitive within a year. Exh. 66 at [4004]. At least thirty-four of the

identified potential candidates actually ran for Congress in 1990 or 1992.<p>

<p>

 In 1990, nine new members of Congress had "receiv[ed] training, tapes and/or

cash, some beginning as far back as 1982" from GOPAC. Exh. 66 at [3885]. In

addition, Congressman Gingrich was re-elected to the House of Representatives

from Georgia's 6th congressional district, winning by only 974 votes. In 1992

"41 of the 48 freshmen Republican members of the House were GOPAC 'alumni' --

they'd either participated in our live training sessions, received our direct

financial support or used our audio and video training tapes." Exh. 57. In

addition, both Congressman Gingrich and other incumbent Republican

Representatives who were active in GOPAC, such as Joe Barton, were re-elected.

Although Republicans gained ten congressional seats in 1992, they failed to

capture control of the U.S. House of Representatives. In the November 9, 1994

general election, 75 non-incumbent Republican candidates were elected to

Congress, thereby obtaining control of the U.S. House of Representatives for

the first time since 1954. Twenty-five (or one-third) of the 75 freshman

Republican members of Congress were GOPAC farm team members. Exh. 58. <p>

<p>

2. GOPAC's Public Statements Influenced Federal Elections.<p>

<p>

 GOPAC's "Campaign For Fair Elections" letter, described extensively above, was

typical of most of its other mass mailings. GOPAC sent "almost one letter a

month." Exh. 21 at [Riddle33, 68]. Each letter contained a "bogeyman," some

issue or threat that was in the national news at the time. One of the recurring

themes was the alleged corruption of the Democratic majorities in Congress.

Exh. 21 at [Riddle37]. "[F]or instance, when [Congressman Gingrich] was

investigating [then-Speaker] Jim Wright, we used Jim Wright. During the years

when we were preparing for the redistricting of congressional districts, we

used redistricting. It just depended what was the issue that we thought would

be of interest to our people." Exh. 21 at [Riddle27]. GOPAC used national

mailing lists, and focused only on national political issues. Exh. 21 at

[Riddle33, 36, 37].<p>

<p>

 The letters contained the same basic message: defeat the Democratic incumbent

Representatives and elect a Republican Majority, and contribute to GOPAC to

help GOPAC continue its efforts to elect a majority in the House. During 1990,

one of GOPAC's direct mail letters asked GOPAC contributors to "make a personal

commitment right now to take advantage of our once-in-a-decade chance to

translate our party's Presidential majority to the Congressional and state

legislative level this November." Exh. 31 at [2792] (emphasis in original).

That letter, inter alia, described GOPAC's activities as "laying the groundwork

for a new generation of GOP Congressmen and Senators, men and women who can

communicate our Party's message to the voters and work effectively in

Washington to put that message into action." Exh. 31 at [2793] (emphasis in

original).    <p>

<p>

 In 1989, GOPAC also began using telemarketing as a follow-up to its direct

mail efforts. Exh. 66 at [2926]. This telemarketing was designed to increase

its receipts, "to disseminate information about its programs and purpose, and

to obtain valuable information about various segments of its constituency."

Exh. 66 at [29:26]. GOPAC's telemarketers reiterated the themes reflected in

GOPAC's direct mail solicitation letters, including GOPAC's assertion that "the

only way we'll ever restore honesty to Congress is to end the Democrats' 33

year control of the House of Representatives," id. at [2919], and discussed

GOPAC's plans to "groom candidates for the national level," including providing

"in-depth issue reviews and seminars for candidates and incumbents." Id. at

[2923]. Follow-up correspondence specifically stated that contributions to

GOPAC would "allow us to help more Reagan-republican candidates at both the

state and national level." Id. at [2916].<p>

<p>

 Taken alone, these communications are admissions that GOPAC's purpose was the

election of the particular Republican candidates who would be running for the

United States House of Representatives in 1990. <p>

<p>

 3. GOPAC Advocated the Election Or Defeat Of Particular Federal Candidates.

<p>

<p>

 In addition to the campaign appeals to elect the particular Republican

congressional candidates, GOPAC's mass mailings during 1989 and 1990 also

advocated the election or defeat of particular individual candidates for

federal office. This further demonstrates that GOPAC's major purpose was

influencing the election of federal candidates. <p>

<p>

a. Vice President George Bush  <p>

<p>

For example, an August 12, 1988 GOPAC direct mail letter advocated the election

of Republican presidential candidate George Bush, asking the recipient: "will

you sign the personal message of support to Vice President Bush that I've

enclosed with my letter?" Exh. 28 at [2686]. <p>

<p>

 "As he begins his general election campaign against the liberal/ Democratic

Party coalition headed by Michael Dukakis, I know that the Vice President would

deeply appreciate knowing of your personal support and commitment.<p>

<p>

 More than any polls he may see, it's important for him to learn directly from

individuals like you, the mainstays of our Party, that he can count on your

vote and support in the months ahead." <p>

<p>

The enclosed note the recipient was to sign stated, in relevant part: <p>

<p>

"I want you to know that as you accept our Party's Presidential nomination and

prepare to lead our Party against Michael Dukakis and the liberal/Democratic

coalition, you have my full support. You can count on my vote [on] Election Day

and my commitment to help you carry forward the Reagan agenda into the

1990s."<p>

<p>

Exh. 29 at [2689]. The accompanying reply form, which was to be returned to

GOPAC, contained similar language: "I have signed and enclosed my message of

support to Vice President Bush. He can count on my support and my vote this

November." Exh. 28 at [2690]. This correspondence predated the June 1989

mailing which was the subject matter of the Commission's complaint in this

litigation. <p>

<p>

b. Congressman Jim Wright  <p>

<p>

Various GOPAC letters singled out then-Speaker Wright, who was a candidate for

re-election in 1988 and 1990. For instance. in a December 1987 letter GOPAC

wrote: <p>

<p>

 "We put tremendous pressure on the Democratic leadership of the House to

crack-down on the unprecedented corruption among Democratic congressmen.  The

fact is the Democrats aren't used to the public spotlight being put on them. I

promise you that in the months ahead, we will continue to expose the sleazy

behavior of House Democrats. including Speaker Wright, as part of our campaign

to elect a Republican House majority and clean up Congress." <p>

<p>

Exh. 28 at [2600] (emphasis in original).<p>

<p>

 GOPAC's "Campaign for Fair Elections" mailings described the then-pending

allegations against Speaker Wright and other Democratic congressmen, stating

"[w]orst of all, they've entrenched themselves into a permanent majority in

Congress. It's now practically impossible to defeat a sitting member of

Congress." Exh. 30 at [1729, 2709, 2720], see id. at [2735]. <p>

<p>

c. Congressman Gingrich<p>

<p>

 The minutes from a June 1989 GOPAC "long-range planning" meeting stated that

"Newt must be re-elected" to Congress. Exh. 66 at [4007]. During, at least 1989

and 1990. GOPAC routinely and continuously provided what was described as "Newt

support" Exh. 66 at [288 :3993]; Exh. 36 at 46, expenditures for projects

"especially for Newt." Exh. 66 at [288]. For instance. GOPAC paid political

consultants, including Jeff Eisenach, Joe Gaylord, Eddie Mahe and Steve Hanser,

to advise Congressman Gingrich. "to help Newt think." Exh. 33 at 43; Exh. 36 at

49-50. Indeed, "help[ing] Newt" was described as "probably the most single high

priority we've got in dollars ...." Exh. 33 at 43.<p>

<p>

 By August 1990 Jeff Eisenach was spending approximately one-half to two-thirds

of his time on "Newt support" projects. Exh. 36 at 46-47. Not only did GOPAC

pay the salaries to provide these and other services -- between $80,000 to

$96,000 per year for Eisenach alone, Exh. 36 at 47 -- but GOPAC also paid their

travel expenses: "If Newt decides he's got a Saturday free in Georgia. he wants

people a[r]ound him. And GOPAC pays those bills. I mean we pay for them to fly

down there. We pay for them to stay at the Buckhead Ritz Carlton." Exh. 36 at

50. Expenditures for "Newt support" were estimated to exceed $250,000 in 1990.

Exh. 36 at 90. <p>

<p>

 At the 1990 North Pole Basin meeting there was a discussion of spending

priorities, including whether and how much to spend on "Newt support." One

Charter Member expressed the following concern: I'm not sure what kind of

support we should be giving Newt. I agree  with the support, but I mean Jeff

Eisenach is a political consultant. * * * [A]t least in theory [Bill] Rosing [a

prior GOPAC consultant] was guiding the future politics of GOPAC. I don't sense

that that's true of Jeff Eisenach." Exh. 36 at 47. <p>

<p>

 However, most participants at this and other GOPAC meetings, concluded that it

was very  important to provide these consulting services:  <p><blockquote>

<p>

"MALE VOICE: Newt needs interplay, Newt needs to talk with all of us, Newt

needs people like Jeff [Eisenach] here, and Lutzback and Steve [Hanser] and

others. GOPAC is able to provide all of that to Newt. It's able to provide it

in a way that most of you understand. So we're able to provide that to Newt and

that's happened." </blockquote>Exh. 33 at 42.  <p>

<p>

One participant provided a specific example.  <p> <blockquote>

<p>

"FEMALE VOICE: But he seems to need that. I mean . . . the other morning when

they invaded Kuwait, he walked in the building. He found out on the way in the

building for a 7 o'clock meeting. He had me place a call to Steve Handser [sic]

right away. He talked to Steve Handser before he got on the phone with the

White House and the national security people. <p>

<p>

 He needs that . . . "  <p>

<p>

"FEMALE VOICE: Well, and I absolutely agree that he needs it. Because I have

always said -- (inaudible) -- political candidates don't do anything until you

talk to somebody else about it. Because you can get blind-sided -- (inaudible).

You can get blind-sided and do something that has a consequence that you hadn't

thought of." <p>

<p>

                   * * *  <p>

<p>

"FEMALE VOICE: So I think he -- there's no question he needs his people out

there. (inaudible)" </blockquote>

<p>

Exh. 36 at 49. Thus, during, at least. 1989 and 1990, GOPAC funded consultants

to support Congressman Gingrich. <p>

<p>

 The notes of a June 1989 meeting, the notes reflect a discussion of actions to

be taken "to inoculate Newt Gingrich from Democrat attacks." Exh. 66 at 4023.

These included "[p]roduction of a 30 minute video tape using excerpts from the

RNC speech, the Firing Line debate and the National Press Club speech, etc. to

get Newt's message into the mainstream" and "[w]ide distribution by GOPAC of

[Congressman Gingrich's] National Press Club speech on audio tape." Exh. 66 at

[4023]; see also Exh. 31 at [2033]; Exh. 66 at [3849, 3851].   <p>

<p>

 GOPAC's desire to support Gingrich also was an explicit factor in its deciding

how to allot its resources during 1990. GOPAC Political Director Tom Morgan's

June 1990 memorandum discussed the "reverse coat tails" effect of state

candidates on federal elections and recommended Georgia as one of the states to

target in 1990. Exh. 66 at 3948. The recommendation referred to Congressman

Gingrich, stating "[o]bviously, GOPAC has a deep interest in Georgia, but it

goes beyond Newt." Exh, 66 at [394S]. GOPAC's 1990 Report to its Charter

Members confirms that GOPAC targeted Georgia during that election cycle in part

"to protect Congressman Newt Gingrich" during redistricting. Exh. 66 at [3896].

GOPAC recruited Georgia legislative candidates and conducted live and video

training seminars there. Exh. 66 at [3896] In fact. according to the l 990

Report, GOPAC conducted seven candidate training sessions in Georgia during

1990, more than in any other state. Exh. 66 at [3905] As the election

approached, GOPAC "targeted 2 House seats and 6 Senate races for special

assistance" and hired . . .  as Southern Field coordinator to help candidates

in Georgia and Tennessee. Exh. 66 at [3896]. GOPAC also contributed to the

Republican candidates in the "targeted" districts. Exh. 66 at [2010-2013;

3986]. Apparently, these were the first contributions GOPAC "ever made to

candidates in Georgia." Exh. 66 a+ [2009].<p>

<p>

 GOPAC also encouraged Charter Members to support incumbent Republicans

financially by contributing to the~ National Republican Congressional Committee

and to individual congressional campaigns. Gingrich testified he told Charter

Members "if they truly wanted to have a Republican majority, they both had to

give FEC money to the NRCC and to FEC campaigns to keep the current team ...."

Exh. 23 at [Gingrich64]. "I would say routinely to successful people, you

should be meeting your Federal Election Commission limit in campaigns you

believe in that are Federal." Exh. 23 at [Gingrich64]. These requests for

contributions apparently were successful, particularly for Gingrich. According

to the campaign finance reports  filed with the Commission, of the $539,328

that GOPAC Charter Members identified by the Commission contributed to all

candidates for the U.S. House of Representatives during 1989- 1990, $124,503

(or 23%) was contributed to Congressman Gingrich's own authorized principal

campaign committee. Exh.10 /12 <p>

<p>

 In sum, GOPAC's activities were not only devoted primarily to its overarching

goal of capturing control of the United States House of Representatives, but

also focused on the election or defeat of specific federal candidates. Thus,

even under the strictest construction of the Act, GOPAC was a federal political

committee.<p>

<p>

 <a name=five><h2>V. CONCLUSION</h2></a><p>

<p>

 GOPAC's activities fall within the historic area of federal partisan electoral

expenditures and solicitations of contributions that Congress sought to

encompass in the Act's definition of political committee. These activities

demonstrate that GOPAC's major purpose was to influence the election of the

members of the United States House of Representatives. Thus, GOPAC is far from

the boundary the Supreme Court drew around issue-advocacy organizations to

prevent the Act from chilling their discussion of issues. Moreover, if this

Court defers to the Commission's construction of the Act's definition of

"political committee" as it should, then there is no need to scrutinize the

purpose of each of GOPAC's activities. As the Commission has consistently

found, once a partisan group, like GOPAC, expends or accepts more that $1,000

to influence the election of a class of federal candidates+ as occurred in the

"Campaign For Fair Elections" letters, the group was required to register and

file reports as a federal political committee. Accordingly, the Federal

93-1438, 93d Cong., 2d Sess. at 83, reprinted +n FEC, Legislative Historv of

the Federal Election Campaign Act Amendments of 1974 at 1027 (Every '

orgcmization which expends any funds or commits any act directed to the public

for the purpose of influencing the outcome of an election, or which publishes

or broadcasts to the public material intended to influence public opinion with

respect to candidates for Federal office [is required] to register with the

Commission as a political committee and report the source and amount oi its

funds and of its expenditures. Since these organizations use their resources

for political purposes, often having a direct and substantial effect on the

outcome of Federal elections, it would be inappropriate to permit these

organizations to conceal the interests they represent solely because the

organizations are able to avoid reporting and disclosure under the technical

deimitions of political committee, contribution, and expenditure").<p>

<p>

 4 The Commission has promulgated regulations permitting federal political

committees to establish a federal account and a non-federal account. Committees

who comply with the regulation are required to report only the activity in the

federal account. 11 C.F.R. 106.5 and 106.6. GOPAC currently only reports 10% of

its expenditures as allocated to its federal account. Exh. 7 at 117.<p>

<p>

 5 Potential Charter Members were recruited with a brochure promising that

"[a]s a Charter Member, you will have unique opportunities to plav an active

role in shaping the political debate for the future." Exh. 66 at [5726]

(emphasis oriiginal). The brochure then describes opportunities for meetings

with the President, the White House staff and the Republican leadership in

Congress. This theme was repeated in personal recruiting letters. See, e.g.,

Exh. 66 at [4448] ("these meetings present a rare opportunity to meet and

discuss with top political figures and strategists the current issues on the

national agenda"); Exh. 66 at [4578, 4609] ("give you a chance to make

recommendations to Newt"); Exh. 66 at [4597, 4616, 4655] ("One of the things

that makes GOPAC so unique is the opportunity for our Charter members to work

with Newt Gingrich and to influence his issues and direction"). Congressman

Gingrich would routinely issue an open invitation to Charter Members to walk

with him in the morning for an "hour of uninterrupted conversation." Exh. 66 at

[4642, 4299, 4263]. Occasionally, a Charter Member appears to have written a

letter requesting assistance while enclosing a check for Charter membership.

See, e.g., Exh. 66 at [4854-56, 58] (effect of asbestos regulations on a

Charter Member's company); Exh. 66 at [4807] (international trade dumping

litigation involving a Charter member's company).<p>

<p>

 6 See, e.g., Exh. 48 "In an Aug. 19 letter to Gingrich, some 125 House

Democrats called on Gingrich to open GOPAC's books." [Roll Call 9/l5/94]; Exh.

50 "The Speaker's Secret Money" "Federal law requires complete disclosure by

groups like GOPAC [sic] that aid Federal candidates, without fine

distinctions." [NY Times editorial 4/25/95.]<p>

<p>

 7 These Commissioners observed that "Advisory Opinion 1988-22 upholds a

long-standing Commission approach: the purpose and functions of an organization

are material and relevant to the Commission's characterization of the

underlying plurpose of a specific activity or program of that entity. . . This

approach is consistent with lthe Supreme Court's decision in [MCFL], where the

Court indicated that if a major purpose of an orgarlization may be regarded as

campaign activity, the organization would be subject to the oblig+ations and

restrictions of a political committee.... Therefore, Republican Associates'

status as a "political organization" for Federal income tax purposes under 26

U.S.C. 527(e'l, as well as its explicit corporate purpose to "elect more

Republicans to office," support the inference that its proposed activities are

for the purposes of influencing the 1988 elections. Exh. 46 AO 1982-22, Fed.

are contributions under the Act even before the Party has selected its

By Benjamin Wittes<br><i>

Legal Times</i><br>

February 26, 1996<p>





Talk about a Southern strategy.<p>



As Patrick Buchanan heads south following his triumph in the New Hampshire

primary last week, his association with a pro-Confederacy journal puts the

Republican presidential contender in league with those who favor the ultimate

Southern strategy: secession.<p>







Buchanan is a "senior advisor" to <i>Southern Partisan</I>, a glossy magazine

with a

circulation of 15,000 that decries the Civil War as the "War of Northern

Aggression," flirts with seceding as an option for the modern South, and has

even defended the ethics of slavery in its pages.<p>



In <i>Southern Partisan</I>, Abraham Lincoln is "a consummate conniver,

manipulator,

and liar"; the South is still the "C.S.A." (Confederate States of America);

blacks are still "Negroes"; Union forces are the "Yankee invaders"; and the

editors are candid about their dissatisfaction with the outcome of the "Late

Unpleasantness."<p>



The Buchanan campaign is proud of the candidate's ties to the publication.<p>



"Mr. Buchanan, who has been a subscriber and reader of the <i>Southern

Partisan</I>

for a number of years, considers it a high compliment to have been asked to

serve as an honorary advisor to the magazine," campaign manager Terry Jeffrey

said in a prepared statement.<p>



Campaign officials, however, did not address a list of more detailed

questions about the candidate's involvement with <i>Southern Partisan</I> and

about

whether he agrees with the publication's positions.<p>



The journal's editors say Buchanan does not play a role in determining the

magazine's content, though they carried his syndicated column until he

stopped writing it to enter the presidential fray. Buchanan has been on the

masthead since at least 1990, they say, and his name appears on the most

recent issue, dated "Fourth Quarter 1995."<p>



FRIEND OF 'FRINGE OF FRINGE'<br>

Further, the editors boast that Buchanan has described <i>Southern Partisan</I>

as

his favorite magazine, and say they appreciate the prestige his formal

association lends them.<p>



"It hasn't been a very close, regular relationship," says Oran Smith, editor

of <i>Southern Partisan</I>. "But we know he's there and he's our friend, and

he

knows we're there."<p>



The mere fact that Buchanan has lent his name to a publication described by

its own editor as "the fringe of the fringe" disturbs the magazine's critics,

who see its stridently pro-Confederate tone as disloyal to the country

Buchanan seeks to lead. Moreover, for many blacks, nostalgia for the Old

South is tantamount to an endorsement of, or at least nostalgia for, racism.<p>



"If you take them at their word, it is a deep challenge to the way the U.S.

is organized right now. It suggests the illegitimacy of the outcome of the

Civil War," says Edward Ayers, a professor of history at the University of

Virginia. "There's a schizophrenia underneath it; these people would consider

themselves simultaneously loyal Americans and at the same time loyal

Confederates."<p>



Buchanan's association with <i>Southern Partisan</I> could prove dicey for the

candidate, whose links to extremist groups have already garnered renewed

attention in the wake of his recent electoral successes. The week before the

New Hampshire primary, Buchanan took heat for his ties to Larry Pratt, who

served as his campaign co-chairman and also heads the Gun Owners of America.

Pratt, who has spoken before white supremacist and militia groups, took a

leave of absence from the campaign. Buchanan stood by his old friend.  <p>



Buchanan has also courted controversy with inflammatory remarks about

immigrants, gays, and accused Nazi war criminals.<p>



For his part, Buchanan seems unworried by what such connections could mean

for his candidacy. Pressed about such ties recently, Buchanan said, "I've got

better golden oldies in my own files that you guys haven't found," according

to <i>Newsweek</i> magazine.<p>



(CONFEDERATE) FLAG WAVERS<br>

The editors of <i>Southern Partisan</I> bristle at the suggestion that they are

disloyal to America or that they are racist. They say the magazine is simply

devoted to celebrating Southern culture.<p>



From a review of the last six issues, the magazine emerges as a combination

of extremely conservative Republican politics and an aggressive defense of

the historical stance of the South in the Civil War era. It actively defends

the flying of the Confederate battle flag, and it runs glowing profiles of

Southern leaders.<p>



"We're serious about being Southerners, but our tongue is very often in our

cheek," says Richard Quinn, the journal's editor in chief. "We're serious

about the historical view that the South historically was motivated by a

belief that they were on the side of constitutional government, and that they

were defending the principles of the original American republic."<p>



Smith, the editor, agrees. Buchanan "identifies with us because of our

willingness to promote a positive image of the South and particularly of some

of the men who died fighting for the South," Smith says. "Pat is very likely

to write columns defending Southern heritage and the brave boys at Gettysburg

charging the Union soldiers."<p>



But the magazine's editorial flavor goes considerably beyond a healthy

respect for the Old South. The masthead notes that the journal is "Printed in

C.S.A." and a column summarizing goings-on around the South is called "C.S.A.

Today." The Washington column is called "From Behind Enemy Lines."<p>



And the publication not only glorifies the South's past, it seems to yearn

for a glorious future when the Confederacy's heroes, not the Union's, will be

honored.<p>



"[W]e must always remember, we must Never Forget, we must put in the dock and

hang higher than Haman, these who in modern times opened the Pandora's Box of

genocide and the extermination of civilians: Sherman, Grant, and Lincoln,"

wrote the late Murray Rothbard, academic vice president at the Ludwig von

Mises Institute, in a column printed last year.<p>



"Perhaps some day, their statues, like Lenin's in Russia, will be toppled and

melted down; their insignias and battle flags will be desecrated, and their

war songs tossed into the fire," continued Rothbard. "And then Davis and Lee

and Jackson and Forrest, and all the heroes of the South, 'Dixie' and the

Stars and Bars, will once again be truly honored and remembered."<p>



The zeal with which <i>Southern Partisan</I> defends the institutions of the

Confederacy sometimes leads into territory that is racially explosive. <p>



ANTI-RACIST?<br>

Quinn and Smith both say that the publication is anti-racist, and Southern

Partisan does, indeed, denounce the Ku Klux Klan and go out of its way to

praise black conservatives. <p>



But <i>Southern Partisan</I> also ran without apparent irony a column by Samuel

Francis in which the writer seems to defend the consistency of slavery with

Christian ethics. (According to Francis, this column got him demoted and

later fired from the conservative <i>Washington Times</i>.)<p>



"Neither Jesus nor the apostles nor the early church condemned slavery,

despite countless opportunities to do so, and there is no indication that

slavery is contrary to Christian ethics or that any serious theologian before

modern times ever thought that it was," Francis, who is a friend of

Buchanan's, wrote in the column. "[M]ainstream churches now spend more time

preaching against apartheid and colonialism than they do against real sins

like pinching secretaries and pilfering from the office coffee pool."<p>



In another Francis article published in <i>Southern Partisan</I>, the columnist

opposed the proposed Arthur Ashe memorial in Richmond, Va., in stark racial

terms -- arguing that the battle over the statue is nothing less than a

forerunner of a second civil war:<p>



"Unlike the nation's first civil war, which mainly concerned whether states

or the embryonic federal leviathan should rule the country, the second civil

war is about which race -- and which race's myths -- will prevail in the

future."<p>



Even some conservative African-Americans are uncomfortable with the racial

overtones of the magazine.<p>



"We celebrate the founding in the late 18th century, in terms of making a

real break -- self-government, limited government, etc. And that was flawed;

it was born in original sin, and that was slavery and was historically dealt

with in the Civil War," says Glenn Loury, a professor at Boston University.

"To argue at the end of the 20th century about the legitimacy of that outcome

is poisonous stuff. . . . People have the right to say whatever they want,

but there are problems with the articulation of that view and the association

with that view by presidential candidates."<p>



SECESSIONIST FLAVOR<br>

Add to this the flirtation with modern secessionists, and <i>Southern

Partisan</I>

seems  a strange affiliation for a candidate for the presidency of the United

States. The magazine publishes advertisements from avowedly secessionist

groups like the Southern League. "Southern Independence: If you would like to

help make it a reality, join The Southern League," says an ad in a recent

issue. <p>



<i>Southern Partisan</I> also published an extensive interview with the

Southern

League's leader, Michael Hill, a history professor at Stillman College in

Tuscaloosa, Ala. <p>



Quinn, who is also a political consultant  to conservative South Carolina

politicians and says he supported Sen. Phil Gramm for the Republican

presidential nomination, describes the extremist anti-North rhetoric in the

magazine as mainly sardonic. And Associate Editor Gordon Jackson, who writes

the "From Behind Enemy Lines" column, says the enemy is not the North per se,

but "big government, imperialist Washington."<p>



But Smith, while stating that the magazine is not secessionist, acknowledges

that the magazine's attitude towards secession is complicated.<p>



"We really struggle with that one here, particularly after the Southern

League raised it. After that, we could discuss it with a straight face," says

Smith. "We don't take a position on whether secession is good or bad or

possible in the modern era.<p>



"Some of our editors probably get a little heartburn over the Southern

League, but others think it's the greatest thing that's come around in a long

time because they are doing some serious study of the American South," Smith

adds.<p>



To what extent does Buchanan share the more radical proclivities of Southern

Partisan? Few believe he actually favors Southern secession in the modern

era. Quinn, for example, describes Buchanan as a "nationalist."<p>



At the same time, however, Buchanan's own writings do often dovetail with

some of the magazine's main themes, and he is often accused of being cozy

with fringe political elements.<p>



In a 1993 syndicated column, Buchanan described the Civil War as "a war

launched to prevent the South from exercising the same right the 13 colonies

exercised in 1776 . . ."<p>



"[T]he War Between the States was about independence, about

self-determination, about the right of a people to break free of a government

to which they could no longer give allegiance," Buchanan wrote.<p>



Buchanan, who <i>The Washington Times</i> has reported is a member of the Sons

of

Confederate Veterans, has also vociferously supported the flying of the

Confederate flag.<p>



"To me, the Confederate flag represents valor, honor, courage and the

willingness to die for your country," the paper quoted him as saying last

March.<p>



Four years ago, according to <i>The Washington Post</i>, Buchanan laid flowers

at

the grave of a Mississippi ancestor. Buchanan then boasted that his forebears

were "rabid secessionists."<p>



LOYALTY ISSUES<br>

While <i>Southern Partisan</I>'s editors see no contradiction between being

loyal

Americans and loyal Confederates, the University of Virginia's Ayers says

their retroactive justification of Confederate secession is reckless in the

context of modern politics.<p>



"They want to talk about states' rights, as they imagine their Confederate

forebears did. . . . They want to shift the locus of power from Washington to

the states. On the other hand, when you pass over to Southern nationalism,

you are passing over the legitimacy of American nationalism.<p>



"If you're talking about Southern nationalism, you can only be talking about

dissolution of the union," Ayers continues. "They enjoy playing with the

sharp blade of the Confederacy, but they don't want to consider how deeply it

can cut."<p>



Eric Foner, a Civil War historian at Columbia University, adds that the

neo-Confederates of <i>Southern Partisan</I> are out of touch with the true

power

the South wields in America.<p>



"The president of the United States is a Southerner; the Speaker of the House

is a Southerner; the majority leader of the House is a Southerner," says

Foner. "I think we in the North might think about seceding, given the way the

Southerners have been oppressing us recently."<p>



Buchanan's link to <i>Southern Partisan</I> won't allay any anxiety about

Buchanan

within the Jewish community, either. <p>



Listed alongside Buchanan as senior advisor to the magazine is an archivist

with the North Carolina state government named Boyd Cathey. Cathey is also

listed as a member of the editorial advisory committee of <i>The Journal of

Historical Review</i> -- a publication that serves as a forum for Holocaust

denial.<p>



Cathey says he resigned from that committee in 1992 and does not know why he

is still listed; Smith, the <i>Southern Partisan</I> editor, says he was

unaware of

Cathey's affiliation with the group.<p>



Buchanan's ties to extremists trouble Rabbi Abraham Cooper, associate dean of

the Simon Wiesenthal Center, a Los Angeles-based group that monitors

antisemitism.<p>



Buchanan "can't fudge it any more, because he's in the big leagues now," says

Cooper. "He's got to make a decision. He's either got to say 'no more,' or

he's got to continue to say there's nothing wrong with the people that Larry

Pratt hung out with and there's nothing wrong with a journal that rewrites

the past and harkens back to the 'good old days' of Dixie."<p>

 Judge Stuart Ain has denied Prodigy a rehearing on

the

issue of whether or not they may be regarded as a publisher for the purposes of

a libel suit. The case, involving

disparaging remarks made on one of Prodigy's online discussion areas, was

settled according to the litigants some

weeks ago, but, as the Judge says in his decision, "the Court finds that this

is a developing area of the law (in

which it appears that the law has thus far not kept pace with the technology)

so that there is a real need for some

precedent.  To simply vacate that precedent on request because these two

parties (or this Plaintiff) has lost

interest or decided that the litigation would be too costly or time consuming

would remove the only existing New York

precedent in this area leaving the law even further behind the technology."<P>

The following papers read on this motion:<UL><BR> Notice of Motion <BR> Memo of

Law in Support <BR> Amicus Memo -

Authors Guild, Inc. <BR> Affidavit of Plaintiff's Counsel <BR> Replay Affidavit

</UL>

<P>

Upon the foregoing papers, it is ordered that this motion by Defendant, for an

order granting renewal and/or

reargument of the  Plaintiff's motion for partial summary judgment is disposed

of as hereinafter provided. 

<P>

By order dated May 24, 1995, this Court determined, inter alia,  that the

Defendant PRODIGY SERVICES COMPANY

("PRODIGY"), was a  "publisher" of certain statements concerning Plaintiffs

which  appeared on its "Money Talk"

computer bulletin board for the  purposes of Plaintiffs' libel claims in this

action. 

<P>

It will suffice, to note that the Court's decision has received  wide

attention.  Obviously, recent advances in

computer  technology have caused what some commentators have called  "explosive

growth" in the Internet and its

usage.  What was once  a tool used only by a handful of researchers and

scientists has  become a means of

entertainment, education and business which is  used by millions of people on a

daily basis. 

<P>

As a result, and largely because there is very little legal precedent directly

on point, the Court's decision of May

24,  1995, has been highly publicized in the media and in legal  circles. 

Presumably, the reason for this attention

is that the  decision offers some guidance for the "cyber-content provider [in

determining] what its responsibilities

and/or liabilities  are...(Lieberstein and Landa, Content Provider Liability: 

Publishers or Vendors?), <I>State Bar

News,</I> Vol. 37, No. 6, p.11). 

<P>

Against this background, PRODIGY moves for reargument and/or renewal of the

motion and the Plaintiffs have decided

not to oppose the motion (Affidavit of Jacob Zamansky, sworn to October 23,

1995).  Indeed, there have been media

reports that the parties have decided to "settle" this case. Those reports are,

to the best of the Court's knowledge,

inaccurate as PRODIGY has thus far insisted that any settlement be conditioned

upon vacatur of the Court's May 24,

1995 decision.  The Court has declined to vacate the order as part of a

settlement package.  As recently noted by the

Appellate Division, First Department: <blockquote>

<P>

"While we appreciate the desirability of settlement, we do not believe it would

be advisable to allow private parties

to demand that the Court eradicate precedent which they personally find

unacceptable on threat of burdensome

litigation should the Court refuse.  Moreover, we note the conclusion of the

Supreme Court that, to follow a policy

in which private parties could agree to vacate a decision and order by

agreement would not necessarily, as a general

matter, serve the purpose of encouraging settlement, as the prospect of being

able to eradicate a decision would it

be unfavorable could well encourage the parties to postpone settlement until

after a decision has been rendered

(<I>U.S. Bancorp Mortgage Co. v Bonner Mall Partnership</I> [    U.S.  , 115

S.Ct.386,393])" (<I>Paramount

Communications v Gibraltar Casualty Co.</I>, 212 AD2d 490, 490-491; 623 NYS2d

850). </blockquote>

<P>

This logic is persuasive in this case especially considering the lack of

guidance concerning, the "Internet" prior to

the Court's decision.  In other words, the Court finds that this is a

developing area of the law (in which it appears

that the law has thus far not kept pace with the technology) so that there is a

real need for some precedent.  To

simply vacate that precedent on request because these two parties (or this

Plaintiff) has lost interest or decided

that the litigation would be too costly or time consuming would remove the only

existing New York precedent in this

area leaving the law even further behind the technology. 

<P>

Turning then to the issue of renewal or reargument, it is clear beyond question

that this is a motion for renewal. 

<P> <blockquote>

"A motion to reargue is based on no new proof; it simply seeks to convince the

court that it was wrong and ought to

change it's mind.  The motion to renew is based on new or additional proof not

used the first time around." (Siegel,

New York Practice, Second Edition, &#167;254). </blockquote>

<P>

By this standard, there can be no doubt that this is a motion for renewal

rather than reargument.  Indeed, PRODIGY's

counsel, in his supporting affidavit refers to PRODIGY's failure to provide

this "new" information on the original

motion as an "oversight" (Affidavit of Martin Garbus, Esq., sworn to July 6,

1995 &#182;2, p.1). 

<P>

Indeed, an examination of the original papers in comparison with the renewal

papers reveals a number of drastic

differences.  For example, PRODIGY's former employee Willard McDowell has

submitted an Affidavit upon this

application in which he now states that when he answered Plaintiffs' counsel's

questions at a deposition concerning

the Board Leaders he (McDowell) was "speculating" (affidavit of Willard

McDowell, sworn to July 5, 1995, &#182;10,

p.3).  Similarly, Jennifer Ambrozek, PRODIGY "Manager of Bulletin Board

Communications" submits, upon renewal, her

Affidavit concluding (inter alia) that upon the prior motion, the Court "was

given the false impression that Prodigy

possesses and exercises significant editorial control and judgment over the

content of its bulletin boards." 

(Affidavit of Jennifer Ambrozek, sworn to June 30, 1995, &#182;2, p.1). 

Neither Mr. McDowell nor Ms. Ambrozek

submitted anything to the Court in opposition to the original motion

notwithstanding the fact that portions of their

deposition transcripts were appended by Plaintiffs to the original moving

papers.  There has been no explanation for

the failure to include an affidavit from Mr. McDowell or Ms. Ambrozek on the

original application. 

<P> <blockquote>

"In support of a motion to renew pursuant to CPLR 2221, the moving party must

show new facts as well as a justifiable

excuse for not placing such facts before the Court in the first instance (see,

Matter of Barnes v State of New York,

159 AD2d 753, lv. dismissed 76 NY2d 816, 819; Foley v Roche, 68 AD2d 558,

568)."  (<I>Zebrowski v Kitchens</I>, 172

AD2d 972, 973). </blockquote>

<P>

While it is indeed true that the requirement for showing of a justifiable

excuse is a "flexible" one, (i.e., the

Court has some discretion in this regard) (see, <I>Saferstein v Stark</I>, 171

AD2d 856; <I>Orenland v Miller

Minuteman Constr. Corp.</I>, 133 Ad2d 816, 817-818; <I>Sciascia v Nevins</I>,

130 AD2d 649, 650; <I>Albanese v

Village of Floral Park</I>, 128 AD2d 612, 614), in this case, it is clear that

the "new" facts set forth by PRODIGY

were well known to it at the time of the original application.  While this,

standing alone, is insufficient to

preclude an exercise of discretion to permit reargument, there has been

absolutely no explanation offered for the

failure to include these facts in the original opposing papers.  Before the

Court can exercise its discretion, it

must be presented with some reason to do so.  "Renewal is by no means

guaranteed and 'is not a second chance freely

given to parties who have not exercised due diligence in making their first

factual presentation' (Matter of Beiny,

132, AD2d 190, lv. dismissed 71 NY2d 994; see <I>Gulledge v Adams</I>, 108 AD2d

950)."  (Matter of <I>Barnes v State

of New York</I>, supra, p.754). 

<P>

Accordingly, in the absence of an acceptable excuse for the failure to include

this new proof in the original motion

papers, PRODIGY's motion for renewal is denied.

src="/images/spt2.gif" alt=" * "> A new settlement agreement has been proposed in 
 the class action suit against several makers of silicone breast 
 implants. The original settlement was withdrawn in part because 
 some 430,000 applications to be included in the class were 
 received, leaving the settlement drastically underfunded. 
 Additionally, Dow Corning, the primary defendant in the suit, 
 declared bankruptcy due to the class settlement and numerous 
 individual suits against it. The awards in the original suit 
 ranged from $100,000 to $2 million; the new settlement grants 
 awards of $10,000 to $250,000 depending on the severity of harm 
 caused by the implants in each class member. Members are divided 
 into three categories of severity, each category has a base 
 award and a bonus award if rupture of the implant, as opposed to 
 "gel leak," can be proved.
 
 
<H3> Bristol, Baxter, 3M, McGhan & Union Carbide Revised
 Settlement Program</H3>

<H3>
 A. Eligible participants:</H3>
 
  A non-foreign class member, as defined in the global
 settlement, who has or had at least one implant manufactured or distributed by
 one of the settling defendants (or their predecessors and subsidiaries):
 Bristol/MEC, Baxter/Heyer-Schulte, 3M,[fn 1] or McGhan.[fn 2] <OL>
  
<P>       <LI> Proof of eligibility is to be provided as specified in II below.
  
<P>       <LI> Persons who would other vise be eligible to participate but for having
 previously opted out from the global settlement may participate under the program
 for "Other Registrants" if, before 12/16/96 and before proceeding to trial
 against a settling defendant, they withdraw their exclusion and register with the
 Claims Office.
  
<P>       <LI> Persons are not eligible to participate if their claims against each of
 the settling manufacturers from which they have received implants have been
 released by settlement or resolved by final judgment.[fn 3] (If their claims
 against a settling defendant have been released or resolved by final judgment but
 they also have an implant from another settling manufacturer, they may
 participate and be eligible for prorated benefits paid by the settling
 defendant(s) with respect to which there is no release or final judgment).
  
<P>       <LI>  Children of breast implant recipients are not eligible with respect to
 claims of their own personal injury, and such claims are not released by the
 recipient's being in the class. As under the existing settlement, derivative and
 representative claims are settled if the recipient participates in the program,
 and personal representatives may act on behalf of deceased or incompetent class
 members. </ol>
  
<H3>B. Classification of eligible participants:</H3>
  <OL>
<P>     <LI>  Current Claimants: eligible participants who mailed to the Claims
 Office (a) by 9/16/94 a signed Registration Form and (b) by 10/17/94 a
 substantially complete Current Disease Compensation Form with sufficient
 documentation to be classified by the Claims Office under the global settlement
 as a current claimant (without regard to whether any deficiencies in
 documentation would be classified as minor or major).
  
<P>       <LI>  Other Registrants: eligible participants (a) who registered with the
 Claims Office by 3/1/95 but are not Current Claimants under B1 above or (b) who,
 having previously excluded themselves from the global settlement, withdraw their
 exclusion and register with the Claims Office by 12/16/96.
  
<P>       <LI>  Late Registrants: all other eligible participants (i.e., all other
 non-foreign class members with a Bristol, Baxter, 3M or Post-'84 McGhan implant)
 who are not Current Claimants under B1 or Other Registrants under B2 above but
 who register with the Claims Office. As under the global settlement, it is
 anticipated that at some point the court will establish a final deadline for
 persons to register with the Claims Office.</ol>
  
<H3><P> C. Opt-out Rights of Eligible Participants</H3>
  <OL>
<P>       <LI> Subject to the limitation in C2 below, any eligible participant may
 reject the settlement offer by filing an opt-out election that is received by the
 Claims Office not later than 45 days after date of Notification of status of the
 participant's registration and claim as provided in I2. Statutes of limitations
 and repose will remain suspended for 6 months after the Claims Office receives
 the opt-out election.
  
<P>       <LI> Late Registrants will not have the opt-out right described in C1 above
 unless they register with the Claims Office by 4/1/96
  
<P>       <LI> Current Claimants and Other Registrants may expedite receipt of the
 Advance Payments provided in D1 and E3 below by waiving the opt-out right
 provided in C1 above.
  
<P>       <LI> Certain ongoing opt-out rights are provided in D2b(2) and E2c below.
  </ol>
<H3>D. Benefits for Current Claimants[fn 4]:</H3>
  <OL>
<P>       <LI> <B>Advance Payment.</B> A non-refundable advance payment of $5,000 will be
 paid as soon as the Claims Office determines that a person has not opted out
 within the time permitted under C1 (or under C3 has waived the remaining time to
 opt out), is a Current Claimant, and has sufficient manufacturer identification
 information. Payment will be made without regard to the status of any appeals
 relating to this settlement and without regard to the existence of any
 deficiencies in the claim. The $5,000 payment will be credited against other
 amounts payable to the claimant under the settlement or awarded in a judgment
 recovered against settling defendants in later litigation,[fn 5] but otherwise is
 not refundable unless the Claims Office determines the claim to have been
 fraudulently presented.
  
<P>       <LI> <B>Compensation.</B> Benefits (less the Advance Payment under D1 above and
 subject to reduction under F1 below if the claimant also has Dow, post-'84
 McGhan, or Mentor implants) to be paid to a Current Claimant, at the claimant's
 election, under either Option One or Option Two.<OL type="a">
  
<P>       <LI> <B>Option One--Fixed Benefits for Current Claimants:</B> A fixed amount (not
 increased or decreased by later changes in claimant's condition) based on disease
 definitions and severity/disability categories in the original Disease Schedule
 (Exhibit D to global settlement). Upon satisfying these criteria (and with
 satisfactory evidence respecting, implant manufacturer identification), a
 claimant electing this option will be paid according to the following schedule
 based on the severity/disability level and on whether by 12/16/96 there is
 appropriate documentation of rupture of a Bristol, Baxter, or 3M implant. Claims
 will be processed by the Claims Office in accordance with all relevant provisions
 of the original global settlement.
  
<P> <B>Option One--Fixed Benefits (Current Claimants Only)</B>
  
<P> Disability Level - A 
  <UL>
<P> Base Amount - $50,000<br>
 Supplement if rupture - + $50,000 = $100,000
  </ul>
<P> 
  Disability Level - B 
  <ul>
<P> Base Amount - $20,000 <br>
 Supplement if rupture - + $30,000 = $50,000
  </ul>
<P> 
  Disability Level - C or D 
  <ul>
<P> Base Amount - $10,000 <br>
 Supplement if rupture - + $15,000 = $25,000
  </ul>
<P> 
      (1) On electing to proceed under Option One, Current Claimants will, upon
 satisfying the criteria and approval by the Claims Office, be paid the specified
 amount (less the advance payment) upon full release of all claims against all
 settling defendants (and other released parties). The obligation of settling
 defendants to pay both the base amount and the increased amount for ruptures is
 not affected by the number or amounts of claims or by the number of opt-outs.
 Payments will be made as soon as the claim is approved and upon execution of a
 standard-form release, without regard to the pendency of any appeals. A Current
 Claimant initially qualifying only for the base amount will be paid the rupture
 supplement (maximum one per claimant) on proof by 12/16/96 of rupture.
  
<P>      (2) Payments of $25,000 or less will be paid in a single lump sum; payments
 of more than $25,000 will be paid in two equal annual installments.
  
<P>      (3)  "Rupture" of a Baxter, Bristol, or 3M implant--which, if documented by
 12/16/96, affects benefit levels for Current Claimants under Option One--refers
 to the failure of the elastomer envelope(s) surrounding a silicone-gel implant to
 contain the gel (resulting in contact of the gel with the body), not solely as a
 result of "gel bleed", but due to a tear or other opening in the envelope(s)
 after implantation and prior to the explantation procedure. To qualify for a
 rupture supplement, the Claimant must have undergone an explantation operation at
 which the rupture was confirmed and must submit a contemporaneous operative
 and/or pathology report (and related statements) documenting the rupture in
 accordance with the protocol in Exhibit F. For explantations after 1/1/96, the
 claimant shall use her best efforts to cause the removed implant to be preserved
 and, if requested by the Claims Office, to provide the removed implant to the
 Claims Office or to an examiner designated by the Claims Office to resolve or
 report on the issue of rupture.
  
<P>       <LI> <B>Option Two:</B> As an altemative to Option One, Current Claimants may
 choose Option Two for long-term benefits under E2 below. Benefits under Option
 Two depend on satisfying during the 15 year period of the program the more
 restricted disease and severity criteria specified in Exhibit E (rather than the
 disease and severity/disability categories specified in the Disease Schedule
 attached as Exhibit D to the original global settlement notice). Upon satisfying
 these criteria and approval by the Claims Office, the claimant will be paid in
 accordance with the schedule shown in E2 below, depending on the new
 disease/severity criteria.
  
<P>      (1) The obligation of defendants to pay approved SS/SLE benefits under
 Option Two to a Current Claimant whose claim for SS/SLE under the global
 settlement would have been either approved or treated as having only minor
 deficiencies (and to pay approved GCTS/PM/DM benefits under Option Two to a
 Current Claimant with any claim that under the global settlement would have been
 approved or treated as having only minor deficiencies) is not affected by the
 number or amounts of claims, by the number of opt- outs, or by the maximum
 cumulative obligations of settling defendants under E2c below; and, upon
 execution of mutually satisfactory releases with individual claimants, the
 settling defendants will pay these amounts without regard to the pendency of any
 appeals relating to this settlement.
  
<P>      (2) Current Claimants who elect and qualify for compensation under Option
 Two will be treated as also eligible, during the 15 years of the program, for
 additional compensation in the same manner as for Other Registrants and subject
 to the provisions of E2c. That is, if a Current Claimant who receives a payment
 under Option Two later develops during the 15 years of the program a condition
 that would entitle her to a larger amount, she would at that time be entitled to
 the difference between the new compensation amount and any amount previously
 paid. If at that time she does not receive this increase because of the maximum
 cumulative obligations of the defendants under E2c below, she would have the same
 opt-out right as stated in E2c.
  
<P>      (3) Current Claimants electing Option Two may, at any time during the 15
 year period of the program before being awarded benefits under Option Two, elect
 to return to Option One but with a 25 % reduction in the amount they would
 otherwise receive under Option One.</ol>
  
<P> <LI>  <B>Post-'84 McGhan implants.</B> Current Claimants with only Post-'84 McGhan
 implants (or only Post-'84 McGhan implants plus implants from Bioplasty, Cox
 Uphoff/CUI or Mentor) shall be eligible for Option One benefits as set forth in
 D2a above, excluding rupture supplements. Payments to such claimants are not
 payable until 30 days after the Court's Final Order with respect to this Revised
 Settlement Program becomes final. Thereafter, payments will be made to claimants
 with approved claims upon execution of a standard form release.</ol>
  
<H3>E. General Benefits for Participants</H3>
  <OL>
<P>       <LI> <B>Explantation expenses.</B> Although not recommending explantation absent
 some specific medical reason to do so, the settling defendants will pay $3,000 to
 Current Claimants and Other Registrants who, after 411194 and within the 15 years
 of the program, have a Bristol, Baxter, or 3M implant removed (without the
 surgery also involving reimplantation of a silicone-gel implant).
  <OL type="a">
<P>       <LI> The obligation of settling defendants to make this payment is not
 affected by the number or amounts of claims or by the number of opt-outs, or by
 the amount of money paid as benefits under E2 below. This $3,000 payment is not
 subject to refund (unless the participant later elects to opt-out under C1), but
 would be credited against any judgment against settling defendants in subsequent
 litigation by the participant.[fn 6]
  
<P>       <LI> Payment of these expenses does not reduce the amount of a participant's
 benefits under E2 (or the amount of benefits for Current Claimants under Option
 One).
  
<P>       <LI> Explantation expenses are not payable to "Late Registrants".
  
<P>       <LI> Although intended only as means to defray medical costs of
 explantation, the amount will not be reduced as a result of the person actually
 incurring less than $3,000 in expenses, whether as a result of a smaller charge
 for the explantation procedure or as a result of insurance or governmental health
 programs.
  
<P>       <LI> In addition, as an optional alternative to the $3,000 assistance offer,
 the settling defendants in the future may provide a list of surgeons willing to
 perform explantations, if the claimant so chooses, without any charge personally
 to the claimant.</ol>
  
<P>       <LI> <B>Compensation.</B> On proof of satisfying, during the 15-year period of the
 program, the revised disease and severity criteria specified in Exhibit E,
 eligible participants will be paid (subject to reduction under F1 below if the
 participant also has Dow, Post-'84 McGhan, or Mentor implants) compensation under
 the following schedule,[fn 7] depending on the new disease/severity criteria.
  
<P> 
<B> Option Two -- Long-Term Benefits</B>
  
<P> Disease -- Severity Level<P>
 SS/SLE -- A  Amount: $250,000
  
<P>  SS/SLE -- B 
 Amount: $200,000
  
<P>  SS/SLE -- C 
 Amount: $150,000
  
<P>  GCTS/PM/DM -- A 
 Amount: $110,000
  
<P>  GCTS -- B 
 Amount: $75,000
  
<P> <OL type="a">
       <LI> Benefits are to be paid in annual installments (as needed) of $100,000.
 These benefits are in addition to any payment related to explantation under E1
 above.
  
<P>      <LI> If during the 15 years of the program the person develops a condition
 that would entitle her to a larger amount than she has previously received, she
 would at that time be entitled to the difference between the new compensation
 amount and any amount previously paid.
  
<P>       <LI> The maximum obligation of the defendants to make payments under this
 program (E2) is $755,000,000 (less amounts paid for explantation expenses of
 Other Registrants under E1 above[fn 8]), with obligated payments as follows: 
  <UL type="disc">
<P>  <LI>  Bristol's cumulative obligation under E2 ($400,000,000) increases in the
 amount of $27,600,000 per year for the first 10 years and $24,000,000 per year
 for the next 5 years (less amounts paid by it for explantation expenses of Other
 Registrants under E1) 
  
<P> <LI>  Baxter's cumulative obligation under E2 ($193,000,000) increases in the
 amount of $13,300,000 per year for the first 10 years and $12,000,000 per year
 for the next 5 years (less amounts paid by it for explantation expenses of Other
 Registrants under E1)
  
<P> <LI>  3M's cumulative obligation under E2 for 3M implants ($132,000,000) increases
 in the amount of $9,100,000 per year for the first 10 years and $8,200,000 per
 year for the next 5 years (less amounts paid by it for explantation expenses of
 Other Registrants under E1)
  
<P> <LI>  3M's cumulative obligation under E2 for Post-'84 McGhan implants
 ($12,000,000) increases in the amount of $800,000 per year for 15 years (less the
 amount, if any, that its payments under D3 for Post-'84 McGhan implants exceed
 $76,800,000)
  
<P> <LI>  McGhan's cumulative obligation under E2 for Post-'84 McGhan implants
 ($6,000,000) increases in the amount of $400,000 per year for 15 years (less the
 amount, if any that its payments under D3 for Post-'84 McGhan implants exceed
 $38,400,000)
  
<P> <LI>  Union Carbide's cumulative obligation under E2 for Post-'84 McGhan implants
 ($12,000,000) increases in the amount of $800,000 per year for 15 years (less the
 amount, if any, that its payments under D3 for Post-'84 McGhan implants exceed
 $76,800,000)</ul>
  
<P> If these cumulative limitations in any year result in any participant not being
 paid the full amount (or installment) shown in the schedule, then such person
 would at that time have the option either (1) to accept a reduced amount based on
 the defendant's obligated payment (with a carry forward of the unpaid portion for
 potential payment in future years if within the defendant's obligated payments)
 or (2) to opt out from the settlement, with the rights to pursue litigation
 against the settling defendants for compensatory damages (but not punitive or
 statutory multiple damages). Participants electing to opt out (a) must first
 return any amounts previously paid under the program (other than for explantation
 expenses or, for Current Claimants, as an Advance Payment) and (b) shall be given
 the opportunity, if they so elect, to participate in non- binding mediation, in
 accordance with procedures to be established by the court, in an effort to
 resolve their claims.
  
<P>       <LI> Benefits to Late Registrants under this program will, as under the
 terms of the global settlement, be paid only if, when, and to the extent the
 defendant's cumulative payment obligations under this program exceed the payments
 to other participants claiming under this program; and such Late Registrants will
 have no right to opt out because of failure to receive the full amount shown in
 the schedule.</ol>
  
<P>       <LI> <B>Advance Payment.</B> A non-refundable advance payment of $1,000 will be
 paid as soon as the Claims Office determines that a person has not opted out
 within the time permitted under C1 (or under C3 has waived the remaining time to
 opt out). is an Other Registrant, and has sufficient manufacturer identification
 information of having had a Bristol. Baxter, or 3M implant. Payment will be made
 without regard to the status of any appeals relating to this settlement and
 without regard to the existence of any deficiencies in the claim. The $1,000
 payment will be credited against other amounts payable to the claimant under the
 settlement or awarded in a judgment recovered against settling defendants in
 later litigation,[fn 9] but otherwise is not refundable unless the Claims Office
 determines the claim to have been fraudulently presented.</ol>
  
<H3> F. Multiple Implants</H3><OL>
  
<P>       <LI> Amounts payable are, in general, not diminished by a person's having
 one or more implants manufactured by other companies in addition to implants from
 the settling defendants. However--<ol type="a">
  
<P>       <LI> If a participant has received one or more Dow implants in addition to
 one or more Bristol, Baxter, or 3M implants, the benefits provided under Option
 One and Option Two (but not the amount of the Advance Payment or the amount for
 explantation expenses) will be reduced by 50%. For example, if a Current Claimant
 qualifying under Option Two for a payment of $200,000 had one or more Bristol
 implants, one or more Dow implants, a Mentor implant, a McGhan implant
 manufactured after 813184, and an implant whose manufacturer could not be
 identified, her compensation would be reduced to $100,000.
  
<P>       <LI> If a participant does not have a Dow implant, but has one or more
 Post-'84 McGhan or Mentor implants in addition to one or more Bristol, Baxter, or
 3M implants, the benefits provided under Option Two (but not the amount of the
 Advance Payment or the amount for explantation expenses) will be reduced by 25 %
 .
  
<P>       <LI> Persons who have received one or more Post-'84 McGhan implants and one
 or more Dow implants but who have not received any Bristol, Baxter, or 3M implant
 are not eligible to participate under this Revised Settlement Program.
  
<P>       <LI> Participation in this program does not release claims a participant may
 have against entities and persons that are not the settling defendants or
 Released Parties under Exhibit B1. Participants are, however, cautioned that
 bankruptcy rules provide a stay at the present time against institution or
 pursuit of claims against Dow Corning, and, to preserve claims against Dow
 Corning, participants may need to file appropriate claims in the bankruptcy
 court.</ol>
  
<P>       <LI> The obligations of the settling defendants to make payments under this
 program are several, not joint, and are limited to the approved claims involving
 implants from that defendant or with respect to which that defendant is agreeing
 to make payments.<ol type="a">
  
<P>       <LI> If a person has implants from more than one of Bristol, Baxter, or 3M,
 their obligations are divided simply on the basis of the number of such
 defendants whose implants the claimant had.[fn 10] For example, if a person had
 one or more Bristol implants, one or more Baxter implants, a Post-'84 McGhan
 implant, and a Mentor implant, and (after the 25% reduction for Post-'84 McGhan
 and Mentor implants) was entitled to a $150,000 payment, then Bristol would be
 responsible for payment of $75,000 and Baxter for payment of $75,000.
  
<P>       <LI> The obligations of McGhan, 3M, and Union Carbide with respect to
 payments to persons who have only Post-'84 McGhan implants (or only Post-'84
 McGhan implants and implants from only Bioplasty, Cox Uphoff/CUI, or Mentor) are
 also several. 3M and Union Carbide shall each be obligated to make 40% of each
 such payment, and McGhan shall be obligated to make 20% of each such payment.
  </ol></ol>
<h3> G. Attorney Fees and Administrative Expenses</H3>
  <OL>
<P>       <LI> Fees and expenses of attorneys representing an individual participant
 in the program are to be paid by the participant (or from benefits payable to her
 under this program) in accordance with the arrangements made between the
 participant and the attorney, but the court is reserving the power to set some
 appropriate standards and limitations on those arrangements (such as precluding
 the inclusion of explantation reimbursement from the calculation of a
 recovery-based contingent fee). Amounts payable to participants will not be
 subject to any reduction for fees and expenses of attorneys for representing the
 plaintiff class or for other "common benefit" services.
  
<P>      <LI> Pursuant to Order No. 13, 6% of the amounts paid to participants under
 this program will be paid by defendants as a surcharge (in addition to benefits
 paid to participants) into the previously established fund as a means for
 compensating and reimbursing counsel providing "common benefit" services. Under
 terms of that order, participants would receive on a pro-rata basis an increase
 in individual benefits should the court determine that the amount of the fund
 exceeds the reasonable fees and expenses chargeable against it.
  
<P>       <LI> Amounts previously paid by defendants under the global settlement to
 support operations of the Claims Office and for other administrative purposes
 will remain under the court's jurisdiction for those purposes. Settling
 defendants will pay such additional sums for operations of the Claims Office
 during the 15-year period of the program as determined by the court (in
 consultation with the settling defendants) to be necessary for that purpose.
 Allocation among settling defendants of the amounts paid for Claims Office and
 administrative expenses shall be based upon the number of claimants applying for
 benefits allocable to each of the settling defendants, and shall be adjusted on
 an on-going basis as necessary by the Court.</ol>
  
     <h3> H. Documentation.</h3> Current Claimants, Other Registrants, and
Late  Registrants may, throughout the 15 year period of the program, submit
 documentation respecting manufacturer identification, medical conditions and
 disability, and other matters affecting eligibility or entitlement to benefits in
 accordance with governing procedures. The Claims Office may, however, establish
 regulations relating to the submission of medical documentation and setting
 reasonable periods at which to conduct evaluations or re-evaluations of a
 person's eligibility and benefits based on supplemental submissions and for
 submission of supplemental documentation after notice of deficiencies. Initial
 documentation showing manufacturer identification must be presented to the Claims
 Office no later than 12/16/96 by participants claiming status as Current
 Claimants, as must documentation of a claim for rupture supplement under Option
 One.
  
    <h3>  I. Claims Office Procedures.</h3> The Claims Office will continue to
process  and evaluate all domestic registrations and claims submitted to it as
 expeditiously as possible, but will give priority of consideration to claims in
 which the claimant has indicated having a Bristol, Baxter, or 3M implant.<OL>
  
<P>       <LI> Protocols governing the required identification of manufacturers of
 claimants' implants are included in the attached Exhibit F. In order to be
 processed as a Current Claimant, a form to be provided by the Claims Office
 regarding proof of manufacturer identification must be received by the Claims
 Office by 12/16/96; earlier presentation of the form will expedite processing of
 Current Claims. The manufacturer defendants agree to provide reasonable
 assistance (including access to their records) to claimants who have difficulties
 in identifying the manufacturer of their implants from their own medical records.
 At their request, defendants shall be afforded access to documentation and other
 supporting evidence submitted by a claimant to identify manufacturers of her
 implants (but redacted to preserve the confidentiality of the claimant's
 identity), and shall bring to the Claim Administrator's attention any submissions
 not covered by existing protocols. In such instances, defendants and Settlement
 Class Counsel shall have the opportunity to submit to the Claims Administrator
 written suggestions for amendments or additions to the existing protocols to
 address the questions raised by the claimants' offers of proof. Any amendments or
 additions to the promulgated protocols will be published on the Claims Office
 computer bulletin board and be made available on request to any class member or
 attorney.
  
<P>       <LI>  Processing of Claims: As claims are processed and evaluated, the Claims
 Office will send each participant a Notification of Status indicating whether her
 proof of manufacturer identification is satisfactory; whether she is classified
 as a Current Claimant, Other Registrant, or Late Registrant; whether any
 documentation submitted in support of a rupture supplement under Option One is
 satisfactory; whether she is entitled to any Option One payment (and, if so, the
 amount of such payment); whether there are any deficiencies in the submission;
 and whether there is a deadline for submitting supplemental documentation
 relating to deficiencies. If there are deficiencies in any of the materials that
 are subject to correction, the Notification will so advise. This Notification,
 which triggers the opt-out period under C1, will be sent to the last address
 provided to the Claims Office, with a copy to the person's attorney if one has
 been indicated.
  
<P>       <LI>  The Claims Office will continue to implement procedures designed to
 detect and prevent payment of fraudulent claims. It should be recognized,
 however, that these procedures cannot be fully implemented preceding Advance
 Payments under D1 and E3 above in view of the goal to make such payments as soon
 as possible.
  
<P>       <LI> Under its plenary responsibilities to assure an acceptable level of
 reliability and quality control of claims, the Claims Office may require, without
 expense to the claimant, an examination or review by a physician or laboratory
 selected by the Claims Office.</ol>
  
<P>       <h3>J. Funding.</h3> Each settling defendant will pay into the fund
established by  the court such amounts as, from time to time during the 15 year period of the
 program, are estimated by the court with the assistance of the Claims Office to
 be needed (after considering undistributed funds previously contributed to the
 fund by that defendant) to pay benefits (or installments) for which that settling
 defendant will become obligated to pay during the next 3 months. The fund will
 maintain appropriate records defining amounts contributed and disbursed with
 respect to each settling defendant and with respect to the Current Claimant and
 Other Registrant programs. The obligations of the defendants to contribute to
 funding of Option Two under E2 (except as specified in D2b(1)) are limited to
 annual cumulative amounts indicated in E2c above. As an initial reserve, Bristol,
 Baxter, and 3M will each pay into the fund by January 15, 1996, at least
 $125,000,000.
  
<h3>K. Miscellaneous.</h3><OL>
  
<P> <LI> Establishment of the settlement program and payments under the program do not
 constitute any admission by defendants of fault, liability, or damages, and will
 not be admissible in evidence in the event a participant at some point opts out
 and proceeds with litigation against the defendants (except that any judgment
 obtained by participant will be reduced by any payment under this settlement).
  
<P>     <LI> All of the Released Parties identified by the settling defendants in
 Exhibit B1 are released to the same extent as are the settling defendants.
  
<P>      <LI> Subject to appropriate conditions to protect claimant confidentiality,
 insurers for settling defendants will be afforded access to appropriate records
 of the Claims Office as may be necessary for defendants to receive benefits under
 such insurance policies.[fn 11]
  
<P>     <LI> Subrogation-type claims by insurers or governmental agencies based on
 payment of medical expenses of participants will, to the extent enforceable under
 applicable laws, be the responsibility of eligible participants; settling
 defendants will have no additional responsibilities to such insurers and agencies
 and will be protected by participants against such claims.
  
<P>      <LI> Where this program establishes deadlines for filing elections,
 supporting materials, etc. with the Claims Office, the materials must be actually
 received at the Claims Office by 5pm, central time, on that date. Fax
 transmissions will not be acceptable.
  
<P>      <LI> The various elections under this program may be made either by the
 participant or by the participant's previously designated attorney. In the event
 of a conflict between elections made by a participant and the participant's
 attorney, the participant's election controls.
  
<P>      <LI> The court shall appoint an independent public accounting firm to (a)
 conduct an annual financial audit of the Claims Office in accordance with
 Generally Accepted Auditing Standards and (b) conduct an audit or audits of the
 processing of claims by any outside claims evaluators. Reports will be made
 available to the parties subject to appropriate conditions to protect claimant
 confidentiality.
  
<P>     <LI> Settling defendants and Released Parties will--subject to the provisions
 of this program--be fully, completely, and forever released from all claims of
 non-foreign class members who have at least one breast implant manufactured by
 one of the settling defendants or their predecessors or subsidiaries, including
 derivative claims of their spouses, children, parents, and others; and such class
 members, including those with derivative claims (but excluding the claims of
 children for their own injury), will be permanently enjoined from asserting,
 instituting, or prosecuting any breast implant-related claim against a settling
 defendant or released party.
  
<P>      <LI> This program will continue to be subject to the court's previous orders
 concerning contribution and indemnification claims against the settling
 defendants and Released Parties.
  
<P>      <LI> This settlement program resolves--subject to its terms--all
 breast-implant related claims (including derivative claims of spouses, parents,
 children, and others) against the settling defendants (and their respective
 Released Parties) by non-foreign class members who have at least one breast
 implant manufactured by one of the settling defendants or their predecessors or
 subsidiaries unless such class members (a) opted out of the settlement class
 under the global settlement during the 1994 opt-out period (and do not withdraw
 their exclusion under A2), (b) opt out of this settlement program under C1 above,
 or (c) exercise an additional opt-out right as provided in sections D2b(2) and
 E2c above. All claims for compensation must be made by the end of the fifteenth
 year of the program (12/15/2010). Any claim by such a class member not made
 during that period would be forever barred.
  
<P>      <LI> Unless otherwise provided, the terms used herein are as defined in the
 Breast Implant Litigation Settlement Notice, the Breast Implant Litigation
 Settlement Agreement, and the Court's Final Order and Judgment dated September 1,
 1994, together with any prior orders incorporated therein by reference. Benefits
 under this program are in lieu of all other benefits that participants and their
 attorneys might have had under the global settlement.
  
<P>      <LI> The obligations of Bristol, Baxter, and 3M to fund Option Two benefits
 for both Current Claimants and Other Registrants will be suspended if the
 provisions of A, B, C, D, E, J, K1, K2, K4, K8, or K10 are challenged on appeal
 and will be cancelled (together with McGhan's, 3M's, and Union Carbide's
 obligations to provide payments for Post-'84 McGhan implants) if any of those
 provisions are disapproved on appeal.</ol>

<H3> EXHIBIT E -- Revised Disease and Severity Definitions</H3>
  
<H4>I. General</H4>
  
<P>       A. A claimant must file with the Claims Office all medical records
 establishing the required findings or laboratory abnormalities. Qualifying
 findings must have occurred within a single 24-month period within the five years
 immediately preceding the submission of the claim. (Findings supplemented in
 response to a deficiency letter sent by the Claims Office do not have to fall
 within the 24-month period outlined above.)
  
<P>       B. If exclusions are noted for a required finding, the physician making
 the finding or ordering the test must affirmatively state that those listed
 exclusions are not present. The physician recording a GCTS finding or making a
 disease diagnosis must also affirmatively state that the qualifying symptoms did
 not exist before the date of first implantation. (This statement can be based
 upon patient history so long as consistent with medical records in the
 physician's possession.) Failure to make these affirmative statements will result
 in a deficiency letter. All underlying office charts, radiology/pathology
 reports, and test results must be supplied to the Claims Office.
  
<P>      <h4>II. Scleroderma (SS):</h4> A claim for scleroderma must include a
diagnosis of  systemic sclerosis/scleroderma made by a board-certified rheumatologist based
 upon personal examination of the patient. [Exclusion: localized scleroderma]
 Supporting medical documentation must affirmatively reveal that the major or at
 least two of the minor criteria listed below are present:<OL type="A">
  
<P>       <LI> <B>Major criterion:</B> Proximal scleroderma - symmetric
thickening,  tightening, and induration of the skin of the fingers and the skin proximal to
 the metacarpophalangeal or metatarsophalangeal joints. The changes may affect the
 entire extremity, face, neck, and trunk (thorax and abdomen). Description of this
 criterion is adequate if the board-certified rheumatologist records that physical
 examination of the patient revealed scleroderma skin thickening, and adequately
 describes the parts of the body where that thickened skin was found.
  
<P>      <LI> <B>Minor Criteria:</B><OL>
  
<P>       <li> Sclerodactyly: Above-indicated skin changes limited to the
fingers.

 lineonodular densities most pronounced in basilar portions of the lungs on
 standard chest roentgenogram; may assume appearance of diffuse mottling or
 "honeycomb lung." These changes should not be attributable to primary lung
 disease.</ol></ol>
  
<H3> Compensation Levels:</H3>
  <OL type="A">
<P>       <LI> Death resulting from SS, or severe chronic renal involvement
manifested  by a glomerular filtration rate of less than 50% of the age- and gender-adjusted

 settling defendant's implants.
  
<P> II. <B>Manufacturer Identification</B>
  <OL type="A">
<P> <LI> <B>Acceptable Proof</B>
  
<P> The following methods of proof, absent fraud, shall be clearly acceptable for
 purposes of establishing that a claimant's implant (s) were (was) manufactured by
 one of the settling defendants:<OL>
  
<P>       <li> contemporaneous hospital or surgeon operative records specifying that
 the claimant was implanted with a settling defendant's implant (s);
  
<P>       <li> certified copy of claimant's medical records containing the implant
 package label; or
  
<P>       <li> where proof specified under 1 and 2 above is unavailable: (a) an
 affirmative statement from the medical doctor who performed the implantation or
 from a responsible person at the treating facility, attesting that the claimant
 was implanted with a settling defendant's implants and providing the basis for
 that conclusion (which cannot rest upon unacceptable proof (see IIB below)); and
 (b) a statement from the claimant describing the steps taken to secure proof
 under methods 1 and 2 above and the reasons for the unavailability of such proof.

Charlotte Mahlum, a Nevada woman who had breast implants surgically installed in 1985

following a subcutaneous mastectomy, filed suit against a number of entities involved in

the manufacture and distribution of the implants. Mahlum alleges a number of disabling

and physically and emotionally painful conditions and symptoms following the rupture of

one of the implants in 1993. The suit was filed naming as a defendant Dow Chemical

Company, a parent of the principal manufacturer, Dow Corning Corporation. On October 28,

1995, Mahlum was awarded approximately $4.1 million in damimages by a jury, and on

October 30, 1995 an additional $10 million in punitive damimages.

accordingly.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereon allege, that each of the

Defendants designated herein by fictitious names are in some manner legally responsible

for the events and happenings referred to herein and approximately and foreseeably

caused damimages to the Plaintiffs as hereinafter set forth. 

<P>

8. At all times herein mentioned, Defendant DOES were the agents, servants, employees,

partners, joint venturers, co-manufacturers, component part suppliers and/or franchisees

of each of the remaining defendant manufacturers and/or distributors and were at all

<H3>ALLEGATIONS AS TO INJURIES</H3>



9.  On or about July 3, 1985, Plaintiff had silicone tissue expanders placed within her

chest for the purpose of reconstructive surgery following mastectomy. Said expanders are

identified as Silastic Percutaneous Skin Expanders, Catalog No. P200-0600 and Lot No.

HH025039.   Plaintiff is informed and believes and thereon alleges that said tissue

expanders were  manufactured and distributed by Defendants. 

<P>

10. On or about August 20, 1985, Plaintiff underwent a second surgery to remove said

tissue expanders and to have them replaced with  Silastic II silicone gel breast

prostheses, identified by Catalog No. PO14-400, Lot No. HH055737 (hereinafter referred

to as "implants").  Said implants were implanted in Plaintiff's chest for the purpose of

reconstruction following subcutaneous mastectomy. Plaintiff is informed and believes and

thereon alleges that said implants  were  manufactured  and  distributed by Dow Corning

Incorporated and other Defendants. 

<P>

11. After implantation, Plaintiff developed an infection and skin necrosis in the wound

located lower aspect of her right side. After  implantation  Plaintiff  also  developed 

numerous other injuries, including but not limited to those listed below. 

<P>

12. Plaintiff is informed and believes and thereon alleges that said implants and/or the

component parts thereof were manufactured and/or distributed in whole or in part by Dow

Corning Incorporated and other Defendants, acting jointly or severally or as agents,

servants, employees, partners, joint venturers, co-manufacturers, component part

suppliers and/or franchisees of one another. 

<P>

13. On or about July 26, 1993, Plaintiff underwent a third surgery to remove the

implants because the left implant had ruptured. 

<P>

14. As a direct and proximate result of the actions and omissions of Defendants as set

forth here in,  Plaintiff was injured and continues so in her health, strength and

activity, which injuries have caused Plaintiff mental, physlcal, and emotional pain and

suffering, including but not limited to, hard, painful breasts, fatigue, skin color

changes, depression, dryness of vaginal mucosa, low grade fevers, tightness and

hardening of the skin, headaches, sore throat and inability to swallow, joint aches and

pains, vision changes, dry eyes, memory loss, numbness, and lumpy, swollen and stiff

fingers.  Plaintiff is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that said

injuries are permanent in character, and that she will continue to experience pain and

suffering by reason thereof in the future, all to Plaintiff's damage in a sum in excess

of $10,000. 

<P>

15. As a further direct and proximate result of the actions and omissions of Defendants

as set forth herein, Plaintiff has incurred and will incur in the future medical and

related expenses for her care and treatment all to her damage in an amount not yet

ascertained. 

<P>

16. As a further direct and proximate result of the actions and omissions of Defendants

as set forth herein, Plaintiff was prevented from attending to her usual occupation and

thereby sustained loss of earnings and a diminished earning capacity. Plaintiff wi11

continue to sustain such damimages ln the future, all in an amount according to proof. 

<P>

17. Plaintiff could not, by exercise of reasonable diligence, have discovered the cause

of her injuries at an earlier time since she is a lay person without medical and

scientific knowledge necessary to make a diagnosis connecting Defendants to her

condition. Furthermore, Plaintiff received no information from Defendants informing her

of any possible culpability on the part of Defendants. In fact, Defendants concealed the

same from Plaintiff. 



<H3>CLAIMS FOR RELIEF AND THEORIES OF RECOVERY </H3>



<H4>FIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF</H4>



(Strict Products Liability)

<P>

18. Plaintiff hereby incorporates by reference, as if fully set forth herein, each and

every allegation contained in Paragraphs through 17, inclusive, of this Complaint. 

<P>

19. The breast implants and component parts thereof manufactured and sold by Defendants

which were implanted into Plaintiff were defective and unsafe, rendering Defendants

strictly liable for all injuries caused thereby, regardless of the state of knowledge of

Defendants at the time of manufacture and distribution  or otherwise. 

<P>

20. Prior to the date upon which Defendants' implants and components  thereof 

(hereinafter  collectively  referred to as "products") were used by Plaintiff,

Defendants knew, or should have known, to a reasonable probability, that the products

were defective and unsafe in that they were dangerous for purposes of breast implants

and caused or could cause grievous injuries to the body when used  for such purposes.  

Despite Defendants having knowledge of the products' actual and potential defects,

Defendants failed to warn Plaintiff of these dangers. 

<P>

21. Defendants knew that said products were to be used by the user without inspection

for defects therein or in any of the components or ingredients thereof. 

<P>

22. Plaintiff neither knew, nor had reason to know at the time of the decision to use or

at the time of the use of the aforesaid products, or at any time prior thereto, of the

existence of the foregoing described defects.  Defendants' products proximately caused

Plaintiff to sustain injuries and damimages as herein alleged. 



<H4>SECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF</H4>



(Negligence)

<P>

23. Plaintiff hereby incorporates by reference, as if fully set forth herein, each and

every allegation contained in Paragraphs through 22, inclusive, of this Complaint. 

<P>

24. Prior to the date upon which Defendants' products were used by Plaintiff and at all

times herein mentioned, Defendants had a duty to properly design, manufacture, compound,

test, inspect, package, label, distribute, market, examine, maintain and prepare for use

and sale the said products. 

<P>

25. At all times herein mentioned, Defendants knew, or in the exercise of reasonable

care should have known, that the aforesaid products were of such a nature that if they

were not properly designed, manufactured, compounded, tested, inspected, packaged,

labeled, distributed, marketed, examined, maintained and prepared for use and sale they

were likely to injure the user of the said products. 

<P>

26.    Defendants   so   negligently   and   carelessly  designed, manufactured,

compounded, tested, failed to test, inspected, failed to inspect, packaged,  labeled,

distributed, marketed, examined, failed to examine, maintained,  prepared  for use and

sold the products that they were dangerous and unsafe for the use and purpose for which

they were intended. 

<P>

27. As a proximate result of the aforesaid negligence of the Defendants, the products

caused severe injury to Plaintiff's body and thereby proximately caused Plaintiff to

sustain damimages and injuries as herein alleged. 



<H4>THIRD CLAIM FOR RELIEF</H4>



(Breach of Express and Implied Warranties) 

<P>

28.    Plaintiff hereby incorporates by reference, as if fully set forth herein, each

and every allegation continued in Paragraphs 1 through 27, inclusive, of this Complaint. 

<P>

29.    Prior to the date upon which Defendants' products were used by Plaintiff,

Defendants knew, or reasonably should have known, of the particular purpose for which

said products would be used and prior to the time that said products were used by

Plaintiff, Defendants impliedly and expressly warranted to Plaintiff that said products

were of merchantable quality and safe and fit for the use for which they were intended.

(NRS 104.2313, 104.2314, 104.2315) 

<P>

30.    In using said products, Plaintiff relied on the skill and judgment of Defendants. 

<P>

31.    Defendants' products were not:safe for their intended use, nor were they of

merchantable quality as said products were not fit for the ordinary purpose for which

such goods are used.  Defendants products had very dangerous propensities when put to

their intended use as silicone gel implants and caused severe injury to the user. 

<P>

32. As a direct and proximate result of the actions and omissions set forth herein

Defendants violated said warranties and failed to act in good faith thereby causing

Plaintiff to sustain injuries and damimages as herein alleged. 



<H4>FOURTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF</H4>



(Misrepresentation and Concealment)

<P>

33.    Plaintiff hereby incorporates by reference, as if fully set forth herein, each

and every allegation contained in Paragraphs through 32, inclusive, of this Complaint. 

<P>

34.    Prior to the date upon which Defendants products were used by Plaintiff,

Defendants knowingly made false representations as to the character,  uses,  benefits

and/or approval for use of said products including, but not limited to, that the

implants were safe for the women who used them, that exposure to silicone materials was 

not dangerous  and that the  implants would safely last lifetime.  Said false

representations were made knowingly and/or with wanton disregard for the public,

including Plaintiff.  These actions and omissions were in violation of, inter alia,

Nevada Revised  Statutes  (NRS)  41.600,  207.171,  598.410, 598.413  and 598.414. 

<P>

35.    The representations by Defendants were, in fact, false.  The true facts were that

the silicone breast implants were likely to leak or bleed or rupture and send silicone

into the human body and that said products were hazardous to the health of the user.

Further, Defendants concealed from Plaintiff and the public that there  was insufficient 

information  to  support  Defendants representations.  These acts and omissions were in

violation of the Nevada Revised Statutes above noted. 

<P>

36.    When Defendants made the aforesaid representations, they knew them to be false

and said representations were made by Defendants with the intent to defraud and deceive

the public,  including Plaintiff, and with the intent to induce Plaintiff to act in the

manner herein alleged,  i.e., to use the aforesaid products for breast augmentation and

reconstruction. 

<P>

37.    Relying upon  the  aforesaid  fraudulent representations  of Defendants,

Plaintiff had silicone breast implants placed within her body, and said implants caused

Plaintiff to sustain the herein described injuries and damimages.  If Plaintiff had

known the true facts, she would not have taken such action.   The reliance of Plaintiff

upon Defendants' representations was justified because the representations were made by

individuals and entities who appeared to be in a position to know the true facts. 

<P>

38.    As  a  direct  and  proximate  result  of Defendants'  false representations and

concealment, Plaintiff was caused to sustain the herein described injuries and

damimages. 

<P>

39.    In doing  the acts  herein alleged,  Defendants acted with oppression, fraud and

malice, and Plaintiff is therefore entitled to punitive damimages to deter Defendants

and others from engaging in similar conduct in the future. 



<H4>FIFTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF</H4>



(Negligent Misrepresentation)

<P>

40.    Plaintiff hereby incorporates by reference, as if fully set forth herein, each

and every allegation contained in Paragraphs 1 through 39, inclusive, of this Complaint. 

<P>

41.    Defendants made the aforesaid representations as to the safety of  said  products 

negligently  with  no reasonable  ground  for believing those representations to be

true; Defendants did not have accurate  or  sufficient information  on  which  to  base 

those representations; and,  Defendants  were  aware  that  they  lacked sufficient

information   on  which   to   base   the   aforesaid representations. 

<P>

42.    At the time said representations were made by Defendants, and at the time

Plaintiff took the actions herein alleged, Plaintiff was ignorant of the falsity of

Defendants'  representations and reasonably believed them to be true.   In reliance upon

said representations,  Plaintiff was  induced  to,  and  did,  use  the silicone   gel 

implants   for   breast   augmentation   and/or reconstruction.  If Plaintiff had known

the actual facts, she would not have taken such action.   The reliance of Plaintiff upon

Defendants'    representations was  justified   because   the representations were made

by individuals and entities who appeared to be in a position to know the true facts. 

<P>

43. As a direct and proximate result of Defendants' actions and omissions, Plaintiff was

caused to sustain the herein described injuries and damimages. 



<H4>SIXTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF</H4>



(Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress) 

<P>

44.    Plaintiff herein incorporates by reference, as if fully set forth herein, each

and every allegation contained in Paragraphs through 43, inclusive, of this Complaint. 

<P>

45. The conduct of the Defendants was done intentionally and with the knowledge that

their conduct would cause Plaintiff severe emotional distress. Furthermore, the conduct

of Defendants was outrageous  and wanton, amounting to reckless disregard for the

Plaintiff's  rights thereby causing Plaintiff to suffer anxiety, mental anguish, and

severe emotional and physical distress and Plaintiff is thereby entitled to recover

exemplary and  punitive damimages  to  set an  example  and  punish Defendants and deter

their wrongdoing. 



<H4>SEVENTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF</H4>



(Loss of Consortium)

<P>

46.    Plaintiffs herein incorporate by reference, as if fully set forth herein, each

and every allegation contained in Paragraphs through 45, inclusive, of this Complaint. 

<P>

47.    At all times herein mentioned, Plaintiff MARVIN S. MAHLUM was, and now is, the

spouse of Plaintiff CHARLOTTE MAHLUM.  MARVIN S. MAHLUM  has  been,  and will  continue

to  be,  deprived  of  the consortium and loss of the full society,  comfort, 

protection, service and support of his spouse,  thereby proximately causing Plaintiff 

MARVIN  S. MAHLUM  sorrow,  mental  anguish,  pain  and suffering, all to the

Plaintiff's damage in excess of $10,000. 

<P>

48.    For purposes of the instant action, Plaintiff hereby adopts and incorporates by

reference each and every applicable part and paragraph of a document entitled, "First

Amended Master Complaint," attached hereto as Exhibit "A" as though fully set forth

herein, including paragraphs:  1, 14, 15, 37, 52, 53, 59, 60, 61, 62, 65, 67, 68, 69,

70, 71, and 75.  Said "First Amended Master Complaint" is a document which is included

in a multidistrict litigation case styled IN RE: SILICONE GEL BREAST IMPLANT PRODUCTS

LIABILITY LITIGATION  (MDL-926) File  No.  CV-92-P-10000-S,  and currently pending in

the Northern District of Alabama.

refusal to allow him to exercise some of his $40 million in stock options.
According to this complaint, Chrysler has repudiated the parties' 1985 contract,
an action, says Iococca, that "is a product of bad faith, transparently motivated
by the desire to punish Mr. Iacocca for his association with Tracinda [Corp.] and
Mr. [Kirk] Kerkorian.  The purported determination made by the Company's Board of
Directors regarding Mr. Iacocca's compliance with the alleged conditions to the
exercise of his Chrysler stock options was unreasonable, arbitrary, capricious
and not based on fact."

COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES, <br>

SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE <br>

AND DECLARATORY RELIEF



<P></b>

Plaintiff Lee A. Iacocca, as and for his complaint against defendants, and each
of them, alleges as follows upon knowledge as to himself and upon information and
belief as to all other matters:  



<h3> NATURE OF THE ACTION </h3>



1.   This action arises out of the wrongful refusal by defendant Chrysler
Corporation ("Chrysler" or the "Company") to honor certain stock options paid to
plaintiff Lee A. Iacocca, former President, Chairman of the Board and Chief
Executive Officer of Chrysler, as compensation for services rendered in the
course of his employment with the Company. 

<P>

2.   During the many years that Mr. Iacocca served at the helm of Chrysler, he
was compensated principally through the award of options to purchase Chrysler
stock, in lieu of salary and other benefits to which he was entitled as the
senior executive of a major American corporation. Mr. Iacocca's stock options
have a current value of over $40 million. 

<P>

3.   The Company's current management and Board of Directors have now sought to
impose a forfeiture of some of those stock options in retaliation against Mr.
Iacocca's recent efforts, in conjunction with Chrysler's largest shareholder,
Tracinda Corporation ("Tracinda"), to enhance the value of the Company's stock
for the benefit of all shareholders.  While the purported justification for that
action is Chrysler's contention that Mr. Iacocca's actions have adversely
affected the Company, Mr. Iacocca has, in fact, always acted in furtherance of
the interests of the Company and its shareholders, both during and after his
tenure with the Company, and none of his conduct has had any adverse affect on
Chrysler or its shareholders. 

<P>

4.   Mr. Iacocca's efforts, which have been heralded by Chrysler, were
instrumental in saving the Company from financial ruin and in creating billions
of dollars of value for the Company's shareholders. Chrysler's bad faith refusal
to honor its contractual commitment to Mr. Iacocca for services already rendered
results from the Company's incumbent managers' desire to entrench themselves by
shielding their positions and perquisites from shareholder scrutiny and the
lawful participation of major shareholders. 



<h3>OVERVIEW</h3>



5.   As described in greater detail below, when Mr. Iacocca was recruited to
join Chrysler as President in November, 1978, the Company's very survival as a
going concern was in imminent jeopardy.  As President and, from September, 1979,
as Chairman of the Company's Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer, Mr.
Iacocca led the Company away from the brink of disaster and succeeded in
returning Chrysler to profitability in 1982.  Mr. Iacocca's leadership was, in
the words of Chrysler's General Counsel, a "contribution to the Company . . .
unparalleled in the history of the Company and, perhaps, in the history of the
American automobile industry." 

<P>

6.   Mr. Iacocca was compensated by Chrysler for his services under a unique
arrangement that minimized his base pay and directly linked the majority of his
earnings to the Company's performance, as measured by the value of its stock. 
Thus, Mr. Iacocca received a base salary and retirement benefits that were
significantly lower than those paid to his counterparts at other major
corporations, including other automobile manufacturers. The bulk of his
compensation was paid in the form of options to purchase Chrysler stock.  Mr.
Iacocca benefited under this arrangement only to the extent that the Company's
stock price increased. 

<P>

7.   Under Mr. Iacocca's leadership, Chrysler was resurrected to sound financial
and operating condition. When he joined Chrysler in 1978, its market value was
approximately $550 million; when he retired at the end of 1992, its market value
had multiplied some 17 times to over $9 billion. 

<P>

8.   The Company and its shareholders have continued to benefit from Mr.
Iacocca's efforts following his retirement.  In April, 1995, concerned with the
Company's flagging performance and stock price, Mr. Iacocca entered into a
relationship with Chrysler's largest shareholder, Tracinda, the product of which
has been further increases in the value of Chrysler stock.  Since April, 1995,
the market value of Chrysler stock has increased by nearly 30 percent, conferring
an additional economic benefit of some $4.4 billion upon all shareholders of the
Company. 

<P>

9.   At the end of June, 1995, Mr. Iacocca took steps to exercise a portion of
the Chrysler stock options he earned during his valuable service to the Company. 

<P>

10.  In response, Chrysler flatly refused to permit the exercise of those stock
options.  Despite his incontestable contributions to Chrysler, the Company's
present managers have wrongfully denied Mr. Iacocca the right to realize the
value of his stock options, while simultaneously exercising their own stock
options, selling their Chrysler stock, and bestowing upon themselves "platinum
parachutes" and other lavish benefits. 



<h3>THE PARTIES</h3>



11.  Plaintiff Lee A. Iacocca was employed by Chrysler for over fourteen years,
from 1978 to 1992, and served as the Company's Chairman of the Board and Chief
Executive Officer for over thirteen years.  He also served as a consultant to
Chrysler in 1993 and 1994.  Mr. Iacocca is presently a citizen and resident of
the State of Michigan, and also maintains a home in Riverside County, California,
and a home and business offices in Los Angeles County, California. Commencing
after January 1, 1996, Mr. Iacocca will become a citizen of the State of
California and will permanently reside in this State.  Mr. Iacocca conducts
business from his California office and homes and will continue to do so in the
future unless frustrated by Chrysler's wrongful conduct. 

<P>

12.  Defendant Chrysler is organized and exists under the laws of the State of
Delaware, with its principal place of business in Highland Park, Michigan. 
Chrysler does continuous and substantial business in the State of California. 
Chrysler sent to Mr. Iacocca's business office in Los Angeles, California the
written notice that it would not permit Mr. Iacocca to exercise his stock
options. 

<P>

13.  Plaintiff is currently unaware of the true names and capacities of the
defendants sued herein as Does 1 through 100, inclusive, and therefore sues such
defendants by such fictitious names.  Plaintiff will amend the complaint to
allege the true names and capacities of such fictitiously named defendants when
the same have been ascertained. 

<P>

14.  At all relevant times, each of the defendants was the agent, servant or
employee of each co-defendant and, in taking the actions or omitting to take the
actions as alleged herein, each of the defendants was acting within the course
and scope of such agency, servitude and/or employment, and each of the defendants
has ratified the acts of its agent.  Each of the defendants is in some form or
manner responsible for the conduct herein complained of, and Plaintiff's damages
were proximately caused by the conduct of each. 



<h3>FACTUAL BACKGROUND</h3>



<B>Mr. Iacocca's Service with Chrysler</B>

<P>

15.  When Mr. Iacocca first joined Chrysler in 1978, the Company was on the
verge of insolvency and its failure was widely predicted.  Indeed, at the time
that Mr. Iacocca assumed the presidency of Chrysler, the Company announced a
quarterly loss of $158 million, the largest it had ever suffered.  Mr. Iacocca
guided Chrysler out of that perilous and troubled period and, under his
management and leadership, the Company made a remarkable recovery to financial
prosperity. 

<P>

16.  Soon after taking the helm at Chrysler, Mr. Iacocca initiated and carried
out a series of bold steps to turn around the Company's fortunes, avert its
imminent bankruptcy, and place Chrysler on a path toward profitability.  Those
steps were far-reaching, innovative, and unquestionably successful. 

<P>

17.  Mr. Iacocca recruited a team of new senior managers to assist him in
efforts to rebuild the Company. He implemented cost-cutting measures, including
plant closings, production realignments, and inventory management strategies. Mr.
Iacocca also oversaw new marketing initiatives for Chrysler automobiles and
trucks.  Each of these steps contributed to turning the Company around, yet it
remained clear that even more drastic action would be required to secure
Chrysler's recovery. 

<P>

18.  In a daring initiative that faced stiff opposition, Mr. Iacocca
successfully petitioned the federal government, in 1979 and 1980, for $1.5
billion in loan guarantees to facilitate Chrysler's recovery.  In a dramatic
move, he also cut his own base salary to $1.00 per year, with the result that,
even more than before, his compensation was tied directly to Chrysler's success,
as measured by the value of its stock. 

<P>

19.  Building upon the enactment of the federal loan guarantee legislation, Mr.
Iacocca continued his efforts to make Chrysler profitable.  Mr. Iacocca cut the
pay of Company executives and secured concessions in its labor contracts with
union employees. 

<P>

20.  By late 1982, all of these efforts culminated in extraordinary improvements
in Chrysler's performance and, by year-end 1982, Mr. Iacocca had succeeded in
returning Chrysler to profitability.  In 1983, the Company had its best year
ever, earning an operating profit of more than $925 million. 

<P>

21.  These achievements were also reflected in the performance of the Company's
stock.  In the Spring of 1983, Chrysler successfully issued some 26 million new
shares of common stock, constituting one of the largest public offerings of
equity in American history. 

<P>

22.  In August, 1983, Chrysler signaled its return to financial health by paying
back the last of its federally-guaranteed loans.  In total, the loans had been
outstanding only three years and Chrysler, under Mr. Iacocca's leadership,
succeeded in retiring them seven years ahead of schedule. 

<P>

23.  Mr. Iacocca's leadership of Chrysler was also reflected in significant
strategic actions.  In particular, in 1986, Chrysler commenced construction on
the $1.5 billion Chrysler Technology Center and, in 1987, the Company acquired
American Motors Corp. and its Jeep line of vehicles. 



<P>

<B>Chrysler's Recognition of Mr. Iacocca's Accomplishments </B>

<P>

24.  The strategic plan initiated and carried out by Mr. Iacocca at Chrysler was
tremendously successful, and created substantial value for the Company and its
stockholders.  As the Company's present management acknowledged in Chrysler's
1993 Proxy Statement, "As Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, Mr.
Iacocca has played a key role in implementing the Corporation's strategic plan." 
The Company also advised its shareholders that in 1992, Chrysler had "returned to
profitability, increased its sales and market share, improved its customer
satisfaction ratings and strengthened its financial condition."  These successes
were reflected in the price of Chrysler common stock which, stockholders were
told, "increased by approximately 165% from $15.50 per share on July 12, 1990 to
a high of $41.125 on February 11, 1993." 

<P>

25.  The Company's current management also acknowledged Mr. Iacocca's
responsibility for Chrysler's recent successes in the Company's 1992 Report to
Shareholders: 

<P><blockquote>

"In the past few years, Lee Iacocca has been telling you how Chrysler was
reshaping itself and its product line, and how this reshaping would lead to a
more competitive company. 

<P>

"In 1992, the payoff began. . . . The payoff came because, going back to 1989,
we were the first automaker to recognize that basic changes were taking place in
our industry, and we were the first to prepare for them." 

<P></blockquote>

26.  The depth and scope of Mr. Iacocca's services to Chrysler were summarized
in materials provided to Chrysler's Board in June, 1992, in anticipation of Mr.
Iacocca's retirement as Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board: 

<blockquote> <P>

"His contribution to the Company has been unparalleled in the history of the
Company and, perhaps, in the history of the American automobile industry. 

<P>

"His agreement to remain as CEO of the Company beyond normal retirement at 65
has been especially valuable to the Company.  In these past few years, he guided
the Company through one of the most severe recessionary periods the industry has
ever faced, which coincided with a time of extreme difficulty within the
Company<br>
. . . 

<P>

"[Mr. Iacocca] stayed beyond normal retirement at the specific request of the
Board, giving up a host of personal plans along the way (including an appointment
to the U.S. Senate and perhaps a shot at even higher office); he stayed 'at the
helm' and guided the Company through those troubled waters. 

<P>

"He made all the tough calls -- an early start to massive and continuing cost
reduction, reorganizing the operations of the Company into platform teams
revolutionizing the way we develop products, revitalizing the troops 

<P>

"He not only got us through - he got us through in great shape . . . 

<P>

"The shareholders, in fact, should be delirious -- the stock came from $10 in
August 1991 to $20+ in June 1992 (a whopping 100% gain), and the Company's market
capitalization increased from $2.4 billion to $6.0 billion (a more whopping 250%
rise!)" 

</blockquote>

<P>

<B>Mr. Iacocca's Chrysler Compensation and Retirement Benefits </B>

<P>

27.  During Mr. Iacocca's employment at Chrysler, his base salary was
substantially lower than the base salaries of his counterparts at other American
automobile manufacturers and other major corporations. 

<P>

28.  The principal element of his compensation from the Company was equity-based
incentive compensation, comprised largely of options to purchase Chrysler stock.
As a result, the magnitude of Mr. Iacocca's compensation corresponded to the
value created under his leadership, and the benefits ultimately realized by Mr.
Iacocca, as Chrysler told its stockholders in 1993, "would depend directly on the
long term success of the strategic plan and would be commensurate with the value
realized by stockholders." 

<P>

29.  At the time of Mr. Iacocca's retirement from Chrysler, the Company
acknowledged that Mr. Iacocca's "pay package" was "fundamentally different from
other Fortune 20 companies .  . .  [with] more pay at risk and greater dependence
on creation of shareholder value," and that, over the period 1978 to 1990, his
"pay package has been more highly dependent on stock price growth than [the CEO
pay package at] any other company." 

<P>

30.  Similarly, the Company acknowledged in its proxy statements from 1988
through 1992 that, "in consideration of his continuing as an employee of the
Corporation beyond his 65th birthday," Mr. Iacocca would receive, among other
compensation, options to purchase 720,000 shares of Chrysler stock. 

<P>

31.  Chrysler also acknowledged that Mr. Iacocca's retirement benefits were
substantially below those accorded to chief executive officers in comparable
situations.  As the Company's General Counsel stated, "[Mr. Iacocca's] overall
retirement benefit under the Company's pension plan is relatively modest compared
to other CEO's of his stature." 

<P>

32.  During his lengthy service to the Company, Mr. Iacocca earned compensation
in the form of options to purchase over 2.5 million shares of the Company's
stock, at prices ranging from $11.75 per share to $42 per share.  Mr. Iacocca
presently holds options (and stock appreciation rights) that he received as
compensation for his services to the Company corresponding to approximately 1.75
million shares of Chrysler common stock.  The current value of those options and
stock appreciation rights is in excess of $40 million. 

<P>

<B>Mr. Iacocca's Pursuit of Other Activities </B>

<P>

33.  Throughout his Chrysler employment, Mr. Iacocca engaged in a wide range of
business, civic, and charitable activities in addition to his services on behalf
of the Company. 

<P>

34.  Both during and after his Chrysler

employment, Mr. Iacocca was an outspoken and vigorous proponent of Chrysler's
interests in many forums.  He regularly addressed the need to maintain quality
and competitiveness at Chrysler and, more generally, in the United States
automobile industry. 

<P>

35.  Following his retirement as the Company's Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer at the end of 1992, Mr. Iacocca continued to pursue a wide range of
activities. These included his service, beginning in April, 1993, as a member of
the Board of Directors of MGM Grand, Inc.  ("MGM Grand"), which is controlled by
Mr. Kirk Kerkorian, and his formation of an investment firm. 

<P>

36.  Chrysler was aware of these activities, which were the subject of
considerable publicity, and never asserted any objection to them nor suggested
that they would in any way impair his ability to exercise his option rights.  To
the contrary, as described in greater detail below, Chrysler, through its General
Counsel and others, provided Mr. Iacocca with information and personal legal
advice in connection with certain of these activities, including Mr. Iacocca's
service on the Board of Directors of MGM Grand and the consequences of that
service with respect to his Chrysler stock options.  At no time was Mr. Iacocca
advised by Chrysler that his business affiliation with a non-Chrysler entity
controlled by Mr. Kerkorian could or would jeopardize the exercisability of his
stock options. 

<P>

37.  In April, 1995, Mr. Iacocca again joined forces with Mr. Kerkorian, whose
Tracinda Corporation is Chrysler's largest shareholder.  Tracinda has advanced
proposals designed to enhance shareholder value for the benefit of all Chrysler
shareholders. 

<P>

38.  The stock market has reacted positively to those proposals.  In fact, the
value of Chrysler's stock has increased nearly 30 percent, from approximately $39
per share in mid-April 1995, to over $50 per share on November 3, 1995.  That
dramatic price rise corresponds to an increase in the market capitalization of
the Company of approximately $4.4 billion. 

<P>

<B>Mr. Iacocca's Receipt of Legal Advice from Chrysler's General Counsel</B> 

<P>

39.  During Mr. Iacocca's employment with Chrysler, William J. O'Brien,
Chrysler's General Counsel, regularly provided Mr. Iacocca with personal legal
advice concerning his compensation and retirement benefits from the Company, as
well as the impact of federal securities laws and regulations on those matters. 

<P>

40.  In December, 1992, Mr. Iacocca appointed Mr. O'Brien as his "true and
lawful attorney-in-fact" by Power of Attorney to act on his behalf in connection
with Mr. Iacocca's receipt of compensation in the form of shares of Chrysler
stock. That Power of Attorney gave Mr. O'Brien "full power and authority to do
and perform all and every act and thing whatsoever" within the scope of the
appointment. 

<P>

41.  Mr. O'Brien provided personal legal advice to Mr. Iacocca and communicated
with representatives of Mr. Kerkorian concerning the effect of Mr. Iacocca's
joining the Board of Directors of MGM Grand on his ownership of Chrysler stock
options and shares. 

<P>

42.  Mr. O'Brien also provided Mr. Iacocca with personal legal advice as to when
he should sell shares of Chrysler stock in order to avoid triggering Chrysler's
"poison pill" as a result of the aggregation of his Chrysler stock holdings with
those of Mr. Kerkorian. 

<P>

43.  Although Chrysler, through its General Counsel, provided personal legal
advice to Mr. Iacocca concerning the effect of his outside activities, including
his association with Mr. Kerkorian, on his holdings of Company stock and stock
options, it never informed Mr. Iacocca that such activities could jeopardize his
right to exercise his options to purchase Chrysler stock, or that the Company
would take the position that Mr. Iacocca forfeited any options by doing so. 
Instead, Chrysler remained silent and consistently honored Mr. Iacocca's requests
to exercise stock options, including requests made after his retirement from the
Company and his association with Mr. Kerkorian.   

<P>



<B>Chrysler's Wrongful Refusal To Honor Mr. Iacocca's Stock Options</B>  

<P>

44.  Certain options were granted to Mr. Iacocca as compensation for his service
as Chrysler's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer in a contract entered into
between the Company and Mr. Iacocca on or about November 7, 1985, as amended (the
"1985 Contract").  Pursuant to the terms of the 1985 Contract, Mr. Iacocca has
the presently exercisable right under the 1985 Contract to purchase up to 112,500
shares of Chrysler common stock, as adjusted, at a price of $18.23 per share (the
"1985 Options"). 

<P>

45.  On or about June 28, 1995, Mr. Iacocca, through his representative at the
public accounting firm of Arthur Andersen & Co., contacted Chrysler and requested
certain forms to exercise all of the 1985 Options for the purchase of 112,500
shares of Chrysler common stock. 

<P>

46.  After receipt of that request, Chrysler, through its Board of Directors,
repudiated its obligations under the 1985 Contract and rejected Mr. Iacocca's
request, on the purported grounds that Mr. Iacocca had failed to satisfy certain
alleged conditions to the exercise of his Chrysler stock options. 

<P>

47.  Chrysler communicated its repudiation and rejection, and the purported
grounds therefor, to Mr. Iacocca at his business office in Los Angeles County. 

<P>

48.  Chrysler's repudiation of its 1985 Contract and rejection of Mr. Iacocca's
attempt to exercise the 1985 Options is in willful breach of its contractual
obligation to him. Chrysler's effort to impose upon Mr. Iacocca the forfeiture of
the value of the 1985 Options -- which comprises a material part of the
compensation he earned for services previously rendered to the Company -- is a
product of bad faith, transparently motivated by the desire to punish Mr. Iacocca
for his association with Tracinda and Mr. Kerkorian.  The purported determination
made by the Company's Board of Directors regarding Mr. Iacocca's compliance with
the alleged conditions to the exercise of his Chrysler stock options was
unreasonable, arbitrary, capricious and not based on fact.   



<h3>FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION</h3>



(For Breach of Contract Against All Defendants) 

<P>

49.  Mr. Iacocca incorporates by reference each of the foregoing allegations as
if fully set forth herein. 

<P>

50.  The 1985 Contract is a valid and binding contract between Mr. Iacocca and
Chrysler, under which contract Mr. Iacocca was to perform services for Chrysler
as its Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of its Board of Directors in exchange
for compensation from Chrysler that was comprised, in large part, of options to
purchase shares of Chrysler common stock. 

<P>

51.  The options to purchase Chrysler common stock granted under the 1985
Contract are fully vested and presently exercisable for the purchase of 112,500
shares of Chrysler common stock at a price of $18.23 per share. 

<P>

52.  Mr. Iacocca has fully complied with all his obligations under the 1985
Contract.  Alternatively, Mr. Iacocca has substantially performed all of his
obligations under the 1985 Contract.  Mr. Iacocca is ready, willing and able to
pay the full option exercise price under the 1985 Contract. 

<P>

53.  Chrysler has wrongfully repudiated and breached the 1985 Contract and
willfully, unreasonably, arbitrarily and capriciously breached its obligations to
Mr. Iacocca both under the express provisions of the 1985 Contract and under the
covenant of good faith and fair dealing implied by law therein. 

<P>

54.  Any and all conditions precedent to Chrysler's performance under the 1985
Contract have been performed or have occurred. 

<P>

55.  Alternatively, the conditions that Chrysler has sought to impose upon the
exercise of Mr. Iacocca's stock options are contrary to California public policy
and are void as a matter of law (including under Section 16600 of the California
Business and Professions Code and Section 1441 of the California Civil Code) in
that, among other things, they constitute an attempt by Chrysler:  (a) to prevent
Mr. Iacocca from practicing his profession in this State;  (b) to prevent Mr.
Iacocca from exercising his rights as a shareholder in Chrysler; and (c) to
retaliate against Mr. Iacocca for having exercised his legitimate and lawful
rights in the past. 

<P>

56.  Alternatively, performance of the conditions sought to be imposed by
Chrysler is excused by reason of waiver, equitable estoppel, unconscionability
and undue forfeiture, as alleged herein. 

<P>

57.  As a result of Chrysler's wrongful conduct, Mr. Iacocca has suffered
damages in an amount to be determined at trial.  





<h3>SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION</h3>



(For Specific Performance Against All Defendants) 

<P>

58.  Mr. Iacocca incorporates by reference each of the foregoing allegations as
if fully set forth herein. 

<P>

59.  Chrysler's repudiation and breach of the 1985 Contract will deprive Mr.
~Iacocca of valuable contractual rights which are unique and have a value to Mr.
Iacocca which is unquantifiable. 

<P>

60.  Pursuant to the terms of the 1985 Contract, Mr. Iacocca is entitled to
immediate delivery of 112,500 shares of Chrysler common stock, with all of their
attendant rights and privileges, including voting rights, the right to receive
future dividends, and the right to receive the benefit of future appreciation of
the market value of Chrysler common stock. 

<P>

61.  An award of monetary damages cannot adequately compensate Mr. Iacocca for
Chrysler's repudiation and breach of the 1985 Contract and the denial of his
rights and privileges as shareholder of the 112,500 shares of Chrysler common
stock to which he is entitled and which Chrysler wrongfully has withheld from
him. 

<P>

62.  Specific performance of the 1985 Contract is necessary to provide complete
relief for Chrysler's wrongful repudiation and breach.    



<h3>THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION</h3>



(For Omissions Of Material Fact Against All Defendants) 

<P>

63.  Mr. Iacocca incorporates by reference each of the foregoing allegations as
if fully set forth herein. 

<P>

64.  Chrysler, through its authorized

representatives, including its General Counsel William J. O'Brien, among others,
provided legal and other advice to Mr. Iacocca in his personal capacity regarding
his Chrysler stock options.  That advice related to, among other matters, the
effect of services provided by Mr. Iacocca to entities other than Chrysler on his
Chrysler stock options, including the 1985 Options. 

<P>

65.  Mr. O'Brien provided such advice incident to his duties as Chrysler's
General Counsel, and it was known by or reasonably foreseeable to Chrysler that
Mr. O'Brien would provide such advice to Mr. Iacocca. 

<P>

66.  Chrysler knew or should have known that such advice had been and was being
rendered to Mr. Iacocca. 

<P>

67.  By virtue of its providing such personal legal and other advice to Mr.
Iacocca, a relationship of trust and confidence existed between Mr. Iacocca and
Chrysler, and Chrysler possessed, and held itself out to possess, superior
knowledge of the facts concerning the terms and conditions of Mr. Iacocca's
Chrysler stock options, including the 1985 Options. 

<P>

68.  Mr. Iacocca reasonably relied on the personal legal and other advice
provided to him by Chrysler concerning his Chrysler stock options. 

<P>

69.  Chrysler knew, and knew that Mr. Iacocca was unaware, of the following
matters, but failed to disclose them to Mr. Iacocca: <ol type="a">

<P>

<LI>  the possibility that Mr. Iacocca would jeopardize his ability and legal
entitlement to exercise his options to purchase Chrysler common stock, including
the 1985 Options, by associating with an entity controlled by Mr. Kerkorian or
any non-Chrysler entity; 

<P>

<LI>  that Chrysler would take the position that all of Mr. Iacocca's rights
under his Chrysler stock options, including the 1985 Options, would be forfeited
if Mr. Iacocca associated himself with an entity controlled by Mr. Kerkorian or
any non-Chrysler entity; 

<P>

<LI>  the possibility that Mr. Iacocca would jeopardize his ability and legal
entitlement to exercise his options to purchase Chrysler common stock, including
the 1985 Options, by continuing to comment publicly regarding the Company as he
had in the past; and 

<P>

<LI> that Chrysler would take the position that all of Mr. Iacocca's rights
under his Chrysler stock options, including the 1985 Options, would be forfeited
if Mr. Iacocca continued to comment publicly regarding the Company as he had in
the past. <P></ol>



70.  The facts and circumstances described in paragraph 69 above were material
to Mr. Iacocca's decisions to associate with entities other than Chrysler,
including his association with Tracinda 

<P>

71.  If Mr. Iacocca had been advised by Chrysler of the facts and circumstances
described in paragraph 69 above, he would not have associated himself with any
entity other than Chrysler without also taking additional steps to protect his
interests, nor would he have engaged in the conduct that Chrysler now contends,
albeit baselessly, adversely affected the Company. 

<P>

72.  In light of the relationship between the parties and the advice that
Chrysler provided to Mr. Iacocca concerning his Chrysler stock options, Mr.
Iacocca reasonably expected Chrysler to disclose any matters that would cause
Chrysler to contend that he lost the compensation he earned for services rendered
to Chrysler, including the matters described in paragraph 69 above. 

<P>

73.  By reason of Chrysler's wrongful conduct, Mr. Iacocca has suffered damages
in an amount to be determined at trial. 

<P>

74.  Chrysler's actions as set forth above were willful, fraudulent, oppressive
and malicious, and were undertaken in conscious disregard for the rights of Mr.
Iacocca. Mr. Iacocca is therefore entitled to an award of exemplary and punitive
damages, in a sum according to proof at trial.

<P>

75.  Mr. Iacocca incorporates by reference each of the foregoing allegations as

Mr. Iacocca by repudiating the 1985 Contract and by failing to disclose to Mr.
Iacocca: <OL type="a"> <P>

</ol><P>

79.  Mr. Iacocca reasonably relied on the affirmative representations made to

before and after his retirement from the Company, and (c) Chrysler's honoring

<P>

85.  Mr. Iacocca did not know that Chrysler would contend that, if he merely

continued to comment publicly regarding the Company as he had in the past, then
he would forfeit his stock options, including the 1985 Options. 

<P>

86.  Chrysler's conduct was undertaken with the intent that Mr. Iacocca rely
upon it. 

<P>

87.  Mr. Iacocca has suffered a prejudicial change in position as a result of

<P>

90.  Notwithstanding Chrysler's determination to refuse to permit the exercise

Iacocca is entitled to judgment declaring that Mr. Iacocca's Chrysler stock
options are valid and enforceable, and that Chrysler must honor such options as
are exercised by Mr. Iacocca, and that the conduct of Mr. Iacocca would not be a
valid basis for Chrysler to contend that he has forfeited the right to exercise

CHRYSLER CORPORATION'S COMPLAINT AGAINST LEE A. IACOCCA FOR <BR>

BREACH OF CONTRACT, BREACH OF FIDUCIARY DUTY, ACCOUNTING FOR <BR>

Prof, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF 

<P>

JURY TRIAL DEMANDED

<P>



    Chrysler Corporation ("Chrysler"), a Delaware corporation, for its complaint

against defendant Lee A. Iacocca ("Iacocca"), alleges, with knowledge as to its

own acts and upon information and belief as to the acts of others, as follows: 



<H3>    NATURE OF THE CASE </H3>



   1. This action arises from the wrongful conduct of Iacocca, a former Chairman

and Chief Executive Officer, director, and consultant of Chrysler. During his

time at Chrysler, Iacocca obtained a vast amount of confidential business and

financial information about Chrysler, including material, nonpublic information

(the "confidential information"). Iacocca owed Chrysler a legal and contractual

duty not to disclose that confidential information. Iacocca has breached and is

continuing to breach those obligations. 

<P>

   2. Iacocca has breached his fiduciary duties owed to Chrysler by disclosing

confidential information about Chrysler to Kirk Kerkorian ("Kerkorian"), a

notorious corporate raider whose wholly-owned Tracinda Corporation ("Tracinda")

is a major Chrysler stockholder. These disclosures began while Iacocca was a

highly paid consultant to Chrysler and a director of Chrysler, if not earlier,

and continue today. The disclosures, for which Iacocca has received substantial

past payments and the promise of millions of dollars of future compensation, have

had the improper aim of providing Kerkorian with confidential information that

was not available to other shareholders. 

<P>

   3. Iacocca has also breached the consulting agreement dated June 11, 1992

(the "Consulting Agreement"), in which Iacocca agreed to provide consultation

services to Chrysler at the request of Chrysler's Board of Directors (the

"Board") or the Chairman and CEO of Chrysler, in return for substantial

compensation from Chrysler. The Consulting Agreement is attached as Exhibit A and

incorporated by reference. In the Consulting Agreement, Iacocca agreed that he

would: (a) act exclusively "in close association with the Chairman and CEO and

under the general auspices of the Board" in all matters involving Chrysler; (b)

not disclose any material, nonpublic information or other confidential

information about Chrysler; (c) not associate with others in a manner that made

him a member of a shareholding "group" having a reporting obligation under

Section 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act ("Exchange Act"); and (d) not

conduct himself in any way that, in the good faith judgment of Chrysler's Board,

would adversely affect or conflict with the interests of Chrysler. Iacocca

satisfied none of these obligations. 

<P>

   4. Iacocca has unjustifiably made efforts to increase his ownership of

Chrysler stock through exercise of certain stock options granted to him by

Chrysler, despite his noncompliance with the express contractual preconditions to

exercise of the options. Iacocca's option agreements made his entitlement to

exercise stock options after his retirement subject to the conditions that he

neither (a) take other employment or render services to others without the

written consent of Chrysler nor (b) conduct himself in a manner adversely

affecting Chrysler. Iacocca violated these preconditions through such actions as

providing services to Kerkorian and Tracinda without prior authorization,

assisting Kerkorian in developing and launching an unsolicited takeover bid for

Chrysler, persisting in his support of Kerkorian's takeover effort even after

Chrysler's Board had formally declared that the proposed takeover was not in the

best interests of the company or its shareholders, and making public statements

disparaging Chrysler and its products. In response to Iacocca's attempt to

exercise certain options subject to these preconditions, Chrysler's Board

properly declared that the options were not exercisable, for failure to comply

with these preconditions. Iacocca nevertheless continues wrongly to assert that

he is entitled to exercise these options. 

<P>

   5. As a result of Iacocca's wrongful acts, Chrysler has suffered and

continues to suffer substantial economic and other losses, and Chrysler is

entitled to: 

<P><UL>

   a. compensatory and exemplary damimages; 

<P>

   b. the return of compensation and perquisites that Chrysler conveyed to

Iacocca through 1994, while he was in breach of the Consulting Agreement and/or

Chrysler policies conceding confidential information; 

<P>

   c. preliminary and permanent injunctive relief against Iacocca's continuing

use and disclosure of Chrysler's nonpublic information; 

<P>

   d. an accounting for all profits and other compensation that Iacocca has

unjustly obtained from Kerkorian and Tracinda in return for wrongfully disclosing

Chrysler's confidential information; and 

<P>

   e. a declaration that the Board was legally justified in refusing to permit

Iacocca to exercise option rights to purchase Chrysler's stock. 

</UL>

<H3>JURISDICTION AND VENUE</H3>



   6. This Court has jurisdiction over these claims under Art. VI,  13 of the

Michigan Constitution and MSA  27A.601, 27A.605; MCL  600.601, 600.605. 

<P>

   7.    Venue is proper in this judicial circuit under MSA  27A.1621, 27A.1629;

MCL  600.1621, 600.1629, because defendant Iacocca resides in Oakland County. 



<H3>THE PARTIES </H3>



   8. Plaintiff Chrysler is a corporation organized and existing under the laws

of the State of Delaware, with executive offices at 800 Chrysler Drive East,

Auburn Hills, Oakland County, Michigan. Other executive offices are presently

located at 12000 Chrysler Drive, Highland Park, Michigan. In 1996, all of

Chrysler's executive offices will be located at the Oakland County address.

Chrysler's headquarters have been located in Michigan since 1927, and it employs

approximately 44,000 people in the State of Michigan. Chrysler and its

consolidated subsidiaries operate in two principal industry segments: automotive

operations and financial services. Chrysler's automotive operations include the

research, design, manufacture, assembly and sale of cars, trucks, and related

parts and accessories. Through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Chrysler Financial

Corporation, Chrysler is engaged in wholesale and retail financing for Chrysler

vehicles, and in property, casualty and other insurance businesses. 

<P>

   9. Defendant Iacocca has been a resident of Michigan since 1947, and is

presently a resident of Bloomfield Hills, in Oakland County, Michigan. Beginning

in November 1978, he was continuously employed by Chrysler in Michigan. From 1979

through 1992, Iacocca was Chrysler's Chairman and CEO. Iacocca was retained by

Chrysler as a consultant throughout 1993 and 1994, and he remained a director

until September 1993. 



<H3> ALLEGATIONS COMMON TO ALL CLAIMS </H3>



<H4> Iacocca's Obligations To Chrysler </H4>



   10. After joining Chrysler in November of 1978 as President and Chief

Operating Officer, Iacocca became Chairman and CEO in September 1979. He held

those positions for 13 years, until the end of 1992. Iacocca was employed by

Chrysler at the will of Chrysler's Board, which set his compensation. In

Iacocca's career with Chrysler, his total compensation, exclusive of unexercised

options, exceeded $90 million. 

<P>

   11. Iacocca had unfettered access to every aspect of Chrysler's operations

and to all of its confidential information. He oversaw numerous major financial

transactions; oversaw negotiations with unions, banks, suppliers, and regulators;

and controlled the development of new vehicles and new product lines. Iacocca was

privy to highly sensitive financial data, debt information, pricing strategies,

investing and stock repurchasing strategies, marketing and manufacturing

strategies, long-term financial and operating projections, and other kinds of

confidential information associated with the management and business of Chrysler,

including information about Chrysler's assessments, plans and strategies relating

to Kerkorian and Tracinda. 

<P>

   12. While CEO of Chrysler, Iacocca presented himself to the public as the

virtual personification of Chrysler. He pursued extensive activities to make his

profile to the public even more prominent than that of other chief executive

officers of major corporations. Iacocca's public positions respecting Chrysler

consequently took on particularly strong public significance. His public

pronouncements were widely quoted, and he sought to cultivate public association

of him with Chrysler through his books, personal appearances, advertisements and

other public statements. Today, he remains publicly associated with Chrysler and

its products. 

<P>

   13. Chrysler expected and trusted Iacocca to be faithful to Chrysler and to

represent exclusively its interests, rather than his own interests. As a Chrysler

officer, director, employee, and consultant, Iacocca had fiduciary obligations to

act in good faith and with undivided loyalty to Chrysler and its shareholders. In

order to fulfill these duties, he was required to exercise his best efforts on

behalf of Chrysler, to refrain from unauthorized disclosure of confidential

information concerning Chrysler, to abide by Chrysler's policies, and to refrain

from acting in a manner adverse to or inconsistent with Chrysler's interests. 

<P>

   14. Chrysler's official policies required Iacocca, like all its officers and

employees, to: 

<P><UL>

   a. release no confidential information without the review and concurrence of

the Public Affairs Office; 

<P>

   b. refrain from disclosing nonpublic information that might materially affect

the market price of Chrysler's securities; and 

<P>

   c. handle requests for information from shareholders with impartiality and on

an equal basis. 

<P></UL>

   15. Chrysler, at all relevant times, has had codes of ethics for employees.

The codes, which were distributed throughout Chrysler under Iacocca's signature,

make employees responsible for protecting Chrysler's property (including

confidential information) from unauthorized use. The codes of ethics also

prohibit disclosure of inside information, which the codes expressly characterize

as proprietary to Chrysler. The codes of ethics clearly warn that violations can

result in disciplinary action (including termination) or in legal proceedings. 

<P>

   16.   On June 11, 1992, in anticipation of his retirement as Chairman and

CEO, Iacocca signed a Consulting Agreement that took effect upon his retirement

on December 31, 1992. Under the agreement, Iacocca was to be paid $500,000 per

year and to receive the perquisites available to Chrysler's most senior

executives, including an office, staff support, accident insurance, reimbursement

of expenses, and use of corporate aircraft and security services. In return for

such compensation and perquisites, Iacocca was to provide consultation services

to Chrysler at the request of the Board or the Chairman and CEO of Chrysler. 

<P>

   17. Iacocca expressly undertook in the Consulting Agreement: (a) to act

exclusively "in close association with the Chairman and CEO and under the general

auspices of the Board"; (b) to maintain, without future time limit, the

confidentiality of material, nonpublic information concerning the business and

affairs of Chrysler; (c) not to associate with any person or entity in a manner

that subjected him or any "group" to a reporting obligation pursuant to Section

13(d) of the Exchange Act; (d) not to "render services" that were "detrimental or

inimical to the interests of Chrysler"; and (e) not to conduct himself in any

manner that "in the good faith judgment of the Company's Board, adversely affects

or conflicts with the interests of Chrysler." 

<P>

   18. Iacocca continued to receive confidential information about Chrysler

during the period of his consultancy, even after he resigned from the Board in

September 1993, and continued to have virtually unlimited access to any

information he wanted about the company. 

<P>

   19. After Iacocca's Consulting Agreement terminated at the end of 1994 he

continued to have a duty not to use or disclose confidential information obtained

as a director, officer, employee or consultant to Chrysler. 

<P>

   20. Iacocca was also granted stock option rights. The options are subject to

the terms and conditions of Chrysler's Stock option Plan, which was initially

approved by the Board and shareholders in 1972 (the "Stock Option Plan"), and its

successor, the Stock Compensation Plan, which was initially approved by the Board

and shareholders in 1991 (the "1991 Stock Compensation Plan"). Copies of the

Stock Option Plan and the 1991 Stock Compensation Plan are attached as Exhibits B

and C, respectively, and incorporated by reference. Section 8 of the Stock Option

Plan provides that any exercise of option rights after the termination of

Iacocca's employment is subject to two conditions precedent, which are applicable

to each option holder: (a) that he takes no other employment and renders no

services to others without Chrysler's written consent and (b) that he does not

conduct himself in a manner "adversely affecting" Chrysler. Section 5(b)(vii) of

the 1991 Stock Compensation Plan imposes the same two conditions precedent on the

exercise of options by all participants of that plan. 

<P>

   21. At all times since November of 1978, Iacocca knew or should have known

that Chrysler relied upon his character and integrity in fulfilling his

obligations. Chrysler relied upon such statements as the following, written by

Iacocca in 1988: 

<P>

  "More than on any law, we have to rely on the character and ethics of the 

people. " The History Of Iacocca's Relationship With Kerkorian And Tracinda 

<P>

   22. Iacocca first met Kerkorian in 1989 at the Gulfstream Park racetrack in

Hollywood, Florida. 

<P>

   23. At around the same time, Iacocca considered attempting a management-led

buyout of Chrysler and contacted Kerkorian to discuss whether Kerkorian would be

interested in participating in a buyout. 

<P>

   24. Iacocca made that overture without consulting the Board and without

considering whether the approach to Kerkorian was in the best interest of

Chrysler's 

<P>

     Defendant Iacocca's statements in 1988 are quotations from Lee Iacocca,

Talking Straight (Bantam Books 1988). shareholders, as opposed to his own

personal interests. Kerkorian was known at the time to be a corporate raider with

a record of initiating widely criticized investments in companies and engaging in

transactions that resulted in greater wealth to Kerkorian at enormous cost and

harm to the companies, and their other shareholders, debt holders, and employees.

Iacocca was fully aware that such ramifications resulted from the type of

strategies Kerkorian was known for employing. Iacocca had written in 1988: 



<P>

     "All I know is what I see--and what I don't.... I see billions of dollars

tied up in new corporate deal Jo keep the raiders at bay while research and

development goes begging . . . I also see a huge share of America's best

management talent wasted on takeover games when it should be devoted to

strengthening the industrial base of the country. 

<P>

  "But I don't see the raiders creating jobs. I don't see them boosting

productivity. And worst of all I don't see them doing a single thing to help 

America compete in the world. " Although Iacocca abandoned the buyout strategy as

unworkable, his overture to Kerkorian apparently spawned Kerkorian's interest in

Chrysler, because shortly thereafter, in October of 1990, Kerkorian began

acquiring Chrysler stock through Western High Income Advisors, a Kerkorian shell

corporation. By the end of November 1990, Kerkorian had acquired almost 5% of

Chrysler's outstanding common stock. At that point, Kerkorian met with Iacocca to

discuss his plans for Chrysler. Iacocca reported to Chrysler's senior management

and Board that Kerkorian had professed great admiration for Iacocca, had told

Iacocca that he planned to acquire more of Chrysler's stock, and had requested

Iacocca's advice as to how he should proceed. 25.   By December 12, 1990,

Kerkorian had acquired over 9% of Chrysler's outstanding common stock. The Board

had legitimate concerns about this acquisition, in light of Kerkorian's

reputation, his failure to adhere to initial promises about not acquiring further

stock, and his secretive and aggressive initial acquisition of Chrysler's shares.

In December of 1990, Chrysler's Board entrusted Iacocca with representing

Chrysler in its dealings with Kerkorian, unaware of any facts that would indicate

Iacocca was unworthy of such trust. 

<P>

   26. Iacocca, who has admitted that Kerkorian is motivated only by "the love

of the game, " repeatedly conferred with him regarding Kerkorian's investment in

Chrysler. On more than one occasion, they discussed the buyout strategy that

Iacocca and Kerkorian first had talked about in 1989. Kerkorian also sought to

have Iacocca disclose confidential information, such as how long Iacocca intended

to remain at Chrysler and whether Chrysler was considering mergers with other

corporations. Kerkorian made clear to Iacocca that he sought such information for

purposes related to his investment strategy. Although Chrysler's Board had

directed Iacocca to treat Kerkorian as hostile and adverse to Chrysler, and

although Iacocca understood that he was expected not to support Kerkorian's

acquisition efforts without prior Board approval, Iacocca engaged Kerkorian in at

least three one-on-one conversations between January and October of 1991 about a

possible Iacocca-led and Kerkorian-sponsored buyout of Chrysler. Iacocca's And

Kerkorian's Efforts To Delay Or Alter Iacocca's Retirement 

<P>

   27. In September of 1991, Chrysler's Board, after carefully weighing the

interests of Chrysler and its shareholders, asked Iacocca to retire as of

December 31, 1992. Iacocca did not accept this decision gracefully and resisted

the Board's determination to relieve him of the trappings of office. Later that

month he met with Kerkorian and, without Board authorization, again discussed a

possible buyout of Chrysler. Since that time, Iacocca has not hidden his disdain

for the Board's decision and for certain members of the Board who played a role

in compelling his retirement. In defiance of the Board's directives, Iacocca has

sought in various ways to restore to himself the greatest possible measures of

the power he held as Chrysler's Chairman and CEO.

<P>

 28. During the summer of 1992,

Iacocca raised the subject of his upcoming retirement with Kerkorian while

staying on Kerkorian's private yacht during the Olympic Games in Barcelona,

Spain. By the end of their Barcelona meeting, Iacocca and Kerkorian had decided

to work together to pressure Chrysler to increase Iacocca's influence after he

retired. Soon afterwards, on August 6, 1992, Kerkorian wrote to Chrysler's Board

proclaiming that his interest in Chrysler was tied to Iacocca's continuing role

as CEO. It was reported that, in making this statement, "Mr. Kerkorian may be

acting at the direct or implied request of Mr. Iacocca." In contrast to his

personal resistance to the Board's directive that he retire, Iacocca had written

as follows about CEOs who will not relinquish their power: "[A] CEO has to know

when it's time to step down. A strong leader in good health never wants to leave.

He operates with blinders on about this issue and when you mention retirement to

him he gets the shakes. ... your attitude becomes that you're in good health and

the company can't do without you then you've overstayed your welcome. " Kerkorian

indicated to Chrysler that he had expected Iacocca to remain Chairman through

1994 and raised the possible need for a Kerkorian representative -- obviously

Iacocca -- on Chrysler's Board. Kerkorian withdrew this demand only after

receiving assurances that Iacocca would continue as a Director and as Chairman of

the Board's Executive Committee following his retirement. 

<P>

   29. In clear violation of Iacocca's ongoing fiduciary duty and the Consulting

Agreement, Iacocca disclosed confidential information regarding Chrysler to

Kerkorian at least as early as the period of Iacocca's consultancy. These

communications did not take place at the direction or under the supervision of

Chrysler's Chairman and CEO, and were not under the auspices of the Board, as the

Consulting Agreement required. Iacocca had numerous discussions with Kerkorian

without ever obtaining prior authorization and without notifying Chrysler either

before or after the fact. Iacocca used the resources available as a result of his

consulting position -- including continued access to confidential information,

office space, staff support, telephones, and expense accounts -- to discuss,

develop, and further his plans with Kerkorian and Tracinda. 

<P>

   30. In August of 1994, Iacocca and Kerkorian met to discuss a joint strategy

respecting Chrysler with Robert Day (head of the Trust Company of the West) and

Gary Wilson (currently co-chairman of Northwest Airlines Corporation and an

experienced leveraged buyout specialist) at Day's vacation home in Massachusetts.

Among other things, they discussed possible methods of increasing the short-term

market price of Chrysler shares. They also discussed the possibility of a buyout

of Chrysler that would gamer them substantial profits and restore Iacocca to a

position of leadership and power. Throughout these discussions and the planning

described above, which occurred during the period of Iacocca's Consulting

Agreement with Chrysler, Iacocca provided confidential information to the

participants, and otherwise assisted them in considering how to achieve a

leveraged buyout of Chrysler. Iacocca participated in this meeting and provided

this information without prior authorization from Chrysler. He did not report the

meeting to Chrysler at any time. His participation in the meeting was contrary to

his fiduciary duties to Chrysler and to his obligations under the Consulting

Agreement. 

<P>

   31. In connection with the Massachusetts meeting, Iacocca used his position

within Chrysler to obtain a list of Chrysler's largest shareholders, without

disclosing the true reasons why he wanted that list. After receiving the list,

Iacocca provided that information to Kerkorian, Day and Wilson. 

<P>

   32. In the months following the Massachusetts meeting, Wilson and one of his

associates worked to develop a financial model for a proposed leveraged buyout of

Chrysler. With Kerkorian's encouragement, Iacocca provided extensive confidential

information to assist in the development of that model, once again without

disclosing to anyone at Chrysler that he was participating in such discussions. 

<P>

   33.   On November 14, 1994, after extensive consultation with Iacocca,

Kerkorian filed under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act for clearance to increase his

holdings of Chrysler's stock to 15%. On the same day, Kerkorian also wrote a

letter to Chrysler's Board, demanding that Chrysler: (a) repeal or loosen the

protective measures in its shareholders' rights plan, (b) issue a two-for-one

stock split, (c) buy back a significant portion of its outstanding common stock,

and (d) increase the dividends on its stock. These demands echoed positions that

Iacocca had asserted in a May 1994 letter addressed to the Board, but also

provided to Kerkorian. Kerkorian threatened to initiate appropriate action,

including possible litigation, if his demands were not met by December 15, 1994.

In an interview dated April 14, 1995, Iacocca admitted that his work with

Kerkorian leading to Tracinda's April 1995 purported offer to take over Chrysler

grew out of this November 14 request: "[t]his all started [in November of 1994]

when [Kerkorian] tried to get the dividend up.... [Kerkorian] looked at me and

said, 'Are you happy?' No? Then it centers on: Do you [Chrysler] need $7.5

billion in cash." Despite the close cooperation, information exchanges and joint

strategic efforts of Iacocca and Kerkorian that were taking place during the

period, Kerkorian's Hart-Scott-Rodino filing and his three Schedule 13D filings

in late 1994 did not disclose that Iacocca was acting in concert with Kerkorian.

Iacocca also failed to file a Schedule 13D at this time revealing his

relationship to Kerkorian and their joint plans. 

<P>

   34. In mid-December of 1994, during a discussion with Chrysler's current

Chairman and CEO, Robert Eaton, Kerkorian urged Chrysler management to consider a

buyout of Chrysler. Eaton rejected the suggestion. Iacocca did not cease his

activities after learning that Chrysler's CEO had indicated that Chrysler was not

interested in a buyout. Instead, Iacocca continued to provide confidential

information to Kerkorian and others, and to work on achieving the result he knew

Chrysler did not consider to be in its shareholders' best interest -- without

disclosing his activities to Chrysler or its Board. 



<H4>The Attempted Takeover Of

Chrysler</h4>

<P>

   35. In March of 1995, Wilson sought and obtained another meeting with

Chrysler's senior management, indicating that he had been participating in

discussions with Iacocca and that, at Iacocca's recommendation, he had a

different proposal to discuss. The proposal, which contained and was purported to

be based on financial analyses that Iacocca had significantly assisted in

developing, was for a buyout in which Iacocca would provide substantial guidance.

Chrysler representatives al: the meeting expressed no interest in pursuing this

proposal. On April 10, 1995, Kerkorian's representatives met with Chrysler's

management to try to persuade them to join a leveraged buyout based on the model

hat Wilson had developed in consultation with Iacocca. Again, Chrysler's

management disclaimed any interest. 36.   On April 12, 1995, Kerkorian sent an

unsolicited letter to Eaton purporting to make an offer to buy all outstanding

Chrysler shares for $55, based on a model that Wilson had developed in

consultation with Iacocca, and publicly announced his intention to buy the

company. Iacocca provided his services and his knowledge in the development of

this unsolicited purported offer without seeking or obtaining from Chrysler any

authorization to provide such services or information. 37. In initiating the

purported offer, Kerkorian sought to sway public support and overcome his

negative image as a raider who enriches himself at the expense of companies,

their shareholders, and other stakeholders by asserting that Iacocca, by virtue

of his knowledge of Chrysler, legitimized the offer. In presenting Iacocca in

this way, Tracinda made clear that it viewed the information Iacocca had conveyed

as not publicly known, highly detailed and of a nature and scope that gave

Tracinda an informational advantage over other Chrysler shareholders. Tracinda

executive Alex Yemenidjian, referring to Iacocca, stated: 

<P><blockquote>

 "[I]n an advisory capacity, given the extensive knowledge that Lee has in the

car business, he could certainly be a very good advisor to us, and obviously we

don't know as much about the car business as Lee does. In fact, very few people

in the world know as much about the car business as he does, and I think that the

fact that he is prepared to risk his own money in [the] transaction gives us a

lot of comfort, because he knows exactly every nook and cranny of this

company.... Lee Iacocca is a perfect example of an investor who is not only

prepared to put a substantial amount of his net worth on the line but also

because of his knowledge of the business to us we consider that a strategic

investor." (emphasis added) </blockquote>

<P>

    Iacocca similarly encouraged the press to understand that he was working

closely with Kerkorian and Tracinda, and that his comprehensive and unique

knowledge about Chrysler made Tracinda's proposed buyout more viable. 38. In the

days after Tracinda announced its purported offer, Iacocca issued public

statements that were critical of Chrysler and its products. These remarks, like

other public criticisms Iacocca had volunteered during the period of his

Consulting Agreement, were harmful to Chrysler and its shareholders. The remarks

were made without prior authorization by or consultation with Chrysler and were

made for the purpose of disparaging and destabilizing the company. 

<P>

    39.   Iacocca has admitted that Tracinda's April 12, 1995 purported offer

was made to alert investors to the company's value in hopes that other buyers

would bid even more." As Iacocca observed in 1988: 

<P>

    "In observing these raiders I've noticed a curious phenomenon. When they're

on the attack they shout their holier-than-thou pitch about making companies more

efficient liquefying capital and defending the helpless stockholder. But a funny

thing happens to these dedicated missionaries once you cross their palms with a

little dough -- they go away. ... [you might as well put anyone who appeals to

you into play. ' That's the new jargon down on Wall Street. Another term for it

is unadulterated greed. " Indeed, Yemenidjian admitted that "[t]here is a number

at which we would be sellers rather than buyers." This approach was consistent

with Kerkorian's 25-year track record of converting partial or controlling

interests in major corporations into multi-million dollar personal profits

without regard to the interests of those corporations or their other

shareholders. 

<P>

    40. Recognizing the threat of severe damage to Chrysler posed by the

purported takeover offer, all of the credit rating agencies immediately voiced

concerns about Chrysler's ability to service its debt and to survive the next

downtown in the automobile market. Standard & Poor's Corporation placed Chrysler

on "credit watch with negative implications." Moody's Investors Service put

Chrysler debt on "watch." Duff & Phelps Credit Rating Company placed the debt of

both Chrysler and Chrysler Financial Corporation on "review of! possible

downgrade." Such actions by the ratings agencies prompted an increase in the

interest rates on Chrysler's current debt. Renegotiation of an advantageous new

revolving credit facility by Chrysler Financial Corporation was interrupted in

mid- stream when lenders insisted on new covenants to protect against the

prospect of a financially weakened Chrysler. 

<P>

   41. The reaction to the purported April 1995 offer from financial analysts,

Chrysler's lenders, suppliers, and dealers, the United Auto Workers and others

was uniformly negative. The proposal was announced without any financing in

place, and Iacocca and Kerkorian were unable to line up financing and equity

investors to support the buyout. After initially responding that Chrysler was not

for sale on April 12, Chrysler's Board definitively rejected the purported offer

on April 26. Despite the declarations of the Board respecting its view that the

proposed transaction was adverse to Chrysler and its shareholders, Iacocca

continued his relationship with Kerkorian, continued giving information to

Kerkorian and continued to participate in a takeover of Chrysler. Kerkorian's

purported offer remained open, with Iacocca's participation, until Kerkorian

withdrew it on May 31, 1995. Iacocca continued to work to further Kerkorian's

adverse purposes even after the purported offer was withdrawn. 

<P>

    42. Iacocca's conduct affected Chrysler adversely in numerous ways,

including that Chrysler's management was required to expend valuable time and

resources to address and defend against Tracinda's purported buyout proposal

(which was neither adequate nor in the best interests of Chrysler's

shareholders), that Chrysler was required to incur additional costs in securing

loans and placing debt as a result of the purported offer, that Chrysler must

defend numerous class action lawsuits filed in the wake of the purported offer,

and that Chrysler's dealers were harmed in their ability to sell the company's

products by Iacocca's disparaging remarks. 43. Throughout the period of his

developing relationship with Kerkorian and in the course of divulging Chrysler's

confidential information, Iacocca knew or should have known that his

participation in their self-serving plans violated his duties to Chrysler and was

not in Chrysler's or its shareholders' best interests. Iacocca's writings from

1988 acknowledge that the interests of Chrysler and its shareholders would not be

served, as follows: 

<P><blockquote>

  "These raiders were really interested in saving American business from is

incompetent management where were they back in 1980 when Chrysler was flat on its

back. One thing I never had to worry about in those days was a raider coming

around because Chrysler wasn't worth looting. ... You see the typical takeover

target isn't a company in trouble. It's a company with a solid asset base low

debt consistent profits and a few bucks in the bank to help it get through the

next business downturn. ... When I went to school we called that good

management."' Iacocca's Compensation From Tracinda </blockquote>

<P>

 44.   A Tracinda Schedule 13D filing in April of 1995 revealed for the first

time the extent of Iacocca's relationship with Kerkorian and that Iacocca would

be highly compensated by Kerkorian for his role. In a June 1995 Schedule 13D

Amendment, Iacocca and Kerkorian disclosed that Iacocca and Tracinda had

formalized Iacocca's compensation arrangements. Iacocca's package included a

"Consulting Agreement" that provided and continues to provide Iacocca with

$41,666.67 per month for his consulting services related exclusively to

Kerkorian's interest in Chrysler, plus a "Value Sharing Agreement," pursuant to

which he is to receive 4% of the amount by which the market value of 32 million

of Tracinda's Chrysler shares exceeds $47 per share when they are sold or, if

they are not sold, at the end of four years. To protect Iacocca from the economic

risk of the breaches of his contractual and fiduciary duties owed to Chrysler,

the Value Sharing Agreement also provided that Tracinda would indemnify Iacocca

against the consequences of such wrongdoing. These exorbitant payments and

extensive indemnification provisions reflect compensation for Iacocca's

willingness to make Chrysler's confidential information available to Kerkorian

and Tracinda. 

<P>

   45. The Value Sharing Agreement memorializes that Iacocca essentially sold to

Kerkorian and Tracinda the right to control Iacocca's actions with respect to

Chrysler and the performance of Iacocca's obligations to Chrysler. Iacocca's

compensation from Tracinda can be completely terminated if Iacocca contacts

Chrysler or takes any action with respect to Chrysler that is not specifically

directed by Tracinda, with very limited exceptions. Iacocca's Attempts To

Exercise His Stock Options. And Continuing Involvement With Kerkorian And

Tracinda 

<P>

   46. Immediately following his entry into the Consulting and Value Sharing

Agreements with Kerkorian, Iacocca informed Chrysler on June 28, 1995, of his

intention to exercise options for 112,500 shares of Chrysler stock, pursuant to

the stock option agreements Chrysler and Iacocca entered into while Iacocca was a

Chrysler employee. Chrysler responded by providing to Iacocca the opportunity to

explain why his prior actions did not violate the conditions precedent to his

exercise of those options. In his reply, Iacocca did not deny that his activities

constituted rendering services to Kerkorian and were unauthorized; nor did he

offer to sever his ties with Kerkorian. Instead, he challenged Chrysler's right

to enforce the provisions of the Stock Option Plan. After considering all

relevant information, Chrysler's Stock Option Committee (which is comprised of

three independent directors) and the full Board unanimously determined that

Iacocca's attempt to exercise his options should be rejected because of his

noncompliance with the conditions precedent to the options' exercise. Chrysler's

Stock Option Plan vests the Board with "full power and authority to interpret and

construe" the Plan, and provides that the Board's actions undertaken in good

faith are "final and conclusive." Iacocca has persisted in contending that he is

entitled to exercise the options, despite the fact that his own writings support

the Board's decision and acknowledge that the purported take over of Chrysler was

contrary to Chrysler's best interests. In 1988, Iacocca wrote: 

<P><blockquote>

    "My other unwavering rule is that I won't do an unfriendly merger. That's a

mind-set of mine. Maybe somebody who succeeds me will attempt a hostile merger

but I just can't. To me it goes against human nature not just my nature. It's an

aberration to come in and tell people that you're going to take them over whether

they like it or not. That's being the schoolyard bully.... Things had gone

entirely too far in Wall Street's version of Monopoly. ... Were [corporate

raiders] really Robin Hood and his Merry Men as they claimed? Or were they

Genghis Han and the Mongol hordes?" <P></blockquote>



    47.   On September 5, 1995, Tracinda announced that it had appointed Jerome

B. York as Tracinda's Vice Chairman and, like Iacocca, as a director of

Kerkorian's GM Grand, Inc. When Iacocca was Chairman and CEO of Chrysler, York

had been Chrysler's Chief Financial Officer. Since York's hiring, he and Iacocca

have continued to speak regularly to each other -- at least "twice a week"

according to public statements by York -- and to Kerkorian's other advisors about

Chrysler's business and about Kerkorian's investment in Chrysler. 

<P>

  48.   On October 25, 1995, Iacocca and the other members of the Kerkorian

group" filed a Schedule 13D amendment, indicating that Tracinda has requested

that Chrysler undertake certain actions dealing with control of Chrysler,

including the following: 

<P><UL>

   a. Board membership for York and two other persons mutually agreeable to

Chrysler and Tracinda; 

<P>

   b. Requiring shareholder approval of issuances of significant amounts of

Chrysler's blank check preferred stock and other block placements of voting

stock; and 

<P>

   c. Raising the threshold under the company's poison pill rights plan from 15%

to 20%. 

<P></ul>

   49.   On November 3, 1995, Iacocca and Tracinda entered into an agreement

designed to support Iacocca in litigation over his assertion of entitlement to

exercise the options, and to provide Iacocca with protection against economic

loss resulting because the options are not exercisable, as a consequence of

Iacocca's dealings with Tracinda. The agreement provides that Tracinda will

reimburse Iacocca for up to $2 million in potential legal fees in an action

against Chrysler over his stock options. Moreover, Iacocca and his attorneys (who

must be reasonably acceptable to Tracinda) are required to "coordinate and

consult with Tracinda and its legal counsel in connection" with the action. In

the event there is not an entirely favorable outcome of the action, Tracinda will

pay to Iacocca the difference between $42 million and what he has received,

including previous payments under the Value Sharing Agreement. In the event

Iacocca does not receive a value of at least $42 million (through a favorable

outcome of the action plus values based on his stock options), Tracinda will also

make payments to Iacocca under the Value Sharing Agreement Tracinda told the

press it was "standing behind a good friend" as the purported rationale for

underwriting Iacocca's conduct. The result of the agreement is essentially that

Iacocca's economic risk as to any interest in Chrysler stock options is

substantially diminished, to the extent the risk is actually being taken by

Tracinda and Kerkorian. 

<P>

   50.   On November 21, 1995, Tracinda filed with the SEC preliminary proxy

materials in which Tracinda advocates proposals related to control of the

company, including placing York on the Chrysler Board, increasing the size of the

Board, formation of a committee to review cash retention policies, restrictions

on issuance of Chrysler's "blank check" preferred stock and block placements of

common stock, and changes to the company's poison pill rights plan. 

<P>

   51. Iacocca continues as of the date of this Complaint to provide services to

Kerkorian and Tracinda without Chrysler's approval. 



<H4>   FIRST CLAIM </H4>



    (Breach Of Contract) 

<P>

   52. Chrysler repeats and realleges each and every allegation contained in

paragraphs 1 through 51 of this Complaint as if fully set forth herein. 

<P>

   53.   Iacocca's June 11, 1992, Consulting Agreement with Chrysler imposed the

following obligations, among others, upon Iacocca: 

<P><blockquote>

  "Confidentiality. You agree to maintain the confidentiality of any material,

nonpublic information concerning the business and affairs of the Company which is

disclosed to you or to which you otherwise become privy in connection with the

performance of the services and duties contemplated hereby. You further agree

that you will not publish, either as author or co-author, without the prior

written approval of the Company, any confidential information concerning the

business and affairs of the Company which may be shared with or developed by you

in the performance of your services hereunder." 

<P>

  "Noncomplete. During the term of this agreement, you agree that you will not

accept employment which is, or render services which are, detrimental or inimical

to the interests of Chrysler, nor will you conduct yourself or affiliate or

otherwise associate with any person, firm or entity in a manner which subjects

you or any 'group' to a reporting obligation pursuant to section 13(d) of the

[Exchange Act] . . . or which, in the good faith judgment of the Company's Board,

adversely affects or conflicts with the interests of Chrysler. " 

<P></blockquote>

    The Consulting Agreement also provided that Iacocca's activities relating to

Chrysler were to be pursued exclusively "in close association with the Chairman

and CEO and under the general auspices of the Board." 

<P>

   54. Implied in this agreement is a covenant of good faith and fair dealing. 

<P>

   55. Despite Chrysler's due performance of its obligations and all conditions

to Iacocca's performance, Iacocca materially breached the express and implied

provisions of the Consulting Agreement by: 

<P><UL>

   a. disclosing, without Chrysler's consent or knowledge, Chrysler's

confidential information (including material information) to outside parties,

including Kerkorian and Tracinda; 

<P>

   b. making disparaging statements about Chrysler and its products, in a manner

contrary to the interests of Chrysler and its shareholders; 



  <P> c. conducting himself in a manner adverse to and in conflict with Chrysler's

interests; 

<P>

   d. associating with others whose interests were adverse to and in conflict

with Chrysler's; consulting with, and performing services for, Kerkorian and

Tracinda in connection with their investments and joining with them in a group

that he should have reported under Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act; 

<P>

    f. performing these actions independently of, and without disclosure to,

Chrysler's CEO or the Board; and 

<P>

   g. otherwise acting in ways that were inimical to Chrysler's interests. 

<P></UL>

   56. As a result of his breaches of contract, Iacocca has proximately caused

actual and consequential damimages to Chrysler. The damimages to which Chrysler is

entitled include, but are not limited to, the return of all compensation paid to

Iacocca by Chrysler during the period of such wrongdoing, all costs incurred by

Chrysler in addressing and defending against the purported buyout proposal put

forward by Iacocca and Kerkorian, all additional costs incurred by Chrysler in

securing loans and placing debt as a result of the purported buyout offer, and

other damimages to be determined. Additionally, with respect to Iacocca's

continuing use and disclosure of Chrysler's nonpublic information, Chrysler has

been irreparably injured, has no adequate remedy at law, and is entitled to

preliminary and permanent injunctive relief against Iacocca. 



<H4>   SECOND CLAIM </H4>



 (Breach Of Fiduciary Duty) 

<P>

   57. Chrysler repeats and realleges each and every allegation contained in

paragraphs I through 51 of this Complaint as if fully set forth herein. 

<P>

   58. Since November of 1978, Iacocca has had extensive knowledge of Chrysler

and Chrysler's confidential information. Indeed, Iacocca has said he knows more

about the inner workings of Chrysler than virtually anyone else. As an employee

and former employee, Iacocca has had (and continues to have) fiduciary duties to

Chrysler and its shareholders to act in good faith and with undivided loyalty for

Chrysler's benefit, which duties were particularly substantial due to Iacocca's

public prominence as the virtual personification of Chrysler. 

<P>

    59. Chrysler reposed in Iacocca its trust and confidence during the more

than 13 years when Iacocca was Chairman and CEO of Chrysler, during the nine

months after his retirement when he continued as a director of Chrysler, during

the two years of his consultancy, and during the period following his consultancy

when he continued to possess confidential information. Iacocca recognized and

voluntarily invited Chrysler's trust and confidence, and undertook to act on

behalf of Chrysler. Iacocca has a continuing duty not to disclose or utilize the

confidential information concerning Chrysler that has come into his possession . 

<P>

   60. It has at all times been Chrysler's policy to maintain the secrecy of its

confidential information and to prohibit disclosure of such information. It has

also been Chrysler's established policy to maintain the confidentiality of

information "when its release would be detrimental to the competitive, financial

or other business interests of the Corporation." Chrysler's policy calls for the

review and concurrence of Chrysler's Public Affairs Office before any such

confidential information is disclosed outside Chrysler. 

<P>

   61. Even while holding himself out as Chrysler's faithful fiduciary, Iacocca,

for his own benefit and for the benefit of Kerkorian and Tracinda, misused the

confidential information that Chrysler entrusted to him by communicating it to

Kerkorian. 

<P>

   62. Iacocca has breached his fiduciary duty to Chrysler and to its other

shareholders, including his duties of good faith and undivided loyalty.

Additionally, during the course of his employment by and consultancy with

Chrysler, Iacocca learned confidential information constituting Chrysler trade

secrets. Such information included, but is not limited to, financial and economic

policies and procedures; methods of operating, planning and forecasting; future

products and business plans; corporate strategy and methods of strategic

planning, economic forecasting analyses; assessments, plans and strategies

relating to Kerkorian and Tracinda; and other aspects of Chrysler's business and

operations that would be highly valuable if learned by third parties. Iacocca

used Chrysler's trade secrets for his own benefit by disclosing them to Kerkorian

and Tracinda in return for lucrative compensation. Iacocca made all of the

foregoing disclosures without Chrysler's consent, in violation of his fiduciary

duties to Chrysler, and in contravention of established Chrysler policies

designed to protect such information from disclosure. 

<P>

   63. Iacocca's actions have injured Chrysler, including the injury resulting

from the deprivation of the exclusive use of its confidential information, and

Chrysler should be awarded the resulting damimages. Chrysler should also be awarded

the profits realized by Iacocca through his unlawful breaches of fiduciary duty,

because Iacocca's actions have resulted in his unjust enrichment at Chrysler's

expense. 

<P>

   64. In committing the foregoing acts, Iacocca has acted willfully, wantonly,

maliciously, and outrageously to injure Chrysler, and especially Chrysler's

reputation and good will. Chrysler cannot be made whole by an award of

compensatory damimages and the profits realized by Iacocca, and is therefore

entitled to exemplary damimages. 

<P>

   65. With respect to Iacocca's ongoing and prospective breaches of fiduciary

duty, Chrysler has been irreparably injured, has no adequate remedy at law, and

is entitled to preliminary and permanent injunctive relief against Iacocca's

continuing use and disclosure of Chrysler's nonpublic information. 



<H4>   THIRD CLAIM</H4>



  (Accounting For Profits) 

<P>

   66. Chrysler repeats and realleges each and every allegation contained in

paragraphs 1 through 51 of this Complaint as if fully set forth herein. 

<P>

   67. As compensation for Iacocca's breaches of fiduciary duty, he has obtained

and entered into extremely lucrative agreements with Kerkorian and Tracinda. The

amounts already paid or in the future to be paid to Iacocca pursuant to those

agreements reflect compensation for Iacocca's unauthorized disclosure of

Chrysler's confidential information 

<P>

   68. Chrysler is entitled to an accounting by Iacocca of his profits under

those agreements and under any other agreements for his unjust enrichment

resulting from his disclosure of information rightfully belonging to Chrysler and

not to him. 

<P>

   69. Chrysler has no adequate remedy at law. 



<H4>    FOURTH CLAIM </H4>



    (Declaratory Relief On Stock Option Rights) 

<P>

   70. Chrysler repeats and realleges each and every allegation of paragraphs 1

through 51 as if fully set forth herein. 

<P>

   71. As the former CEO and Chairman of Chrysler, Iacocca had acquired options

to purchase a total of approximately 1.55 million shares of Chrysler common

stock. These options expire on various dates. 

<P>

   72. The option rights are governed by the terms of Chrysler's Stock Option

Plan and its 1991 Stock Compensation Plan, to which Iacocca agreed, for good and

valuable consideration. In particular, the right to exercise options after the

option holder's termination of employment is subject to the satisfaction of

express contractual preconditions. 

<P>

   73. Section 8 of the Stock Option Plan provides: 

<P>

 "[T]he exercise of any option after termination of employment shall be subject

to satisfaction of the conditions precedent that the Option Holder neither, (a)

takes other employment or renders services to others without the written consent

of the Corporation, nor (b) conducts himself in a manner adversely affecting the

Corporation." 

<P>

    74.   Section 5(b)(vii) of the 1991 Stock Compensation Plan provides: 

<P><blockquote>

 "[T]he exercise of any Stock Option after termination of employment shall be

subject to satisfaction of the conditions precedent that the Optionee neither,

(x) takes other employment or renders services to others without the written

consent of the Company, nor (y) conducts himself in a manner adversely affecting

the Company." </blockquote>



   75. Iacocca and Chrysler have entered into separate written option agreements

with respect to each grant of stock option rights. An example of such an option

agreement, virtually identical to all others, is attached as Exhibit D and

incorporated by reference. The option agreements all incorporate the conditions

precedent set forth above and provide that any waiver by Chrysler of a provision

of the option agreement shall not operate as or be construed to be a subsequent

waiver of the same provision or a waiver of any other provision. 

<P>

    76. Chrysler has performed, and/or has been excused from performing, all of

its obligations under its Stock Option Plan and its 1991 Stock Compensation Plan

with respect to Iacocca. 

<P>

    77. Iacocca failed to obtain Chrysler's written consent to the rendition of

services to Kerkorian and Tracinda (within the meaning of Section 8 and Section

5(b)(vii) of the plans), including among other services: 

<P><UL>

  a. services provided in planning and implementing Tracinda's April 1995

unsolicited purported offer to take over Chrysler; 

<P>

   b. services provided pursuant to Iacocca's May 9, 1995 consulting agreement

with Tracinda, which expressly requires the consent of Tracinda with respect to

certain of Iacocca's actions concerning Chrysler; and 

<P>

   c. services in the form of supplying Chrysler's confidential information to

Kerkorian and Tracinda, and otherwise supporting Tracinda's efforts. 

<P></ul>

   78.    Iacocca has conducted himself in a manner "adversely affecting"

Chrysler (within the meaning of Section 8 and Section 5(b)(vii) of the plans) by,

among other things: 

<P><UL>

   a. forming a group within the meaning of Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act

with Kerkorian and Tracinda; 

<P>

   b. assisting in development and implementation of Tracinda's April 1995

unsolicited purported offer to take over Chrysler; 

<P>

   c. continuing to participate in the April 1995 purported offer after

announcements by the Chrysler board that it had determined the purported offer

was not in the best interests of Chrysler or its shareholders; 

<P>

   d. continuing to participate with Kerkorian, York, and others in activities

adverse to Chrysler, for the purpose of profiting from their joint efforts to

increase the short- term value of Chrysler stock holdings and without regard to

the long-term interests of Chrysler; and 

<P>

   e. publicly disparaging Chrysler and its products. 

<P></UL>

   79.    Chrysler's Stock Option Committee and Board acted in good faith, and

within their contractually provided powers in rejecting Iacocca's request to

exercise options, based on his noncompliance with the contractual preconditions

to their exercise. Iacocca nevertheless has continued to insist that the options

are exercisable, and has arranged to have Tracinda provide substantial financial

support to his efforts to restore his options through litigation. 

<P>

   80. Because there is an immediate, actual and substantial controversy between

Chrysler and Iacocca, Chrysler seeks a declaratory judgment, pursuant to Michigan

Court Rules 2.111 and 2.605, that the Board was legally justified in refusing to

permit Iacocca to exercise option rights to purchase Chrysler's stock. 



<H4>   IRREPARABLE INJURY </H4>



   81. Iacocca continues to breach his fiduciary duties and continues to

disclose and utilize confidential information of Chrysler. 

<P>

   82. Chrysler and its shareholders will suffer irreparable injury if these

breaches of fiduciary duty continue, if defendant continues to disclose

confidential information, if defendant is not required to undo the injuries

caused by his violations, and if defendant is allowed to benefit from his

violations. 

<P>

   83. Iacocca and his "group" may undertake further attempts to obtain control

of Chrysler, as well as proxy fights, and Chrysler has been, and will continue to

be, deprived of the exclusive use of its material, nonpublic information. 

<P>

   84. Chrysler and its shareholders will continue to be injured by disclosure

of Chrysler's highly valuable, proprietary and/or material, nonpublic information

to Kerkorian and Tracinda. 

<P>

   85. Uncertainty in the marketplace created by Iacocca's conduct, along with

speculation about Chrysler's future and its survival as a going concern caused by

Iacocca's conduct, have damaged and continue to damage Chrysler in a manner that

is unquantifiable. <P>

   86. Chrysler has no adequate remedy at law. 



<H4>  PRAYER FOR RELIEF </H4>



   WHEREFORE, Chrysler demands judgment against Iacocca and respectfully

requests that Chrysler be granted the following relief. 



   a. For Iacocca's breach of contract and breaches of fiduciary duty

compensatory damimages, including, but not limited to, the return of all

compensation paid to Iacocca by Chrysler during the period of such wrongdoing,

all costs incurred by Chrysler in addressing and defending against the purported

buyout proposal put forward by Iacocca and Kerkorian, all additional costs

incurred by Chrysler in securing loans and placing debt as a result of the

purported buyout offer, and other damimages to be determined. 

<P>

   b. For Iacocca's breaches of fiduciary duty: exemplary damimages in an amount

to be determined, and an accounting for all profits and other compensation that

Iacocca has unjustly obtained from Kerkorian and Tracinda in return for

wrongfully disclosing Chrysler's confidential information. 

<P>

   c. For Iacocca's breach of contract in continuing to use and disclose

confidential information and breaches of fiduciary duty preliminary and permanent

injunctive relief against Iacocca's continuing use and disclosure of Chrysler's

nonpublic information 

<P>

   d. For Iacocca's noncompliance with the conditions precedent to the exercise

of his stock options: a declaration that the Board was legally justified in

refusing to permit Iacocca to exercise option rights to purchase Chrysler's

stock. 

<P>

   e. For all claims: Chrysler's attorneys' fees and costs in this action. 

<P>

   f. Such other relief as the Court may deem just and proper. 

<P>

<H3><a name=intro>I. INTRODUCTION</a></h3><p>
The late 1980's and early 1990's witnessed a conspicuous rise in public
disparagement of lawyers and the judicial process. The diminished respect for
the profession expressed itself in sour humor, opinion polls, editorial columns
and in some reflective commentary. This was not an entirely new phenomenon;
American lawyers, like their English forebears, had for centuries been
vulnerable to periodic bouts of public disdain. <p>
In some respects, however, the mood at the outset of the decade was different.
For one thing, the lowered esteem of the legal profession coincided
paradoxically with the arrival in its ranks of unprecedented numbers of new
lawyers. These freshly-minted attorneys, turned out by a record number of law
schools across the land, had chosen the law as their life's work at just the
moment this choice was more and more held up to ridicule and criticism. At the
same time, too, changes in the profession that had been long in the making were
increasingly being felt. The sheer numbers of lawyers and the dissolution of
traditional long-standing relationships between lawyer and client combined to
increase sharply competition among lawyers. This in turn promoted more
pervasive and aggressive advertising and heightened the commercialization of
the "client-getting" process. Increased technology posed new opportunities and
challenges for the practice of law. More severe economic pressures faced both
young lawyers entering practice saddled with heavy student debts and start-up
costs and established practitioners confronted with rising overheads, heavy
competition and stiffer fee resistance. The rise in the mobility of lawyers
weakened the ties to firms, institutions and communities in which professional
standards traditionally had been articulated and enforced. <p>
In 1993, a series of measures had been enacted in the wake of a Report to the
Chief Judge and the Administrative Board of the Courts to address criticism of
practices in the matrimonial field. But the crisis of confidence and morale
generated by external disparagement and internal change seemed broader than one
segment of the practice. Accordingly, in the belief that an organized and
systematic inquiry under official auspices would be useful, Chief Judge Judith
Kaye appointed this Committee in 1993. <p>
The Chief Judge, after noting the history of the matrimonial practice reforms,
observed that "it is apparent that the discontent is broader, and that public
confidence in the entire legal system has seriously eroded." The Committee was
charged with considering wider application of the matrimonial reforms as well
as other measures, and encouraged to consult widely with the bench, bar and
public "in defining the sources of the public dissatisfaction and in devising
recommendations to address it."[fn 1] <p>
In this Report, the Committee responds to that charge, and does so unanimously.
After describing the Committee itself, and the approach it took to its work,
the Report presents a general view of the current state of the legal profession
in New York and its views on the principal sources of public discontent. In
succeeding sections, the Report offers the Committee's recommendations --
necessarily addressed to several audiences -- for improvements required to
raise both the actual level of professional and judicial responsiveness to the
public and also the level of public confidence in the competence and integrity
of the profession and the courts. <p>
Many of the improvements we urge are made necessary by the aggregate impact of
the forces mentioned at the outset of this section. Together they have produced
a considerably more atomistic, competitive and impersonal kind of practice than
was common a generation ago. This in turn has made it harder for clients to
obtain lawyers they know well. It is thus easier for misunderstandings to arise
between lawyer and client, and harder to resolve those frictions harmoniously
and informally. The same forces have operated to make the risk of professional
lapse greater at the same time that the formal and informal arrangements that
had helped to prevent such lapses have weakened. All this makes it necessary,
in a world where the calendar cannot be turned back, to create new arrangements
to reinforce the old, to provide new measures that will increase clients'
access to information, reduce the incidence of avoidable misunderstanding,
resolve disputes fairly and quickly, prevent ethical violations from occurring
where possible, and impose discipline when violations do occur, in a way that
is fair and commands public confidence. In doing all of this, the Committee is
greatly encouraged by this single, most important finding: the actual level of
professionalism brought to bear on clients' affairs by thousands of lawyers
across the state, in court and office, day in and day out, is extraordinarily
high. Overwhelmingly, the practicing lawyers of New York earn the respect of
their clients on a daily basis. <p>
But the essence of a self-governing profession is that it have and use the
capacity for critical self-examination. It must then exercise its autonomous
powers to improve its service and to meet new challenges generated by changing
times. It is in that spirit that the Committee recommends the measures in this
Report.  <p>
<B>THE COMMITTEE</B><p>
The sixteen members of the Committee are identified in Appendix A. All were
appointed by the Chief Judge, but half of the members were proposed by the
Presiding Justices of the four Appellate Divisions, each of whom designated a
member of the court and an attorney practicing in the Department to serve. No
member was selected as a representative of any organization or constituency,
although several hold or have held key posts in the state or important local
bar associations. <p>
In the aggregate, the Committee and its accumulated experience is very diverse.
In addition to Appellate Division justices from across the state, two trial
court judges serve on the Committee, one from Brooklyn and one from Rockland
County. A recently retired judge of the Court of Appeals, with a long history
of upstate practice and judicial service, also serves. The practicing lawyers
come from all the major centers of legal activity in New York, practice in
small and mid-sized firms as well as large, and work in a wide variety of
fields. The Committee was thus ready from its inception to recognize the
probability that conditions of practice -- and the measures appropriate to
improve them - would vary from place to place and from one kind of practice to
another. In reaching the recommendations set out in this Report, as will be
seen, the Committee has drawn on its diversity of background to balance the
desirability of uniform standards with the need to recognize important
differences in local circumstance. <p>
The Committee undertook its work as a whole. Members from all sectors of the
state attended hearings wherever they were held. Everyone received and gave
focused attention to all the written submissions and the background literature
assembled by the staff and by Committee members themselves. All recommendations
were fully discussed at meetings of the whole Committee and voted on a total of
three times -- once preliminarily, once after having presented a tentative
summary of proposals to forums of bar leaders from around the state, and
finally in formally adopting this Report. In each case, after full discussion,
the votes were unanimous.  <p>
<B>THE METHOD OF INQUIRY</B><p>
The Committee first approached its charge by supplementing its own considerable
aggregate experience by study, interviews and hearings. Its objective was to
gain as comprehensive and well considered a view as possible of the present
actual condition of the profession and its reputation in the state. There were
several parts to this threshold issue: What could be found out by study and
inquiry about the actual quality of service to the public by the bar and the
courts? What were the grievances the public held towards lawyers and the
courts? Were these complaints based on realistic expectations of the role and
function of the law and its instruments? What were the pressures felt by
lawyers and judges in their daily functions that affected their ability to meet
public requirements? To try to reach an understanding of these issues the
Committee embarked on a program of public meetings, study and consultation that
lasted almost two years. <p>
<B>STUDY AND CONSULTATIONS</B><p>
First, the Committee and its staff gathered and distributed, studied and
reviewed in its meetings, a vast amount of published material. Some of this was
from learned journals and dealt with considerations of sociology, economics,
ethics, history and public policy that underlie the very notion of the law as a
profession. Some were more popular works, by lawyers or lay persons viewing the
current state of the profession. Some were the product of previous committees'
efforts to address similar issues at the national level or in other states.
Some were drawn from that large array of commentaries about law and lawyers --
editorials, cartoons, organizational newsletters -- that in part precipitated
the creation of the Committee in the first place. A selective bibliography
listing the most useful materials consulted by the Committee in its studies is
set out in Appendix B. <p>
Next, throughout its work, the Committee consulted with experts in areas of
particular importance to its study. One of its meetings was devoted to a
seminar conducted by leading academic ethicists of the profession. Each of the
professors, after an initial presentation of his views as to the most important
questions facing the profession, participated in a robust discussion with each
other and the Committee over the views expressed. Taken with the review of the
literature that had gone before, the Committee found this session particularly
useful in allowing it to think through some of the more fundamental questions
implicated in its work. <p>
The Committee also met with the chief counsel of the departmental disciplinary
committees and the director of the Client Security Fund. All supplemented their
discussion with full written submissions. Taken as a whole, these materials
gave the Committee an essential view of the principal problems generating
disciplinary complaints, the practical constraints encountered in dealing with
them, methods used in various parts of the state that seemed effective in
handling the disciplinary function, and useful reactions to several suggestions
for changes in the disciplinary process that the Committee took into account in
formulating its own recommendations. <p>
The Committee also met with the deans, or their representatives, of most of the
law schools in New York and with a large number of administrative judges from
districts around the state, who attended meetings in Syracuse, Buffalo, Albany
and Central Islip and participated "en banc" at a full Committee meeting. Each
of these groups furnished the Committee with concrete viewpoints on the
profession and the courts, and an opportunity for dialogue and a testing of
ideas that study alone could not have allowed. <p>
This Committee was not alone working on interrelated subjects for the Chief
Judge or the Office of Court Administration. Among those other groups were
committees on Case Management, Legal Education, Electronic Recording of Court
Proceedings and Alternative Dispute Resolution. Through the generous
cooperation of the chairs of those committees and some fortuitous overlapping
memberships, a highly productive liaison between the Committee and its sisters
was maintained throughout.   <p>
<B>PUBLIC HEARINGS</B><p>
The Committee held public hearings, limited to users of legal services, in the
Fall of 1994. Separate, advertised hearings were conducted in Buffalo,
Manhattan, Albany, Central Islip and Syracuse. The advertisements inviting
interested individuals or groups to speak at the hearings also publicized a "
1-800" telephone line that the Committee kept open to receive public commentary
from those who could not or preferred not to appear at the hearings. The
Committee also invited written materials from the public and received a
substantial response, all of which was circulated to all the members. A list of
those testifying at the hearings is contained in Appendix C. <p>
Despite concerns in some quarters that these hearings would simply provide a
respectable forum for "lawyer bashing" and that interest groups would overwhelm
any useful testimony, the Committee concluded that the hearings were an
indispensable part of its work. For one thing the Committee's charge had
directed it to consult with the public. For another, it seemed illegitimate to
set about an inquiry into the relations between lawyers and clients without
creating an organized opportunity for clients to have their say. Further, the
Committee members wanted the opportunity to see and hear for themselves what
disappointed clients and action groups thought about the profession, to sense
from the emotional as well as the factual content of their presentations the
depth of the chasm between such witnesses and the bar. Finally, the Committee
members were reasonably satisfied that their own backgrounds and the dialogue
among them could prevent the Committee from being swept away by a tide of
ill-considered criticism. <p>
In the end, the hearings proved very useful in a number of ways. They did
describe a number of problems and suggested remedies that survived scrutiny and
are addressed in this Report. They did point up some areas in which clients
have unrealistic expectations of lawyers and other areas in which the bar needs
to do a better job of educating the public about its role and limitations. They
did serve as a reality check on some of the presuppositions members brought to
the inquiry. Witnesses suggested practical ways in which both lawyers, and even
overworked courts, can be more hospitable to those who have to use them. And,
finally, the hearings left the Committee with the impression that there are
indeed organized groups that are intractably hostile to the legal profession
and the American legal system, whose criticisms are exaggerated and whose
proposed reforms are unrealistic. The Committee concluded that its duty was to
offer reasoned, practical suggestions that could in fact help the profession
and the courts to meet the legitimate expectations of their clients.   <p>
<B>CONSULTATION WITH THE BAR</B><p>
The Committee was particularly eager to have the benefit of early and
continuous consultation with the practicing bar. Its advice was seen as very
important in developing the Committee's awareness of the diverse conditions of
practice throughout the state. The Committee also hoped to receive
recommendations from the bar for solutions to problems perceived by the public.
And the Committee felt the need to test the practical ramifications of measures
being considered for adoption by discussion with those who would have to carry
them out. From the very outset, the Committee pursued its work in a spirit of
genuine, open and receptive dialogue with the bar. <p>
That dialogue took several forms. In the Fall of 1994, on the eve of the public
hearings in Buffalo, Albany, Long Island and Syracuse, the Committee, using
lists provided by the New York State Bar Association, invited all the local and
regional bar organizations to send representatives to a meeting. At those
meetings, which were for the most part well attended, the Committee laid out
its approach and assured the bar leaders of its need and desire for their
collaboration. In return, the Committee received extensive comments from those
leaders as to local conditions, concerns they wished the Committee to bear in
mind, and reciprocal promises of a collaborative approach to the Committee's
work. <p>
A second round of forums with bar representatives was held in late Spring and
Summer 1995, after the Committee's recommendations had been tentatively
adopted. At those meetings, in Rochester, Manhattan and Mineola, the
Committee's views on key issues were presented and full and helpful commentary
was received from the numerous bar representatives present. <p>
In the interval between these two sets of formal meetings, continuous contact
was maintained between Committee representatives and several major bar
associations that had established special groups to consider and comment on
this Committee's work. In particular, throughout the course of its life, the
New York State Bar Association Task Force on the Profession, chaired by
Haliburton Fales, 2d, Esq., furnished information, advice and constructive
suggestions -- many of which this Committee has adopted. So, too, the
Association of the Bar of the City of New York, the New York County Lawyers'
Association, the Women's Bar Association, the bar associations of Brooklyn, and
of Erie, Monroe, Nassau, Onondaga and Suffolk counties and key specialized bar
groups furnished very useful materials and suggestions while the work was in
process. In addition, many bar association reports prepared quite independently
of this Committee, but addressed to topics within its mandate, proved very
helpful in shaping the Committee's views on several key issues. (The bar
association materials relied on by the Committee are included in Appendices B
and D.) <p>
Finally, the meetings with bar leaders, the public hearings, and coverage in
the legal and lay press about the Committee and its work prompted a substantial
volume of written commentary from judges and lawyers from many corners of the
state, offering their personal -- and often very illuminating -- views on the
subjects the Committee was studying. <p>
All in all, the Committee invited and received, as part of its consultative
process, a wide range of highly useful formal and informal comment from the
practicing bar in the state. That commentary has played an important role in
the formation of the views this Report expresses and the measures it
recommends. <p>
* * *<p>
In summary, the Committee sought to form its response to the Chief Judge's
charge by a process that was persistently and diligently open and inclusive. It
read widely, and consulted with all the principal sources of theoretical and
practical wisdom it could identify. It went out to all corners of the state to
meet in five hearings with the public and seven meetings with representatives
of the profession. It listened attentively and deliberated carefully. What
follows are the conclusions of that process, arrived at unanimously, and
reflecting the collective best view of the Committee members as to the measures
the profession must now take to ensure its effective response to the needs and
expectations of the public. <p>

<h3><a name=two>II. THE PROFESSION EXAMINED</a></h3><p>
<B>THE PROFESSIONAL IDEA</B><p>
A consideration of ways to fortify professionalism among lawyers profitably
begins with some notion of what the profession is. This Committee is far from
the first to ponder that question; a considerable literature about the subject
exists. We have found the definitions referred to in the 1986 report of the
American Bar Association Commission on Professionalism (the "Stanley Report")
to be especially useful in directing our approach to our task. <p>
Noting correctly that it had stood the test of time, the Stanley Report first
quoted Roscoe Pound's classic definition of a profession:<blockquote> <p>
"The term refers to a group . . . pursuing a learned art as a common calling in
the spirit of public service - no less a public service because it may
incidentally be a means of livelihood. Pursuit of the learned art in the spirit
of a public service is the primary purpose."[fn 1] </blockquote><p>
The Stanley Commission also developed a more elaborate, and perhaps more
modernistic, definition of its own, describing a profession as: <p>
<blockquote>
"An occupation whose members have special privileges, such as exclusive
licensing, that are justified by the following assumptions: </blockquote><OL>  
<p>
<LI> That its practice requires substantial intellectual training and the use
of
complex judgments. <p>
<LI> That since clients cannot adequately evaluate the quality of the service,
they must trust those they consult. <p>
<LI> That the client's trust presupposes that the practitioner's self-interest
is
overbalanced by devotion to serving both the client's interest and the public
good, and <p>
<LI> That the occupation is self-regulating -- that is, organized in such a way
as to assure the public and the courts that its members are competent, do not
violate their client's trust, and transcend their own self interest."[fn
2]</ol>
<p> This definition parallels the concepts laid out by the New York Court of
Appeals in Matter of Freeman, 34 N.Y.2d 1, 7 (1974): <p> <blockquote>
"A profession is not a business. It is distinguished by the requirements of
extensive formal training and learning, admission to practice by qualifying
licensure, a code of ethics imposing standards qualitatively and extensively
beyond those that prevail or are tolerated in the marketplace, a system for
discipline of its members for violation of the code of ethics, a duty to
subordinate financial reward to social responsibility, and, notably, an
obligation on its members, even in nonprofessional matters, to conduct
themselves as members of a learned, disciplined, and honorable occupation."
</blockquote><p>
Among the common notes of these definitions are a sense of purpose transcending
self-interest expressed in the form of duties owed to clients and the public,
together with a collective means of self-governance that articulates and
enforces the professional ideal. <p>
Self-governance necessarily includes a commitment to continuous self-appraisal.
That self-appraisal in turn necessarily encompasses a critical assessment of
the success of the profession in sustaining the competence of its members upon
whom clients trustingly depend. It entails, also, a review of the ability of
the profession to assure the public of its reliability by effective means of
disciplining errant members. And finally, since the authority to regulate
itself is largely bestowed at the sufferance of the public, the duty of
critical self-examination must involve measuring how well the profession as a
whole reasonably satisfies the legitimate expectations of the public it serves.
<p>
The kind of continuing self-examination that is an ingredient of the idea of a
profession requires attention to the performance of its members both
individually and in groups. To most members of the public, individual lawyers
and judges are the personal embodiment of the legal profession and the legal
system. The impressions garnered from the interaction of lawyers and judges
with clients, adversaries, witnesses, jurors and spectators inevitably affects
-- for good or ill -- not only the professionals themselves, but also the
profession and the justice system as well. <p>
Similarly, lawyers and judges in groups - in bar associations and as courts - -
also convey to the public a sense of the collective attitude of the bar and the
justice system. As quintessential professional organizations, bar associations
have a role far transcending that of trade or business associations. Unlike
such associations, which are formed primarily to pursue their particular
commercial interests, it is the essence of bar associations that they devote
themselves to advancing the very notion of professionalism and to helping their
members realize that ideal in the daily practice of the law. As Chief Judge
Breitel put it in Matter of Freeman, 34 N.Y.2d at 8, "[P]rofessional
associations justify their existence to the extent they further the standards
and the ideal [of the profession]." <p>
The duty of critical self-appraisal imposed by that professional ideal cannot
be discharged by the intermittent work of committees such as this. It must be
taken up by the bar associations and the courts around the state as a
continuous and significant part of their agenda. And they must take a
leadership role in carrying out many of the improvements that such an appraisal
will inevitably suggest. As many recent and continuing projects show, the New
York State Bar and many other bar associations around the state have recognized
this challenge and are striving to meet it. <p>
Courts, too, communicate to the public a collective sense of the legal system.
By the rules they adopt, the way they enforce those rules, by the practices
they pursue on a daily basis, and the attitudes of their personnel, courts can
create an impression of a legal system that tends either to ennoble or debase
the image of the profession held by the ordinary persons who encounter it. The
court system, too, must therefore be open to a continuous process of appraisal
and improvement. As the numerous committees and task forces now and recently at
work on a variety of court-related reforms plainly show, the Unified Court
System is not shirking its duty of self-examination. This report will add some
items to the pending agenda and recommend still further studies beyond this
Committee's scope and expertise. Like the bar associations', the courts' role
in improvement of service to the public will require institutional stamina. But
that practical and steady dedication of lawyers and judges -- in groups as well
as individually -- is at the heart of the "spirit of public service" that Pound
taught decades ago was the hallmark of our profession.  <p>
<B>THE PROFESSIONAL IDEA IN PRACTICE</B><p>
Despite the disparagement of the legal profession that caused this Committee to
come into existence, its foremost conclusion is that, in fact, the
professionalism of lawyers in New York, on the whole, is very high. There is
ample evidence to support the view that the daily work of lawyers in service of
their clients, in small towns and big cities, in firms large and small, is
generally good, effective and ethical. <p>
Some of that evidence is drawn from the everyday experiences of lawyers and
clients who have shared their views with us. Some of the evidence is empirical,
derived from studies such as the American Bar Association survey published in
1993 and the Nassau County Bar Association's analysis prepared this year. Some
of that evidence derives from what the Committee did not hear in its extensive
effort to collect materials supporting public criticism of lawyers: while there
are some hotspots in the practice where levels of client discontent are high,
on the anecdotal evidence provided us, those levels of discontent did not seem
to recur in the practice at large. It still seems to hold true that, with some
notable exceptions, clients may distrust and dislike lawyers at large based on
an amorphous anti-lawyer sentiment, but they trust and respect the lawyers who
have worked for them. <p>
Any recommendations for the improvement of professional performance must
therefore take account of the fact that, for the most part, responsiveness by
individual lawyers to individual clients is much better than the bar in general
is given credit for by the public at large. <p>
Moreover, collective efforts by lawyers to improve the profession in general
and service to clients in particular abound. Over and over in the course of our
work we discovered important initiatives in the public interest launched and
maintained by lawyers and bar associations. It was the almost universal
experience of the sponsors of these efforts that the media had no interest in
publicizing their valuable and important activities. Just as the press gives
deserved coverage to lawyers and judges who break the law or fail to adhere to
the exacting standards of their calling, so too should the media focus on
lawyers' efforts to serve the community. Taken together with the abundance of
lawyer disparagement that has gained enthusiastic press attention, the silence
on the really significant good that the profession regularly achieves produces
a huge imbalance in the material available to the public at large on which it
bases its general judgments of the profession. <p>
Many of these projects are aimed at improving clients' access to quality legal
services. Bar associations throughout the state sponsor lawyer referral
services that match clients with lawyers who have joined panels requiring them
to meet set standards. The Suffolk County Bar Association and a Joint Committee
of the New York County Lawyers and the Association of the Bar of the City of
New York have had conspicuously successful services for years. <p>
Increased access to legal services for persons who cannot pay for a lawyer has
been energetically promoted by professional groups across the state. A special
committee established by former Chief Judge Sol Wachtler spent over two years
monitoring and measuring the extent of the pro bono effort of the private bar,
and found a substantial commitment to such service, especially in upstate
counties, including, notably, Monroe. Downstate, organizations such as
Volunteers of Legal Services, the Voluntary Committee of the State Bar, the
McKay Outreach Program of the Association of the Bar, and the major commitments
of the Nassau and Suffolk Bar Associations have contributed thousands of hours
of legal service, free, to those who require that help. <p>
And in urban and rural areas alike, New York has benefited from the dedication
of thousands of lawyers who have made a career in legal services and legal aid
offices, committing themselves full time and for scant pay and perquisites to
the legal needs of the poor. Add to these, whose legal help is rendered to
private clients, the thousands more New York lawyers who serve the public as a
client in federal, state and local government offices. The truth is that New
York lawyers by career choice or pro bono commitment provide a huge volume of
legal services to and for the public, often with little mention and less
reward. <p>
As another example, the bar has dedicated enormous efforts to promoting
competent and ethical performance by practicing attorneys. The New York State
Bar Association for years has been a national leader in the preparation and
dissemination of continuing legal education courses. Institutions like the
Nassau County Bar Academy of Law and initiatives like the Erie County Bar's
introductory course on "Survival Strategies for Life After Law School" -- and
many other similar programs elsewhere -- are aimed at raising the level of
competence and learning of the practicing bar.   <p>
The same is true of the growing number of mentoring programs of various types
being developed throughout New York. The Suffolk County and Monroe County bars
have such programs, and the increasingly popular Inns of Court create an
organized setting in which younger and more experienced lawyers can interact
and increase their common commitment to professional excellence. <p>
Still again, the organized bar in New York has recognized the need for vehicles
to alleviate problems between clients and their lawyers. Everywhere the
Committee went to solicit insights into the lawyer-client relations, it heard
of programs in being that provide mediation and conciliation and, in some
cases, fee arbitration services for troubled relationships. <p>
The point of these examples, and many others that could be added is this: the
professional ideal of service to the public transcending personal self-interest
is in fact thriving in New York. It thrives, not because it has been given the
general recognition it in fact has earned, but because New York lawyers, in
vast numbers, believe it right. <p>
<B>THE PROFESSIONAL IDEA UNDER ATTACK</B><p>
When Roscoe Pound authored his classic essay on "The Causes of Popular
Dissatisfaction With the Administration of Justice" in 1906, he began his
dissertation with a collection of ancient English barbs against the legal
system and profession, featuring, among others, Wyclif, James I and Lord
Campbell. When, a year later, John dos Passos wrote his monograph, "The
American Lawyer," he reminded his readers that condemnation of lawyers
resonated through the pronunciamento of the Papal Legate at the Council of
London in 1237, who "heard the cry of Justice, complaining that it is greatly
impeded by the quibbles and cunning of advocates."[fn 3] Plato, Shakespeare,
Dickens, Sandberg and countless others have contributed to the anthology of
lawyer-bashing literary allusions. <p>
Over the centuries, people have been moved not only to write, but to act on a
spite for lawyers. When Shakespeare has Dick the Butcher tell the rebel leader
Jack Cade, "The first thing we do, let's kill all the lawyers," he is echoing
the actual agenda of 1381 revolutionaries as recounted in Holinshed's
Chronicles.[fn 4] History records that the rebels at least tried to make good
on their campaign promise. So did the debt-burdened Massachusetts farmers who
waged Shays' Rebellion some four centuries later, scorning lawyers as "the
pests of society."[fn 5] <p>
Another approach to bridging the gap between the common folk and a bar
perceived to be elite and predatory, was championed by Jacksonian democracy. At
its zenith in New York, pressing its view that "every man can be a lawyer," it
wiped away virtually all qualifications for admission to practice.[fn 6] The
Committee heard echoes of all those ideological themes during its public
hearings. <p>
Much of this public dissatisfaction with lawyers, as Pound noted, has
originated from time immemorial in impatience with the restrictions and
procedures of the law itself. Whether it was Cade's rebels in 1381, or the
organizations of fathers dissatisfied with how they had been treated by the New
York custody laws in 1994, the fundamental grievance has been with the law
itself. As Pound noted, the intrinsic character of law as a restrainer and
regulator -- uniform and gradual in its approach -- necessarily builds up
impatience in those groups who see themselves as disadvantaged by its
application. And, as law becomes more pervasive, causing, among other evils,
"The Death of Common Sense," this impatience appears to grow and spread.[fn 7]
Coming at a time when institutions having custody of the vision and values of
the society are felt to be in general disrepair and disrepute, a generalized
climate of disdain is easy to achieve. In short, now as for centuries past, a
major wellspring of disregard for lawyers has been a disappointment in the law
itself, often generated by exaggerated expectations of what the law in reality
can achieve.   <p>
Similarly, the expectations of individual clients as to what their counsel can
achieve can also be unrealistic. A client may fix such hopes based on a
generalized optimism about what law can do. Sometimes, however, the clients'
exaggerated expectations may stem from an imperfect understanding of the
engagement or from promises of counsel that cannot reasonably be kept. <p>
To the perception that law does not work at all because it does not work
perfectly, and that lawyers do not achieve what they should, another general
impression -- equally exaggerated -- infects the public's view of lawyers. That
is the belief that legal services are only realistically available to the
moneyed class, that lawyers generally are wealthy and work in large firms
serving the rich. <p>
The profile of the legal profession in New York State bears out none of these
impressions. In New York, 80 percent of all lawyers in private practice work in
firms with fewer than ten attorneys; of these, 50 percent (40 percent of all
the lawyers in the state) work in firms smaller than five, or as sole
practitioners.[fn 8] While 25 percent of the attorneys in New York earn over
$120,000 a year, an equal percentage earn less than $45,000.[fn 9] There are,
of course, large firms providing expensive legal services to large corporate
clients. Even those firms have felt the twin pressures of rising costs and
client fee resistance; some old and distinguished firms have not survived those
pressures. But the overwhelming reality of law practice in New York, whether
measured by numbers of clients served or numbers of lawyers serving them, is
that the practice is carried out by small firms, charging modest fees, and
earning modest incomes. <p>
Those lawyers have to deal with law of increasing volume and complexity; with
demands that they be more and more proficient in specialty areas of practice;
with heightened competition from more and more lawyers; with rising overheads
and expenses and narrowing margins of net income. The technical demands and
economic pressures of contemporary practice are very much at odds with the
prevailing notions of lawyers' lives and practices. Any realistic proposals for
improvement of professionalism in practice must take into account these
realities, as we believe ours do.   <p>
The contemporary legal profession is thus beleaguered in large part by forces
beyond its control. Some have ancient pedigree and are ingrained in populist
resistance to law as a stabilizing force or lawyers as a learned elite. Others
spring from the inherent qualities of law and some from its contemporary growth
and pervasiveness. Still others spring from social and economic changes that
have particularly affected law and lawyers. Some spring from gross
misperceptions of what the actual profile of the profession in the state really
is.  <p>
<B>THE PROFESSION'S PROPER RESPONSE</B><p>
It is an insufficient response to our charge, however, to rest on this catalog
of influences that lie beyond the profession's control, because some of the
public discontent is well founded, and is within the profession's power to
correct. We have already noted the centrality, in our view, of critical
self-examination as a hallmark of professionalism. As then-Judge Arlin Adams
put the same point:   <p> <blockquote>
"All professions, especially one as central to American life as the legal
profession, should undergo a continuing process of examination and
self-evaluation. Any group that does not engage in such an exercise loses much
that makes it a profession: a shared set of principles and customs that
transcend self-interest and speak to the essential nature of the particular
calling or trade."[fn 10] </blockquote><p>
The legal profession has not lacked for assiduous self-examination in recent
years. Committees of the American, New York State and myriad local bar
associations have published important and illuminating reports on areas in
which the performance of the bar can be improved. The Committee is in debt to
these forerunners whose insights and proposals have been most helpful.   <p>
The Committee's proposals are aimed at achieving two objectives. First, there
are areas in which genuine reform of present practice is required in the public
interest. Second, there are areas in which modest improvements in current
practice are likely to raise substantially the level of public confidence in
the profession. <p>
Our review of the materials available to us and the data we accumulated
persuades us that significant opportunities to improve professional performance
and to raise the confidence of the public in the profession lie in the areas we
treat in this Report. We conclude that improvements in pre- and post-admission
training are important to inculcating and preserving professional values and
skills. There are numerous ways in which client dissatisfaction can be reduced
or more satisfactorily redressed. Hypercompetitive behavior by lawyers, whether
in obtaining clients through misleading advertising, stirring up frivolous
controversies, or engaging in inappropriate, uncivil or misleading tactics, all
can be stemmed. A discipline system that offers more options to prevent as well
as to sanction unethical behavior, and balances concerns of public knowledge
with basic fairness badly needs to be enacted. Some new approaches to
increasing the efficiency of the court system and to providing appropriate
alternative methods of resolving disputes should be attempted. <p>
In recommending the proposals that follow in ensuing sections of this Report,
the Committee is motivated by the conviction that it is the urgent duty of the
bar to respond fairly to fair criticism. There are areas in which its
performance can be improved. The enactment of such recommendations, coupled
with the continued steady adherence to the professional idea that already marks
the character of the New York lawyer, is the best response the bar can give to
contemporary public criticism.

<h3><a name=three>III. RECOMMENDATIONS TO IMPROVE PROFESSIONALISM <p>
IMPROVED TRAINING FOR NEW LAWYERS</a></h3><p>
The substantive legal and ethical skills that comprise a lawyer's stock in
trade are acquired and refined during a lifetime of practice. A lawyer entering
the profession commits to a career of studying new law, practicing advocacy and
client relation skills and discerning the ethical implications of a complex
world. It is an educational process which the American Bar Association Report
of the Task Force on Law Schools and the Profession: Narrowing the Gap (the
"MacCrate Report) described as a "continuum." Commencing with entry to law
school, the continuum progresses through various stimages of apprenticeship.
Eventually, the once junior lawyer becomes the mentor, charged with passing on
professional verities to a neophyte. <p>
Law schools, as the gatekeepers of the profession, are entrusted with the
responsibility to ensure that prospective candidates for admission to the bar
possess a solid background in reasoning and ethics, essential skills in
successful lawyering. This responsibility mandates that law schools impose
rigorous admissions standards and teach curricula that immerse students in the
life of law. It is an enormous task given that in 1994, 127,441 students
attended 177 law schools across the country; of those, approximately 44,000
were first year students.[fn 1] <p>
Chief Judge Kaye has formed a committee to explore ways to incorporate into New
York's system of legal education the ideas raised in the "MacCrate Report."
Chaired by Justice Joseph Sullivan of the Appellate Division, First Department,
that Committee is conducting a multi-phased inquiry and expects to issue its
report in 1996. To the extent that Justice Sullivan's Committee is not
addressing ethical training for law students, we do so here. <p>
Every area of law is defined by the ethical dimensions raised in its
application. It is not enough for a law school to include in its curriculum
only one professional responsibility course taught independently of its other
courses, and too often geared to preparation for the Multi-state Professional
Responsibility Examination. In addition to the standard professional
responsibility course, each substantive and procedural course should
incorporate material addressing the ethical obligations and conflicts a
practitioner faces in applying the legal principles pertaining to that area of
law. Several law schools, most notably Brooklyn Law School, have been
developing course syllabi that include such ethical dimensions. In addition,
the Fordham University School of Law has opened the Stein Center for Ethical
and Public Interest Law, an institute dedicated to the exploration of ethical
issues and law. <p>
Law school ethics education is similarly incomplete unless it imparts to
students the historical underpinnings of the profession. Knowledge of the
development of our legal culture and the individuals who have made meaningful
contributions to the profession is essential if a lawyer is to be more than a
mere legal technician. And we emphasize, there is such a thing as a
professional culture -- a sense of shared traditions and history of the legal
profession, of its purpose and its responsibility to society. Law schools must
strive to inspire in each student an intellectual and emotional feeling for the
greatness and nobility of the profession and an understanding of this culture.
A lawyer so trained will better recognize the obligations of the profession and
will be better prepared to respond to the legal needs and emotional
expectations of each client. <p>
Law schools can more readily achieve these goals, given the crowded course
loads they must already deliver, by forging greater partnership with bar
associations. Several law school deans who consulted with this Committee
pointed to increased interaction with local bar associations as a way to better
prepare students for practice. Early exposure to bar associations will
encourage students to attend programs that address practical substantive and
ethical issues. Moreover, bar members provide an invaluable resource to
students, who, prior to graduation, usually have minimal exposure to the daily
rigors of practice. Students, for their part, provide an important resource to
bar associations interested in expanding pro bono programs. <p>
The financial predicament of law school graduates deserves special attention.
Law schools are regarded as major sources of revenue for the universities with
which they are affiliated. At least one university in the state ranks its law
school as its third revenue producer, behind the football and basketball teams.
To maximize this lucrative role, classes entering law school have been filled
to capacity. In turn, record numbers of law graduates, some 6,000 annually in
New York alone, are entering a profession that is already saturated and
suffering a market-forced contraction.[fn 2] That law schools are beginning to
recognize their obligation to tailor class size to market demands is evidenced
by the recent decisions of Syracuse and Creighton Universities to reduce the
size of next year's entering class. In announcing the reduction, the Creighton
University Law School dean observed that the decision was a "moral, ethical
response" to a saturated lawyer market. Moreover, he noted that the smaller
class would prevent an erosion of admission standards.[fn 3] <p>
An estimated 85% of law school graduates enter this downsizing profession
carrying an average debt of $60,000.[fn 4] Unable to find employment,
increasing numbers of recently graduated lawyers "hang up a shingle" without
the benefit of any apprenticeship. Predictably, these lawyers are the subject
of a significant percentage of complaints filed with the attorney grievance
committees. The allegations raised range from client neglect, to conversion, to
malpractice; many can be attributed to simple ignorance of law office
management and attorney-client relations often caused by the lack of any
practical apprenticeship. Frequently, pressed by economic necessity, the lawyer
has simply accepted a matter beyond his or her level of expertise. <p>
The Committee proposes several initiatives to address this situation. Each
proposal is a substitute for the nurturing process of acculturation newly
admitted attorneys traditionally experienced when they joined a firm or public
service. In those settings, senior attorneys imparted the lessons learned by
their experience to associates, who came of age by joining the partnership or
rising to a policymaking position. Taken together, the Committee's proposals
attempt to reconstruct that tradition, by emphasizing the crucial role of
education by example and peer review.  <p>
The Committee proposes that practitioners be instructed in law office
management and client relation skills at a seminar conducted at the time of
admission. The Appellate Division, Fourth Department, in conjunction with the
Erie County Bar Association, recently sponsored such a program, aptly titled
"Survival Strategies for Life After Law School." Newly admitted lawyers
attended a two and a half day program that took place immediately after the
Spring, 1995 admission ceremony. They heard a variety of practitioners and
judges address practical topics such as developing professional relationships,
common ethical pitfalls, how to communicate effectively with clients, the
basics of establishing and managing a law practice, and the fundamentals of
simple legal transactions. <p>
At least eight states include in their bar admission requirements some degree
of such specific training in practical skills. California, Maryland, Michigan,
Missouri, New Mexico and North Carolina require between three and thirty-four
hours of course work to be completed in varying time-frames within the first
year of admission. New Jersey mandates a three year program, beginning with an
intensive core curriculum consisting of ethics, real estate, will drafting and
probate practice, family law, and a trial preparation course. This requirement
must be completed either prior to admission or within the first year following
the taking of the bar examination. The second year curriculum consists of
another trial preparation course and administrative law. During the last year,
an attorney selects two of the following courses: small business law;
bankruptcy practice; collection practice; municipal court practice; worker's
compensation practice, and landlord/tenant practice.[fn 5] The Committee
recommends that each Department, in cooperation with State and local bar
associations initiate programs similar in content to those described above, to
be taken at or near the point of a new attorney's admission. <p>
The Committee also recommends the adoption of internship programs developed
with the cooperation of law schools, law firms and local bar associations.
Ideally, such programs would be available to students throughout their law
school careers and prior to their admission to the bar. An apprenticeship of
even short duration will enable a newly- minted attorney to learn rudimentary,
yet sound, business procedures which are essential to running a successful solo
practice. Such an internship will also enable a young lawyer to become part of
the practicing legal community, thereby acquiring a sense of belonging and the
confidence that makes it easier to ask questions before making a mistake. <p>
The Delaware Board of Bar Examiners currently requires candidates for admission
to the bar to perform a clerkship of at least 5 months' duration some time
after admission to law school and within a year of taking the bar examination.
The clerkship experience is further amplified by the requirement that the
candidate be personally sponsored by a practicing lawyer, known as a preceptor,
who reviews the clerkship in the context of evaluating the application for
admission. <p>
Local bar associations can play a key role in the professional development of
young attorneys by forming long-term mentoring programs. Several bar
associations across the state have sponsored mentoring programs in the past few
years, with varying degrees of success. The Monroe and Erie County Bars matched
senior practitioners with new members in an effort to cultivate relationships.
Similarly, in Suffolk County, the bar association conducts an on-going effort
to match young members with seniors. That association's news bulletin runs
advertisements for the mentor program and periodic get- togethers are held to
enable interested members to develop relationships. Experienced practitioners
also are listed in the association's membership book, according to area of
expertise, as being available to mentor a young practitioner. In a slightly
different approach, the Capitol District Chapter of the New York State Women's
Bar Association operates a mentoring program in conjunction with its pro bono
effort, as do several other pro bono organizations around the state. Lawyers
who volunteer in an area of law outside their expertise attend a training
session and then are teamed with an attorney knowledgeable in that field. This
format provides a context for mentoring that affords the otherwise artificial
relationship an opportunity to evolve into a mutually rewarding endeavor. <p>
The recent proliferation of American Inns of Court, patterned on the four
English Inns of Court, also reflects the profession's recognition of the
importance of creating alternatives to the traditional legal structure.
Introduced in the late 1970's by Chief Justice Warren E. Burger, there are now
approximately 300 Inns functioning across the country. Comprised of no more
than 80 attorneys of varying levels of experience, the inns conduct mock
proceedings in addition to sponsoring seminars on matters of interest to its
members. Both mentoring programs and the Inns provide a forum for peer review,
which a number of ethicists note is an important element in the self-regulation
of the profession.  <p>
<B>MANDATORY CONTINUING LEGAL EDUCATION</B><p>
A lawyer's obligation to continually hone professional skills and keep abreast
of developments in the law is a central element of professionalism.
Notwithstanding the many educational programs available to the bar and
judiciary, practitioners, judges, clients and grievance committee counsel each
identified incompetence as a substantial deficiency within the profession. <p>
For this reason, the Committee endorses previous proposals for the adoption of
a mandatory continuing legal education requirement. Topics such as accounting,
drafting, ethics, law office management, and communication, as well as
procedural and substantive law should be included in the roster of courses
which comprise a CLE program. <p>
To the extent that a continuing legal education requirement imposes yet another
obligation on overburdened practitioners, the Committee urges the development
of alternatives to the standard lecture format. The development of videotape
and computer software training packimages that could be shared among lawyers and
studied at their own convenience would immeasurably reduce the cost and
inconvenience of CLE. Lawyers, especially those in small firms or solo
practice, would be more inclined to integrate CLE into their professional
lives. In addition, insurers of legal practices can contribute an added
incentive for CLE participation by offering premium rebates to subscribers. <p>
Cognizant of the funding issues that stalled implementation of mandatory CLE in
the past, the Committee recommends that courses sponsored by the Unified Court
System, law schools and local bar associations be denominated by court rule as
satisfying the requirement. Compliance with the CLE requirement can be
monitored by including a certification to that effect on the biennial
registration form.  <p>
<B>ESTABLISHMENT OF AN ETHICS INSTITUTE</B><p>
This Committee's mandate covers ground well-trod by others interested in the
profession's development. As the bibliography indicates, the topics addressed
during our inquiry and deliberations have been examined by a number of task
forces, academicians, and committees, whose recommendations parallel some of
our own. From their many thoughtful treatises and reports we have discerned one
salient point: issues pertaining to the legal profession relate not only to
law, but to the very society we are and aspire to become. No committee of
limited duration can address matters of such scope and that, by their nature,
require continuity of
attention. Deborah L. Rhode, Esq., Professor of Ethics at Stanford University
Law School, has observed that well-meaning efforts at reform of the profession
are often piecemeal and skirt more fundamental questions about our system of
law with the result that they easily degenerate into exercises in rhetoric.[fn
6] <p>
Mindful of these considerations, the Committee recommends the creation of a
permanent entity to study and speak to issues pertaining to professionalism. In
1993, the Texas Bar Foundation founded The Texas Center for Legal Ethics and
Professionalism, dedicated to advancing the bar's awareness and understanding
of ethical issues. The Center has outlined seven specific goals to be achieved
by 1997, which will afford the bar a comprehensive program of ethics, research
resources and instruction. We recommend that the Chief Judge cause to be
established, with the participation of the courts, the bar and law schools, a
similar institute in New York which would greatly foster our understanding of
professionalism and inform the public debate regarding the role of law in our
society.  <p>
<B>REAFFIRMING STANDARDS OF CIVILITY</B><p>
The adversarial nature of our legal system has always engendered a degree of
tension that, traditionally, was kept in check by the cultural mores of the
relatively small legal community. Members of the bar and bench observed a code
of etiquette and decorum that facilitated the resolution of disputes just as
contentious as the ones we see today. Moreover, the routine courtesies lawyers
extended to their colleagues enabled lawyers to distance themselves from the
acrimony conflict inevitably spawns. That in turn enabled them to serve their
clients more objectively and effectively and to preserve collegial
relationships with other members of the bar. <p>
In recent years, as society has become inured to violence on television, on the
streets, in the workplace and in our homes, etiquette and decorum have been
accorded less and less value. At times, ordinary civility seems to have become
a quaint anachronism. Prime time television's "Rambo" image of effective
lawyering dictates not only the client's expectation of attorney behavior, but
also, unfortunately, some lawyers' image of themselves. Lawyers who are
otherwise inclined to observe common courtesies often forego this opportunity
for fear that opposing counsel will use the concession as a weapon, or that
their clients will believe them less than whole-hearted in their zeal. <p>
The bench, too, is affected by this trend. As Benjamin Cardozo noted, and the
1991 Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals' Interim Report on Civility recalled,
"Judges are never free from the feelings of the times."[fn 7] Pressured by
heavy calendars and hampered by inadequate resources, judges also sometimes
contribute to the "coarsening" of practice.[fn 8] <p>
Incivility commonly manifests itself as rudeness, refusal to accommodate a
colleague's schedule, judge baiting, or harassment during depositions. As a New
York County Lawyers' Association report has noted, also included under the
umbrella are sharp practice tactics such as misrepresenting facts to the court
or an adversary and including false information in unsworn documents.[fn 9]
Examples of judicial incivility range from excessive delays in commencing
scheduled proceedings, to public ad hominem attacks that humiliate counsel,
witnesses or litigants. <p>
This Committee recognizes that neither incivility nor sharp practice tactics
are institutional problems: they are a product of individual behavior. But that
behavior has always been influenced, for better or worse, by the collective
viewpoint of the community in which it occurs. As the ever-increasing size of
the bar attenuates the sense of collegiality that exists among lawyers, and as
economic pressures spur more competitive behavior substitutes for the unwritten
rules of appropriate behavior must be found. <p>
In recent years, several inquiries into incivility and sharp practice have
resulted in the adoption of codes of conduct that explicitly set forth behavior
standards to which the bar and the bench should aspire. The Committee urges the
Unified Court System to adopt a code of conduct, similar to those promulgated
by the American College of Trial Lawyers and the United States Court of Appeals
for the Seventh Circuit, that will reorient the bar and bench toward the
observance of courtesies that long have enhanced the quality of professionalism
in New York. Aspirational in tone and content, such a code will form a frame of
reference to assist both bench and bar in discerning the bounds of civility
among other things. <p>
The claim that courtesy must be sacrificed to the demands of zealous advocacy
is expressly contradicted by Disciplinary Rule 7-101 of the Lawyer's Code of
Professional Responsibility, which states, " A lawyer does not violate [the
obligation to zealously represent a client] by acceding to reasonable requests
of opposing counsel which do not prejudice the rights of the client, by
avoiding offensive tactics, or by treating with courtesy and consideration all
personal involved in the legal process."   <p>
The fundamental principles articulated in the Ethical Considerations and
Disciplinary Rules which flow from Canons 1 and 7 of the Lawyer's Code reflect
the profession's recognition of the critical role etiquette and honorable
practices play in our system. Indeed, the Lawyer's Code can form the basis for
a code of conduct. <p>
In addition, the Committee recommends that the Canon 7 Disciplinary Rules be
amended to include "gross and persistent" incivility as a violation of the
Lawyer's Code. This recommendation recognizes the increasing willingness of the
Appellate Divisions to sanction, in the context of disciplinary proceedings,
conduct that exceeds the bounds of propriety. An example of this willingness is
the Second Department's recent suspension from practice of an attorney whose
courtroom behavior was adjudged to evince "a flagrant disrespect for the
judiciary and a fundamental disregard for the judicial process which he has
been sworn to uphold." Matter of Richard L. Giampa, A Suspended Attorney, 211
AD.2d 212 (2d Dept. 1995). Explicit proscription of a pattern of conduct that
the profession finds offensive sends clear notice that there is no room in the
profession for individuals who mistreat colleagues and misuse the legal
process. This message will be underscored if the proposed extension of the
disciplinary rules to law firms is adopted by the Appellate Divisions. <p>
The profession's success in reorienting itself to the principles of etiquette
and decorum depends not only upon individual observance of those principles,
but also upon each judge's commitment to upholding, as an exercise of judicial
authority, the principles articulated in the Lawyer's Code. A judge's failure
to insist upon compliance with the letter and spirit of the behavioral
standards governing litigation erodes society's respect for, and confidence in,
the law. <p>
The elimination of incivility and sharp practice tactics can only assist
overburdened judges in managing bulging calendars. The Civil Practice Law and
Rules and rules promulgated by the Chief Administrative Judge provide vehicles
for a judge to ensure that the calendar is not cluttered with submissions that
divert attention from the essential aspects of a dispute. Those who argue that
application of existing provisions generates unnecessary litigation in
themselves miss the point. Once judges create the expectation that lawyers who
appear before the court must act courteously and honorably, all motion
practice, including proceedings related to attorney conduct, will be reduced.
<p>
<B>TRUTHFUL, INFORMATIVE ADVERTISING</B><p>
Issues pertaining to lawyer advertising have long generated impassioned debate.
Practitioners, the public, regulating authorities, and the courts grapple with
balancing the First Amendment's guarantee of free speech against the need to
protect the public and the profession from unscrupulous, if not unseemly,
advertising. Other issues concern the role of advertising in affording the
public informed access to legal services and the feeling in some quarters that
all advertising denigrates the profession. <p>
In <I>Central Hudson Gas &amp; Elec. Corp. v. Public Service Comm'n of New
York,</I>
447 U.S. 557 (1980), the United States Supreme Court developed a four-part
analysis for determining whether state regulation of advertising is
constitutionally barred. First, in order to qualify for protection, the
advertisement must "concern lawful activity and not be misleading." If this
threshold is met, the state must demonstrate that it has a substantial interest
in supporting the regulation; that the restriction "directly and materially
advances that interest"; and that the regulation itself is "narrowly drawn."
<p>
New York's restrictions pertaining to lawyer advertising are set forth in
Disciplinary Rules 2-101 through 2-105 of the Lawyer's Code of Professional
Responsibility. In addition, some local government agencies, such as the New
York City Department of Consumer Affairs, consider lawyer advertising to fall
within the ambit of their authority. <p>
At the heart of the United States Supreme Court rulings and the New York
regulations is the requirement that advertisements be truthful and not
misleading. It is imperative that members of the public seeking counsel through
advertising have the reasonable expectation of finding competent ethical
representation. The rationale supporting lawyer advertising -- the public's
improved access to counsel -- depends entirely on the public's being fairly
informed about the services on offer. <p>
The anecdotal evidence presented to this Committee confirms the data presented
in the <a href=http://www.aba.net>American Bar Association</a> Report,
<I>Lawyer
Advertising at the Crossroads: Professional Policy Considerations:</I> most
people retain lawyers based upon
personal referral or by thumbing through yellow page advertisements. In
addition, the ABA found that although most people are generally satisfied with
the services rendered by their own attorney, many hold the view that
advertising, especially intrusive television or billboard ads, sullies the
profession.[fn 10] More particularly, as the American Bar Association's 1993
Survey found, much of the public believes that lawyer advertising is motivated
by greed and is "just another way to generate more lawsuits and, therefore,
more fees."[fn 11] <p>
Given the prevalence of these seemingly contradictory views, lawyers who
advertise, and the profession at large, must take scrupulous care to ensure
that advertisements are truthful and free from any statements that could be
regarded as misleading or confusing to a potential client. To assist lawyers in
maintaining high professional standards in advertising, the Erie County Bar
Association has published the Lawyer's Guide to Advertising in New York State.
The pamphlet sets out a lawyer's obligations and describes ways an ad can
conform to or violate those standards. <p>
A particularly troublesome problem is caused by those advertisements that fail
to disclose accurately that the attorney placing it does not intend to handle
the matter. The advent of the virtual office has contributed to the increase in
the number of lawyers who broker cases, after soliciting those cases through
misleading advertisements. The broker conducts the initial interview with the
client, in effect screening the case for referral to another lawyer, based upon
the latter's geographic location, expertise, or mere availability and
willingness to pay a forwarding fee. During the initial interview, the broker
sets the terms of the representation and the client commits, blindly, to be
represented by an unknown person. <p>
The Committee, having perceived an increase in the brokering of cases,
recommends amendment of the Lawyer's Code of Professional Responsibility to
require disclosure if an attorney places advertisements as a broker. This
required disclosure conforms with the Central Hudson analysis in that such
advertising, absent disclosure, is inherently misleading, and the state has a
substantial interest in protecting the public from the risks it poses. Indeed,
many states have promulgated regulations to ensure the accountability of the
attorney placing the ad. In addition, the restriction is narrowly drawn to
ensure that only those lawyers who parcel out cases are affected by the
disclosure requirement.

<h3><a name=four>IV. RECOMMENDATIONS TO IMPROVE CLIENT SATISFACTION</a></h3>
<p>
Traditionally, a person chose a lawyer on the basis of a pre-existing
relationship or on the strength of the lawyer's reputation in the local
community. Today, the sheer number of lawyers and the isolation of local
community life increase the likelihood that client and lawyer meet as strangers
at the outset of their relationship. It is not a propitious start to a
relationship that is often occasioned by a crisis in the client's life. <p>
In examining the relationship between client and lawyer, the Committee
identified several common flashpoints of conflict in the attorney-client
relationship. Some have characterized these issues as "consumer complaints".
However, insofar as the term "consumer" depicts the anonymous relationship that
exists between the buyer and seller of a commodity, it is a misnomer. The
client, in hiring a lawyer, purchases legal services that, by virtue of the
lawyer's professional oath, include a fiduciary commitment to safeguard the
client's trust and interest. <p>
The proposals that follow aim to reduce the opportunities for misunderstandings
to arise during this multi-faceted, yet often stressed, relationship.  <p>
<B>ENGAGEMENT LETTER</B><p>
Communication is the essential ingredient of a successful relationship between
lawyer and client. A number of clients and lawyers who addressed the Committee
described conflicts that could have been managed harmoniously, if not totally
avoided, had the parties fully discussed their expectations and obligations at
the beginning of the relationship. From the outset of the representation both
parties should have a clear understanding of what services are to be rendered,
the effort required to perform those services, and the fee to be charged.
Failure of the minds to meet on these critical issues underlies many accounts
of client dissatisfaction and the demise of many attorney-client relationships.
<p>
The Committee urges the adoption of a disciplinary rule requiring a lawyer to
provide the client with an engagement letter upon the commencement of the
representation of an individual where the fee to be charged is expected to be
$1,000 or more. <p>
An engagement letter encourimages the lawyer to explain the details and realities
of the representation to the client; moreover, it sets the stage for the lawyer
to periodically update the client regarding the status of the matter. The
letter serves as a permanent record of the understanding between the parties,
and each can refer to it in the future. <p>
The Committee's proposal has several nuances that spring from its belief that
the rule should be tailored to the cases in which it is most useful and that
the rule should not be unduly burdensome. The rule is limited to representation
of individuals. The Committee believes that, in general, corporations and other
entities are likely to be sufficiently sophisticated to enter into a
relationship with counsel as an equal, and therefore, can chart their own
course without necessarily receiving a letter of engagement. The minimum fee of
$1,000 reflects the Committee's assessment, based upon discussions held across
the state, that services rendered for less than that amount tend to be of a
sufficiently transitory nature as not to require the formality of an engagement
letter. A $1,000 threshold also reflects the Committee's concern that the solo
practitioner not bear an excessive burden imposed by a rule of general
application. This is especially pertinent in many upstate jurisdictions where,
as one practitioner said, the school bus driver is often the most economically
secure person in the community. We also mean the threshold to be high enough
that the encounter between a lawyer and longstanding client in any of the many
casual situations in which advice can be sought and given is not covered by the
rule. But where a transaction of sufficient size to attract a fee of $1,000 is
involved, it is in the interest of both the attorney and the client to record
their understanding. <p>
The length of the letter should be determined by the nature of the services to
be rendered. It is the Committee's view that an adequate letter can and should
be succinct. It does not seem necessary to make the engagement letter itself a
complex legal instrument, and the interests of lawyer-client clarity are not
served by doing so. The Committee considered but rejected the suggestion that
it propose a model letter. The circumstances of engagements differ so widely
that no such form seems useful. Rather, as clients and the legal community
adapt themselves to the rule, the marketplace will play a role in developing
the terms to be included in the letter. <p>
A letter of engagement need not be filed with the trial court or with the
Office of Court Administration, unless the services to be rendered pertain to
personal injury or domestic relations. The filing of an engagement letter in
those cases is necessary since the lawyer's fee constitutes part of the
litigation. Enforcement of the rule will be a function of the disciplinary
process. If a fee dispute arises and the lawyer did not provide the client with
an engagement letter, a rebuttable presumption will be drawn against the lawyer
that precludes the lawyer from recovering more than $1,000 from the client. 
<p>
<B>STATEMENT OF CLIENT'S RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES</B> <p>
The attorney-client relationship, founded as it is upon the trust the client
places in the lawyer, is, as we have noted, multi-faceted. The lawyer's
fiduciary duty to the client has many tangible and quantifiable manifestations:
conservation of the client's funds, protection of the client's confidences and
advancement of the client's interests. The client too, has certain
responsibilities toward the lawyer: truthfulness in discussions with counsel
and prompt payment of fees for services rendered. <p>
The Committee proposes that these mutual rights and responsibilities be
articulated for the client's benefit in a written statement of client's rights
and responsibilities similar in content to the statement set forth in the Joint
Rules of the Appellate Divisions, Section 1400.2, that pertains to domestic
relations matters. The Committee also endorses the American Bar Association's
"My Declaration of Commitment to Clients" for its simple, straight-forward
format that is easily understood by a client and not burdensome to a lawyer.
Such statements are valuable educational tools that tend to inform clients
accurately about what they may reasonably expect from their lawyer and what
their lawyer can reasonably expect from them. <p>
The statement should be available for the client to study at the lawyer's
office. It should be conspicuously posted, just as hospitals post the statement
of patient's rights, or the lawyer can give the client a copy of the statement.
<p>
<B>ARBITRATION OF FEE DISPUTES</B><p>
Fee disputes represent one of the most frequent and intense sources of public
dissatisfaction with attorneys. To be sure, the reverse is often also true. The
Committee concludes that a speedy, inexpensive and fair means of resolving such
disagreements would greatly ease lawyer-client tensions. The method we propose
is fee arbitration along the lines described below. <p>
Fee disputes often arise when a case, especially a litigated matter, takes
unexpected turns that escalate the cost beyond what the client anticipated.
Such developments as extensive discovery, the hiring of experts, motion
practice pertaining to ancillary issues and time lost in unproductive court
sessions can quickly transform a seemingly simple matter into an expensive
legal quagmire. Inadequate understanding of the services to be rendered,
insufficient notice of mounting expenses and, perhaps, failure to prevail in
the matter all exacerbate a disagreement regarding fees. <p>
In order to remove the dispute from an adversarial posture and to facilitate
speedy resolution, the Committee recommends adoption of a fee arbitration
program according to the model set forth in the Rules of the Chief
Administrator, Part 136 that governs arbitration of fee disputes in domestic
relations matters.  <p>
Procedurally, fee arbitration takes place as follows: A matter is submitted to
arbitration at the election of the client; and, once that election is made, the
lawyer's participation is mandatory. If the client does not file a request to
arbitrate within 30 days of receiving notice of the fee dispute from the
lawyer, the latter may commence an action to recover the fee. Disputes in
excess of $100,000 are beyond the jurisdiction of the arbitration program. <p>
The program's panel of arbitrators, who serve as volunteers, is comprised of
lawyers and other members of the community. One arbitrator hears disputes where
the amount in controversy is less than $3,000; three arbitrators sit on cases
exceeding that amount. The result handed down by the arbitrator is binding upon
both parties, subject to the limited judicial review permitted by Article 75 of
the Civil Practice Law and Rules. <p>
The Committee makes this recommendation, anticipating that the Unified Court
System's extension of fee arbitration to all areas of practice may vary across
the state as dictated by geographic considerations and by the availability of
local resources to participate in the program.  <p>
<B>LAWYER REFERRAL SERVICES</B><p>
Adequate access to counsel is another flashpoint of frustration for clients
trying to negotiate the legal system. <p>
Anecdotal evidence presented to the Committee confirmed the finding of several
studies, including a recent American Bar Association report, that most people
hire their lawyers on the basis of a personal referral. Failing that, those of
moderate means are often at a loss when hiring a lawyer to draft a will,
negotiate a house closing or handle a divorce. A frequently heard complaint,
particularly from the owners of small businesses, is that as laws governing
their conduct multiply, their need for access to legal assistance increases:
often they are frustrated by the difficulty of finding an attorney under
auspices that give them confidence. The profession has the obligation to
develop innovative ways to connect clients with competent, affordable attorneys
to handle the common life events that require the law's imprimatur. <p>
Recognizing this responsibility, and to redress the shortcomings inherent in
lawyer advertising, many bar associations have developed lawyer referral
services that successfully direct those in need of a lawyer to knowledgeable
counsel. The New York State Bar Association Lawyer Referral and Information
Service (LRIS), started in 1981, operates a referral service in 39 counties
where no service is otherwise provided. In 1994, LRIS handled more than 30,000
inquiries and made approximately 5,000 referrals.[fn 1] In addition, at least
25 local bar associations provide a similar service. Model programs such as the
one operated by the Suffolk County Bar Association establish standards for
lawyers participating in a referral bank that ensure the competence of the
lawyer it recommends to the public. In order to join the service, a lawyer must
sign a grievance release waiver that authorizes the association's executive
committee to examine the lawyer's grievance files and the lawyer must carry at
least $100,000 in malpractice insurance. In addition, a participant in the
service agrees to provide the client with a written letter of engagement and
participate in fee arbitration if such a dispute arises during the
representation. <p>
It is the Committee's assessment that public awareness of bar association legal
referral services is hampered by the limited funding that the associations are
able to devote to publicizing the programs within the community. A Columbus,
Ohio, referral program has had success in generating advertising itself by
charging its members a percentage fee that is used exclusively for publicity.
<p>
The Committee recommends that existing referral services be reinforced and more
amply financed and advertised, and that increased efforts be made to provide
such services everywhere in New York.   <p>
<B>PRO BONO EFFORTS</B><p>
Those who cannot afford to hire a lawyer must often rely upon the pro bono
services of public-spirited attorneys. Traditionally, lawyers in New York have
contributed generously of their time and expertise to provide legal counsel to
the poor. Much of this effort is quietly performed in fulfillment of a lawyer's
obligation to serve the community; and it complements but cannot replace the
indispensable work performed on behalf of the poor by staffed legal services
organizations. <p>
The need for increased levels of pro bono service and proposals to meet those
needs were set forth by the Chief Judge's Committee to Improve the Availability
of Legal Services, chaired by Victor Marrero, Esq. In 1990, that Committee
recommended the adoption of a mandatory pro bono requirement for all lawyers in
New York. Former Chief Judge Sol Wachtler subsequently appointed a second
committee to monitor the performance of pro bono work being performed in the
wake of the Marrero report, and that Committee, chaired by Justin Vigdor, Esq.,
presented its thorough report in 1993. <p>
This Committee believes that the problems and opportunities involved in
providing adequate pro bono services have been laid out for the Chief Judge in
the thoughtful reports of its predecessors, to which it defers on this issue.
Whatever disposition is made of those proposals, this Committee believes that
pro bono service singularly benefits both the public and the profession. We
strongly encourage continued, energetic efforts to make such help available as
widely as needed.  <p>
<B>PRO SE LITlGANTS</B><p>
Whether by choice or from necessity, increasing numbers of litigants represent
themselves before the court, without the benefit of counsel. This phenomenon is
especially evident in landlord and tenant courts and in family courts across
the state. The individuals who appear before these courts often lack education
or the facility with English necessary to negotiate the labyrinth that is legal
procedure. <p>
The Committee recommends that the Office of Court Administration endeavor to
develop avenues for informing pro se litigants of fundamental procedures and
their rights in litigating matters before the court. In addition, pro se
litigants often require basic information regarding the location of specific
offices and courtrooms within the courthouse. They can also reduce the
confusion and consumption of court time that ill- prepared pro se litigants
often involve. The publication of multi-lingual informational booklets and the
presentation of videos regarding various court practices can only assist the
pro se litigant in successfully appearing before the court. Present efforts to
make court personnel available to assist individuals in preparing their papers
for submission to the court, and the drafting of special pro se forms for
submission by unrepresented individuals are laudable. In urging these efforts,
the Committee appreciates the concern expressed by several court administrators
that court personnel not cross the fine line between assisting a litigant and
becoming that litigant's advocate. <p>
<B>RELATIONSHIP OF RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE MATRIMONIAL RULES</B> <p>
As stated earlier, this Committee's genesis can be found in the 1993 adoption
of procedural rules which altered some aspects of matrimonial practice. Indeed,
the Chief Judge's mandate specifically charged the Committee with examining the
applicability of those procedural rules to other areas of practice. <p>
Many of the recommendations set forth in this Report have been drawn from the
bar's successful experience with the matrimonial rules. In particular, the
promulgation of a statement of client's rights and responsibilities, adoption a
letter of engagement, fee arbitration, early preliminary conferences, and
stricter requirements for the certification of submissions to the court can be
traced to those changes, although sometimes in slightly varied form. <p>
Other rules adopted for the matrimonial bar have proven to be unsuitable for
extension to general practice because the circumstances that give rise to the
important role they play in matrimonial practice do not exist in other areas.
These include the procedure for obtaining a security interest and the
requirement that a closing statement be filed with the court upon the
conclusion of a matrimonial matter. In addition, the prohibition against
non-refundable retainers is now a matter of case law. Matter of Edward M.
Cooperman, 187 A.D.2d 56 (2d Dept. 1993), affd 83 N.Y.2d 465 (1994).

<h3><a name=five>V. RECOMMENDATIONS TO IMPROVE ATTORNEY DISCIPLINE</a></h3>  
<p>
The legal profession, by virtue of being accorded the privilege of
self-regulation, is obligated to maintain an attorney discipline process that
ensures the public's confidence in the legal system is both safeguarded and
deserved. <p>
Traditionally, as Professor Geoffrey Hazard, Esq., has observed, standards of
ethics and competence were maintained by a combination of social pressures,
such as commendation and ostracism, and long-term relationships that carried
the promise of repeat business and professional success. Today, that collective
social evaluation has fallen victim to the relative formlessness of a vastly
larger bar. No longer part of the social fabric, attorney discipline has become
institutionalized.[fn 1] <p>
It is the Committee's assessment that there are significant opportunities for
improvements in the present system of attorney discipline that would enhance
both its effectiveness and public confidence in its operation. Clients,
practitioners, judges and ethicists all expressed serious reservations
regarding the current disciplinary process. The experiences they recount,
whether their own or others', whether understated or embellished, point to
three areas of concern: the grievance committees' difficulty in communicating
effectively with persons filing complaints; the limited options available to
them in redressing complaints; and the secrecy with which the business of
attorney discipline is conducted. These concerns are real, and they give rise
to the perception, no less damaging by virtue of being a perception, that the
profession is unable or unwilling to regulate itself. In short, the negative
experience of filing a disciplinary complaint works a disservice upon not only
the client who seeks grievance committee assistance, but also upon the lawyers
who competently meet their responsibilities, the profession, and the public at
large. The proposals that follow are urged as ways to better equip the
grievance committees to respond meaningfully to the complaints filed, and to
address the ethical and competence deficiencies of lawyers who are the subject
of those complaints. <p>
<B>lMPROVED RESPONSIVENESS TO COMPLAINTS</B><p>
In 1994, more than 10,000 eomplaints against lawyers were filed with the
grievance committees in New York State. If statistics from prior years are an
indication, almost 90% of these complaints will be rejected or dismissed for
failure to allege conduct that violates a disciplinary rule, 8% will result in
the imposition of a sanction by the grievance committee that is not disclosed
to the public, and 2.5% will result in public censure, suspension from practice
or disbarment by the Appellate Division.[fn 2] Most of the rejected or
dismissed complaints involve fee disputes or a form of neglect sufficiently
irksome to the client to warrant the complaint, but not so egregious as to
warrant the filing of charges. These complainants customarily receive a form
letter tersely advising them of the committee's action; no explanation of the
lawyer's conduct is offered and no suggestion regarding alternative avenues to
resolve the disagreement is made. Receipt of such a letter can only compound
the client's already considerable feelings of frustration and impotence. If
these feelings are multiplied by the number of individuals who receive these
letters and the number of people to whom they recount the experience, it is no
wonder that the attorney discipline system is held in disregard. <p>
The Committee believes several measures should be adopted that hold the promise
of significantly improving the real and perceived responsiveness to client
complaints. First, the Committee proposes adoption of mediation programs by
each of the six grievance committees to handle complaints, that, although
legitimate, are not sufficiently serious to warrant the imposition of a
sanction by the grievance committee or Appellate Division. A client who files a
complaint asserting, among other things, failure to return telephone calls,
missed conferences, a lack of updated information in the case, or fee issues,
is interested in quickly resolving the problem. A mediator, with a neutral ear
attuned to the failure of communication that characterizes many complaints of
this type, can often remedy the situation in one or two meetings with attorney
and client. Mediation can perhaps even repair the attorney-client relationship.
 <p>
As envisioned, the volunteer mediators, once identified by a bar association or
the Appellate Division, would be appointed to their task by the Appellate
Division. Following a mediation training program, the volunteers would be
available for assignment to resolve the issues underlying a complaint which
"falls below the radar screen" of sanctionable misconduct. <p>
The grievance committee staff would evaluate incoming complaints for
participation in mediation according to criteria devised by the Appellate
Division, in consultation with the grievance committee. Assignments to
mediation would be made by the grievance committee. A matter referred to a
mediator would not be dismissed until the mediator certified to the grievance
committee that the parties had reached an acceptable resolution. If upon
examining the complaint, the mediator believed that the issues involve
substantive violation of a disciplinary rule, the matter would be referred back
to the grievance committee for further investigation in a disciplinary posture.
<p>
Mediation programs of various types are currently in operation in each of the
judicial departments. Each, albeit with differing procedures and administrative
sponsorship, provides an alternative to discipline. Of these, the mediation
program sponsored by the Departmental Disciplinary Committee, First Judicial
Department, most closely approximates the program proposed by the Committee.
With a volunteer staff of 58 mediators, drawn from three local bar
associations, the program handled 187 matters in 1994. Of these, 162 resulted
in successful resolutions. The remaining complaints were either dismissed due
to the client's failure to cooperate or referred back to the committee for
formal disciplinary action.[fn 3] <p>
Second, the grievance committees' responsiveness to complainants also can be
improved by rethinking the purpose of the letter rejecting or dismissing a
complaint. However appropriate the committee's action is, the person who filed
the complaint feels aggrieved by the conduct of the lawyer hired to represent
his or her interests. A two- sentence form letter does little to assuage that
feeling. Tailoring the letter to the specific complaint and including with it
an informational booklet explaining the discipline process would be a gesture
of goodwill toward an important constituent of the legal process. <p>
Finally, each of the grievance committees includes non-lawyers who participate
fully in adjudicating complaints against lawyers. Their presence reflects the
profession's recognition of its accountability to the society it serves. Lay
members of the committees should be highly visible to the public to remind the
community that, through them, the public does play a role in the attorney
discipline process.  <p>
<B>BROADER RANGE OF AVAILABLE SANCTIONS</B><p>
The range of public and private sanctions currently available to the grievance
committees is insufficient to meet the committees' responsibility to prevent
misconduct and limit recidivism. A letter of education, letter of caution,
letter of admonition and a reprimand/admonition after hearing are the types of
discipline administered by the grievance committees pursuant to the procedural
rules, without application to the Appellate Division. They are employed on
occasions when the committee is of the view that the lawyer's violation of a
disciplinary rule was not of sufficient gravity to warrant the filing of formal
charges and their application is not disclosed to the public. Public censure,
suspension and disbarment are the statutorily authorized sanctions imposed by
the Appellate Division, following a hearing based upon formal charges. Although
this sanction structure effectively redresses violations of the Lawyer's Code
of Professional Responsibility, it does not include a vehicle for the
rehabilitation of the errant lawyer that the changing demographics of the
profession call for. <p>
As increasing numbers of new lawyers have entered solo practice without the
benefit of substantial apprenticeship, the profile of lawyers against whom
complaints are made has changed. In years past, the typical respondent in a
disciplinary matter was a middle-aged practitioner who succumbed to the
pressures of practice, often as a consequence of substance abuse. Today,
although substance abuse may still be a factor, with increasing frequency, the
typical respondent has been admitted to the bar no more than ten years,
practicing mostly in circumstances involving no supervision. <p>
It is the Committee's recommendation that the Appellate Division expand the
spectrum of sanctions that can be imposed against respondents to include
mandatory attendance at remedial classes, participation in a mentoring program,
and acquiescence in a monitoring schedule. In different environments and with
escalating degrees of supervision, each program affords an attorney whose lack
of skills has resulted in the filing of charges, the opportunity to remedy the
deficiency. Participation in these programs would be mandated by the grievance
committee or the Appellate Division, in its discretion, as part of, or as an
alternative to, the standard sanction. <p>
Mandatory attendance at remedial classes in ethics, law office management,
communication skills, advocacy, drafting, and substantive law will benefit the
young practitioner who has wide gaps in training. At the grievance committee's
option, the classes can be short-term, like the continuing legal education
seminars sponsored by bar associations, or long-term, like the multi-month
courses conducted under the auspices of law schools. In recent years, attorney
discipline authorities in several states have founded ethics schools which all
respondents in discipline matters must attend. California has operated such a
school for several years. Following the California model, in May, 1995, the
Departmental Disciplinary Committee, First Judicial Department, conducted a
one-day experimental program focusing on ethics, safeguarding escrow funds, and
law office management. Based upon the attendance, which was voluntary, two
programs are planned for 1996. <p>
Mentoring aims at preventing recidivism by matching the errant lawyer with a
respected senior practitioner for a specified period of time. By meeting with
the mentor and observing the way the mentor conducts practice, the
lawyer/mentee has the opportunity to develop practical skills and ethical
sensibilities. At the conclusion of the specified period, the mentor, who
serves pro bono, would submit a written report to the grievance committee,
assessing the lawyer's progress and recommending a disposition of the matter.
If the mentor's assessment is unfavorable, the disciplinary matter would be
pursued. <p>
Monitoring contemplates a more intensive level of supervision in the form of
management and financial audits to which the attorney would submit for a
designated period. Pursuant to court rule, the Appellate Division would most
likely direct monitoring as part of the public sanction imposed following a
hearing based upon formal charges. The conversion of funds is a serious
defalcation that monitoring does not seek to minimize: it is suggested as an
alternative, or adjunct, to discipline in circumstances where it is apparent
that the conversion was the inadvertent result of incompetence. Where
appropriately related to the issuance of private discipline, the grievance
committee also could direct participation in a monitoring program. The concept
of monitoring has precedent in New York. In recent years the Appellate
Divisions occasionally have directed substance abuse monitoring for respondent
attorneys whose misconduct relates to drugs or alcohol use. The lawyer facing
discipline bears the cost of the monitoring. At the end of the designated
period, if the audit results are positive, the sanction is avoided or lifted.
<p>
<B>OPENING DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS FROM A FINDING THAT A PRIMA FACIE CASE
EXISTS</B>
<p>
All but a few legal proceedings are open to the public. It is a cornerstone of
our jurisprudence, derived from the legacy of the fifteenth century English
Star Chamber, that legal action be taken in a public forum. Lawyers, who
challenge the actions and reputations of others in the public forum, may not
consistently shield themselves from that same scrutiny when their own conduct
is questioned and found lacking. Thirty-two states, supported by a number of
bar associations, including the American Bar Association and The Association of
the Bar of the City of New York, presently conduct attorney discipline
proceedings to some extent in public.4 Some states, such as Oregon, open the
process to the public from the time the complaint against an attorney is filed;
others, such as New Jersey permit public scrutiny of discipline proceedings
from the time formal charges are filed against the lawyer. <p>
It is the unanimous conclusion of the Committee that the confidentiality
accorded attorney discipline in New York is an anachronism that burdens rather
than enhances the profession. Accordingly, we urge the Legislature to amend
Judiciary Law Section 90(10) to open disciplinary proceedings to public
scrutiny once formal charges are filed against a lawyer, in accordance with the
standards we propose. <p>
This Committee's proposal would direct public disclosure of pending
disciplinary action against a lawyer in the cases where formal charges are
filed. It would be the responsibility of the grievance committees to maintain
an alphabetical listing of the lawyers subject to charges alleging violation of
the disciplinary rules. The list would include language advising the reader
that the charges have yet to be proved at a hearing. In the event the charges
are not sustained at the hearing, the lawyer's name will be dropped from the
list. Additionally, amendment of Judiciary Law 90 or the grievance committee's
procedural rules would include a provision enabling the Appellate Division, in
the court's discretion, to close the proceedings for good cause shown. <p>
The Committee further recommends that the Appellate Divisions adopt a uniform
standard for determining when formal charges should be filed against a lawyer.
As a result of the various geographic considerations and different cultures of
practice in the four judicial departments, each has evolved its own procedure
for the adjudication of attorney discipline matters. The Committee respects the
evolution of differing procedures as an understandable response to the needs of
the community served by each grievance committee. The Committee's
recommendation contemplates that different means may be employed in different
parts of the state to satisfy the jointly adopted uniform standard for
evaluating a complaint against a lawyer. <p>
The proposed uniform standard is that formal charges be filed against a lawyer
upon a finding that a prima facie case exists against the lawyer. We define
prima facie for this purpose as sufficient evidence, if not contradicted, to
support the conclusion that a lawyer has committed an ethical violation
recognized by the Lawyer's Code of Professional Responsibility. Stated in other
terms, for a prima facie case to exist, all the elements comprising a violation
of a disciplinary rule must be established by sufficient evidence, if it is not
contradicted by other credible evidence, to the satisfaction of the entity
making the determination. Once the charges are filed, the allegations are
subjected to the preponderance of the evidence standard of proof. <p>
The Committee proposes that the prima facie determination be made by the
Appellate Division or a multi-member panel of the grievance committee.
Currently, the Appellate Divisions employ varying mechanisms for determining
when to file formal charges. The court itself makes the determination in the
Second and Third Departments. The First Department consigns that responsibility
to the disciplinary committee's chief counsel and members of the committee. The
full committee makes the finding in the Fourth Department. <p>
So long as a uniform standard for determining whether a prima facie case exists
is adhered to, the Committee recognizes that variations in local procedures for
making that determination may well be appropriate. The Committee, however,
recommends that two minimum procedural requirements be adopted, whatever local
variations otherwise occur. <p>
First, the prima facie determination should not be made by the staff of the
disciplinary committees, but by more than one of the committee members acting
in concert, or by the Appellate Division. <p>
Second, prior to determining whether a prima facie case exists to prefer
charges, the lawyer who is the subject of the allegations should be permitted
to appear before the grievance committee personally or in writing. As the
committee deems appropriate, the lawyer also should be permitted to present
witnesses on his own behalf. <p>
The Committee unanimously concludes that a regime of controlled openness to
public scrutiny is in the interest of both the public and the profession. The
public gains the knowledge, appropriate for it to have, both about particular
cases and about the adequacy of the process. The profession, in turn, benefits
from increased public confidence in the integrity and effectiveness of the
bar's ability to police itself. The constraints suggested are consistent with
fairness to accused attorneys, and the standards and procedures proposed
accommodate the needs for uniformity of substance and diversity in local
practice.

<h3><a name=six>VI. RECOMMENDATIONS TO IMPROVE COURT MANAGEMENT</a></h3> <p>
The operation of the court system stands at the forefront of any discussion
regarding the legal profession. In 1994, overall civil filings in New York's
courts totaled approximately 2.7 million.[fn 1] The individuals who come before
the court have every reason to expect a fair, expeditious, and cost-effective
examination of their claim or defense. To the extent they experience delay,
escalating expenses or even the appearance of an uneven playing field, public
confidence in the legal process is eroded to the detriment of the individuals
who participate in the system and to the detriment of the profession itself.
<p>
<B>PROPOSALS FOR CASE MANAGEMENT AND CALENDAR CONTROL </B><p>
The Unified Court System has recognized the need to develop procedures that
enhance the administration of justice in the courts. Self-examination of the
court process has led to the adoption of different procedures in matrimonial
cases and reform of the jury system. The April, 1995, publication of the Report
of the Committee on Case Management to the Chief Judge and Chief Administrative
Judge of the State of New York, is but the judiciary's most recent effort to
discern and implement improvements in the adjudicatory process. The report
recommends establishment of a differentiated case management program;
development of standards and goals that include the pre-note of issue stage of
litigation; creation of a mediation program for the commercial parts; and
establishment of dedicated parts for matrimonial cases that conduct trials on
consecutive days and resolve custody issues early in the litigation. This
Committee joins its sister committee in urging implementation of those
measures, with the added suggestion that custody matters be decided within six
months of filing the request for judicial intervention.   <p>
The Committee also proposes that task forces be created in each judicial
district to identify ways to limit litigation costs. Increased motion practice
and the time a lawyer spends in court have contributed to the escalation of
expenses in litigated matters. The members of a local task force would well
know the strength and weaknesses of the community's culture of practice. It is
this intimate knowledge that would enable the task force to craft remedies that
meet the needs of the community to be served. <p>
In making its recommendations regarding court management, this Committee is
mindful that the rendering of justice depends upon not only effective systemic
management programs, but also upon the individual judge's ability to direct a
case through discovery and trial to disposition. It is a talent assisted by
appropriate procedural rules and enhanced by training. The Committee endorses
the judiciary's efforts to develop meaningful educational programs that afford
judges the opportunity to develop their skills. <p>
In the course of the Committee's inquiry, one veteran judge commented that
maintaining a current calendar is a judge's best tool in directing the
litigation of any particular case. When a judge's calendar is current, lawyers
know that motion practice will be tightly controlled and delays will be
short-lived; little opportunity exists to divert attention from the issues
underlying the dispute. As a result, dispositions are reached in an
expeditious, cost-controlled fashion. <p>
However overburdened they may be, judges should decide all submitted motions
within the sixty day period specified in the Rules of the Chief Judge, Part 4,
Section 4.1 (a). This management tool, employed by the federal courts too,
reflects the awareness of judges and practitioners alike, that delay in the
disposition of motions is a major contributor to the overall increase in motion
practice during the course of a case. A motion is submitted to address a
dispute within the litigation. Delay in the determination of that motion
creates a vacuum in the case that encourimages other disputes to arise and
exacerbates the level of acrimony between the parties and lawyers. Expenses
increase, attention is diverted from the underlying cause of action, and the
lawyer's relationship with the client can deteriorate. <p>
The measure of control a judge exercises over the calendar can be influenced to
a great degree by the extent to which the judge invokes the statutes and rules
that govern procedure. These provisions, enacted to maintain a level playing
field between the parties and facilitate resolution of the matter in
controversy, range from time limits for motion practice and discovery to
preclusion and financial sanctions for abuse of the process. Professor Roger
Cramton, Esq., Professor of Law at Cornell University, has aptly observed that
procedures, especially sanction procedures, must be frequently and consistently
applied if they are to have meaning to the bar and the judiciary.[fn 2] If not
applied, the standards lose potency and judicial authority is compromised.
Conversely, a judge who enforces these provisions affirms the authority that
reposes in the office, and should not suffer retribution from the parties, the
bar or colleagues. <p>
It is the Committee's recommendation that the judiciary's procedural repertoire
be supplemented by two additional mechanisms for controlling a case. First, a
preliminary conference held shortly after the filing of a request for judicial
intervention would enable judges to direct the litigation from the outset of
the case. At the conference the judge would set a schedule for the performance
of specified tasks and a date by which they must be performed. A rule
promulgated by the Chief Administrative Judge, similar to the preliminary
conference rule in matrimonial cases, should set the time-frame for conducting
the conference. <p>
The Committee also recommends expansion of Part 130 of the Chief
Administrator's Rules which provides for the assessment of a financial sanction
not to exceed an aggregate of $10,000 in a case against a lawyer who is found
to have engaged in frivolous conduct. We propose that conduct subject to
sanction be expanded to include, among other things, judge baiting, ignoring
court directives and discovery abuse. The allowable aggregate sanction amount
also should be increased to an amount to be determined by the Chief
Administrative Judge.   <p>
<B>A "RULE 11" FOR NEW YORK COURTS</B><p>
Believing that it is necessary and possible to purge frivolous claims, defenses
and contentions from New York State litigation, the Committee strongly
recommends legislative enactment of a provision similar to Rule 11 of the
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. There is no room in overcrowded New York
courts for claims, defenses or contentions that are devoid of legal or
evidentiary basis. In describing to the Committee the prevalence of these
tactics, judges and lawyers alike pointed to the federal judiciary's successful
application of Rule 11 to reduce abuses that pervert the legal process, despite
initial objections that it would involve courts in "side shows" that would
themselves cause delay. <p>
Rule 11 provides that the act of submitting a pleading, motion or other paper
to the court constitutes certification that "to the best of the lawyer's
knowledge, information, and belief, formed after an inquiry reasonable under
the circumstances -- (1) it is not being presented for any improper purpose...;
(2) ...the legal contentions are warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous
argument for the extension, modification, or reversal of existing law or the
establishment of new law; (3) ...[the] factual contentions have evidentiary
support [or will have after discovery is conducted]; and (4) the denials of
factual contentions are warranted on the evidence or, if specifically so
identified, are reasonably based on a lack of information or belief."
Procedurally, Rule 11 applications can be initiated by a party or, sua sponte,
by the court. The section includes an opportunity to cure the abuse charged,
without penalty, and does not apply to discovery motions that are regulated
elsewhere in the Rules. Sanctions may be monetary or nonmonetary in nature,
"limited to what is sufficient to deter repetition of such conduct or
comparable conduct by others similarly situated." The existing body of federal
case law regarding the rule will make its application in state court quick and
efficacious. <p>
In essence, Rule 11 reminds all participants in the legal process and the
public that a court of law searches for truth and in the course of the search,
a lawyer serves as the "truthteller." The Rule emphasizes the concept of
service as much as truth. Since there is no area of litigation to which these
principles are not relevant, Rule 11 should apply to all civil litigation. The
suggestion that matrimonial matters should be exempt from Rule 11 because a
lawyer may not be privy to intimacies of a failed marriage, should be
unavailing. It is the lawyer's professional obligation to make "an inquiry
reasonable under the circumstances" to satisfy the Rule.  <p>
<B>STENOGRAPHIC TRANSCRIPTS</B><p>
The importance of receiving from court stenographers timely, affordable and
accurate transcripts and the widespread failure to achieve that objective were
areas of concern highlighted to the Committee by parties, practitioners and
judges. A March, 1995, report on electronic reporting released by a joint
committee of the Unified Court System and the New York State Bar Association
contains recommendations for the extension of electronic recording throughout
the state. This Committee views those proposals as contributing to improvement
in the delivery of stenographic services in New York. In addition, the
Committee urges that the Unified Court System undertake a fast- track study of
ways to reduce the cost of transcripts and the often protracted delays in
providing them, and of further ways modern technology can facilitate the
creation of reliable, inexpensive and timely transcripts.  <p>
<B>ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION</B><p>
Alternate dispute resolution programs have been in
operation in New York's courts for some time. Pursuant to statute and rule,
judicial hearing officers
and referees have long played an important role in the resolution of disputes
presented to the courts. In addition, since 1981 the Unified Court System has
conducted a community dispute resolution program in each of the state's 62
counties as an alternative to commencing formal court proceedings. During the
1993-94 fiscal year, these centers conducted more than 25,000 conciliations,
mediations and arbitrations.[fn 3] <p>
During its examination of arbitration, mediation and other ADR models, the
Committee heard divergent views regarding their fairness, especially in the
area of family law. While proponents of alternate dispute resolution emphasize
the benefits of removing family matters from the adversarial environment of the
courts, others point out that ADR offers little protection to those too
vulnerable to assert themselves. <p>
Chief Judge Kaye has appointed a committee to examine in depth all aspects of
alternate dispute resolution. Co-chaired by Fern Schair, Esq., and Margaret
Shaw, Esq., that committee expects to issue a report in 1996. This Committee
defers to its sister committee's expertise and declines to make recommendations
pertaining to this area.

<h3><a name=seven>VII. TOPICS BEYOND THE COMMITTEE'S MANDATE</a></h3>   <p>
As broad as this Committee's charge is, two matters brought to its attention
fall beyond the scope of the Committee's mandate and competence. Workers'
compensation and domestic relations law were the targets of almost universal
criticism by lawyers, judges and the public. The breadth, frequency and
emotional intensity of these complaints persuade the Committee that the
problems described pertain less to professionalism than to the substantive and
procedural nature of practice in those areas. <p>
Recognizing the problems that appear to pervade the workers' compensation
program, Governor George E. Pataki has ordered a full examination of the
system. In a similar vein, the Committee recommends that the Unified Court
System establish a task force of experts to examine the broad area of domestic
relations. No single area of practice -- perhaps not all other areas of
practice combined -- exhibited so much dissatisfaction between clients and
lawyers, between both and the courts, and so little sense of personal or
professional satisfaction. Judges, law guardians and other professionals
representing the interests of litigants, described a litany of critical
deficiencies in substantive as well as procedural aspects of family law that
adversely affect the individuals who come before the court. The painful
experiences recounted to the Committee by all these participants in domestic
relations cases lead us to conclude that the problems are myriad and systemic;
we recommend a formal, comprehensive and attentive study of them.   <p>
<h3><a name=eight>VIII. CONCLUSION</a></h3><p>
In this Report, the Committee has laid out a series of recommendations as to
measures it is convinced should be taken now to improve the already strong
professionalism of the New York bar and to restore the increasingly weak
confidence of New Yorkers in that professionalism. That deterioration of public
confidence results in significant part from many historical, social, economic
and cultural forces lying beyond the reforming reach of the bar, the bench and
the legislature. Some of it, however, stems from ways that lawyers and courts
have traditionally done business. Some of those practices no longer serve well
either the public or the bar, given major changes in the environment in which
New York lawyers practice. <p>
In the end, we strongly recommend that the measures we propose comprise an
action agenda for the Unified Court System, the Legislature, the organized bar
and the law schools. We believe such an agenda offers practical hope of
addressing those sources of public dissatisfaction that are legitimate and
within the reach of professional reform. <p><UL>

"> In 1992, Nassau County passed an ordinance making it illegal to sell trading cards

which depict a "heinous crime, an element of a heinous crime, or a heinous criminal" to

minors. The statute was passed in response to the release of a set of "True Crime"

trading cards which depicted violent crimes and infamous criminals such as Jeffrey

Dahmer, Charles Manson, and Lizzie Borden. Eclipse Enterprises, the publisher of the

cards, brought suit against the county for violating its right to free speech. In the

magistrate's order, he hypothesizes the censorship called for in the ordinance as

potentially banning a trading card describing Ty Cobb's infamous assault on a crippled

fan in the 1920's or a set of historical cards regarding the Stalinist purges.<P>

CV 92-3416 (ADS)



<P>

ORENSTEIN, United States Magistrate Judge

<P></center>



<H3>INTRODUCTION</H3>



    Plaintiff Eclipse Enterprises, Inc. ("Eclipse") challenges the constitutionality of

Nassau County Local Law Number 11-1992 which makes it a Class A misdemeanor to sell to

minors trading cards which depict a "heinous crime, an element of a heinous crime, or a

heinous criminal and which is harmful to minors." (Local Law 11- 1992 is attached herein

as an appendix to the Report and Recommendation). Plaintiff publishes "True Crime"

trading cards, and other sets of trading cards similar in kind which are targeted by the

ordinance. Defendant County of Nassau ("County") asserts that the ordinance is an

appropriate exercise of its power to protect the welfare of children.[fn 1]

<P>

    District Judge Arthur Spatt referred the matter to this Court to conduct an

evidentiary hearing and to report and recommend its findings. A hearing was conducted on

March 23 and 28, April 7, and May 23, 1994. This Court was requested inter alia to

report and recommend whether 1) Nassau County Local Law Number 11-1992 ("the law" or

"law") violates the First Amendment or is the least restrictive means to further the

County's interest in providing for the well-being of minors; and 2) whether the types of

trading cards prohibited by the statute are "harmful to minors" as defined in the

statute.

<P>

    As a content-based restriction, the Law is subject to the strictest First Amendment

scrutiny. For the reasons set forth below, this Court reports and recommends that Nassau

County Local Law Number 11-1992 is 1) an unconstitutional restraint of free speech in

that it is not narrowly tailored to further the ordinance's stated purpose; 2) is

overbroad and 3) is void for vagueness. The Court further finds that no definitive

evidence was presented at the hearing from which this Court could conclude that the type

of trading cards at issue are "harmful to minors" as defined in the statute. Moreover,

Defendant failed to present evidence to support its claimed connection between the

trading cards in question and the commission of or increase in juvenile crime, or that

the cards impair the "ethical and moral development of youth."



<H3>DISCUSSION</H3>



    The stated purpose of Local Law 11-1992 is to protect the welfare of children

generally, and 1) prevent juvenile crime and 2) ensure the proper moral and ethical

development of county youth specifically. Local Law 11-1992 Section 1. The substantive

portion then attempts to execute its intent by criminalizing the sale of trading cards

containing depictions of violence and criminals to children under the age of seventeen.

<P>

    The Legislative Intent section of Local Law 11-1992 provides in pertinent part: 

<P><blockquote>

"The Board of Supervisors finds that in light of their limited experience, education and

emotional development, children under the age of seventeen are impressionable and

susceptible to the influence of violence and criminal conduct in our society. The

dissemination of materials devoted to the depiction of heinous crimes and heinous

criminals is a contributing factor to juvenile crime, a basic factor in impairing the

ethical and moral development of our youth and a clear and present danger to the

citizens of Nassau County."

<P></blockquote>

Section 1, Law 11-1992.



    <H4>1. Protected Speech</H4>

<P>

    The ordinance prohibits the sale of trading cards which depict heinous crimes or

heinous criminals and are harmful to children. Local Law 11-1992 Section 3. The

ordinance explicitly defines "heinous crime" as murder, assault, kidnapping, arson,

burglary, robbery, rape or other sexual offenses. Local Law 11-1992 Section 2(C). A

"heinous criminal" is defined as one who has been found guilty of committing a heinous

crime. Local Law 11-1992 Section 2(D).

<P>

    Speech which contains depictions of crime or violence is not considered "obscene"

and is thus accorded the protection of the First Amendment. See <I>Winters v. New

York,</I> 333 U.S. 507, 508 (1948) (holding magazines and other written material

depicting stories of bloodshed, lust, or crime protected under the First Amendment);

<I>Video Software Dealers Ass'n v. Webster,</I> 968 F. 2d 684, 688 (8th Cir. 1992)

(video cassettes depicting violence protected under the First Amendment); <I>American

Booksellers Ass'n., Inc. v. Hudnut,</I> 771 F.2d 323, 330 (7th Cir. 1985) (television

violence is protected speech), aff'd, 475 U.S. 1001 (1986); <I>Sovereign News Co. v.

Falke,</I> 448 F. Supp. 306, 394 (N.D. Ohio 1977) (violent material given the highest

degree of First Amendment protection).

<P>

    Plaintiff's products, and trading cards by other manufacturers, are sets of cards

which digest various topical material. Some contain depictions of violence or of persons

who committed crimes of violence. One set of cards, True Crime (Plaintiff's Exhibit,

hereinafter "Pl. Ex." 10), comprises cards that create an encyclopedic history of

infamous criminals. However, not all sets of cards focus on violent individuals or

activity. Coup D'etat (Pl. Ex. 3), published by the plaintiff, is a set of cards which

discusses the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. The individual cards which

discuss the shooting of the President, Officer Tippit, and Lee Harvey Oswald contain

depictions of "heinous crimes" as defined in the statute. Similarly, The Rise and Fall

of the Soviet Union (from Lenin to Yeltsin), contains a comprehensive introduction to

the history of the Soviet Union (Pl. Ex. 6). One card in the set discusses the murder of

the Czar and his family, another, the wholesale murder of millions in the Stalinist

"purges" of the early 1930's. The set Foul Ball (Baseball's Greatest Scandals,

Scoundrels and Screw-ups), (Pl. Ex. 28), contains a card which discusses Ty Cobb's

violent assault on a spectator, and another card which digests a former major league

catcher's violent bat-wielding assault on a former major league pitcher during their

active playing days. Inspection of the sets reveals that only some of the cards fall

within the purview of the law.

<P>

    Nevertheless, the County relies upon the Local Law's legislative intent of

protecting the physical and psychological well-being of minors. (Defendant's

Post-hearing Memorandum of Law, hereinafter "Def. Mem. of Law" at 1.) The County argues

that Local Law 11-1992 is an appropriate exercise to "shield minors from the influence

of literature that is not obscene by adult standards." (Id. at 1-2.)

<P>

    There is no doubt that the protection of the physical and psychological well-being

of minors is a compelling governmental interest, and that the government may

constitutionally regulate protected speech in order to promote such an interest.

<I>Sable Communications of California, Inc. v. F.C.C.,</I> 492 U.S. 115, 126 (1989)

(citing <I>Ginsberg v. New York,</I> 390 U.S. 629, 639-40 (1968));<I> New York v.

Ferber,</I> 458 U.S. 747, 756-57 (1982). In furtherance of their goal, the government

may adopt more stringent controls on what communicative material is available to minors

as opposed to adults. <I>Erznoznik v. City of Jacksonville, </I>422 U.S. 205, 212

(1975). Minors are entitled to significant First Amendment protection. Therefore, the

government's ability to prohibit public dissemination of protected materials is limited

to "relatively narrow and well-defined circumstances." Id. at 212-13. To withstand

constitutional scrutiny, the government must act by narrowly drawn regulations designed

to serve those interests without unnecessarily interfering with a minor's First

Amendment freedoms. Sable 492 U.S. at 126 (citing <I>Schaumburg v. Citizens</I> for a

setter Environment, 444 U.S. 620, 637 (1980) (citations omitted)). Even in the context

of regulating a minor's access to sexually oriented materials, the Supreme Court has

held that "speech that is neither obscene as to youths nor subject to some other

legitimate proscription cannot be suppressed solely to protect the young from ideas or

images that a legislative body thinks is unsuitable for them." Erznoznik, 422 U.S. at

213-14.



     <H4>2. Content-Based Ordinance</H4>



    Laws that "by their terms distinguish favored speech from disfavored speech on the

basis of the ideas or views expressed are content-based." <I>Turner Broadcasting System,

Inc. v. F.C.C.,</I> 114 S. Ct. 2445, 2459 (1994). Regulations which attempt to control

expression on the basis of content are presumptively invalid. <I>Simon & Schuster v.

N.Y. Crime Victims Board,</I> -- U.S. --, 112 S. Ct. 501, 508 (1991); <I>Regan v. Time,

Inc.,</I> 468 U.S. 641, 648-49 (1984). The danger of such regulations is that government

may effectively drive certain ideas or viewpoints from the marketplace based solely on

disagreement with the message conveyed. Simon & Schuster, 112 S. Ct. at 508. The Supreme

Court has repeatedly warned against prohibiting expression simply because society finds

the idea offensive or disagreeable. See, e.q., <I>Texas v. Johnson,</I> 491 U.S. 397,

414 (1989); <I>Hustler Magazine Inc. v. Falwell,</I> 485 U.S. 46, 55 (1988) ("the fact

that society may find speech offensive is not a sufficient reason for suppressing it.").

<P>

    Local Law 11-1992 is clearly content-based. It prohibits the sale to minors of

trading cards depicting violent acts, while allowing athletic and other topical cards to

be sold. As a content-based restriction, the Law is subject to the highest First

Amendment scrutiny. Defendant must prove that the regulation is narrowly tailored to

serve a compelling governmental interest without unnecessarily interfering with First

Amendment freedoms. <I>Perry Educ. Ass'n. v. Perry Local Educ. Ass'n.,</I> 460 U.S. 37,

45 (1983) . Additionally, the government must choose the least restrictive means to

further the articulated interest. Sable Communications, 492 U.S. at 126. The government

must demonstrate that the "ordinance 'does not burden substantially more speech than is

necessary to further the government's legitimate interests. Turner Broadcasting, 114 S.

Ct. at 2470 (quoting <I>Ward v. Rock Against Racism,</I> 491 U.S. 791, 799 (1989) .



   <H4> 3. Narrowly Tailored</H4>



    No empirical evidence, beyond mere speculation or conjecture, was presented at the

hearing from which the Court could find any causal connection between the sale to minors

of this genre of trading cards and juvenile crime or that such sale impairs the ethical

or moral development of minors.

<P>

    The government has failed to meet its burden of demonstrating that the ordinance is

narrowly tailored to achieve or serve its stated compelling interest. See Turner

Broadcasting, 114 S. Ct. at 2470; Sable, 492 U.S. at 126; Perry, 460 U.S. at 45.

Legislative bodies are not required to draft legislation with scientific certainty.

Ginsberg v. New York, 390 U.S. 629, 642-43 (1968) (citing <I>Noble State Bank v.

Haskell,</I> 219 U.S. 104, 110 (1911)). However, even in the context of commercial

speech, with its attendant lower "rational relation" standard, the Supreme Court

requires the governmental body seeking to sustain a restriction on protected speech to

demonstrate that the restriction directly advances the state interest involved.

<I>Edenfield v. Fane,</I> 113 S. Ct. 1792, 1800 (1993) (citing <I>Central Hudson Gas &

Elec. Corp. v. Public Serv. Comm'n of New York,</I> 447 U.S. 557, 564 (1980)). "The

regulation may not be sustained if it provides only ineffective or remote support for

the government's purpose." Id. The government's burden is not satisfied by "mere

speculation or conjecture," Edenfield, 113 S.Ct. at 1800, and must do more than simply

"'posit the existence of the disease sought to be cured. <I>Turner Broadcasting Sys.,

Inc. v. F.C.C.,</I> 114 S. Ct. 2445, 2470 (1994) (quoting <I>Quincy Cable Television,

Inc. v. F.C.C.,</I> 768 F. 2d 1434, 1455 (D.C. Cir. 1985)). In Edenfield, the Supreme

Court noted the lack of any studies, empirical data, or anecdotal evidence indicating a

connection between the government's stated interests and the restriction on protected

speech. 113 S. Ct. at 1800-01.

<P>

    In the instant case the evidence presented by Nassau County is similarly weak and

insufficient to justify the broad restriction. The Local Law concludes that the

dissemination of communications about heinous crimes or heinous criminals "is a

contributing factor to juvenile crime, [and] a basic factor in impairing the ethical and

moral development of [county] youth. Local Law 11-1992 Section 1. At the hearing, a

member of the county legislature testified that in passing the ordinance, the Board had

no evidence that any crime had been linked to the reading of a trading card depicting

heinous crimes or criminals. (Hearing Transcript, hereinafter "Tr." at 4:73-74.)[fn 2]

Moreover, the same witness testified that the Board did not consult any mental health

professionals with respect to the effect on minors of this genre of trading cards. (Tr.

at 4:74.) In fact, the witness testified that the County's conclusion that trading cards

which depict crimes or criminals are a contributing factor to juvenile crime was based

solely upon "surmise." (Tr. at 4:83-85.)

<P>

    Defendant's witnesses testified that no study, scientific or otherwise, has ever

been conducted to examine whether trading cards which depict crime or criminals affect

minors. (Tr. at 1:58; 1:197.) Much testimony focused upon the effect of violence in the

media on minors. Most studies have specifically addressed violence on television and not

violence in literature. Yet, television or videos and films combine the senses of sight

and hearing. Trading cards are merely speech, or involve the sense of sight.

<P>

    Even assuming that the studies on violence in the media are analogous to trading

cards, evidence of a causal relationship is contradictory and inconclusive. See Stephen

J. Kim, Viewer Discretion Advised: A Structural Approach To The Issue Of Televised

Violence, 142 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1383, 1383-85 (1994) (noting the various conflicting

studies and debates regarding the effects of violence in television on society). The

only obvious conclusion to be drawn is the clear difference of opinion over this

sensitive issue. Accordingly, little in the testimony and exhibits justifies the

regulation of the protected speech herein.

<P>

    In addition, the County fails to offer any justification for a distinction between

trading cards and other forms of communication that depict violence in furthering its

interest of preventing juvenile crime and protecting the welfare of minors. See Simon &

Shuster, 112 S. Ct. at 510 (no justification offered for distinction between regulating

profits of criminals from books and other assets). Books, magazines, and other forms of

media contain depictions of the very same crimes and criminals as the trading cards at

issue. Plaintiff demonstrated that hundreds of such books are available to minors in the

County's schools and public libraries. (Pl. Exs. 24, 25.)

<P>

    Defendant urges that Local Law 11-1992 is narrowly tailored because its language is

specific and contains strict definitions, in contrast to the ordinance in <I>Video

Software Dealers Ass'n. v. Webster,</I> 968 F. 2d 684 (8th Cir. 1992). (Def. Mem. at 5.)

The Court agrees that Webster is distinguishable in this respect. In Webster the court

relied primarily on the failure of Missouri's statute to define the type of violence at

issue. Here, however, the Court draws its conclusions not from the County's failure to

clearly define the type of communication which is banned, but from the utter failure of

the County to demonstrate that the restrictions placed on the First Amendment are in any

way tailored to attain the compelling interest sought to be achieved. The statute

unnecessarily infringes on freedom of expression. See Sable, 492 U.S. at 126.



    <H4>4. Overbreadth</H4>



    Under the law, heinous crime has been defined as "murder, assault, kidnapping,

arson, burglary, robbery or other sexual offenses." Local Law 11-1992 Section 2.

Plaintiff argues that the law is overbroad and sweeps within its prohibition virtually

all discussion of history, politics, and current events. (Pl. Mem. at 16-17.) Defendant

argues that the overbreadth doctrine must be employed only as a last resort. (Def. Mem.

at 6). The County further argues that in any event, the statute's clearly defined terms

prevent application of the ordinance in an overbroad manner. (Id. at 6-7.)

<P>

    However, based upon the testimony of Defendant's own experts, it is clear that the

Local Law's comprehensive definitions inevitably create this very defect. The

ordinance's broad definition of heinous crimes covers murder in a war context, an

assaultive tackle on a football card, and a fictional story or thriller. A card which

would depict and tell the story of Cain slaying Abel comes within the Law's purview, as

does a card which would depict the Holocaust. Cards which selectively copy photographs

from the True Crime set include cards about Elliot Ness and J. Edgar Hoover, in addition

to cards about Al Capone and "Lucky" Luciano. (Pl. Ex. 10.) The set also contains a card

detailing the kidnapping of the Lindberg baby, in addition to the St. Valentine's Day

massacre. Id. Defendant's own experts noted numerous innocuous cards that, in their

expert opinion, would not contribute to juvenile crime yet would be banned for sale to

minors. (Tr. at 1:68, 69, 70, 77-78, 79, 81, 84; 2:25, 39, 49.)

<P>

    The law fails to account for the varying degrees of violence that might be revealed

in a particular card. Additionally, the context of the violence is not taken into

account. For example, the reprint set of trading cards Horrors of War details the early

days of World War II and the Spanish civil war. (Pl. Ex. 8.) Each and every card in the

set ends its digest with the epitaph, in bold print, "To know the HORRORS OF WAR is to

want PEACE." (Id.) Local Law 11-1992 would prevent minors in Nassau county from

purchasing cards with that message. The law sweeps within its ambit every trading card

which contains a depiction of violence regardless of context or pervasiveness, and no

matter how tangential or incidental the violence may be. See Simon & Shuster, 112 S. Ct.

at 511; Erznoznik, 422 U.S. at 213.[fn 3]



     <H4>5. Vagueness</H4>



    Plaintiff also maintains that the law is void for vagueness. (Pl. Mem. at 17.)

Defendant claims that the statutory language provides explicit definitions from which an

ordinary person could determine which trading cards could not be sold to minors. (Def.

Mem. at 9.) Local Law 11-1992 requires a determination not only of whether the

particular cards contain depictions of "heinous crimes or "heinous criminals," but also

whether the particular card is "harmful to minors." Plaintiff does not dispute that the

ordinance provides explicit definitions and guidelines with respect to what is a

"heinous crime" or "heinous criminal." (Pl. Mem. at 18.) The plaintiff challenges the

vagueness of the term "harmful to minors." Id.

<P>

    A statute must "give the person of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to

know what is prohibited" and "provide explicit standards for those who apply [the

statute]" so as to avoid "arbitrary and discriminatory application." <I>Grayned v. City

of Rockford,</I> 408 U.S. 104, 108-09 (1972); see also <I>Smith v. Goguen,</I> 415 U.S.

566, 572-73 (1974); <I>Bantam Books v. Sullivan,</I> 372 U.S. 58, 71 (1963). 

<P>

    Defendant contends that any trading card which depicts a "heinous crime" or "heinous

criminal" is de facto "harmful to minors." Therefore, so the argument goes, one need

only look to the definitions to determine what trading cards are prohibited. (Def. Mem.

at 9.) However, this assertion fails to acknowledge the statutory language of the

criteria required for a determination that a card is harmful to minors. The County has

adopted a modification of the <I>Miller v. California</I> obscenity test in an attempt

to provide guidelines for the statute's application of what is "harmful to minors."

"Harmful to Minors" means that quality of any description or representation in whatever

form of a heinous crime, an element of a heinous crime or a heinous criminal, when it 1)

considered as a whole, appeals to the depraved interest of minors in crime; and 2) is

patently offensive to prevailing standards in the adult community as a whole with

respect to what is suitable material for minors; and 3) considered as a whole, lacks

serious literary, artistic, political and scientific value for minors.

<P>

    The Court finds the application of this test "elusive." See Video Software, 968 F.2d

at 690 (adoption of Miller obscenity test for regulation of sale to minors of violent

video cassettes void for vagueness). In a clear exposition of the inability of one of

ordinary intelligence to reasonably know what is prohibited, Defendant's own

psychological experts contradicted each other, and themselves, as to whether certain

cards are "harmful to minors." Dr. Sandra Kaplan testified that a card depicting General

Suharto from the Friendly Dictators, featuring 36 of America's Most Embarrassing Allies

trading card set (Pl. Ex. 2) would not be harmful. (Tr. at 1:79.) Later, Dr. Kaplan

testified that the very same card was harmful. (Tr. at 1:126.) In another example, Dr.

Kaplan testified that a card depicting Rick Mazzeo from the Rotten to the Core, The Best

and Worst of New York City's Politics (Pl. Ex. 4) trading card set was harmful.[fn 4]

(Tr. at 1:60.) Another defendant expert, Dr. Miriam Miedzian, testified that the Rick

Mazzeo card was "certainly not a problem." (Tr. at 2:70.)

<P>

    The Court finds that under Local Law 11-1992, a person of ordinary intelligence

cannot reasonably distinguish between those trading cards which are "harmful to minors"

and those that are not. 92 S. Ct. at 2298-99.



     <H4>6. The Statutory Presumption</H4>



    Section 4 of the ordinance provides for a presumption of "knowledge of the character

and content of the material sold or loaned." Local Law 11-1992 Section 4. Plaintiff

challenges the ordinance on the basis that it imposes strict liability on one who

disseminates speech in the form of trading cards targeted by the local law. (Pl. Mem. at

19.) Defendant asserts that the presumption is a proper inference which may substitute

for direct evidence of intent. (Def. Mem. at 12.).

<P>

    The First Amendment requires that statutes imposing criminal sanctions for

distribution of unprotected speech must contain a scienter requirement. New York v.

Ferber, 458 U.S. 747, 765 (1982); <I>Smith v. California,</I> 361 U.S. 147, 151-53

(1959) (strict liability for possession of obscene material is unconstitutional as it

carries the risk of self-censorship); Video Software, 968 F.2d at 690 (lack of knowledge

requirement renders statute unconstitutional).

<P>

    Moreover, "a criminal statutory presumption must be regarded as 'irrational' or

'arbitrary', and hence unconstitutional, unless it can at least be said with substantial

assurance that the presumed fact is more likely than not to flow from the proved fact on

which it is made to depend." <I>Leary v. United States,</I> 395 U.S. 6, 36 (1969);

accord <I>Young v. Abrams,</I> 698 F.2d 131, 136 (2d Cir. 1983); see also <I>Tot v.

United States,</I> 319 U.S. 463, 467-68 (1943).

<P>

    Defendant asserts that "there is clearly a rational connection between the sale of

trading cards depicting "heinous crimes" and/or "heinous criminals" and the presumption

that one sold a package of these cards with knowledge of its contents." (Def. Mem. at

13). Contrary to Defendant's assertions, neither the United States Supreme Court in 

<I>Ginsberg v. New York,</I> 390 U.S. 629 (1968), nor the New York Court of Appeals in

<I>People v. Hartman,</I> 244 N.E. 2d 710 (N.Y. 1968), endorsed the presumption

provision of 235.22 of the New York State Penal Law. In fact, both cases were decided

under 484-h, the earlier version of 235.22, which did not contain Section 4 of the

present Nassau County Local Law 11-1992. See Ginsberg, 390 U.S. at 632 n. 1; Hartman,

244 N.E.2d at 711.

<P>

    Nevertheless, the Court finds that the presumption provision of Nassau County Local

Law 11-1992 is neither irrational nor arbitrary. Specifically, the Court concludes that

it is more likely than not that a disseminator of trading cards depicting heinous crimes

and/or criminals deemed harmful to minors would have knowledge of the general character

and content of such materials. In so holding, the Court emphasizes that Section 4 of

Local Law 11- 1992 merely sets forth a permissive, not mandatory inference of fact and

is rebuttable. See Young, 698 F.2d at 136 (discussing New York Penal Law 235.10, which

contains an almost identical presumption provision in the obscenity context). The

presumption that a disseminator of trading cards had knowledge of the contents &

character of his materials may constitutionally be substituted for direct evidence on

the issue of scienter. See Young, 698 F.2d at 136-37; <I>Overstock Book Co. v.

Berry,</I> 436 F.2d 1289, 1294 (2d Cir. 1970) (both cases upholding constitutionality of

New York Penal Law 235.10); see also Smith, 361 U.S. at 154 ("Eyewitness testimony of a

bookseller's perusal of a book hardly need be a necessary element in proving his

awareness of its contents. The circumstances may warrant the inference that he was aware

of what a book contained, despite his denial.") (Brennan, J., opinion).



<H3>CONCLUSION</H3>



    Based upon the foregoing, this Court reports and recommends that Nassau County Local

Law 11-1992 is an unconstitutional restriction on the distribution of free speech and

ideas. The law is not narrowly tailored to further the ordinance's stated purposes of

preventing juvenile crime and protecting the welfare of children under the age of 17.

<P>

    The law is overbroad in that all cards which depict violence are targeted, even if

the violence is tangential or incidental.

<P>

    The Court further finds that the law is vague and ambiguous in that no reasonable

person can determine whether a particular trading card or set of cards taken as a whole

is harmful to minors.

<P>

    Finally, the Court finds that no credible or empirical evidence was presented from

which this Court could conclude that the trading cards cause juvenile crime or impair

moral and ethical development.

<P>

    Despite this Court's findings and recommendations, the County's attempt to deal with

a societal problem is praiseworthy. Today, more and more children are exposed to more

and more senseless activity. Many are born addicted to narcotic drugs or with fetal

alcohol syndrome. Unlike a generation ago, children today are raised in a culture where

violence is depicted in the media on a daily basis. As a result, children are growing up

desensitized to the horrors of the violence around them, which could very well

predispose them to certain anti-social behaviors. But, however praiseworthy the local

law and its goals, the County cannot enact legislation which fails to pass

constitutional muster. The burdens of living in a democracy are great. One of those

burdens is that we must often accept offensive or tasteless speech.

<P>

"Madison admonished us: A popular Government, without popular information, or the means

of acquiring it, is but a Prologue to a Farce or a Tragedy; or, perhaps both. Knowledge

will forever govern ignorance: And a people who mean to be their own Governors, must arm

themselves with the power knowledge gives."

<LI>In the defendant's Post-hearing memorandum of law, the defendant argues that the law

is a permissible regulation of commercial speech. (Def. Mem. at 16.) The Court finds no

merit to this argument. See Virginia State Bd. of Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizens Consumer

Council, Inc., 425 U.S. 748, 762 (1976) (commercial speech is limited to that which

proposes a commercial transaction).

<P>

<LI>In citing to transcripts of the hearing, the designation N:pp indicates the volume

number followed by the page number. Volume 1 of the transcript refers to that portion of

the hearing conducted on March 23, 1994; Volume 2, March 28, 1994; Volume 3, April 7,

1994; Volume 4, May 16, 1994; and Volume 5, May 23, 1994.

<P>

<LI>In a recent case before the District of Columbia Circuit Court, Action For

Children's Television v. FCC, 1995 WL 384630 (D.C. Cir. 6/95), the court concluded that

the Public Communications Act of 1992, which banned indecent broadcasting on television

between the hours of 6:00 A.M. until midnight, was constitutional. That case is

distinguishable due to the unique nature of broadcasting, and the limited First

Amendment concerns in that context. The trading cards in question do not present the

"captive audience" or unwilling listener problem, and involve more serious First

Amendment concerns. The cards, similar to the indecent phone call in Sable, require

affirmative acts to obtain a desired message. Unsuspecting or innocent youngsters are

not in danger of viewing the cards, like a passing indecent scene on television or the

evening television news broadcasts.

<P>

The Communications Act seeks to channel indecent messimages to certain times of the day,

while the Nassau County law attempts to ban all sales of cards to minors at all times.

Lastly, the Nassau County law is broadly defined and supported by minimal evidence,

while the Public Communications Act is narrowly defined, and adequately supported by FCC

studies.

<P>

<LI>The Court also notes that Dr. Kaplan's courtroom testimony with respect to the Rick

Mazzeo card was different than at her deposition. (Tr. at 1:60.)

AVENUE, NE.<br>  WASHINGTON, DC 20510 6425<br>  TELEPHONE (202) 224-2981<p>  <p>  <p>  <H2>RESOLUTION FOR
INVESTIGATION</H2></center> 
 <img align=left width=68 height=68 src=/images/spotlight/packwo.gif> <p>       Whereas, the Select Committee
on Ethics on December 1, l992, initiated a  Preliminary Inquiry (hereafter "Inquiry") into allegations of
sexual misconduct  by Senator Bob Packwood, and subsequently, on February 4, 1993, expanded the  scope of its
Inquiry to include allegations of attempts to intimidate and  discredit the alleged victims, and misuse of
official staff in attempts to  intimidate and discredit:, and notified Senator Packwood of such actions;
and<p>  <p>     Whereas, on December 15, 1993, in light of sworn testimony that Senator  Packwood may have
altered evidence relevant to the Committee's Inquiry, the  Chairman and Vice-Chairman determined as an
inherent part of its Inquiry to  inquire into the integrity of evidence sought by the Committee and into any 
information that anyone may have endeavored to obstruct its Inquiry, and  notified Senator Packwood of such
action; and<p>  <p>  <p>     Whereas, on May 11, 1994, upon completion of the Committee staff's review of 
Senator Packwood's typewritten diaries, the Committee expanded its Inquiry  again to include additional areas
of potential misconduct by Senator Packwood,  including solicitation of financial support for his spouse from
persons with an  interest in legislation, in exchange, gratitude, or recognition for his  official acts;<p> 
<p>     Whereas, the Committee staff has conducted the Inquiry under the direction  of the Members of the
Committee; and<p>  <p>     Whereas, the Committee has received the Report of its staff relating to its 
Inquiry concerning Senator Packwood; and<p>  <p>     Whereas, on the basis of evidence received during the
inquiry, there are  possible violations within the Committee's jurisdiction as contemplated in  Section
2(a)(1) of S. Res. 338, 88th Congress, as amended:<p>  <p>     It is therefore Resolved:<p>  <p>     I.  That
the Committee makes t]he following determinations regarding the  matters set forth above:<p>  <p>          (a)
 With respect to sexual misconduct, the Committee has carefully  considered evidence, including sworn
testimony, witness interviews/ and  documentary evidence, relating to the following allegations:  <UL>        
 (1)  That in 1990, in his Senate office in Washington, D.C., Senator  Packwood grabbed a staff. member by the
shoulders and kissed her on the lips;<p>  <p>          (2)  That in 1985, at a function in Bend, Oregon,
Senator Packwood  fondled a campaign worker as they danced.  Later that year, in Eugene, Oregon,  in saying
goodnight and thank you to her, Senator Packwood grabbed the campaign  worker's face with his hands, pulled
her towards him, and kissed her on the  mouth, forcing his tongue into her mouth;<p>  <p>          (3)  That
in 1981 or 1982, .in his Senate office in Washington, D.C.,  Senator Packwood squeezed the arms of a lobbyist,
leaned over and kissed her on  the mouth;<p>  <p>          (4)  That in 1981, in the basement of the Capitol,
Senator Packwood  walked a former staff assistant into a room, where he grabbed her with both  hands in her
hair and kissed her, forcing his tongue into her mouth;<p>  <p>          (5)  That in 1980, in a parking lot
in Eugene, Oregon, Senator Packwood  pulled a campaign worker toward him, put his arms around her, and kissed
her,  forcing his tongue in her mouth; he also invited her to his motel room;<p>  <p>          (6)  That in
1980 or early 1981, at a hotel in Portland, Oregon, on two  separate occasions, Senator Packwood kissed a desk
clerk who worked for the  hotel;<p>  <p>          (7)  That in 1980, in his Senate office in Washington, D.C.,
Senator  Packwood grabbed a staff member by the shoulders, pushed her down on a couch,  and kissed her on the
lips; the staff member tried several times to get up, but  Senator Packwood repeatedly pushed her back on the
couch;<p>  <p>          (8)  That in 1979, Senator Packwood walked into the office of another  Senator in
Washington, D.C., started talking with a staff member, and suddenly  leaned down and kissed the staff member
on the lips;<p>  <p>          (9)  That in 1977, in an elevator in the Capitol, and on numerous  occasions,
Senator Packwood grabbed the elevator operator by the shoulders,  pushed her to the wall of the elevator and
kissed her on the lips.  Senator  Packwood also came to this person's home, kissed her, and asked her to make 
love with him;<p>  <p>          (10)  That in 1977, in a motel room while attending the Dorchester  Conference
in coastal Oregon, Senator Packwood grabbed a prospective employee  by her shoulders, pulled her to him, and
kissed her;<p>  <p>          (11)  That in 1975, in his Senate office in Washington, D.C., Senator  Packwood
grabbed the staff assistant referred to in (4), pinned her against a  wall or desk, held her hair with one
hand, bending her head backwards, fondling  her with his other hand, and kissed her, forcing his tongue into
her mouth;<p>  <p>          (12)  That in 1975, in his Senate office in Washington, D.C., Senator  Packwood
grabbed a staff assistant around her shoulders, held her tightly while  pressing his body into hers, and
kissed her on the mouth;<p>  <p>          (13)  That in the early 1970's, in his Senate office in Portland, 
Oregon, Senator Packwood chased a staff assistant around a desk;<p>  <p>          (14)  That in 1970, in a
hotel restaurant in Portland, Oregon, Senator  Packwood ran his hand up the leg of a dining room hostess, and
touched her  crotch area;<p>  <p>          (15)  That in 1970, in his Senate office in Washington, D.C.,
Senator  Packwood grabbed a staff member by the shoulders and kissed her on the mouth;<p>  <p>          (16) 
That in 1969, in his Senate office in Washington, D.C., Senator  Packwood made suggestive comments to a
prospective employee;<p>  <p>          (17)  That in 1969, at his home, Senator Packwood grabbed an employee 
of another Senator who was babysitting for him, rubbed her shoulders and back,  and kissed her on the mouth.
He also put his arm around her and touched her leg  as he drove her home;<p>  <p>          (18)  That in 1969,
in his Senate office in Portland, Oregon, Senator  Packwood grabbed a staff worker, stood on her feet, grabbed
her hair, forcibly  pulled her head back, and kissed her on the mouth, forcing his tongue into her  mouth. 
Senator Packwood also reached under her skirt and grabbed at her  undergarments. </ul>  <p>  Based upon the
Committee's consideration of evidence related to each of these  allegations, the Committee finds that there is
substantial credible evidence  that provides substantial cause for the Committee to conclude that violations 
within the Committee's jurisdiction as contemplated in Section 2(a)(1) of S.  Res. 338, 88th Congress, as
amended, may have occurred; to wit, that Senator  Packwood may have abused his United States Senate Office by
improper conduct  which has brought discredit upon the United States Senate, by engaging in a  pattern of
sexual misconduct between 1969 and 1990.<p>  <p>     Notwithstanding this conclusion, for purposes of making a
determination at  the end of its Investigation with regard to a possible pattern of conduct  involving sexual
misconduct, some Members of the Committee have serious  concerns about the weight, if any, that should be
accorded to evidence of  conduct alleged to have occurred prior to 1976, the year in which the federal  court
recognized quid pro quo sexual harassment as discrimination under the  Civil Rights Act, and the Senate passed
a resolution prohibiting sex  discrimination in the United States Senate, and taking into account the age of 
the allegations.<p>  <p>     (b)  With respect to the Committee's inherent responsibility to inquire into  the
integrity of the evidence sought by the Committee as part of its Inquiry,  the Committee finds, within the
meaning of Section 2(a)(1) of S. Res. 338, 88th  Congress, as amended, that there is substantial credible
evidence that provides  substantial cause for the Committee to conclude that improper conduct  reflecting upon
the Senate, and/or possible violations of federal law, i.e.,  Tittle 18, United States Code, Section 1505, may
have occurred.  To wit:<p>  <p>     Between some time in December 1992 and some time in November 1993, Senator
 Packwood intentionally altered diary materials that he knew or should have  known the Committee had sought or
would likely seek as part of its Preliminary  Inquiry begun on December 1, 1992.<p>  <p>     (c)  With respect
to possible solicitation of financial support for his  spouse from persons with an interest in legislation,
the Committee has  carefully considered evidence, including sworn testimony and documentary  evidence,
relating to Senator Packwood's contacts with the following persons:<p>  <UL>          (1)  A registered
foreign agent representing a client who had  particular interests before the Committee on Finance and the
Committee on  Commerce, Science and Transportation;<p>  <p>          (2)  A businessman who had. particular
interests before the Committee  on Commerce, Science and Transportation;<p>  <p>          (3)  A businessman
who had particular interests before the Committee on  Finance and the Committee on Commerce, Science and
Transportation;<p>  <p>          (4)  A registered lobbyist: representing clients who had particular 
interests before the Committee on Finance and the Committee on Commerce,  Science and Transportation;<p>  <p> 
        (5)  A registered lobbyist representing a client who had particular  interests before the Committee on
Finance.</ul>  <p>     Based upon the Committee's consideration of this evidence, the Committee  finds that
there is substantial credible evidence that provides substantial  cause for the Committee to conclude that
violations within the Committee's  jurisdiction as contemplated in Section 2(a)(1) of S. Res. 338, 88th
Congress,  as amended, may have occurred, to wit: Senator Packwood may have abused his  United States Senate
Office through improper conduct which has brought  discredit upon the United States Senate by inappropriately
linking personal  financial gain to his official position in that he solicited or otherwise  encouraged offers
of financial assistance from persons who had a particular  interest in legislation or issues that Senator
Packwood could influence.<p>  <p>     II.  That the Committee, pursuant to Committee Supplementary Procedural 
Rules 3(d)(5) and 4(f)(4), shall proceed to an Investigation under Committee  Supplementary Procedural Rule 5;
and<p>  <p>     III.  That Senator Packwood shall be given timely written notice of this  Resolution and the
evidence supporting it, and informed of a respondent's  rights pursuant to the Rules of the Committee.<p>  <p>

<p>     By a letter received at the Committee November 30, 1992, the Women's Equal  Rights Legal Defense and
Education Fund (WERLDEF), filed a complaint against  Senator Packwood, and requested an investigation of the
sexual harassment and  misconduct allegations that had been made against him.  By letter dated  December 1,
1992, the Committee notified Senator Packwood of the complaint, and  that the Committee had decided to conduct
a preliminary inquiry into the  allegations.<p>  <p>     On December 10, 1992, Senator Packwood held a press
conference, in which he  read a statement saying, <I>inter alia,</I> that he took full responsibility for his 
conduct, that all of his past record was clouded because of incidents in which  his actions were unwelcomed
and offensive to the women involved, and  justifiably so; that his past actions were not just inappropriate,
that what he  had done was not just stupid or boorish, but his actions were just plain wrong.  He stated that
he "didn't get it", but that he did now.  Without getting into  specific allegations, he admitted his mistake,
and apologized to the women  involved. [fn 1]<p>  <p>     On December 21, 1992, the Committee received a sworn
complaint, in which a  woman alleged that Senator Packwood had made an improper advance toward her,  and asked
that the Committee investigate his behavior.  Her attorney also  requested the Committee to conduct an inquiry
into the pattern of Senator  Packwood's conduct over a period of years with regard to other women he 
Committee received numerous letters from other groups and private citizens  urging that the Committee
investigate the allegations of sexual harassment and  misconduct.   <p>  <p>          On February 4, 1993, the
Committee announced that it was expanding the  scope of its inquiry to include allegations of attempts to
intimidate and  discredit the alleged victims, and misuse of official staff in attempts to  intimidate and
discredit<p>  <p>           <H4>2.   How the Investigation was Conducted</H4><p>  <p>     The staff took sworn
depositions or statements from twenty- two women who  made allegations of sexual harassment or misconduct
against Senator Packwood.  The staff also interviewed or deposed witnesses who corroborated the  allegations
made by some of the women accusers, by virtue of the fact that the  women had told them about the incident,
although not always in great detail,  either shortly after it occurred, or well before the allegations were
published  by the <I>Post.</I><p>  <p>     The staff also mailed a letter and questionnaire to 293 female
former  Packwood staff members, asking if they had information relevant to the  Committee's inquiry.  194
questionnaires were returned. [fn 2] 39 signed  returned receipt cards were returned, but no corresponding
questionnaires were  returned.[fn 3]  47 of the questionnaires were returned as undeliverable.[fn 4]  Thus,
out of the 293 questionnaires originally sent, 280 have been accounted  for, either by the questionnaire being
returned, by the return receipt card  being returned, indicating that the questionnaire was delivered but the 
addressee did not wish to respond, or by the questionnaire being returned as  undeliverable.<p>  <p>     The
bulk of the persons responding to the questionnaire (approximately 122)  had no relevant information [fn 5];
approximately 34 did not wish to become  involved in the Committee's inquiry. [fn 6]  Approximately 35 women
responded  that they had relevant information; most of these women provided (by a written  statement
accompanying their questionnaire, by a telephone interview, or both)  statements of support for the Senator,
generally stating that they had a  wonderful experience working for him, that they had neither experienced nor
 heard of any type of sexual misconduct by the Senator, and that they viewed the  Senator as a gentleman who
was genuinely interested in advancing women and  women's causes.  A few of these women provided information
about misconduct  involving women who have not chosen to come forward, some of which corroborated  information
the staff had already uncovered.  Two persons who responded to the  Committee's questionnaire have come
forward with allegations of sexual  misconduct.<p>  <p>     The staff also attempted to contact and interview
or depose every person who  the staff had reason to believe, by virtue of other testimony or information, 
might have knowledge either implicating Senator Packwood in unwanted sexual  behavior toward his staff, or
tending to exonerate him of such accusations. <p>  <p>          The staff also took the depositions of Jack
Faust, Senator Packwood's  longtime friend, campaign adviser, and attorney, and Elaine Franklin, Senator 
Packwood-s chief of staff.<p>  <p>     Senator Packwood was served with two separate document requests, on
March 29  and July 16, 1993, asking for virtually every document that dealt with the  allegations of sexual
misconduct, or the women who were making the allegations.  His chief of staff, Elaine Franklin, was also
served with a document request,  and Jack Faust was served with a subpoena for documents.<p>  <p>     Senator
Packwood appeared for his deposition by the Committee staff on  Tuesday, October 5, 1993.  During questioning
by the staff, Senator Packwood  testified that he had kept detailed diaries from the time he had taken office,
 which he dictated and then had transcribed by a staff member.  Senator Packwood  testified that he had
reviewed some portions of the diaries and scanned others,  and that the diaries contained some entries that
were relevant to the  complaints that had been made against him. [fn 7]<p>  <p>     At that point, the
deposition was halted.  An agreement was reached for  review of the diaries by Committee counsel and counsel
immediately began that  review.  After counsel discovered entries in the diaries that appeared to  implicate
Senator Packwood in other conduct that was arguably improper, Senator  Packwood refused to allow further
review of his diaries.  The Committee voted  unanimously to subpoena Senator Packwood for production of his
diaries.  When  he did not comply, the Committee introduced a resolution on the floor of the  Senate to
authorize the Senate legal counsel to file suit in Federal District  Court to enforce the subpoena.  The
resolution was approved by a vote of 94 to  6.<p>  <p>     The Committee's application to enforce the subpoena
was filed on November  22, 1993, and was heard by the Hon. Thomas Penfield Jackson on December 16,  1993.  On
January 24, 1994, Judge Jackson granted the Committee's application,  and after consulting with the parties,
on February 4, 1994, established  guidelines for the Committee's review of the diaries.  The Committee
received  Senator Packwood's diary transcripts from March 1994 through April 1994, and  the diary tapes from
October 1994 through February 1995.  Senator Packwood's  deposition was concluded in January 1995.<p>  <p>    
<H3>B.   Alteration of Evidence</H3><p>  <p>       <H4>1.   The Committee's Pursuit of the Diaries</H4><p> 
<p>           a.   The Committee's Document Requests <p>  <p>        The two document requests issued to
Senator Packwood by the Committee in  March and July 1993 required him to produce all documents of any kind, 
including personal records, regarding, related to, communicating with, or  memorializing communications with a
wide range of identified individuals, or  referring or relating to a set of identified events, within the
scope of the  Committee's inquiry.  The second request specifically stated that [t]he  Committee expects that
you will conduct a reasonable and thorough search of  your Senate office files, your personal files, campaign
committee files, and  other files that are within your possession, custody, and control, or otherwise  would
be available to you, in order . . . to ensure full compliance" with the  Committee's document requests.<p> 
<p>     As defined in the requests, the word "document" included any information  stored on audio or
videotape, or by any other electromagnetic or electronic  means.<p>  <p>     The existence of diaries kept by
Senator Packwood was known to the staff,  through a press report and a reference to them in another document
produced by  Senator Packwood.  Although Senator Packwood produced a number of documents  pursuant to these
requests, he produced no portions of his diaries.  Further,  although the Senator informed the Committee that
he was asserting the  attorney-client or work-product privilege with respect to the production of  more than
100 documents and disclosed the existence of the documents that he  was withholding on that ground, the
Senator never disclosed that he was  withholding, or asserting a privilege from producing, diaries responsive
to the  Committee's document requests. [fn 8] <p>  <p>     The staff assumed in good faith that Senator
Packwood had complied with the  two document requests, and had identified all material that was responsive to 
the Committee's requests, either by turning it over to the Committee, or  disclosing its existence but
withholding it on grounds of privilege.  Because  no entries from Senator Packwood's diaries were ever
produced, nor was the  Committee advised that Senator Packwood was withholding them on the basis of  any
privilege, the staff assumed that the diaries contained no material  responsive to the Committee's document
requests.<p>  <p>           b.   The Committee Learns of the Existence of Relevant Diary Entries<p>  <p>    
At his first deposition in October 1993, Senator Packwood testified under  oath that he had scanned more than
ten years of his diaries in connection with  the Committee's inquiry, and that his diaries contained materials
concerning  persons and events that were the subject of the Committee's inquiry.  He gave  no explanation for
his failure to produce these materials in response to the  Committee's request, despite the fact that he
testified that they included  relevant information. [fn 9]<p>  <p>     At that point, the staff requested that
Senator Packwood provide his diaries  to the Committee 80 that the staff could examine them before completing
his  deposition.  The staff began negotiations with Senator Packwood's attorneys for  access to the diaries. 
The Committee agreed to allow Senator Packwood to  produce diaries covering specific years (the last period of
which terminated  with the then-present date, October 6, 1993), and to mask with opaque tape  passimages
covered by the attorney-client privilege, the physician-patient  privilege, or that referred solely to
personal, private family matters.  The  Committee permitted Senator Packwood to mask entries dealing with
personal,  private family matters, despite the fact that such entries were not protected  by any recognized
evidentiary privilege, to accommodate Senator Packwood's  concerns about the private nature of diary entries
about his family.  However,  the Committee did not accede to Senator Packwood's request that he be allowed  to
mask entries dealing with consensual sexual relationships, because such  matters would likely bear on the
potential bias of witnesses before the  Committee, and because consent was at the heart of the issues before
the  Committee.  Senator Packwood's attorney specifically advised the staff that the  Senator had agreed to
produce his diaries under these conditions.<p>  <p>     Before the staff began reviewing the diaries, Senator
Packwood's attorneys  asked whether the staff would agree that if, while reviewing the diaries, the  staff
identified passimages raising issues within the Committee's jurisdiction,  but beyond the scope of its inquiry
into alleged sexual misconduct and witness  intimidation, the staff would not require copies of those entries,
but would  set aside those additional issues for later consideration.  The staff refused  to make such a
commitment.<p>  <p>     On October 12, 1993, Senator Packwood began providing his masked diaries for 
review.[fn 10]  Over the next four days, four Committee counsel reviewed an  estimated 3,000 to 4,000 pimages
spanning 1969 through 1983, and identified 115  pimages or portions of pimages that contained relevant
material.  Senator Packwood  provided photocopies of those pimages to the Committee.<p>  <p>     As agreed,
the diaries were reviewed by the staff only in the presence of  Senator Packwood's attorneys.  Staff did not
take any notes, make any copies,  or take custody of any of the diaries.  Staff marked for photocopying those 
entries it determined had some relevance to the Committee's inquiry, with the  understanding that Senator
Packwood's attorneys would provide copies of these  passimages.  As agreed, if there were disputes about the
relevance of any  particular passimages that the staff requested be photocopied, which could not be  resolved
at the staff level, Senator Packwood had the right to press his  objection before the Committee leadership,
and ultimately before the full  Committee, for a ruling.<p>  <p>     On October 14, while the staff continued
to review the diaries, Senator  Packwood requested, by way of a letter addressed to the Committee, that he be 
allowed to mask entries relating to his consensual intimate activities during  the years since 1989. He
suggested that Kenneth Starr be retained to review any  such masking to ensure that it dealt only with
consensual activity. The  Committee rejected Senator Packwood's request, because such material could be 
probative of potential witness bias and could bear directly on one of the key  factual issues that the
Committee would ultimately need to resolve, namely,  whether particular conduct was or was not consensual. 
Senator Packwood  continued to produce his diaries in accordance with the previous agreement.<p>  <p>    
Committee counsel continued to review Senator Packwood's diaries over the  weekend of October 16 and 17,
examining an additional estimated 1,000 to 2,000  pimages, and marking approximately 170 pimages or portions
of pimages for  photocopying. [fn 11]<p>  <p>  <p>      c.   The Committee's Review of the Diaries Comes to a
Halt<p>  <p>      On Sunday, October 17, Committee counsel came across two passimages from 1989  that
indicated possible misconduct in areas unrelated to the Committee's  pending inquiry into sexual misconduct
and witness intimidation.<p>  <p>     These entries raised questions whether Senator Packwood may have
improperly  solicited financial support for his wife from individuals with interests in  legislation and
whether such solicitations may have been linked to his  performance of official acts.  The entries implicated
possible violations of  federal laws, as well as rules and standards of the Senate.<p>  <p>     These entries
appeared in the diaries on November 3 and November 6, 1989.  At that time, as reflected in the diaries,
Senator Packwood was contemplating  divorce from his wife, and was worried about the amount of support that he
 would have to pay as part of the divorce settlement.  The November 3 entry  stated that Senator Packwood had
met with Steve Saunders, and had asked him to  put the Senator's wife on "retainer" for $7500 per year; the
individual agreed,  expressing relief that the figure was an annual, and not a monthly, amount.  The entry
also reflects that Senator Packwood had approached two other  individuals with similar requests.<p>  <p>     A
diary entry on November 6, 1989, three days after the meeting with Steve  Saunders, reflected that Senator
Packwood attended a meeting or hearing of the  Senate Committee on Finance, of which Senator Packwood was the
ranking  Republican member. Senator Packwood recorded that he had raised questions or  suggested legislative
language of some sort for Mr. Saunders.<p>  <p>     Senator Packwood's handwritten calendars, which he turned
over to the  Committee after their existence was discovered during his deposition, also  confirm the November
3 meeting with Mr. Saunders, and that on November 6,  Senator Packwood went to  "Finance for Saunders."<p> 
<p>     Committee counsel marked these entries in the diary for photocopying, and on  October 18, Victor
Baird, Chief Counsel for the Committee, advised the  Committee leadership of the discovery of the entries<p> 
<p>      On Monday, October 18, Senator Packwood's attorney failed to deliver the  next series of diaries for
review [fn 12] under the agreement.  When Victor  Baird inquired of Senator Packwood's attorney when the
diaries would arrive,  Senator Packwood's attorney expressed concern over one of the two passimages that  had
been marked for photocopying, claiming that it was not relevant to the  Committee's inquiry, and asking why it
had been marked. He was advised that the  entry raised new issues of potential misconduct, and was cited to
specific  laws, Senate rules, and standards that might apply.  The Senator's attorney  asked if these new
issues could be treated as a separate matter, and not acted upon until the Committee's current preliminary
inquiry was concluded.  Mr. Baird informed him that he could not agree to that, and that it was the 
Committee's decision as to whether any new issues would be treated separately.  Mr. Baird reminded the
Senator's attorney that he had earlier raised this  question, and that Mr. Baird had made it clear that the
Committee was obligated  to follow up on any information of potential misconduct within its jurisdiction  that
came to its attention.<p>  <p>     Later that day, one diary volume was produced for review by the-staff 
counsel.  When Mr. Baird telephoned Senator Packwood's attorneys to ask when  additional diaries would be
produced, he was told that the next diaries in  sequence for review were in the process of undergoing
additional masking in  light of the Committee's discovery of the new materials.  Senator Packwood's  attorney
explicitly confirmed that not only was he now masking additional  material based upon the Committee's
discovery of information relating to  potential misconduct in new areas, but that additional material had been
masked  in the single diary volume that had been delivered for review by the Committee  earlier that
afternoon.  Senator Packwood's attorney was told that additional  masking was unacceptable, and if the Senator
was not willing to produce his  diaries pursuant to the original agreement, the Committee would need to 
consider subpoenaing them. At that point, Senator Packwood broke off all  further cooperation under the
agreement, refusing to provide copies of any of  the approximately 170 pimages or portions of pimages from
1984 through early 1990  that Committee counsel had already reviewed and determined to be relevant.<p>  <p>   
 d.   The Committee Insists on Completing its Review of the Diaries<p>  <p>     The Committee requested that
Senator Packwood immediately complete his  production of the remaining diaries.  The Committee proposed that
the Senator  deliver them, after masking them in the three categories previously agreed  upon, to Kenneth
Starr, who would review the masked material to ensure that it  complied with the agreement, and then forward
the masked diaries to the  Committee counsel for review.  Counsel would review only the unmasked material, 
identify entries relevant to matters within the Committee's jurisdiction for  copying, and return the
originals to Mr. Starr for safekeeping.<p>  <p>     Senator Packwood refused to accept this proposal, or to
resume abiding by  his original agreement with the Committee. Instead, he insisted on masking  additional
materials, including all entries which relate to political,  campaign, staff or similar activities and are
wholly unrelated to the sexual  misconduct/intimidation issues. [fn 13]  He further demanded that the
Committee  agree not to pursue at that time either the new matters its counsel had  discovered, or any other
matters outside the scope of the preliminary inquiry.  The Committee rejected the Senator's proposal.<p>  <p> 
   e.   The Committee Votes to Issue a Subpoena<p>  <p>     On October 20, after advising the Senator's
attorneys that continued  recalcitrance would lead to a subpoena, the Committee voted unanimously to  issue a
subpoena to Senator Packwood, requiring him to produce his diaries from  January 1, 1989 to the present, by
delivering them to Mr. Starr.  The subpoena  required production forthwith of:  <p>  <blockquote>  "All
diaries, journals, or other documents, including tape recordings and  materials stored by computer or
electronic means, in his possession, custody,  or control, which were prepared by him or at his direction,
recording or  describing his daily activities for January 1, 1989 through the present."</blockquote>  <p>     
 Senator Packwood's attorneys were informed that he would still be  permitted to mask attorney-client and
physician-patient material, and  information relating to personal, private family matters, subject to Mr. 
Starr's review.  The subpoena was served on Senator Packwood on the morning of  October 21.  The Committee
informed Senator Packwood that, unless he complied  with the subpoena, the Committee intended to meet later
that day to consider  reporting a resolution to the full Senate seeking authority to initiate a civil  action
to enforce the subpoena. Senator Packwood sought additional time to  respond, and repeated his attorneys'
earlier proposal that the Committee defer  attempting to obtain information related to newly discovered
matters and limit  its request to the sexual misconduct and witness intimidation issues.<p>  <p>     The
Committee unanimously voted to report a resolution to the Senate to seek  civil enforcement of its subpoena
unless Senator Packwood produced the diaries  immediately.  upon receiving no response from Senator Packwood,
on the evening  of October 21, the Committee reported the enforcement resolution to the  Senate.<p>  <p>      
  f.   The Senate Debates Enforcement of the Subpoena<p>  <p>     The Senate took up consideration of the
resolution on November 1.  The  Senate debated the resolution for approximately fifteen hours on November 1
and  2.<p>  <p>     At the request of Senator Packwood and his attorneys, the Committee  leadership and
Committee counsel met with Senator Packwood and his attorneys on  the evening of November 1.  In response to
Senator Packwood's claim that he did  not know what new matters in the diaries had drawn the Committee's
attention,  Victor Baird again set forth, as he had done earlier to Senator Packwood's  attorneys, the precise
provisions of federal law, Senate rules, and standards  that were potentially implicated by particular entries
in the diaries.<p>  <p>     Senator Packwood then offered to produce all diary entries that he judged to  be
relevant to either the initial matters under Committee inquiry, or the new  matters that had come to the
Committee's attention regarding solicitation of  income for his wife.  He proposed that Mr. Starr (who was not
aware of this  proposal) review the completeness of his production, but on the  condition that  he not divulge
any evidence he found of potential new violations.  The  Committee met and unanimously rejected Senator
Packwood's proposal, and  informed him that it had the duty to investigate all credible information  relating
to  potential misconduct of a Senator, and could not erect a barrier  deliberately to screen itself from
potential evidence of wrongdoing.<p>  <p>     After extensive debate, the Senate voted 94 to 6 to adopt the
Committee's  proposed resolution to authorize the Senate Legal Counsel to enforce the  Committee's
subpoena.<p>  <p>     g.   The Committee Proposes a Process for Review of the Diaries<p>  <p>     The
Committee then wrote to Senator Packwood, to clarify the procedures for  complying with the subpoena and to
respond to questions that Senator Packwood  had raised.[fn 14]  The Committee made it clear that the subpoena
required  production of only Senator Packwood's diaries and no other documents, and that  the Committee would
cut off production under the subpoena at July 16, 1993, the  date of its second document request to him.  The
Committee also reemphasized  that Senator Packwood could continue to mask the three categories agreed upon 
earlier.  The Committee repeated that Mr. Starr would verify the  appropriateness of all masking, and that the
Senator would still have the  opportunity to object to the Committee on the relevance of any materials 
selected and copied from his diaries by Committee counsel. <p>  <p>   h.   Senator Packwood Offers to Resign  
    <p>  <p>        On November 17, 1993, Senator Packwood wrote to Senators Bryan and  McConnell, stating
that he did not choose to fight on, and that he was  "emotionally, physically, and financially exhausted."  He
asked that the  Committee accept his plea of <STRONG>nolo contendere</STRONG> to the charges involving sexual
misconduct and intimidation.  The Committee met on November 18, and discussed the letter over several hours. 
It was unclear from the letter, for example, what Senator Packwood meant by his wish to "put this matter
behind me, without further proceedings," or what would be encompassed in a plea of <STRONG>nolo
contendere;</STRONG> it was decided that staff would meet with Senator Packwood's  attorneys to discuss these
issues. [fn 15]<p>  <p>     By the time of this Committee meeting on November 18, the Justice Department  had
already notified the Committee that it intended to open an inquiry into  possible solicitation of employment
by Senator Packwood for his spouse, and had  asked about the possibility of Committee staff meeting with the
Department to  discuss coordination of the separate inquiries, as the Department did not wish  to interfere
with the Committee's inquiry.<p>  <p>     At some time during November 18, Senator Packwood contacted Senator 
McConnell and during the course of their conversation indicated that he wanted  a "window of opportunity"
between the termination of the Committee's proceeding  and Justice Department action 80 that he could destroy
his diaries.  Senator  McConnell immediately conveyed this information to the Chairman and the  Committee
staff.<p>  <p>     During the evening and early morning hours of November 18 and 19, an  agreement was reached
that Senators Bryan and McConnell would meet with Senator  Packwood in the presence of staff counsel and
attorneys for Senator Packwood.  At around 11:00 a.m. on November 19 the meeting took place, with Senators 
Bryan, McConnell, Packwood, staff counsel, Jim Fitzpatrick, and Bill  Diefenderfer, as a "friend" of Senator
Packwood.  It became clear early on in  the meeting that it would likely be impossible for a resolution of the
case to  be agreed upon in the absence of delivery of the diaries.  Senator Packwood  asked that he and his
attorney be excused, and Mr. Diefenderfer presented a  proposal on behalf of the Senator: Senator Packwood
would resign, the Committee  would terminate the preliminary inquiry and cease all discovery and subpoena 
enforcement activity, and the subpoena would be withdrawn. [fn 16] During this  discussion with Mr.
Diefenderfer, Senator Bryan specifically mentioned the  Committee's concern about document preservation; Mr.
Diefenderfer stated that  he did not believe that the Senator had any intention of destroying the  diaries. 
Mr. Diefenderfer agreed to give the Committee an hour to respond to  this proposal.<p>  <p>     In view of the
earlier notification from the Department of Justice of their  interest in the matter, and the concerns raised
by Senator Packwood's comments  to Senator McConnell about a "window of opportunity" to destroy the diaries,
it  was agreed that communication with the Justice Department was required, in  order to preserve the
Department's opportunity for access to the diaries.  Michael Davidson, Senate Legal Counsel, joined the
discussion, and agreed that  it was appropriate to contact the Department of Justice.  Mr. Davidson  contacted
Jack Keeney, Deputy Assistant Attorney General of the Criminal  Division, Department of Justice, and inquired
about the Department's intentions  with respect to the diaries in the event that the Committee withdrew its 
subpoena.  Mr. Keeney informed Mr. Davidson that the Department would  immediately subpoena the diaries from
Senator Packwood.<p>  <p>     The Committee met again at about 1:30 p.m. and agreed to Senator Packwood's 
proposal to resign.  Mr. Diefenderfer was notified, and the proposal was  reduced to writing in the form of a
letter which was signed by Senators Bryan  and McConnell. Before this letter could be delivered to Senator
Packwood for  his signature, Mr. Diefenderfer contacted Senator McConnell and told him that  Senator Packwood
had been served with a subpoena for his diaries by the  Department of Justice, and that he no longer intended
to resign.  The Committee  met later that afternoon, and was so informed.<p>  <p>       i.   The Committee
Goes to Court to Enforce the Subpoena<p>  <p>      On November 22, 1993, Senate Legal Counsel filed an
application to Enforce  the Subpoena in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. 
Senator Packwood's attorneys responded, claiming that the diaries were  protected from production by the
Fourth and Fifth Amendments to the  Constitution.  A hearing was held on December 16, 1993, and argument was 
presented by both sides.[fn 17] On January 24, 1994, Judge Jackson issued his  ruling, finding that the
Committee was entitled to production of the diaries.  On February 7, 1994, Judge Jackson issued a further
ruling, setting out the  procedures for review by Kenneth Starr, and incorporating the categories for  masking
of material that had been suggested by the Committee in its November  19, 1993 letter to Senator Packwood.<p> 
<p>     <H3> 2.   Evidence of Possible Alteration</H3> <p>  <p>         During the time that the Committee was
seeking access to Senator  Packwood's diaries, news accounts and public statements by Senator Packwood  raised
questions about how his former secretary, Cathy Wagner Cormack, had been  paid to transcribe his diaries.  The
staff took Ms. Cormack's deposition in  order to determine whether she was paid from Senate or campaign funds,
as  opposed to Senator Packwood's personal funds, for transcription of the  diaries.<p>  <p>     After her
deposition was transcribed and she had an opportunity to review  it, Ms. Cormack provided a sworn affidavit to
the Committee, indicating that  after the initiation of the Ethics Committee investigation, Senator Packwood 
had taken back from her some tapes that he already had given her to transcribe,  and that at a later time it
appeared to her that he may have made some  revisions to those tapes.  She also stated that Senator Packwood
confirmed to  her that he had made changes to the tapes. Based on this information, Ms.  Cormack's deposition
was taken a second time, on December 15, 1993, and she  confirmed the information she had included in her
affidavit.<p>  <p>     That Senator Packwood's diaries may have been altered was set forth in a  December 7,
1993 letter provided to the Chairman of the Committee by Senator  Packwood's attorney, which stated,
<STRONG>inter alia,</STRONG> that:<blockquote>  <p>  "With what may be a few or possibly no exceptions, the
originals of these tapes  (the diaries) are among the materials now held by Arnold &amp; Porter. . . . In 
discrete instances, the transcripts depart from the original tapes. Based on a  recounting of events, it is
unlikely such transcripts were among the  transcripts examined by the Senate ethics Committee staff. [fn
18]</blockquote>  <p>     The information indicating possible alteration of the diaries was provided  to Judge
Jackson, who, at the hearing on December 16, 1993, ordered that all  diaries, including transcripts and
audiotapes, be immediately deposited with  the Court for safekeeping pending the Court's decision on the
Committee's  application to enforce the subpoena.<p>  <p>  <p>    <H3> 3.   Procedure for Production of
Diaries to the Committee, and the  Committee's Review of the Diaries</H3><p>  <p>      a.   The Court's
Order<p>  <p>     On February 7, 1994, after conducting a status conference with the parties  to discuss
procedures to implement the Court's January 24, 1994 Order granting  the Committee's application to enforce
its subpoena, the Court issued an Order  getting out procedures under which the Committee would obtain Senator
 Packwood's diaries. [fn 19]<p>  <p>      Kenneth Starr was appointed Special Master[fn 20], and the tapes and
 transcripts that had been turned over to the Court as a result of the December  16, 1993 hearing were
transferred to him. Mr. Starr was instructed to provide  the transcripts and tapes to the Federal Bureau of
Investigation for  duplication, with copies to be provided to Mr. Starr, Senator Packwood, and the  Clerk of
the Court.  The original transcripts and tapes were returned to Mr.  Starr for possible later forensic
examination to determine the nature and  extent of any alterations, if requested by the Committee.<p>  <p>    
The Court's Order provided that Senator Packwood would have a reasonable  opportunity to mask portions of the
transcripts and audio tapes  according to  the criteria for masking allowed by the Committee. [fn 21] Mr.
Starr would then  review the masking to determine if it met these criteria, unmasking any  portions that did
not, and provide a copy to the Committee.<p>  <p>       b.   Production of the Diaries to the Committee  <p> 
<p>         1.   Diary Transcripts<p>  <p>     The Committee began receiving copies of diary transcripts [fn
22] that had  been masked by Senator Packwood on March 30, 1994. Although these copies had  not yet been
reviewed by Mr. Starr to determine if they had been properly  masked, they were provided to the Committee in
an attempt to avoid unnecessary  delay in the Committee's review of the diaries.  The Cormack transcripts were
 designated as "Q 1 through Q 10," with each "Q" representing six months of  entries.  As Mr. Starr reviewed
the Cormack transcripts, he provided the  Committee with entries that he had determined did not meet the
criteria for  masking.  This process continued through April 29, 1994, when the Committee  received the last
of the Cormack transcripts.<p>  <p>         2.   Diary Tapes<p>  <p>      The Court's Order of February 7,
1994, contemplated that Senator Packwood  would have the right to mask the audiotapes that corresponded to the
Cormack  transcripts.  It also provided that Mr. Starr could reassess his judgment about  the propriety of any
masking, if he discovered alterations in the Cormack  transcript or the audiotape.<p>  <p>     Shortly after
Senator Packwood began designating portions of the audiotapes  that should be masked, Mr. Starr informed the
parties that the audiotapes and  the Cormack transcripts were different in several respects.  There were 
portions of the audiotapes that did not appear on the Cormack transcript, and  portions of the Cormack
transcript that did not appear on the audiotapes.  There were also entries on the audiotape that were captured
on the Cormack  transcript, but in a different, or paraphrased, form.  Senator Packwood  maintained that he
had a right to mask portions of the audiotape that fit the  criteria allowed for masking by the Committee,
<STRONG>even</STRONG> <STRONG>if</STRONG> those portions did not  correspond to the Cormack transcript.  The
Committee made clear its position  that any entries on the audiotape that did not match entries on the Cormack
 transcript, or vice versa, constituted possible evidence of alteration, and  could not be masked by Senator
Packwood.  It appears that Mr. Starr permitted  further masking where he deemed it appropriate.<p>  <p>    
The Committee began receiving audiotapes that had been masked and reviewed  by Mr. Starr in October 1994. 
Because the testimony from Ms. Cormack indicated  that changes to the diary were most likely made in 1992 and
1993, the Committee  had requested that it be provided with the tapes for these years first.  As the 
Committee received the tapes for 1992 and 1993, it had them transcribed by a  reporting service.  The diaries
thus transcribed were compared to the Cormack  transcripts.  For the years 1989 through 1991, the staff
listened and compared  the audiotapes themselves to the Cormack transcript.<p>  <p>     The last of the
audiotapes corresponding to Q 1 through Q 10 were received  by the Committee on January 13, 1995.  A final
delivery of ten tapes occurred  on February 27, 1995.<p>  <p>     <H3>C.   Employment Opportunities for Mrs.
Packwood</H3><p>  <p>      <H4>1.  Origin of Allegations</H4><p>  <p>     The allegations involving
inappropriate linkage of personal financial gain  to Senator Packwood's official position by soliciting or
otherwise encouraging  offers of financial assistance from persons having a particular interest in 
legislation or issues that Senator Packwood could influence are based on a  number of the Senator's diary
entries from the years 1989 through 1991.<p>  <p>       <H4>2.  How the Investigation was Conducted</H4><p> 
<p>     Committee staff took sworn depositions from ten persons referenced in the  diary as possibly having
some involvement in extending employment opportunities  to Mrs. Packwood.  The Committee also took the sworn
deposition of Senator  Packwood's former wife and received sworn testimony from Senator Packwood. In  total,
thirteen persons were deposed on this subject.<p>  <p>     In addition, the Committee subpoenaed documents
from each of the individuals  mentioned above.  The subpoena called for all documents referring or relating 
to either Senator or Mrs. Packwood.  The Committee also subpoenaed documents  from Mrs. Packwood and from
Senator Packwood.  In response to these subpoenas,  the Committee received in excess of four thousand pimages
of documents.<p>    <a name=auth.htm><H2>III. THE COMMITTEE'S AUTHORITY TO INVESTIGATE AND SANCTION MISCONDUCT
OF MEMBERS</H2></a><p>  <p>    <H3>A.   Authority of the Congress to Discipline Its Members</H3><p>  <p>    
The United States Constitution confers on each House of Congress the power  to punish and expel its Members. 
Article I provides:<p>  <blockquote>     "Each House may determine the Rules of its Proceedings, punish its
Members  for disorderly Behavior, and, with the Concurrence of two thirds, expel a  Member." [fn
23]</blockquote>  <p>     Pursuant to this authority, in 1964, the Senate adopted Senate Resolution  338,
which created the Select Committee on Standards and Conduct, and delegated  to it the authority to receive
complaints and investigate allegations of  improper conduct which may reflect upon the Senate, violations of
law, and  violations of rules and regulations of the Senate, relating to the conduct of  individuals in the
performance of their duties as Members of the Senate."[fn  24]<p>  <p>     In those situations where the
violations are sufficiently serious to warrant  sanctions, the Committee is authorized to recommend to the
Senate by report or  resolution appropriate disciplinary action.[fn 25]<p>  <p>     The Senate has disciplined
Members for conduct that it has deemed unethical  or improper, regardless of whether it violated any law or
Senate rule or  regulation.[fn 26]  As it adopted new rules governing Members' conduct, the  Senate has
recognized that the rules did not "replace that great body of  unwritten but generally accepted standards that
will, of course, continue in  effect. [fn 27]<p>  <p>     <H3>B.   Private Versus Official Conduct</H3><p> 
<p>     The Senate or House may discipline a Member for any misconduct, including  conduct or activity which
does not directly relate to official duties, when  such conduct unfavorably reflects on the institution as a
whole. [fn 28]  In  his historic work on the Constitution, Justice Joseph Story noted in 1833 that  Congress'
disciplinary authority for "expulsion and any other punishment" is  apparently unqualified as to "the time,
place or nature of the offense." [fn  29]  Moreover, the Supreme Court has consistently declared that the
Senate has  far-reaching discretion in disciplinary matters. [fn 30]  Precedent within both  the House and
Senate has reaffirmed this broad authority. In the censure of  Senator Joseph McCarthy, the Select Committee
to Study the Censure Charges in  the 83rd Congress reported:<blockquote>  <p>     "It seems clear that if a
Senator should be guilty of reprehensible conduct  unconnected with his official duties and position, but
which conduct brings the Senate into disrepute, the Senate has the power to censure." [fn 31]</blockquote> 
<p>  Additionally, in the report on Representative Adam Clayton Powell from the  House Judiciary Committee,
which recommended that Powell be censured for  misconduct, the Committee noted that the conduct for which
punishment may be  imposed is not limited to acts relating to the Member's official duties. [fn  32]<p>  <p>  
    In proposing a permanent standing committee on ethics in the Senate,  Senator John Sherman Cooper
expressly referred to the select committee that  investigated the censure charges of Senator Joseph McCarthy
as a model -- a  committee that had unambiguously asserted its authority to investigate conduct  "unconnected
with [a Member's] official duties and position." Senator Cooper  and supporters of the resolution emphasized
that the Select Committee was  intended to be free to investigate anything which, in its judgment, seemed 
worthy, deserving, and requiring investigation" [fn 33] and "would not be  limited to alleged violations of
Senate rules, but it would take into account  all improper conduct of any kind whatever." [fn 34]<p>  <p>     
 It appears that the intent of the Senate in adopting S. Res. 338 was to  convey to the Ethics Committee the
authority to investigate and make  recommendations to the full Senate on misconduct of Members over which the 
institution has jurisdiction. Nowhere in the legislative history of this  resolution was there language which
expressed or implied any intent to reserve  some authority only in the full Senate, or to limit the authority
of the  Committee to investigate and report to the full Senate concerning any  misconduct of a Member within
the jurisdiction of the institution. <p>  <p>     <H3>C. Improper Conduct Reflecting Upon the Senate</H3> <p> 
<p>        The Senate did not attempt to delineate all the types of conduct or the  guidelines which the
Committee should follow in determining which actions by a  Member would constitute "improper conduct"
reflecting on the Senate. [fn 35] It  appears that the standards and guidelines of what would be deemed proper
or  improper conduct for a Member would change and evolve, both as to the  perception of the general public as
well as for those within the legislature  itself. [fn 36]  The drafters of the resolution in 1964 intended
that "improper  conduct" would be cognizable by the Senate when it was so notorious or  reprehensible that it
could discredit the institution as a whole, not just the  individual, thereby invoking the Senate's inherent
and constitutional right to  protect its own integrity and reputation. [fn 37]<p>  <p>     Senate Resolution
338, as amended, which establishes and sets forth the  responsibilities of the Select Committee on Ethics,
provides, in part:<blockquote>  <p>  "Sec. 2(a) It should be the duty of the Select Committee to--   <p>  <p> 
(1) 'receive complaints and investigate allegations of <STRONG>improper conduct which may reflect upon the
Senate</STRONG>, violations of law, violations of the Senate Code  of Official Conduct, and violations of
rules and regulations of the Senate,  relating to the conduct of individuals in the performance of their
duties as  Members of the Senate, or as officers or employees of the Senate, and to make  appropriate findings
of fact and conclusions with respect thereto ..." [fn 38]  (emphasis added)</blockquote>  <p>     S. Res. 338
gives the Committee the authority to investigate Members who  engage in "improper conduct which may reflect
upon the Senate, regardless of  whether such conduct violates a specific statute, Senate Rule, or regulation. 
Indeed, the original Rules Committee proposal, rejected by the Senate, would  have given the Committee the
authority to investigate only alleged violations  of the rules of the Senate. [fn 39]  In offering the
amendment containing the  language adopted by the Senate [fn 40], Senator Cooper described his amendment  as
authorizing the new committee "to receive complaints of unethical, improper,  illegal conduct of members. [fn
41] Senator Case, in discussing this amendment,  noted that the Committee "would not be limited to alleged
violations of Senate  rules, but it would take into account <STRONG>all improper conduct of any kind
whatsoever</STRONG>." [fn 42]<p>  <p>    <H4>1. Historical Context of Improper Conduct and Committee
Precedent</H4><p>  <p>       The phrase "improper conduct" as used by S. Res. 338 can be given meaning  by
reference to generally accepted standards of conduct, the letter and spirit  of laws and Rules [fn 43], and by
reference to past cases where the Senate has  disciplined its Members for conduct that was deemed improper,
regardless of  whether it violated any law or Senate rule or regulation.<p>  <p>       As early as 1797,
Senator William Blount was expelled from the Senate for  inciting Native Americans against the government,
despite the fact that he had  committed no crime, and neither acted in his official capacity nor during a 
session of Congress. [fn 44] In 1811, the Senate censured Senator Thomas  Pickering for reading a confidential
communication on the Senate floor, despite  the fact that there was no written rule prohibiting such conduct.
[fn 45] In  1873, a Senate Committee also recommended the expulsion of Senator James  Patterson, for accepting
stock at a reduced price knowing that the offer  intended to influence him in his official duties, for giving
a false account of  the transaction, suppressing material facts, and denying the existence of  material facts
which must have been known to him. [fn 46]<p>  <p>       In 1929, the Senate condemned Senator Hiram Bingham
for placing an  employee of a trade association with a direct interest in tariff legislation  then pending on
the Senate payroll. In 1954, the Senate condemned Senator  Joseph McCarthy for his lack of cooperation with
and abuse of two Senate  committees that investigated his conduct.<p>  <p>       None of these cases involved
conduct that was found to violate any law,  rule, or regulation, but in each case, the conduct was deemed to
violate  accepted standards and values controlling Senators' conduct.<p>  <p>     After the passage of S. Res.
338 establishing the Select Committee on  Standards and Conduct, the next case involving a finding of improper
conduct  was the investigation of Senator Thomas Dodd.  The Committee investigated  allegations of unethical
conduct concerning the Senator's relationship with a  private businessman with overseas interests; the
conversion of campaign  contributions to personal use; the free use of loaned automobiles; and the  acceptance
of reimbursements from both the Senate and private sources.  Although no Senate rule or law prohibited the use
of campaign funds for  personal use at that time, the Committee found that the testimonial dinners 
investigated were political in character, and thus the proceeds should not have  been used for personal use.
[fn 47]<p>  <p>     The Committee recommended, and the Senate adopted, a resolution censuring  Senator Dodd
for having engaged in a course of conduct  <blockquote>  <p>  "exercising the influence and power of his
office as a United States Senator  ... to obtain, and use for his personal benefit, funds from the public
through  political testimonials and a political campaign." </blockquote>  <p>  Such conduct, although not
violative of any specific law or Senate rule in  force at that time, was found to be "contrary to accepted
morals, derogates  from the public trust expected of a Senator, and tends to bring the Senate into  dishonor
and disrepute." [fn 48]<p>  <p>     In 1966, pursuant to S. Res. 338, the Select Committee on Standards and 
Conduct began to develop recommendations for rules and regulations regarding  Senators' conduct.  The
Committee ultimately proposed S. Res. 266, the Senate  Code of Official Conduct, which addressed outside
employment, disclosure of  financial interests, and campaign contributions.  The floor debate on this 
resolution demonstrates that the Rules were not intended to be a comprehensive  code of conduct for Senators,
but were targeted at a limited area of activity,  and more importantly, that they were not intended to
displace generally  accepted norms of conduct.  During that debate, the Committee's Chairman,  Senator John
Stennis, stated: <blockquote>  <p>  "We do not try to write a full code of regulations . . . . [O]ur effort is
 merely to add rules and not to replace that great body of unwritten but  generally accepted standards that
will, of course, continue in effect." [fn  49]</blockquote>  <p>  In addition, the Committee's Vice Chairman,
Senator Wallace Bennett, stated  that it was impossible to develop written rules that address every possible 
area of misconduct. [fn 50]<p>  <p>     In 1990, upon the recommendation of the Committee, the Senate
denounced  Senator David Durenberger, in part based on his financial arrangements in  connection with a
condominium in Minneapolis, finding that his conduct was  deemed to have "brought discredit upon the United
States Senate" by a "pattern  of improper conduct," although the Committee did not find -that any law or rule 
had been violated in connection with the condominium. [fn 51]  However, the  Committee Chairman noted that the
Senator's conduct violated the spirit of 18  U.S.C. S 431, which generally prohibits a Member from benefitting
from a  contract with the federal government. [fn 52]<p>  <p>     Most recently, in 1991 the Committee
concluded that Senator Alan Cranston  engaged in improper conduct which reflected on the Senate by engaging in
an  impermissible pattern of conduct in which fund raising and official activities  were substantially linked.
 The Committee found that for about two years,  Senator Cranston had personally or through his staff contacted
the Federal Home  Loan Bank Board on behalf of Lincoln Savings and Loan during a period when he  was
soliciting and accepting substantial contributions from Mr. Keating or his  affiliates, and that Senator
Cranston's office practices further evidenced an  impermissible pattern of conduct in which fund raising and
official activities  were substantially linked.  The Committee specifically found that none of the  activities
of Senator Cranston violated any law or Senate rule.  Nonetheless,  the Committee found that his impermissible
pattern of conduct <blockquote>  <p>  "violated established norms of behavior in the Senate, and was improper
conduct that reflects upon the Senate, as contemplated in Section 2(a)(1) of S. Res. 338, 88th Congress, as
amended." [fn 53]</blockquote>  <p>  The Committee found that Senator Cranston's conduct was improper and
repugnant, and that it deserved the "fullest, strongest, and most severe sanction which  the Committee has the
authority to impose."  The Committee issued a strong and  severe reprimand of Senator Cranston. [fn 54]<p> 
<p>     <H4>2.   S. Res. 266 and the Code of Ethics for Government Service</H4><p>  <p>     Part III of the
Select Committee's Rules of Procedure sets out the sources  of the Committee's subject matter jurisdiction,
which include, in addition to  those set out in S. Res. 338, the Preamble to S. Res. 266, and the Code of 
Ethics for Government Service.  The Preamble to S. Res. 266, by which the  Senate Code of Official Conduct was
first adopted, provides that<blockquote>  <p>    "(a) The ideal concept of public office, expressed by the
words, "A public  office is a public trust", signifies that the officer has been entrusted with  public power
by the people; that the officer holds this power in trust to be  used only for their benefit and never for the
benefit of himself or of a few;  and that the officer must never conduct his own affairs so as to infringe on 
the public interest. All official conduct of Members of the Senate should be  guided by this paramount concept
of public office.<p>  <p>     (b)  These rules, as the written expression of certain standards of conduct 
complement the body of unwritten but generally accepted standards that continue to apply to the Senate." [fn
55]</blockquote>  <p>        Thus, in this Preamble, specifically set out as a source of jurisdiction  for the
Committee under S. Res. 338, the Senate has recognized that it has the  authority to discipline its Members
for conduct that may not necessarily  violate a law, or Senate rule or regulation, but that is unethical,
improper,  or violates unwritten but generally accepted standards of conduct that apply to the Senate. [fn
56]<p>  <p>     The Code of Ethics for Government Service, passed by House Resolution on  July 11, 1958, with
the Senate concurring, is also specifically listed in the  Committee's Rules as a source of jurisdiction for
the Committee under S. Res.  338.  It sets out ten broadly-worded standards of conduct that should be  adhered
to by all government employees, including office-holders.  The first  and last of these standards state that
any person in government service should:  <blockquote>  <p>  "Put loyalty to the highest moral principles and
to country above loyalty to  persons, party, or Government department.  <p>    Uphold these principles, ever
conscious that public office is a public trust."  [fn 57]</blockquote>  <p>      Again, these standards of
conduct generally encompass conduct that may not  violate a specific law, rule, or regulation, but that is not
consistent with  "loyalty to the highest moral principles. [fn 58]<p>  <p>       <H3> D.   Time
Limitations</H3><p>  <p>            <H4>1.   Historical Context</H4><p>        The United States Constitution
which grants the Senate the express  authority to discipline its own Members contains no apparent time
limitation on this authority. [fn 59]  Thus, the Supreme Court, in 1897, implied an  unqualified authority of
each House of Congress to discipline a Member for  misconduct, regardless of the specific timing of the
offense. [fn 60] The Court  cited the case of the expulsion of Senator Blount by the Senate as support for 
the constitutional authority of either House of Congress to punish a Member for  conduct which, in the
judgment of the House or Senate, "is inconsistent with  the trust and duty of a member" even if such conduct
was "not a statutable  offense nor was it committed during the session of Congress, nor at the seat of 
government." [fn 61]<p>  <p>      The Senate Select Committee on Standards of Conduct, predecessor of the 
current Committee, noted in a matter before it in 1967, that the procedural  rules for disciplining a Member
is a matter within the Senate's discretion, as  long as the institution abides by the basic guarantees of due
process within  the Constitution. [fn 62] Since discipline of its own Members is a power and  authority
expressedly committed to the Senate in the Constitution, the Senate  may establish or choose its own time
limitations for investigations and  disciplinary proceedings, or may choose not to attach any specific
limitations  on such actions.  The specific procedure adopted and followed by the Senate for  its own internal
disciplinary actions would most likely not be subject to  judicial review because of the non-justiciability of
the issue. [fn 63]<p>  <p>      Historically, neither House of Congress has abdicated its ability to punish  a
Member in the form of <STRONG>censure</STRONG> for conduct which occurred in a Congress prior  to a Member's
re-election to the current Congress.  In the censure of Senator  Joseph McCarthy of Wisconsin, the Select
Committee to Study the Censure Charges  in the 83rd Congress, after consideration of the fact that the Senate
is a  continuing body, reported: <blockquote>  <p>     "It seems clear that if a Senator should be guilty of
reprehensible conduct  unconnected with his official duties and position, but which conduct brings the Senate
into disrepute, the Senate has the power to censure.  The power to  censure must be independent, therefore, of
the power to punish for contempt.  A Member may be censured even after he has resigned (2 Hinds' Precedents 
1239,1273, 1275 (1907)). ... While it may be the law that one who is not a  Member of the Senate may not be
punished for contempt of the Senate at a  preceding session, this is not a basis for declaring that the Senate
may not  censure one of its own Members for conduct antedating that session, and no  controlling authority or
precedent has been cited for such a position. [fn  64]</blockquote>  <p>  There have been indications that the
Senate, in an <STRONG>expulsion</STRONG> case, might not  exercise its disciplinary discretion with regard to
conduct in which an  individual had engaged before the time he or she had been a Member. [fn 65]<p>  <p>     
<H4> 2.   Limitations Applicable to S. Res. 338 and the Senate Code of  Conduct</H4><p>  <p>     The Senate
does not have a rule which would limit an inquiry into, or  disciplinary action taken, within the jurisdiction
of the Select Committee on  Ethics.  However, the Senate may not conduct an initial review or investigation 
of any alleged violation of law, the Senate Code of Official Conduct, or rule  or regulation that was not in
effect at the time of the alleged violation. 66  It should be noted that the House of Representatives recently
amended its own  internal rules of discipline to institute a "statue of limitations" on internal  disciplinary
matters which would restrict inquiries into conduct which occurred  before the three previous Congresses.
67<p>  <p>     Finally, the Senate Ethics Study Commission of the 103rd Congress (which  included the members
of this Committee) recommended in its Report to the Senate  that: <blockquote>  <p>  "The Senate should not
adopt a fixed statute of limitations, but should  continue its practice of balancing on a case-by-case basis
potentially relevant  considerations, such as fairness, staleness, integrity of evidence, reasons for  delay,
and seriousness of alleged misconduct, in evaluating the timeliness of  allegations of misconduct.  High
ethical standards should be maintained  throughout the period of service within the Senate, and technical
rules should  not be used to avoid the Senate's responsibility to redress serious  misconduct."<p>    The
Report further stated, in part:  <p>    "Under current practice, in determining what action to take in
response to an  allegation of potential misconduct, the Ethics Committee has discretion to take  into
consideration the interval of time since the conduct allegedly occurred. A  number of factors may play a role
in the Committee's determination of its  course of action, including the fairness in investigating the
allegations, the  staleness of the charges, the availability and integrity of relevant evidence,  the reasons
the allegations were not presented earlier, the seriousness of the  alleged behavior, and whether continuing
effects from the alleged misconduct  persisted well after the conduct, among others." </blockquote>  <P><hr> 
<p>  <H3>Endnotes</H3><tt><font size=-1>   <p>  1.   At his deposition in January 1995, Senator Packwood
disavowed any intent  by this statement to admit to any specific conduct; he only meant to say that  if the
conduct had occurred, he was sorry.<p>  <p>  2.  Three of the persons to whom the questionnaire was directed
were  deceased.<p>  <p>  3.  Some of the return receipts were not signed by the addressee.  The staff 
interviewed three of these persons independently of the questionnaire.<p>  <p>  4.  The staff interviewed two
of these persons independently of the  questionnaire.<p>  <p>  5.  Two of these persons were interviewed by
the staff independently of the  questionnaire.<p>  <p>  6.  One of these persons was interviewed by the staff
independently of the  Committee's questionnaire.<p>  <p>  7.  Senator Packwood stated that he had -reviewed
his diaries, but that on the  advice of his counsel, he had not reviewed them for the purposes of preparing 
for his deposition.  Senator Packwood's counsel was under the mistaken  impression that if Senator Packwood
reviewed the diaries in preparation for his  deposition, Committee counsel would demand to see the diaries
pursuant to the  Federal Rules of Evidence, which provide that the opposing party may review any  documents
that a witness has used to refresh his recollection in preparation  for testimony.<p>  <p>  8.  The privilege
log provided to the Committee by Senator Packwood's attorneys  listed 112 memoranda that were being withheld
on the grounds of either  attorney-client or work-product privilege, and identified them by date, author, 
recipient(s), and the name of the complainant or potential complainant who was  discussed in the memorandum. 
The privilege log did not disclose that attached  to many of the memoranda were excerpts from Senator
Packwood's diary pimages,  some of which referred to women who had made claims of misconduct against  Senator
Packwood.  At his deposition, Jim Fitzpatrick, one of Senator  Packwood's attorneys at the at firm of Arnold
&amp; Porter, testified that they  viewed some of the diary entries as falling outside the scope of the 
Committee's request, and some of them as falling within the scope; to the  extent that they fell within the
scope of the request, he stated that they were  adequately identified on the privilege log.  Six of the
memoranda identified on  the privilege log pre-dated the November 1992 election.  Mr. Fitzpatrick  testified
that their representation of Senator Packwood began just after that  election. <p>  <p>  9.  Also for the
first time, Senator Packwood disclosed the existence of daily  records of events, which he had kept for over
twenty years, and travel records,  neither of which had been provided to the Committee in response to its 
requests.  Senator Packwood provided those records to the Committee within a  few days after his
deposition.<p>  <p>  10.  The diaries requested by the Committee on October 6, 1993, which were to  be
reviewed under the agreement were for the following periods: January 1969  through December 1972; January 1975
through December 1977; September 1978  through December 1986; and August 1989 through October 6, 1993.<p>  <p>
 11.   On at least two occasions during the Committee's review of the diaries,  the Senator's attorneys
informed staff that particular passimages had been masked  that did not fall within the agreed-upon
categories, but which related to  extremely personal information about third parties, and were in no way
relevant  to matters under inquiry.  Staff declined an offer to examine this material,  and consented to its
masking.<p>  <p>  12.  Senator Packwood also refused to provide the Committee with copies of  these November 3
and November 6 entries, or of any of the entries designated  for copying over the weekend of October 16 and
17.<p>  <p>  13.   Letter from James Fitzpatrick and Daniel Rezneck to Senators Richard H.  Bryan and Mitch
McConnell, October 20, 1993.<p>  <p>  14.  Letter from Senators Richard H. Bryan and Mitch McConnell to
Senator 80b  Packwood, November 9, 1993.<p>  <p>  15.  The attorneys met with the staff, but there was a very
brief discussion  with little or no elaboration on the proposal being advanced by Senator  Packwood.<p>  <p> 
16.  Informally, the Committee would not seek to curtail the Senator's pension,  an action which was not
within the Committee's power in any event. <p>  <p>  17.  By this time, Senator Packwood had retained
different attorneys, the firm  of Stein, Mitchell &amp; Mezines, who continue to represent him in this 
matter.<p>  <p>  18.  On December 10, 1993, Michael Davidson, Senate Legal Counsel wrote to  Senator
Packwood's attorneys, stating, inter alia:  <p>  <p>  "[i]t would be helpful and appreciated if you could
advise U8 of the dates of  the transcripts that depart from the original tapes, and also provide us with  any
other specific information that could shed light on the integrity of the  tapes and transcripts."<p>  <p> 
Senator Packwood's attorney responded that his letter of December 10, 1993,  "must stand without comment.<p> 
<p>  19.  Senator Packwood petitioned the District Court for a stay of its Orders of  January 24 and February
7, 1994, while he appealed those Orders to the Court of  Appeals.  The District Court denied this motion. 
Senator Packwood's appeal for  a stay was also denied by the Court of Appeals on February 18, 1994.  On March 
2, 1994, Chief Justice Rehnquist denied Senator Packwood's request for a stay,  and Senator Packwood
subsequently withdrew his appeal of the Orders  themselves.<p>  <p>  20.  Mr. Starr also continued to act as
the Committee's Hearing Examiner.<p>  <p>  21.  These criteria were the same as set out in the November 9,
1993 letter  from the Committee to Senator Packwood.<p>  <p>  22.  To avoid confusion, the written diary
transcripts that were provided to  the Committee by Senator Packwood, through Mr. Starr, will be referred to
as  the "Cormack transcripts."<p>  <p>  23.  U.S. Const. art. I, S 5, cl. 2.<p>  <p>  24.  S. Res. 338, S

661, 670 (1897) (in upholding the authority  of the Senate to require by subpoena testimony of private persons
in an  investigation of Senatorial misconduct, the Court noted the expulsion of former  Senator Blount as an
example of Congress's broad authority: "It was not a  statutable offense nor was it committed in his official
character, nor was it  committed during the session of Congress, nor at the seat of government.");  United
States v. Brewster, 408  U.S. 501 (1972) (in dicta, the Court observed,  "The process of disciplining a Member
of Congress...is not surrounded with the  panoply of protective shields that are present in a criminal case. 
An accused  Member is judged by no specifically articulated standards, and is at the mercy  of an almost
unbridled discretion of the charging body...from whose decisions  there is no established right of
review.").<p>  <p>  31.  Report of the Select Committee to Study Censure Charges pursuant to S.  Res. 301 and

committee  might investigate,  Senator Cooper explained as follows: "I cannot foresee every case...I believe 
one of the great duties of such a committee would be to have the judgment to  know what it should investigate
and what it should not, after looking into a  question." Id.<p>  <p>  36.   See, e.g., Jack Maskell,
Congressional Research Service Confidential  Report to the Select Committee on Ethics, jurisdiction and
Authority of the  Senate Select Committee on Ethics Over What Might be Characterized as  "Personal" or
"Private" Misconduct of a Senator (not published, March 3,  1993).<p>  <p>  37.   In the censure of Senator
Joseph McCarthy of Wisconsin, the Select  Committee to Study the Censure Charges reported to the Senate:  It
seems clear  that if a Senator should be guilty of reprehensible conduct unconnected with  his official duties
and position, but which conduct brings the Senate into  disrepute, the Senate has the power to censure. n S.
Rep. No. 2508, supra, note  6, at 22.<p>  <p>     The House of Representatives has held a similar view.  In
the report on  Representative Adam Clayton Powell from the House Judiciary Committee, which  recommended that
Powell be seated, and then censured for his misconduct, the  Committee noted that: "Nor is the conduct for
which punishment may be imposed  limited to acts relating to the Member's official duties." In Re Adam Clayton
 Powell H.R. Rep. No. 27, 90th Cong., 1st Sess. 24 t1967).<p>  <p>     See, also, for examples of
recommendations for discipline for conduct which  brings  the Senate into dishonor and disrepute : S. Rep. No.
382, 101st Cong.,  2d Sess. 14 (1990); S. Rep. No. 337, 96th Cong., 1st Sess. 18 (1979); S. Rep.  No. 193,

(1964)(emphasis added).<p>  <p>  43.  In a report of a 1964 investigation into certain activities undertaken
by  Robert Baker, then Secretary to the Majority of the Senate, the Committee on  Rules and Administration
stated: "It is possible for anyone to follow the  'letter of the law' and avoid being indicted for a criminal
act, but in the  case of employees of the Senate, they are expected, and rightly so, to follow  not only the
'letter' but also the 'spirit' of the law." S. Rep. No. 1175, 88th  Cong., 2d Sess. 5(1964).<p>  <p>  44.  See
In Re Chapman, 166 U.S. 661, 669-670 (1897).<p>  <p>  45.  S. Doc. No. 7, 92d Cong., 1st Sess. 6 (1972)
(Expulsion and Censure  Cases).  <p>  <p>  46.  The Senate decided not to act on the Committee's
recommendation before the  end of the session, and Senator Patterson left the Senate at the end of his  term.

2d. Sess. (1968).<p>  <p>  56.  The Committee has never relied specifically on the Preamble as an  enforceable
standard, but prior to adoption of S. Res. 266, its predecessor  Committee on Standards and Conduct had
recommended censure for Senator Thomas  Dodd in part because it found his conduct derogates from the public
trust  expected of a Senator."  S. Rep. No. 193, 90th Cong., 1st Sess. (1967).  The  Preamble continues as a
Standing Order of the Senate.  See Senate Manual,  paragraph 79.6.<p>  <p>  57.  The Code of Ethics for
Government Service, H. Con. Res. 175, 85th Cong.,  1st Sess. (1957). <p>  <p>  58.  Although the House of
Representatives has used the broad standards set out  in the Code of Ethics for Government Service as a
disciplinary standard in  investigations of misconduct, the Senate has never done 80.  See In The Matter  Of
Representative Austin J. Murphy, H. Rep. No. 485, 100th Cong., 1st Sess. 4  (1987); 133 Cong. Rec. H11686-96

Smith, Senator John Quincy Adams,  reporting for the committee, noted that the power of expulsion is 
"discretionary" and is 'without any limitation other than that which requires a  concurrence of two-thirds of
the votes to give it effect." See II Hinds'  Precedents 1264, at 817-18.  Although the power was described
broadly, Hinds'  Precedents notes that the charge that Smith made an oath of allegiance to a  foreign king,
was not acted upon since it was to have been taken previously to the election of Mr. Smith.<p>  <p>  66.  S.

width=100 height=92 border=0 align=left src="/images/spt2.gif" alt=" * ">



In September 1994, a fifteen-year old in Blair, Nebraska discovered that she was

twenty-three weeks pregnant by her boyfriend, also a minor. A medical examination showed

she was able to have an abortion if she chose, and with the approval of her family, she

scheduled a termination. The boyfriend and his parents came to the woman's home,

allegedly assaulted the woman and her parents, calling them "baby killers," and police

were summoned. The boyfriend was arrested for assaulting a police officer. While the

police were there, one of the sheriff's deputies allegedly attempted to give the woman

anti-abortion literature. Several hours later, police arrived at the home where the

woman and her family were staying, and took her into "protective custody" on the basis

of a "To Whom It May Concern" letter from a physician who had not examined the minor,

alleging that the proposed abortion would endanger the minor. The minor was placed in

foster care for a period of at least 36 hours. A judge allowed her to be returned to her

parents custody "<B>on the condition that no abortion shall be performed on the

subject's unborn child without further order of the Court.</B>" In December 1994, the

minor gave birth to a child. The woman and her parents have filed this complaint against

the county attorney, the county, members of the county sheriff's office and local police

department, and the boyfriend and his parents on various counts of trespass, illegal

search and seizure, invasion of privacy and interference with the right to reproductive

choice.<P>

16.  Defendants [redacted] and his mother and stepfather Kathy and John Tull had become

aware of the pregnancy on the afternoon of September 26 because Kathy had [redacted]

take two home pregnancy tests at the Tulls' house.  Later that evening, Kathy and John

Tull made an unsolicited visit to the Scotts' home.  The Tulls informed the Scotts of

their desire to help raise [redacted] child, even though [redacted] had not yet decided

whether or not she would carry her pregnancy to term.<P>  



17.  On Tuesday, September 27, plaintiff [redacted] Scott was examined by Dr. Carol

Weckmuller at the Blair Medical Group.  The family's regular doctor was on vacation at

the time. [redacted] was accompanied by her mother Connie Scott.  Based on a physical

examination, Dr. Weckmuller informed [redacted] and Connie Scott that she estimated that

[redacted] was twenty-three weeks pregnant.  Dr. Weckmuller advised [redacted] where she

could get an abortion, should that be her choice. [redacted] Scott informed defendant

Kathy Tull, by telephone, of the developments that day. 

<P>

18.  On Wednesday, September 28, [redacted] spoke at length with her family about her

options.  After extensive deliberation, [redacted] decided to seek an abortion. 

<P>

19.  On Wednesday, September 28, [redacted] made an appointment by telephone for an

abortion.  During the phone call, [redacted] spoke to a clinic employee, who asked her a

series of questions and then explained the abortion procedure to her.  Connie Scott also

talked to the employee and gave her additional information. [redacted] then spoke again

with the clinic employee, who asked again whether [redacted] really wanted an abortion.

[redacted] replied yes, and scheduled an appointment. 

<P>

20.  Early that evening, [the boyfriend] came over to [the Scott's] house. [redacted]

told him that she planned to have an abortion.  He was upset, saying she was killing a

baby.  Mid- evening Kathy Tull called the Scotts, screaming and saying such upsetting

things that Connie Scott hung up the telephone. 

<P>

21.  Shortly thereafter someone pounded on the Scotts' door.  Carl Scott went to answer

the door, but before he could open it, defendant [the boyfriend] kicked the door,

causing it to hit Carl in the eye and [redacted] across the face.  Present with [the

boyfriend] at the Scott home were, among others, Kathy  and John Tull, another Tull

family member, and several of [the boyfriend]'s friends. They were screaming, calling

the Scotts "baby killers" and other derogatory names, pulling [redacted], and hitting

Carl. Connie Scott called the police to the house because of the violence against her

family.  When the police arrived, including defendants Willis, Lager, Thallis, Shear and

John Does I-VIII, [the boyfriend] struck Officer Lager and was arrested.  Kathy Tull

assaulted Connie Scott by kicking her in the stomach.  Kathy Tull was not arrested.  Two

officers asked [redacted] if she had made an appointment for an abortion, to which she

responded, yes. 

<P>

22.  At least one deputy from the Sheriff's Department, defendant Officer Darrell

Howard, arrived at the scene separately.  He tried to give [redacted] a manila envelope

containing anti-abortion literature.  Earlier that day, Officer Howard, who is active in

the anti-choice movement in Blair, had met with the Tulls at their home apparently for

the purpose of preventing [redacted] from obtaining an abortion.<P>  



23.  After the altercation, the plaintiffs and [redacted]'s younger brother went to

their cousins' house for the night.  The plaintiffs had earlier told the police that

they would be staying at their cousins' home in Blair that night and had given the

officers their cousins' address.  

<P>

24.  That same day, September 28, without [redacted] Scotts' consent, defendant Kathy

Tull discussed [redacted]'s pregnancy and abortion plans with defendants Bagby and

Jordan apparently for the purpose of preventing [redacted] from obtaining an abortion. 

Defendants Bagby and Jordan cooperated, by writing a letter stating that "any elective

abortion could potentially cause medical and emotional damage to the mother at any stage

of pregnancy" and that an abortion at twenty-three weeks "could be harmful" to

[redacted].  (Emphasis added.)  Neither Bagby nor Jordan had ever examined or spoken

with [redacted].  The letter does not state that an abortion at twenty-three weeks is

legal and is accepted medical practice, nor does it note that carrying to term and

delivering a child could also be harmful to [redacted].  Kathy Tull then took the letter

to the Blair police station.  Attached as Exhibit A is a copy of that letter. 

<P>

25.  At around 12:30 a.m. on Thursday, September 29, the plaintiffs were awakened by

police at their cousins' house.  More than ten law enforcement vehicles surrounded the

house.  Present were members of the Blair Police Department, including defendants Lager,

Thallis and Shear, as well as county officers.  The police took [redacted] into custody. 

They did so for the purpose of preventing [redacted] from obtaining an abortion.  

<P>

26.  The Scotts were told that [redacted] was being taken into protective custody.  The

police offered the Scotts little explanation as to why [redacted] was being taken into

custody except to show them the letter from defendants Bagby and Jordan, and to say that

defendant John E. Samson, the County Attorney, had directed them to take [redacted] into

custody.  The police told the Scotts there would be a hearing at 9 a.m. that morning,

and advised them to get an attorney.  They did not inform the plaintiffs where they were

taking [redacted] or what they would do with her.  The plaintiffs were extremely

frightened and confused by the police removing [redacted] in the middle of the night to

an undisclosed place for an undefined purpose. 

<P>

27. [redacted] was taken by the police to the Blair police station. [redacted] was at

the police station for several hours.  During this time, the police did not give her

written notice of the reasons she was taken into custody.  During this time, [redacted]

also noticed anti-choice materials on one of the lockers in the station. 

<P>



28.  After several hours at the police station, [redacted] was transported to the home

of a foster family who were strangers to her.  At approximately 3:30 a.m., plaintiffs

Connie and Carl Scott received a call from Deborah Bales, whom they did not know, but

who identified herself as being with the Nebraska Department of Social Services.  Ms.

Bales informed the Scotts that [redacted] was safe and urged them to get an attorney. 

<P>

29.  Early Thursday morning, September 29, plaintiffs Connie and Carl Scott sought and

obtained counsel.  Their attorney was informed by defendant County Attorney Samson that

no hearing would be held that day because there were no judges in town.  Plaintiffs

Connie and Carl Scott were not told when a hearing would be held, nor were they given

the option of going to another town to appear before a judge in order to avoid further

delay. 

<P>

30.  On Thursday morning, defendant County Attorney John Samson interrogated [redacted]

Scott. [redacted] was alone throughout the questioning, even though defendant Samson

knew that she was under eighteen years of age and that her parents were available. 

Defendant Samson further knew that the Scotts had retained counsel.  Defendant Samson

also refused Deborah Bales' requests that he release [redacted].  Instead, he filed a

baseless petition with the Washington County Juvenile Court under the child protection

law, alleging  that [redacted] was in a situation dangerous to life or limb or injurious

to her health.  The only stated reasons for the petition were that plaintiffs Connie and

Carl Scott "had made arrangements" for [redacted] Scott to obtain an abortion and that

defendant Bagby had provided a letter to law enforcement officials stating that an

elective abortion could be harmful to [redacted].  A copy of the petition is attached as

Exhibit B. 

<P>

31.  On Thursday, September 29, the Scotts discovered that fliers had been posted all

over Blair stating that plaintiffs Carl and Connie Scott were "murderers."  Members of

[the boyfriend's] family and his friends were responsible for posting the fliers. 

<P>

32.  On Friday afternoon, September 30, the Honorable F.A. Gossett, III, of Juvenile

Court of Washington County held a hearing regarding [redacted].  No guardian ad litem or

attorney was ever appointed to represent [redacted]'s interests. 

<P>

33.  At the hearing, County Attorney Samson filed an Amended Petition alleging that

[redacted] was in a situation dangerous or injurious to her health or morals and that

she was being neglected by her parents.  These allegations were based solely on the

assertion that [redacted] was twenty-three weeks pregnant and considering an abortion.

The only evidence put forth by Samson was the letter from defendants Bagby and Jordan

(Ex. A), who had never examined or spoken to [redacted], stating that they believed an

abortion at twenty-three weeks could be harmful to [redacted].  A copy of the Amended

Petition is attached as Exhibit C. 

<P>

34.  The petition filed by defendant County Attorney Samson stated that the allegations

against plaintiffs Connie and Carl Scott were based on reports to "Law Enforcement." The

Scotts did not, however, receive written notification of the investigation from the

state Department of Social Services.  Nor were any of the other procedures typically

associated with a child abuse or neglect investigation followed, such as the appointment

of a guardian ad litem for [redacted]. 

<P>

35.  Upon consideration of the Amended Petition, Judge Gossett stated that [redacted]

should not have been removed from the Scotts' custody.  Judge Gossett ordered that the

temporary placement of [redacted] with the Department of Social Services be terminated,

and further ordered that [redacted] be released to the custody of her parents "on the

condition that no abortion shall be performed on the subject's unborn child without

further order of the Court." The order provides that any violation of its terms is

punishable as contempt.   A copy of the Order is attached as Exhibit D. 

<P>

36.  Subsequent to the hearing, [redacted] obtained protective orders from the District

Court of Washington County against Kathy Tull and [redacted] prohibiting them from

harassing [redacted] and entering the Scott home. These orders became permanent on

October 14, 1994, and are still in effect. 

<P>

37.  After the incident, [the boyfriend] tried repeatedly to contact [redacted].  His

friends followed [redacted] when she left the house in Blair. [redacted] was threatened

with assault. [redacted] became afraid to leave the house alone.  School in Blair became

so threatening that [redacted] was tutored at home. [redacted] was so upset by the

events that she had to seek the advice and support of a counselor.  Connie and Carl

Scott were also harassed. Because of the trauma to their family caused by these events

and the ongoing harassment, Connie and Carl Scott decided to move from Blair.  They

wanted [redacted] to be able to return to school and again be with peers.  Despite the

move and passage of time, [redacted] continues to have nightmares. 

<P>

38.  Subsequent to the events, [the boyfriend] pleaded guilty to assaulting a police

officer at the Scotts' house and was placed on probation for one year. 

<P>

39.  In December 1994, [redacted] gave birth to a baby, whom she is raising in

[redacted]'s parents' home. 

<P>

40.  On September 22, 1995, the plaintiffs served upon defendants Washington County,

John E. Samson, Darrell Howard, Kevin Willis, City of Blair, Joseph Lager, Nicholas

Thallis, Benjamin Shear, and John Doe I-VII tort claim notices in the form required and

provided in such cases by the laws of the State of Nebraska concerning claims of

trespass, intentional infliction of emotional distress, invasion of privacy and

interference with the rights to reproductive choice, family integrity, due process, and

freedom from illegal search and seizure as guaranteed by the Nebraska Constitution.   

<P>

participating in joint activity, deprived the plaintiffs of their liberty without due

process of law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States

Constitution and Art. 1, Section 3 of the Nebraska Constitution. 

<P>

45.  By, among other things, forcibly and without consent, entering the Scotts'

In his remarks, delivered to the Federalist Society's Ninth Annual Lawyers Convention,

Thomas criticized contemporary society for exalting victims-in not only the political

realm, but in the courts as well. He marveled at the breadth and depth of the victim

mentality, finding irony in the white men today who, "preoccupied with oppression," have

"fallen prey to the very aspects of the modern ideology of victimology that they

deplore." And, sounding a classic conservative theme, Thomas concluded that "the idea

that government can be the primary instrument for the elimination of misfortune is a

fundamental misunderstanding of the human condition."<P>

The full text of Thomas' speech, delivered Sept. 22 in Washington, D.C., follows. It is

reprinted with permission.<P> 

<hr size=7><P>

I would like thank my friends here at the Federalist Society for once again inviting me

to be a part of an important and timely conference. And I would like to begin by

returning to a topic I touched upon in my last speech at a conference co-sponsored by

this organization: personal responsibility. It says something about the current state of

affairs in our society that a conference on victims-that is, a conference on the rise of

the practice of blaming circumstances for one's situation rather than taking

responsibility for changing things for the better-is evennecessary.<P>

As many of you have heard me say before, the very notion of submitting to one's

circumstances was unthinkable in the household in which I was raised. The mere

suggestion that difficult circumstances could prevail over individual effort would evoke

a response that my brother and I could lip-sync on cue: "Old man 'can't' is dead; I

helped bury him." Or, another favorite response: "Where there is a will, there is a

way." Under this philosophy-the essential truth of which we all recognize in our

hearts-victims have no refuge.<P>

It may have seemed harsh at the time to be told that failure was one's own fault.

Indeed, there may have been many circumstances beyond our control. But there was much

that my family and my community did to reinforce this message of self-determination and

self-worth, thereby inoculating us against the victim plague that was highly contagious

in the hot, humid climate of segregation.<P>

What has become clear to me over the years, as I have witnessed the transformation of

our society into one based upon victims rather than heroes, is that there is a more

positive message to be gained from adversity: Success (as well as failure) is the result

of one's own talents, morals, decisions, and actions. Accepting personal responsibility

for victory as well as for defeat is as liberating and empowering as it is unpopular

today. Overcoming adversity not only gives us our measure as individuals, but it also

reinforces those basic principles and rules without which a society based upon freedom

and liberty cannot function.<P>

In those years of my youth, there was a deep appreciation of heroes and heroic virtue.

Art, literature, and even popular culture (unlike today) often focused on people who

demonstrated heroic virtues-courage, persistence, discipline, hard work, humility,

triumph in the face of adversity, just to mention a few. These building blocks of

self-reliance were replicated and reinforced at home, school, and church. The "rags to

riches" Horatio Alger stories were powerful messages of hope and inspiration to those

struggling for a better life. And many of us used to read and dream about heroes-not to

mention our favorite television heroes, something perhaps unbelievable these days. I am

certain that many of you who attended grammar school in the 1950s or earlier probably

remember reading a favorite account of the integrity and work ethic of George

Washington, or of Abraham Lincoln, or of George Washington Carver, or even of some

baseball or football legend. It seemed that we all had heroes (not role models, a term

of far more recent vintage). Indeed, it would have been odd for a child of several

decades ago not to have had a hero.<P>

But today, our culture is far less likely to raise up heroes than it is to exalt

victims-individuals who are overcome by the sting of oppression, injustice, adversity,

neglect, or misfortune. Today, victims of discrimination, racism, poverty, sickness, and

societal neglect abound in the popular press. Today, there are few (if any) heroes.

Often, it seems that those who have succumbed to their circumstances are more likely to

be singled out than those who have overcome them.<P>

What caused this cultural shift-from an emphasis on heroes to a preoccupation with

victims? Why are there more victims and virtually no heroes recognized today? Why in

years past was there much less of an emphasis on victimage?<P>

I think two things contributed to this change in the state of affairs. The first is that

our political and legal systems now actively encourage people to claim victim status and

to make demands on society for reparations and recompense. The second is that our

culture actually seeks to denigrate or deconstruct heroes. Why would a civilized society

travel down two such destructive paths? Why has it become no more admirable to rise

valiantly above one's circumstances than it is to submit to them-all the while

aggressively transferring responsibility for one's condition to others?

Let's begin with our political and legal systems-how have they contributed to this state

of affairs? The classical conception was that government and the law were meant to

ensure freedom and equality of opportunity by giving people the most room possible for

self-provision and self-determination. James Madison made this point in The Federalist

Papers when he observed that the "protection" of the "diversity of faculties in men" was

the "first object" of government. And, in more recent times, the great political

economist Friedrich von Hayek-who witnessed totalitarianism first-hand-made a similar

point when he observed that "the chief aim of freedom is to provide both the opportunity

and the inducement to insure the maximum use of the knowledge that an individual can

acquire."<P>

Between the New Deal and the 1960s, a far different view began to hold sway- namely,

that the role of the state was to eliminate want, suffering, and adversity. Freedom was

no longer simply a right to self-provision and self-determination, but was instead a

right to make demands on government and society for one's well-being and happiness. That

is the import of Franklin Roosevelt's "Citizen Bill of Rights," which spoke of freedom

from want-rights to minimum income, housing, and other "adequate protections from

economic fears." And, I think it is axiomatic that the call for such new rights (if not

claims) became ever more prevalent in the 1950s and 1960s.<P>

No doubt, this gradual transformation in ideas took root and flourished (at least in

part) because of the aggregate growth in wealth and resources we were witnessing in this

country during the course of the 20th century. Against the background of this

prosperity, poverty stood out in bold relief and in uncomfortably stark contrast-even as

the number of people suffering from it shrank. It is not surprising that people began to

think that, in a world of seemingly unlimited resources, adversity could be eliminated,

or, at the very least, remedied. The ideal of the "benevolent state" took hold. In our

"enlightened" society, neglect, misfortune, and injustice did not have to be accepted as

inevitable facts of life. Good government and laws could step in when necessary, as many

believed they had successfully done during two World Wars, the Great Depression, and the

civil rights movement.

If one assumes that suffering and adversity can be eliminated, but sees a number of

people continuing to suffer from adversity or misfortune, then there must be some forces

in society that relegate the "have nots" to this fate. Or, at the very least, the less

fortunate are being ignored. Those facing adversity, hence, are victims of a society

that is not doing as much as it could (if it so desired), and these victims can (and

should) stake a legitimate claim against the political and legal systems for recompense.

In this view, neglect or selfishness on the part of society and government is

responsible for the sting of oppression, injustice, and misfortune that the unfortunate

and "have nots" feel today.<P>

In light of this modern ideology, is it any surprise that people identify themselves as

victims and make demands on the political systems for special status and entitlements?

Our culture expects (and, indeed, encourages) people to do exactly that. Consider, for

example, the creation and continued expansion of the welfare state and other social

programs in this country. How often have we heard proponents of these programs lull the

poor into thinking that they are hopeless victims, incapable of triumphing over

adversity without "benevolent intervention" by the state? How often have we heard these

proponents encouraging the less fortunate in our society to become indignant about their

situation in life and more demanding on the political system to find solution to their

problems?<P>

It is not only in the political system, though, that we see our society and its leaders

succumbing to the modern ideology of victimhood. As with the political system, people

today also are strongly encouraged to make demands on the legal system by claiming

victim status. Indeed, the legal system has, in many ways, become a significant driving

force behind the modern ideology of victimhood. Courts are viewed as an effective means

of forcing (or at least pressuring) political institutions into meeting demands for

protected status and new rights or entitlements.<P> 

Pointing to perceived "victimization" by "the system" or by others in society, our legal

culture has often told the least fortunate in our society that their last hope is to

claim special legal rights and benefits, or to seek exoneration for the harmful,

criminal consequences of their acts. The least fortunate are encouraged to turn to legal

arguments that admit defeat and that challenge the moral authority of society. In these

ways, courts are called upon to solve social problems-by creating special rules, and by

crafting remedies that will satisfy the claims and demands of victim groups but that do

not apply to all of us.<P>

Appealing to the legal system, though, was not as easy a task as making demands on the

political system. Our legal system has traditionally required that redress for

grievances only be granted after very exacting standards have been met. There had to be,

for example, very distinct, individualized harm. And, the definition of harm was

circumscribed by a traditional understanding of adjudication under the common law, where

narrow disputes regarding traditional property rights were resolved among private

parties who could not settle matters on their own. Very generalized claims of misfortune

or oppression or neglect-the kinds of assertions made in the political system-would not

easily fit into this common mold of court activity. It would not be enough for people to

be indignant, angry, and demanding about their situation in life. There would have to be

an assertion of a legal wrong and a persuasive argument that a legal remedy was

available.

The pressure of victimology "revolutionized"-and that word does not always have positive

connotations-the courts and the law. For those in our culture seeking to use the courts

as agents of social change, poverty, unemployment, social deviancy, and criminal

behavior were not just unfair conditions in our society that could be eliminated if only

people or politicians cared. Instead, these abstract problems were personified as the

direct actions of local schools, churches, businesses, and other social institutions so

that they could be sued for causing individualized harm to the victims. Based on this

new kind of harm-a kind of legalistic understanding of "victimage"-the courts were said

to be obligated to recognize special rights and protected status under the law.<P>

Take, for example, welfare rights and due process. Beginning with <I>Goldberg v.

Kelly,</I> 397 U.S. 254 (1970), our cases underscored the importance of welfare as a

means of preventing social malaise, promoting the general welfare, and securing the

blessings of liberty for all Americans. The rights to life, liberty, and property were,

in effect, transformed from freedom from government interference into a right to welfare

payments. There are countless other examples in legal literature and judicial

opinions-some have argued that inner city minorities and the poor should not be held

responsible for the consequences of their criminal acts because of oppression and

misfortune; and, of course, there is the debate now raging about preferences based on

sex, race, and ethnicity.<P>

This change in our political and legal systems has been accompanied by the rise of the

"victim group." These groups are quite useful to public officials for building

coalitions for future political support and legitimacy, as well. And, for the courts,

"victim groups" provide useful justification or cover for energizing the legislative

process, changing the legislative agenda, forcing reconsideration of spending

priorities, and transforming public debate.

But the rise of victimhood, and its perpetuation by government and the law, is only part

of the modern tragedy. There is also the dearth of heroes in our culture. Significantly,

as the number of these "victim groups" has escalated, there has been a corresponding

decline in the amount of attention that our culture has paid to heroes or, even worse, a

conscious attempt to cheapen their achievements. Today, success or a commitment to

fighting for noble ideas is attributed to self-interest, revenge, self-aggrandizement,

insecurity, or some psychological idiosyncrasy.<P>

Just thumb through recently published biographies in the library or bookstore-in many of

them, it is not a conscious effort to be virtuous or to do good, but instead a series of

unforeseeable and external forces, that lead to greatness or success. And, in many of

these biographies, we are introduced to the uncut, "never before seen" foibles,

mistakes, and transgressions of people our culture idealized for centuries. The message:

that these so-called heroes are really just regular people capable of folly and vice who

happened to have a few good breaks.<P>

In Democracy in America, Alexis de Tocqueville anticipated this state of affairs when he

said: "Historians who live in democratic times do not only refuse to admit that some

citizens may influence the destiny of a people, but also take away from the people

themselves the faculty of modifying their own lot and make them depend on an inflexible

providence or a kind of blind fatality."<P>

Now, the problem these days is not that there are no people who should be singled out as

heroes. Rather, as Daniel Boorstin suggests in his book, The Image, society is

preoccupied with celebrities. And heroism and celebrity status are two very different

things. The word "hero" refers to people of great strength, integrity, or courage who

are recognized and admired for their accomplishments and achievements. The word

"celebrity," on the other hand, refers to a condition-the condition of being much talked

about. It is a state of notoriety or famousness. As Boorstin says, "A celebrity is a

person who is known for his well-knownness." Thus, while a hero is distinguished by his

achievement, celebrities are created by the media and are simply a trademark.

Celebrities are, in short, neither good nor bad-they are just a big name. Publicity is

the defining feature of a celebrity's existence, and, unlike a hero who will become

greater as time passes, time destroys celebrities. Over time the glare of publicity, as

Boorstin notes, melts away the celebrity by shedding light and heat on his vices and

commonplaceness.<P>

This pattern of ignoring and deconstructing heroes-and focusing instead on the ephemeral

celebrity who is known for his well-knownness rather than character or individual

worth-stems from the rise of radical egalitarianism. In the 1960s, many of the cultural

elite saw a need to ensure absolute equality. On this view, differences in ability and

level of achievement are random or uncontrolled; and to permit these characteristics to

dictate human happiness and well-being would therefore be unfair. Celebrity status, in

contrast, is not a problem for egalitarians, for as Boorstin notes, "anyone can become a

celebrity, if only he can get into the news and stay there." Certainly, real achievement

is not necessarily required.<P>

It should surprise no one that our culture now has far less difficulty recognizing

celebrities than it does those who achieve success as a result of personal effort and

character traits that we traditionally would consider heroic. Denigrating heroic

virtue-in other words, chalking heroism up to circumstance-fits quite well with the

notion that we must all be the same and that there can be no significant differences in

our achievement, social standing, or wealth.<P>

Anyone can see what these intellectual currents have done to the ideals of human

dignity, personal responsibility, and self-determination. Preoccupation with victim

status has caused people to focus covetously on what they do not have in comparison to

others, or on what has happened to them in the past. Many fail to see the freedom they

do have and the talents and resources that are at their disposal.<P>

Our culture today discourages, and even at times stifles, heroic virtues-fortitude,

character, courage, a sense of self-worth. For so many, the will, the spirit, and a firm

sense of self-respect and self-worth have been suffocated. Many in today's society do

not expect the less fortunate to accept responsibility for (and overcome) their present

circumstances. Because they are given no chance to overcome their circumstances, they

will not have the chance to savor the triumph over adversity. They are instead given the

right to fret and complain, and are encouraged to avoid responsibility and self-help.

This is a poor substitute for the empowering rewards of true victory over adversity.<P>

One of my favorite memories of my grandfather is how he would walk slowly by the

cornfield, admiring the fruits of his labor. I have often thought that just the sight of

a tall stand of corn must have been more nourishing to his spirit than the corn itself

was to his body.<P>

But the culture of victimology-with its emphasis on the so-called benevolent

state-delivers an additional (and perhaps worse) blow to dignity and self-worth. When

the less fortunate do accomplish something, they are often denied the sense of

achievement which is so very important for strengthening and empowering the human

spirit. They owe all their achievements to the "anointed" in society who supposedly

changed the circumstances-not to their own efforts.<P>

Long hours, hard work, discipline, and sacrifice are all irrelevant. In a world where

the less fortunate are given special treatment and benefits-and, significantly, where

they are told that whatever gains or successes they have realized would not be possible

without protected status and special benefits-the so-called beneficiaries of

state-sponsored benevolence are denied the opportunity to derive any sense of

satisfaction from their hard work and self-help. There is not a one among us who views

what others do for us the same way we view what we do for ourselves. No matter how much

we appreciate the help, it is still just that-help, not achievement.<P>

It also bears noting that our culture's preoccupation with grouping victims has

balkanized society. The "we/they" mentality of calling oneself a victim of society

breeds social conflict and calls into question the moral authority of society. The idea

that whole groups or classes are victims robs individuals of an independent spirit-they

are just moving along with the "herd" of other victims. Such individuals also lack any

incentive to be independent, because they know that as part of an oppressed group they

will neither be singled out for the life choices they make nor capable of distinguishing

themselves by their own efforts.<P>

As victim ideology flourishes and people are demoralized by its grip, more and more

people begin to think that they must claim victim status to get anywhere in this world.

Indeed, is it any surprise that anyone and everyone can claim to be a victim of

something these days? In his book The Abuse Excuse, Alan Dershowitz criticizes countless

examples of conditions that "victimize" people and thereby release them from

responsibility for their actions. Here are just a few examples:<P><UL>

<LI>The "black rage defense," which asserts that blacks who are constantly subjected to

oppression and racial injustice will become uncontrollably violent;<P>

<LI>"Urban survival syndrome," which claims that violent living conditions justify acts

of aggression in the community;<P>

<LI>"Self-victimization syndrome," which maintains that people become less productive

and creative, and become severely depressed, as a result of societal neglect and

discrimination.</ul><P>

Most significantly, there is the backlash against affirmative action by "angry white

males." I do not question a person's belief that affirmative action is unjust because it

judges people based on their sex or the color of their skin. But something far more

insidious is afoot. For some white men, preoccupation with oppression has become the

defining feature of their existence. They have fallen prey to the very aspects of the

modern ideology of victimology that they deplore.<P>

Some critics of affirmative action, for example, fault today's civil rights movement for

demanding equality yet supporting policies that discriminate based on race. These

critics expect the intended beneficiaries of the civil rights regime to break away from

the ideology of victimhood: to cherish freedom, to accept responsibility, and, where

necessary, to demonstrate fortitude in the face of unfairness.<P> 

I do not quarrel with this. But these critics should hold themselves to the same

standards, resisting the temptation to allow resentment over what they consider reverse

discrimination to take hold of their lives and to get the best of them. They must

remember that if we are to play the victim game, the very people they decry have the

better claim to victim status.<P>

Of course, de-emphasizing heroism exacerbates all these problems. Human beings have

always faced the temptation to permit adversity or hate to dominate and destroy their

lives. To counter this tendency, society had heroes-people capable of overcoming the

very adversity or injustice that currently affects today's victims. They rose above

their circumstances and inherent imperfections. Heroes cherished freedom, and tried to

accomplish much with what little they had. Heroes demonstrated perseverance in the face

of adversity and used hardship as a means to strive for greater virtue. And heroes

accepted responsibility-they did what they did despite fear and temptation, and tried to

do the right thing when presented with a choice between good and evil. It is awfully

hard for society to inculcate these values without some useful models from the past and

present.<P>

I may not have realized it as a child, but my grandfather was a hero who had a

tremendous impact on my life. He certainly would not be a celebrity by today's

standards. Though barely able to read and saddled with the burdens of segregation, he

worked hard to provide for his family. He was a deeply religious man who lived by the

Christian virtues. He was a man who believed in responsibility and self-help. And though

this could not bring him freedom in a segregated society, it at least gave him

independence from its daily demeaning clutches.<P>

In all the years I spent in my grandparents' house, I never heard them complain that

they were victims. Now, they did not like segregation or think that it was right. In

fact, there was no question that it was immoral and that anyone who promoted it was

morally reprehensible. But there was work to be done. I assure you that I did not enjoy

the demands he placed on us. I saw no value in rising with the chicken, and, unlike him,

I was not obsessed with what I will call the "reverse Dracula syndrome": that is, fear

that the rising sun would catch me in bed.<P>

It would not be until I was exposed to the most fortunate and best educated in our

society that I would be informed that all this time I had been a victim. I am sure you

can imagine what it was like when I returned home to Savannah, and informed my

grandparents that with the education I had received because of their tremendous

foresight and sacrifice, I had discovered our oppressed and victimized status in

society. Needless to say, relations were quite strained and our vacation visits were

somewhat difficult. My grandfather was no victim and he didn't send me to school to

become one.<P>

There are many people like my grandfather alive today. The cultural elite does not honor

them as the heroes they are, but instead views them as people who are sadly ignorant of

their victim status or who have forgotten where they came from. Our social institutions

do not train today's young to view such people as heroes and do not urge them to emulate

their virtues.<P>

In idealizing heroic virtue and criticizing the victim ideology of our day, I am not

saying that society is free from intractable and very saddening injustice and harm. That

would not be true. But the idea that government can be the primary instrument for the

elimination of misfortune is a fundamental misunderstanding of the human condition.

There has always been bad and suffering in the world, and we must admit that wrongs have

been and will continue to be committed. People will always be treated unfairly- we can

never eliminate oppression or adversity completely, though we can and should fight

injustice as best we can.<P>

But keep in mind that all of us are easily tempted to think of ourselves as victims and

thereby permit adversity to be the defining feature of our lives. In so doing, we deny

the very attributes that are at the core of human dignity-freedom of will, the capacity

to choose between good and bad, and the ability to endure adversity and to use it for

gain. Victimhood destroys the human spirit.<P>

I also am not saying that we should expect everyone to be a hero all of the time. We

humans are weak by our very nature; all of us at times will permit hardship to get the

very best of us. But having a set of norms to guide us and to push us along-the stuff of

heroes-can be a source of great strength. If we do not have a society that honors people

who make the right choices in the face of adversity-and reject the bad choices-far fewer

people will make the right choices. Ultimately, without a celebration of heroic virtue,

we throw ourselves into the current state of affairs, where man is a passive victim

incapable of triumphing over adversity and where aggression, resentment, envy, and other

vice thwart progress and true happiness.<P>

What I am saying is that it requires the leadership of heroes and the best efforts of

all to advance civilization and to ensure that its people follow the path of virtue.

And, because of the role law has played in perpetuating victim ideology and because of

the influence law can have in teaching people about right and wrong, lawyers have a

special obligation here. We should seek to pare back the victimology that pervades our

law, and thereby encourage a new generation of heroes to flourish.<P>

I am reminded of what Saint Thomas - Kempis wrote more than 500 years ago about the

human spirit. His standard is a useful one for thinking about the instruction that our

law should be offering: "Take care to ensure that in every place, action, and outward

occupation you remain inwardly free and your own master. Control circumstances, and do

not allow them to control you. Only so can you be a master and ruler of your actions,

not their servant or slave; a free man. . . ."

JUSTICE SCOTT concurs. JUSTICE ERICKSON dissents. 

<P>

Defendants, Roy Romer, Governor of the State of Colorado, Gale A. Norton, Attorney

General of the State of Colorado, and the State of Colorado (defendants) appeal the

trial court's entry of a permanent injunction enjoining them from enforcing a

voterinitiated amendment to the Colorado Constitution ("Amendment 2"). We affirm. 

<P>

I In May 1992, petitions which would amend the Colorado Constitution by adding a new

section 30 to article II were filed with the secretary of state. The proposed amendment

was put to the voters as Amendment 2 on November 3, 1992, and passed by a vote of

813,966 to 710,151 (53.4% to 46.6%). The secretary of state certified the results on

December 16, 1992, as required by article V, section 1, of the state constitution. 

<P>

Amendment 2 provides:

<P>

No Protected Status Based on Homosexual, Lesbian, or Bisexual Orientation. Neither the

State of Colorado, through any of its branches or departments, nor any of its agencies,

political subdivisions, municipalities or school districts, shall enact, adopt or

enforce any statute, regulation, ordinance or policy whereby homosexual, lesbian or

bisexual orientation, conduct, practices or relationships shall constitute or otherwise

be the basis of or entitle any person or class of persons to have or claim any minority

status quota preferences, protected status or claim of discrimination. This Section of

the Constitution shall be in all respects self-executing. On November 12, 1992, Richard

G. Evans, along with eight other persons, the Boulder Valley School District RE-2, the

City and County of Denver, the City of Boulder, the City of Aspen, and the City Council

of Aspen (plaintiffs) filed suit in Denver District Court to enjoin the enforcement of

Amendment 2 claiming that the amendment was unconstitutional. 

<P>

The trial court conducted an evidentiary hearing to consider plaintiffs' motion for a

preliminary injunction. Subsequently, the court granted the motion and prohibited the

defendants from enforcing Amendment 2 pending the outcome of a trial on the merits.FN1

The defendants appealed pursuant to C.A.R. 1(a)(3), and we granted review. See Evans v.

Romer, 854 P.2d 1270 (Colo. 1993) (Evans I). In Evans I, we first addressed the question

of the legal standard to be applied in reviewing the trial court's entry of the

preliminary injunction. Following the precedent of the United States Supreme Court, we

held that "the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution protects the

fundamental right to participate equally in the political process," and "that any

legislation or state constitutional amendment which infringes on this right by 'fencing

out' an independently identifiable class of persons must be subject to strict judicial

scrutiny." Id. at 1282. 

<P>

After recognizing that "[t]he immediate objective of Amendment 2 is, at a minimum, to

repeal existing statutes, regulations, ordinances, and policies of state and local

entities that barred discrimination based on sexual orientation" and that the "'ultimate

effect' of Amendment 2 is to prohibit any governmental entity from adopting similar, or

more protective statutes, regulations, ordinances, or policies in the future unless the

state constitution is first amended to permit such measures," we held: 

<P>

[T]he right to participate equally in the political process is clearly affected by

Amendment 2, because it bars gay men, lesbians, and bisexuals from having an effective

voice in governmental affairs insofar as those persons deem it beneficial to seek

legislation that would protect them from discrimination based on their sexual

orientation. Amendment 2 alters the political process so that a targeted class is

prohibited from obtaining legislative, executive, and judicial protection or redress

from discrimination absent the consent of a majority of the electorate through the

adoption of a constitutional amendment. Rather than attempting to withdraw

antidiscrimination issues as a whole from state and local control, Amendment 2 singles

out one form of discrimination and removes its redress from consideration by the normal

political processes. 

<P>

Id. at 1285. We concluded that the trial court did not err in granting the preliminary

injunction enjoining defendants from enforcing Amendment 2. 

<P>

After our decision in Evans I, the case was remanded to the trial court to determine

whether Amendment 2 was supported by a compelling state interest and narrowly tailored

to serve that interest. Id. at 1286. At trial the defendants offered six "compelling"

state interests: (1) deterring factionalism; (2) preserving the integrity of the state's

political functions; (3) preserving the ability of the state to remedy discrimination

against suspect classes; (4) preventing the government from interfering with personal,

familial, and religious privacy; (5) preventing government from subsidizing the

political objectives of a special interest group; and (6) promoting the physical and

psychological well-being of Colorado children.FN2 The trial court concluded that the

interest in deterring "factionalism" was in truth, nothing more than an attempt to

impede the expression of "a difference of opinion on a controversial political question

. ..." It concluded that the first governmental interest was not a compelling state

interest but rather, that "the opposite of defendants' claimed compelling interest is

most probably compelling," i.e., encouraging the competition of ideas with uninhibited,

robust, and wide-open political debate. 

<P>

The trial court found that the interest of preserving the State's political functions,

premised on the Tenth Amendment right of the states to amend state constitutions, was

not a compelling interest since "[d]efendants' legal argument is not supported by

federal or state case law, nor is it supported by the Colorado Constitution." With

respect to the interest in preserving the ability of the state to remedy discrimination

against groups which have been held to be suspect classes, the trial court stated its

doubt as to whether fiscal concerns of the state rise to the level of a compelling state

interest. The court held that Amendment 2 could not be understood to further this

interest because, [d]efendants' evidence was principally in the form of opinion and

theory as to what would occur if a Denver type ordinance were adopted as a state

statute. There is no such statute, nor is one proposed. Plaintiffs' evidence was based

on what has happened over the course of eleven years in Wisconsin, and during the time

in which the Denver ordinance has included a sexual orientation provision. Those actual

experiences show that the presence of a sexual orientation provision has not increased

costs or impaired the enforcement of other civil rights statutes or ordinances. 

<P>

Thus, the trial court concluded that "defendants' offered evidence of lack of fiscal

ability [is] unpersuasive in all respects." The trial court held that preventing the

government from interfering with personal, familial, and religious privacy was, in part,

a compelling state interest. Although the court acknowledged promotion of family privacy

is a compelling state interest, it held that defendants never established what they

meant by the term "family." Moreover, defendants failed to 

<P>

"tiein . ..the interest of protecting the family and denying gays and bisexuals the

right to political participation . ..." The trial court also found that preserving

religious liberty was a compelling state interest. However, it held that Amendment 2 was

not narrowly tailored to serve this interest. "The narrowly focused way of addressing

[antidiscrimination protections for gay men, lesbians, and bisexuals] is to add to it a

religious exemption such as is found in the Denver and Aspen ordinances, not to deny

gays and bisexuals their fundamental right of participation in the political process."

The trial court rejected the personal privacy component of the argument on the grounds

that "[t]he general issue of whether personal privacy is a compelling state interest was

not adequately established. The court can only speculate as to what defendants mean by

personal privacy and how Amendment 2 protects such a right." The interest in preventing

government from subsidizing the political objectives of a special interest group was

rejected on the grounds that "[t]his claimed compelling interest was not supported by

any credible evidence or any cogent argument, and the court concludes that it is not a

compelling state interest." Similarly, the trial court rejected the argument that the

protection of children is a compelling state interest served by Amendment 2 because

"[d]efendants have failed to present sufficient evidence to support this claimed

compelling interest." Accordingly, because the trial court concluded that Amendment 2

was not necessary to support any compelling state interest and narrowly tailored to meet

that interest, it permanently enjoined the enforcement of Amendment 2.FN3 On appeal the

defendants argue that: (1) the legal standard set forth by this Court in Evans I for

assessing the constitutionality of Amendment 2 should be reconsidered; (2) Amendment 2

is supported by several compelling state interests and is narrowly tailored to meet

those interests; (3) that the unconstitutional provisions of Amendment 2 are severable

from the remainder; and (4) Amendment 2 is a valid exercise of state power under the

Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. 

<P>

II Defendants first ask that we reconsider the constitutional principles articulated in

Evans I, but they offer no arguments that were not then considered and rejected by this

court. We see no reason to revisit that decision. We reaffirm our holding that the

constitutionality of Amendment 2 must be determined with reference to the strict

scrutiny standard of review.FN4 III A legislative enactment which infringes on a

fundamental right or which burdens a suspect class is constitutionally permissible only

if it is "necessary to promote a compelling state interest," Dunn v. Blumstein, 405 U.S.

330, 342 (1972), and does so in the least restrictive manner possible. Plyler v. Doe,

457 U.S. 202, 217 (1982). The question of what constitutes a compelling state interest

is one of law and thus, we review the trial court's ruling de novo. League of United

Latin Am. Citizens, Council No. 4434 v. Clements, 986 F.2d 728, 772 n.30 (5th Cir.

1993); Scott v. Rosenberg, 702 F.2d 1263, 1274 (9th Cir. 1983). Defendants argue that

Amendment 2 is supported by a number of compelling state interests and is narrowly

tailored to serve those interests.FN5 A Defendants' first asserted governmental interest

is in protecting the sanctity of religious, familial, and personal privacy. Freedom of

religion is expressly guaranteed by both the First Amendment to the United States

Constitution and article II, section 4 of the Colorado Constitution and stands at the

core of our Nation's history and tradition. It is among the highest values of our

society. See Murdock v. Pennsylvania, 319 U.S. 105, 115-17 (1943). There can be little

doubt that ensuring religious freedom is a compelling governmental interest. 

<P>

Defendants argue that Amendment 2 is necessary to serve this interest because "[u]nder

the ordinances preempted by Amendment 2, individual landlords or employers who have

deep-seated and profound religious objections to homosexuality would nonetheless be

compelled to compromise those convictions, under threat of government sanctions." In

support of this proposition, defendants rely on Smith v. Commission of Fair Employment &

Hous., 30 Cal. Rptr.2d 395 (Cal. App. 3 Dist. 1994). 

<P>

In Smith, the plaintiff challenged the ruling of the California Commission of Fair

Employment and Housing which found that she had impermissibly discriminated, based on

their marital status, against a couple who sought to rent housing. The couple was

unmarried and the plaintiff refused to rent to them on the grounds that doing so would

violate her deeply-held religious beliefs. Plaintiff was ordered to cease and desist

marital discrimination; post a notice announcing her violation of California law for

ninety days; permanently post a notice to rental applicants of their rights and remedies

under California antidiscrimination laws; and sign both notices and provide copies to

each person who subsequently expressed an interest in renting her property. Id. at

397-98. 

<P>

The California court of appeals concluded that the commission's order substantially

burdened plaintiff's free exercise rights because she "cannot remain faithful to her

religious convictions and beliefs and yet rent to unmarried couples." Id. at 399.FN6

Assuming arguendo that ordinances such as that in effect in Boulder, which prohibit

discrimination against gay men, lesbians, and bisexuals in housing and employment but

which contain no exception for religiously-based objections, substantially burden the

religious liberty of those who object to renting or employing gay men, lesbians, or

bisexuals on religious grounds, the enactment of Amendment 2 clearly is not narrowly

tailored to serve the interest of ensuring religious liberty. To the contrary, an

equally effective, and substantially less onerous way of accomplishing that purpose

simply would be to require that antidiscrimination laws which include provisions for

sexual orientation also include exceptions for religiously-based objections. This is

precisely what the Denver antidiscrimination laws provide. Denver, Colo., Rev. Mun. Code

art. IV, Sub Sect. 28-92, 28-93, 28-95 to 28-97 (1992 Supp.). Similar exemptions for

religious organizations are found in federal antidiscrimination statutes. See, e.g., 42

U.S.C. Sect. 2000e-1 (1994 Supp.) (exempting religious organizations from the

prohibition against employment discrimination); 42 U.S.C. Sect. 3607 (1994 Supp.)

(exemption for religious organizations in housing and public accommodation).FN7

Defendants do not, and we doubt that they could, argue that the Denver ordinance impairs

religious freedom. Indeed, Joseph Broadus, who testified as an expert witness on behalf

of the defendants, testified that imposing a religiously-based exemption on

antidiscrimination laws intended to protect gay men, lesbians, and bisexuals would be

less restrictive than Amendment 2 and would adequately address any concerns about

religious liberty. 

<P>

It is clear that Amendment 2, which affects the fundamental right of gay men, lesbians,

and bisexuals to participate equally in the political process, is not the least

restrictive means of ensuring religious liberty, and is not narrowly tailored to serve

the compelling governmental interest in ensuring the free exercise of religion. 

<P>

Defendants also argue that Amendment 2 serves the compelling interest of preserving

"familial privacy." Family privacy is characterized by defendants as the right "of some

parents to teach traditional moral values" to their children. As support, defendants

cite authority recognizing the sanctity of the family and the central role the family

plays in society. See, e.g., <I>Moore v. City of East Cleveland,</I> 431 U.S. 494,

503-04 (1977) ("the Constitution protects the sanctity of the family precisely because

the institution of the family is deeply rooted in this Nation's history and tradition");

Ginsberg v. New York, 390 U.S. 629, 639 (1968) (parental role is "basic in the structure

of our society"). 

<P>

Defendants contend that the "right of familial privacy" is "severely undermine[d]" by

the enactment of antidiscrimination laws protecting gay men, lesbians, and bisexuals

because "[i]f a child hears one thing from his parents and the exact opposite message

from the government, parental authority will inevitably be undermined." This argument

fails because it rests on the assumption that the right of familial privacy engenders an

interest in having government endorse certain values as moral or immoral. While it is

true that parents have a constitutionally protected interest in inculcating their

children with their own values, see <I>Prince v. Massachusetts,</I> 321 U.S. 158, 166

(1944), defendants point to no authority, and we are aware of none, holding that parents

have the corresponding right of insuring that government endorse those values. 

<P>

The United States Supreme Court has repeatedly held that the individual's right to

profess or practice certain moral or religious beliefs does not entail a right to have

government itself reinforce or follow those beliefs or practices. See, e.g., <I>Bowen v.

Roy,</I> 476 U.S. 693, 699 (1986) ("Never to our knowledge has the Court . .. require[d]

the Government itself to behave in ways that the individual believes will further his or

her spiritual development or that of his or her family."). Furthermore, it is clear that

the government does not burden an individual's constitutional rights merely because it

endorses views with which that individual may disagree. See <I>Block v. Meese,</I> 793

F.2d 1303, 1312-14 (D.C. Cir. 1986) (then Judge Scalia concluding that "[a] rule

excluding official praise or criticism of ideas would lead to the strange conclusion

that it is permissible for the government to prohibit racial discrimination, but not to

criticize racial bias; to criminalize polygamy, but not to praise the monogamous family

. .. ."). Id. at 1313. 

<P>

Consequently, fully recognizing that parents have a "privacy" right to instruct their

children that homosexuality is immoral, we find that nothing in the laws or policies

which Amendment 2 is intended to prohibit interferes with that right. With or without

Amendment 2, parents retain full authority to express their views about homosexuality to

their children. We believe that Amendment 2 is neither necessary nor narrowly tailored

to preserve familial privacy because that right is not implicated by the laws and

policies which Amendment 2 proscribes. 

<P>

Defendants also argue that Amendment 2 serves the compelling state interest in

preserving "personal privacy." While it is not entirely clear what is meant by the

phrase, it appears that the defendants are referring to the right of "associational

privacy" which will be impaired in the absence of Amendment 2 because individuals may be

forced to associate with gay men, lesbians, and bisexuals in the rental of housing.FN8

As the Supreme Court has explained, the right of associational privacy protects

associations involving, deep attachments and commitments to the necessarily few other

individuals with whom one shares not only a special community of thoughts, experiences,

and beliefs but also distinctively personal aspects of one's life. ...[T]hey are

distinguished by such attributes as relative smallness, a high degree of selectivity in

the decisions to begin and maintain the affiliation, and seclusion from others in

critical aspects of the relationship. As a general matter, only relationships with these

sorts of qualities are likely to reflect the considerations that have led to an

understanding of freedom of association as an intrinsic element of personal liberty. 

<P>

<I>Roberts v. United States Jaycees,</I> 468 U.S. 609, 620 (1984). 

<P>

While preserving associational privacy may rise to the level of a compelling state

interest, Amendment 2 is not narrowly tailored to serve that interest. Amendment 2 would

forbid governmental entities from prohibiting discrimination against gay men, lesbians,

and bisexuals (because they are gay, lesbian, or bisexual) in all aspects of commercial

and public life, no matter how impersonal. Amendment 2 affects a vast array of

affiliations which in no way implicate associational privacy. None of the criteria

needed to precipitate associational privacy rights exists: there is no "special

community" distinguished by "selectivity," "relative smallness," or any concern with

"distinctively personal aspects of one's life." Id. 

<P>

[A]n association lacking these qualities -- such as a large business enterprise -- seems

remote from the concerns giving rise to this constitutional protection. Accordingly, the

Constitution undoubtedly imposes constraints on the State's power to control the

selection of one's spouse that would not apply to regulations affecting the choice of

one's fellow employees. 

<P>

Id. (citing <I>Loving v. Virginia,</I> 388 U.S. 1, 12 (1967) and <I>Railway Mail Ass'n

v. Corsi,</I> 326 U.S. 88, 93-94 (1945)). 



To the extent that antidiscrimination laws protecting gay men, lesbians, and bisexuals

have the potential to implicate associational privacy rights, a narrower way of avoiding

this conflict would be to exempt the sort of intimate associations identified in Roberts

from the scope of such laws. For instance, landlords could be allowed to discriminate

against homosexuals in the rental of owner-occupied housing -- the so-called "Mrs.

Murphy's Boarding House" exception. See, e.g., Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. Sect. 3603(b)

(1988 & 1994 Supp.) (exempting certain owneroccupied housing from the Fair Housing Act);

Statutory History of the United States: Civil Rights, Part II 1741-52, 1805-06 (B.

Schwartz ed. 1970) (detailing legislative history and policies underlying "Mrs. Murphy's

Boarding House" exemption in Fair Housing Act). Similar exemptions already exist under

Colorado law. For instance, Denver's antidiscrimination ordinance exempts from its

housing and public accommodation provisions multiple unit dwellings of not more than two

units where one of the units is owner occupied. Denver, Colo., Rev. Mun. Code art. IV,

Sub Sect. 2895(b)(2) & 28-96(b)(2) (1991). Similarly, the Colorado Civil Rights statute

exempts from the definition of "housing" any room offered for rent or lease in a

single-family dwelling occupied in part by the owner. Sect. 24-34 -501(2), 10A C.R.S.

(1988). 

<P>

Amendment 2, however, does no such thing. Rather, it prohibits governmental entities

from enacting laws barring discrimination against gay men, lesbians, and bisexuals in

all contexts, regardless of the nature of the relationship involved and the extent of

intimacy inherent in those relationships. Amendment 2 sweeps more broadly than necessary

and is not narrowly tailored to serve the governmental interest in preserving

associational privacy. 

<P>

B Defendants next assert that because "laws and policies designed to benefit homosexuals

and bisexuals have an adverse effect on the ability of state and local governments to

combat discrimination against suspect classes. ...Amendment 2 is an appropriate means

whereby the people sought to focus government's limited resources upon those

circumstances most warranting attention." In short, defendants take the position that

Amendment 2 serves the compelling governmental interest in seeing that limited resources

are dedicated to the enforcement of civil rights laws intended to protect suspect

classes rather than having a portion of those resources diverted to the enforcement of

laws intended to protect gay men, lesbians, and bisexuals. 

<P>

It is well-settled that the preservation of fiscal resources, administrative

convenience, and the reduction of the workload of governmental bodies are not compelling

state interests. See, e.g., <I>Reed v. Reed,</I> 404 U.S. 71, 76-77 (1971) (interest of

"reducing case-load of probate courts" is not weighty enough to survive even heightened

scrutiny); <I>Shapiro v. Thompson,</I> 394 U.S. 618, 633 (1969); <I>Vlandis v.

Kline,</I> 412 U.S. 441, 458-59 (1973) (it is "obvious . .. that, as the Court's

assessment of the weight and value of the individual interest escalates, the less likely

it is that mere administrative convenience and avoidance of hearings or investigations

will be sufficient to justify what otherwise would appear to be irrational

discriminations.") (White, J., concurring). 

<P>

Consequently, we conclude that defendants' asserted interest in preserving the fiscal

resources of state and local governments for the exclusive use of enforcing civil rights

laws intended to protect suspect classes does not constitute a compelling state

interest. 

<P>

Assuming that the state has some legitimate interest in preserving fiscal resources for

the enforcement of civil rights laws intended to protect suspect classes, and

recognizing that combating discrimination against racial minorities and women may

constitute a compelling governmental interest, see <I>Roberts v. United States

Jaycees,</I> 468 U.S. 609, 623 (1984), the evidence presented indicates that Amendment 2

is not necessary to achieve these goals.FN9 The chief enforcement officer for Denver's

antidiscrimination ordinance testified that Denver's protection of gay men, lesbians,

and bisexuals has not prevented Denver from protecting other groups or had any

significant fiscal impact on Denver. The chief of Wisconsin's Civil Rights Bureau

testified, based on twelve years experience with Wisconsin's enforcement of its

antidiscrimination laws, that protection of gay, lesbian, and bisexual persons has not

limited enforcement of other parts of the Wisconsin statutes. The trial court found that

protecting gay men, lesbians, and bisexuals from discrimination "has not increased costs

or impaired the enforcement of other civil rights statues or ordinances."FN10 This

finding is supported by the record and substantiates the conclusion that Amendment 2 is

not necessary to serve the governmental interest asserted. 

<P>

Even if protecting gay men, lesbians, and bisexuals from discrimination has some fiscal

impact on the state, Amendment 2 is not narrowly tailored to serve that interest.

Ensuring that certain racial, gender, or ethnic groups receive undiminished funds for

civil rights enforcement could easily be accomplished by ear-marking funds to cover the

costs of such enforcement. Under such an arrangement, any protection for gay men,

lesbians, and bisexuals would have to be funded from sources other than funds reserved

for the protection of the specified suspect classes. The governmental interest in

insuring adequate resources for the enforcement of civil rights laws designed to protect

suspect classes from discrimination need not be accomplished by denying the right of gay

men, lesbians, and bisexuals from participating equally in the political process.

Rather, this interest can be served in such way that no persons' fundamental rights need

be denied. 

<P>

The defendants' second asserted governmental interest in support of Amendment 2 is

neither necessary nor narrowly tailored to serve that interest. 

<P>

C Defendants next argue that Amendment 2 "promotes the compelling governmental interest

of allowing the people themselves to establish public social and moral norms."FN11 In

support of this proposition, defendants define two related norms which are promoted by

Amendment 2: Amendment 2 preserves heterosexual families and heterosexual marriage and,

more generally, it sends the societal message condemning gay men, lesbians, and

bisexuals as immoral. 

<P>

The only authority relied on to support the view that the protection of morality

constitutes a compelling governmental interest is Barnes v. Glen Theater, Inc., 501 U.S.

560 (1991). Defendants cite the plurality opinion in Barnes for the proposition that

"the State's interest in protecting order and morality is compelling; substantial;

subordinating; paramount; cogent; strong." Barnes does not support defendants'

contention that protecting public morality constitutes a compelling governmental

interest. 

<P>

In Barnes, four Justices held that "the public indecency statute order and morality."

Barnes, 501 U.S. at 567 (emphasis added). Justice Souter provided the fifth vote in

Barnes, however he did not rely "on the possible sufficiency of society's moral views to

justify the limitations at issue." Id. at 582 (Souter, J., concurring). Rather, he was

of the opinion that the Indiana law at issue (which prohibited completely nude dancing)

was permissible due to the "State's substantial interest in combating the secondary

effects of adult entertainment establishments . ..." Id. None of the justices in Barnes

concluded that furthering public morality constitutes a compelling state interest. 

<P>

Consequently, defendants have cited no authority to support the proposition that the

promotion of public morality constitutes a compelling governmental interest, and we are

aware of none. At the most, this interest is substantial. However, a substantial

governmental interest is not sufficient to render constitutional a law which infringes

on a fundamental right -- the interest must be compelling. See <I>Plyler v. Doe,</I> 457

U.S 202, 217 (1982). 

<P>

Furthermore, even recognizing the legitimacy of promoting public morals as a

governmental interest, it is clear to us that Amendment 2 is not necessary to preserve

heterosexual families, marriage, or to express disapproval of gay men, lesbians, and

bisexuals. First, we reject defendants' suggestion that laws prohibiting discrimination

against gay men, lesbians, and bisexuals will undermine marriimages and heterosexual

families because married heterosexuals will "choose" to "become homosexual" if

discrimination against homosexuals is prohibited. This assertion flies in the face of

the empirical evidence presented at trial on marriage and divorce rates. For example,

Wisconsin, the state with the oldest "gay rights" law in the nation, enacted in 1982,

reports that the divorce rate in Wisconsin declined after the enactment of its

antidiscrimination statute. See Center for Health Statistics, Division of Health,

Wisconsin Dep't of Health & Social Services, 1990 Wisconsin Vital Statistics Report, at

p. 93, Figure 13 (divorce rates in Wisconsin peak at 3.9 divorces per 1,000 population

in 1981 and decline thereafter to 3.6 divorces per 1,000 population in 1990). 

<P>

Defendants also argue that the "endorsement" of homosexuality undermines marriage and

heterosexual families because antidiscrimination laws implicitly endorse that conduct

which is deemed an improper basis for discrimination. We are of the opinion, however,

that antidiscrimination laws make no assumptions about the morality of protected classes

-- they simply recognize that certain characteristics, be they moral or immoral -- have

no relevance in enumerated commercial contexts. For instance, it is difficult to imagine

how a law which prohibits employers from discriminating against anyone engaged in

off-duty, legal conduct such as smoking tobacco, see Sect. 24-34402.5, 10A C.R.S. (1994

Supp.), constitutes an endorsement of smoking. 

<P>

In short, prohibitions on discrimination against gay men, lesbians, and bisexuals do not

imply an endorsement of any particular sexual orientation or practices. To the contrary,

prohibitions on discrimination imply at most that termination of employment, eviction or

denial of rental opportunities, denial of insurance coverage, and other sanctions in

commercial contexts based on sexual orientation are not appropriate ways of advancing

even valid moral beliefs. 

<P>

Accordingly, we reject defendants' third asserted interest as a basis for finding that

Amendment 2 is constitutionally valid. 

<P>

D Defendants contend that Amendment 2 "prevents government from supporting the political

objectives of a special interest group." The only argument offered to substantiate the

contention that this is a compelling state interest is the following observation from

Lyng v. International Union, 485 U.S. 360, 369 (1988): "[A]t the heart of the First

Amendment is the notion that an individual should be free to believe as he will, and

that in a free society one's beliefs should be shaped by his mind and his conscience

rather than coerced by the State." (quoting Abood v. Detroit Bd. of Educ., 431 U.S. 209,

234-45 (1977)). 

<P>

Defendants do not claim that the laws which Amendment 2 is intended to prohibit

constitute an infringement on the First Amendment liberties identified in Lyng.

Similarly, they do not take the position that those laws amount to a "coerc[ion] by the

State" to believe anything. Rather, they assert that the laws which Amendment 2 is

intended to prohibit constitute an implicit endorsement of homosexuality and that this

somehow vitiates the right of individuals "to make their own judgments on this question

. ..." As explained above, however, we do not believe that antidiscrimination laws

constitute an endorsement of the characteristics that are deemed an unlawful basis upon

which to discriminate against individuals. See infra pp. 25-26. 

<P>

More significantly, defendants offer no authority to support the rather remarkable

proposition that the government has a compelling interest in seeing that the state does

not support the political objectives of a "special interest group."  The state exists

for the very purpose of implementing the political objectives of the governed so long as

that can be done consistently with the constitution. The fact that some political

objectives are promoted by "special interest groups" is utterly inconsequential. Indeed,

virtually any law could be regarded as a benefit to a "special interest group."  If

defendants' argument had any merit at all, the compelling state interest defined would

justify striking down almost any legislative enactment imaginable. This is clearly not

the law. No citation of authority is needed to make the point. 

<P>

We reject defendants' assertion that Amendment 2 is justified by the compelling

governmental interest in not having the state endorse the political objectives of a

special interest group. 

<P>

E Defendants claim that Amendment 2 "serves to deter factionalism through ensuring that

decisions regarding special protections for homosexuals and bisexuals are made at the

highest level of government."  More specifically, they argue that "Amendment 2 is

intended, not to restrain the competition of ideas," but "seeks to ensure that the

deeply divisive issue of homosexuality's place in our society does not serve to fragment

Colorado's body politic." Amendment 2 accomplishes this end by eliminating "city-by-city

and county-by-county battles over this issue." We reject the argument that the interest

in deterring factionalism, as defined by defendants, is compelling. Political debate,

even if characterized as "factionalism," is not an evil which the state has a legitimate

interest in deterring but rather, constitutes the foundation of democracy. "[T]here is

no significant state or public interest in curtailing debate or discussion of a ballot

measure."  <I>Citizens Against Rent Control v. City of Berkeley,</I> 454 U.S. 290, 299

(1981). See also <I>Williams v. Rhodes,</I> 393 U.S. 23, 32 (1968). We fail to see how

the state, which is charged with serving the will of the people, can have any legitimate

interest in preventing one side of a controversial debate from pressing its case before

governmental bodies simply because it would prefer to avoid political controversy or

"factionalism."  See Police Dep't of <I>Chicago v. Mosley,</I> 408 U.S. 92, 96 (1972)

("government may not grant the use of a forum to people whose views it finds acceptable,

but deny use to those wishing to express less favored or more controversial views"). 

<P>

In support of the asserted compelling interest in deterring factionalism, defendants

rely on Storer v. Brown, 415 U.S. 724 (1974). Storer involved a state requirement that

proponents of any viewpoint resign from political parties and not run in those parties'

primaries if the proponents intend to run as independent candidates. The purpose of this

neutral election procedure was to insure that independent candidates were more than

merely sore losers who, having lost one primary, ran as "independents" to satisfy

"short-range political goals, pique, or personal quarrel."  Id. at 735. 

<P>

Neither Storer, nor any other case we are aware of supports the proposition that there

is a compelling governmental interest in preventing divisive issues from being debated

at all levels of government by prohibiting one side of the debate from seeking desirable

legislation in those fora. We conclude that the interest in deterring "factionalism" is

not a compelling state interest. 

<P>

F Defendants argue that each of the governmental interests, while individually adequate

to validate Amendment 2, "are especially so when considered in the aggregate."  None of

the interests identified by the state is a necessary, compelling governmental interest

which Amendment 2 is narrowly tailored to advance. Lumping them together as one

grandiose (and rather illdefined) interest makes them no more necessary, compelling, or

narrowly tailored. In this context, the whole is equal, and is as equally deficient as

the sum of its parts. 

<P>

IV Defendants next argue that the provisions of Amendment 2 are severable and that only

those provisions pertaining to "sexual orientation" should be stricken as

unconstitutional: "Plaintiffs have only challenged . ..the question of sexual

orientation. They have not claimed or made any suggestion that Amendment 2's

restrictions concerning homosexual or bisexual conduct, practices, and relationships are

in any way constitutionally suspect." In so arguing, defendants not only mischaracterize

plaintiffs' position, but fundamentally misconstrue the intent of Amendment 2. In Evans

I, we held that Amendment 2 had been shown to a reasonable probability to be

unconstitutional on the grounds that it affected "the fundamental right to participate

equally in the political process . ...by 'fencing out' an independently identifiable

class of persons . 

<P>

recognized in Evans I was not limited to sexual orientation as opposed to restrictions

concerning homosexual or bisexual conduct, practices, and relationships. To the

contrary, it was based on the fact that Amendment 2 sought to deny an independently

identifiable group's right to participate equally in the political process. 

<P>

"Whether unconstitutional provisions are excised from an otherwise sound law depends on

two factors: (1) the autonomy of the portions remaining after the defective provisions

have been deleted and (2) the intent of the enacting legislative body." <I>Robertson v.

City and County of Denver,</I> 874 P.2d 325, 335 (Colo. 1994) (quoting City of

<I>Lakewood v. Colfax Unlimited Ass'n, Inc.,</I> 634 P.2d 52, 70 (Colo. 1981)). 

<P>

We hold that the portions of Amendment 2 that would remain if only the provision

concerning sexual orientation were stricken are not autonomous and thus, not severable.

In addition to denying the right of equal participation in the political process to a

group based on sexual orientation, Amendment 2 also is intended to deny that same right

to persons based on "homosexual, lesbian or bisexual . ..conduct, practices or

relationships . . .." Amendment 2 targets this class of persons based on four

characteristics: sexual orientation; conduct; practices, and relationships. Each

characteristic provides a potentially different way of identifying that class of persons

who are gay, lesbian, or bisexual. These four characteristics are not truly severable

from one another because each provides nothing more than a different way of identifying

the same class of persons. 

<P>

The fact that there is no constitutionally recognized right to engage in homosexual

sodomy, see Bowers v. Hardwick, 478 U.S. 186 (1986), is irrelevant. Amendment 2 by no

stretch of the imagination seeks to criminalize homosexual sodomy. While it is true that

such a law could be passed and found constitutional under the United States'

constitution, it does not follow from that fact that denying the right of an

identifiable group (who may or may not engage in homosexual sodomy) to participate

equally in the political process is also constitutionally permissible. The government's

ability to criminalize certain conduct does not justify a corresponding abatement of an

independent fundamental right. 

<P>

V Last, defendants argue that even if Amendment 2 is in conflict with the Fourteenth

Amendment to the United States Constitution, it is nevertheless a constitutionally valid

exercise of the people's reserved powers under the Tenth Amendment.FN12  In short, the

argument is that the power to amend the state constitution is reserved to Colorado's

voters under the Tenth Amendment, and even if the voters amend the state constitution in

such a way as to violate the federal constitution, such an amendment is per se valid. 

<P>

In support of this argument, defendants rely on <I>Gregory v. 

Ashcroft,</I> 501 U.S. 452 (1991). In Gregory, the Supreme Court held that the Age

Discrimination in Employment Act does not apply to state court judges. In reaching this

conclusion, the Court noted that decisions concerning the necessary qualification of

state court judges "is a decision of the most fundamental sort for a sovereign entity.

Through the structure of its government and the character of those who exercise

government authority, a state defines itself as a sovereign."  Id. at 460. The court

concluded that "Congressional interference with this decision of the people of Missouri,

defining their constitutional officers, would upset the usual constitutional balance of

federal and state powers."  Id. (emphasis added). 

<P>

Gregory applies only to cases involving federal interference with the qualification of

constitutional officers. See, e.g.,<I> Equal Employment Opportunity Comm'n v.

Massachusetts,</I> 987 F.2d 64, 68-69 (1st Cir. 1993) (Gregory applies only when federal

law interferes with state's definition of policy-making officials'qualifications);

<I>Tranello v. Frey, </I>962 F.2d 244, 249 (2d Cir. 1992) (same); <I>May v. Arkansas

Forestry Comm'n,</I> 993 F.2d 632,  63536 (8th Cir. 1993) (same); <I>Associated Builders

& Contractors v. Perry,</I> 817 F. Supp. 49, 53 n.3 (E.D. Mich. 1992) (same). 

<P>

States have no compelling interest in amending their constitution in ways that violate

fundamental federal rights. <I>Reitman v. Mulkey,</I> 387 U.S. 369 (1967) (no reserved

power to make right to discriminate a part of the state's basic charter); <I>Lucas v.

Colorado Gen.Assembly,</I> 377 U.S. 713, 736-37 (1964) ("A citizen's constitutional

rights can hardly be infringed simply because a majority of the people choose that it

be."). 

<P>

We reject defendants' argument that Amendment 2 is a constitutionally valid exercise of

state power under the Tenth Amendment. 

<P>

VI The state has failed to establish that Amendment 2 is necessary to serve any

compelling governmental interest in a narrowly tailored way. Amendment 2 is not

severable and not a valid exercise of state power under the Tenth Amendment.

Accordingly, we affirm the trial court's entry of a permanent injunction barring its

enforcement. 



<H4>JUSTICE SCOTT concurs. JUSTICE ERICKSON dissents.</H4> 



<B>JUSTICE SCOTT concurring:</B>

<P><blockquote>

I agree with the majority and join in its opinion and judgment. Amendment 2 is

unconstitutional because it offends the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth

Amendment of the United States Constitution. I write separately, nevertheless, to

suggest that Amendment 2 impermissibly burdens the right "peaceably to assemble and

petition the government for redress of grievances," a right guaranteed to every citizen.

Hence, the district court's permanent injunction should be upheld under the Privileges

or Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. 

<P>

I Citizenship, not the good graces of the electorate, is the currency of our republican

form of government. Over 130 years ago, this nation was engaged in a great Civil War

which tested our constitutional form of government as has no other time in our history.

That great battle, joined to address issues of slavery and race, actually resolved much

more. History teaches us that, in fact, our nation addressed a question of paramount

importance: 

<P>

whether any state may, by legislative enactment or popular referendum, deny or refute

the Union of the several states and render asunder the bonds of our constitutional form

of government. Although answered at Appomatox, today we are called upon to answer, if

not resolve, that question once more. 

<P>

The federal Constitution, as submitted to the various states, created certain rights

which the states cannot diminish. By joining the Union, Colorado "cannot be viewed as a

single, unconnected, sovereign power, on [which] . ..no other restrictions are imposed

than may be found in its own Constitution."  <I>Fletcher v. Peck,</I> 10 U.S. (6 Cranch)

85, 135 (1810). Writing for the court in Fletcher, Chief Justice Marshall opined that

each state "is a part of a large empire, . ..is a member of the American Union; and that

Union has a constitution, the supremacy of which all acknowledge, and which imposes

limits to . ..the several states, which none claim a right to pass."  Id. Thus, within

the limits of state sovreignty, most important questions are decided by the electorate.

However, those matters in which the result intrudes upon a protected liberty or

fundamental right cannot be determined in the voting booth. 

<P>

The framers originally recognized this potential for harm and understood that not every

issue can be resolved by the vote of a majority. In The Federalist Papers, James Madison

identified the covenant of "a well constructed Union" as its promise to protect and

preserve inviolate certain rights of all citizens. The Federalist No. 10, at 42 (J.

Madison) (Wills 1982). Madison noted that under other forms of government, "measures are

too often decided, not according to the rules of justice, and the rights of the minor

party; but by the superior force of an interested and over-bearing majority."  Id. at

43. Madison further stated: 

<P>

The interest of the man must be connected with the constitutional rights of the place .

...If men were angels, no government would be necessary. If angels were to govern men,

neither external nor internal controuls on government would be necessary. In framing a

government which is to be administered by men over men, the great difficulty lies in

this: You must first enable the government to control the governed; and in the next

place, oblige it to controul itself. 



<P>

It is of great importance in a republic, not only to guard the society against the

oppression of its rulers; but to guard one part of the society against the injustice of

the other part. 

<P>

Id., No. 51, at 262 & 264. Appropriately, Madison suggested, the "cure" rests in a

republican form of government -- a Union in which there is a "tendency to break and

control the violence of faction." Id., No. 10 at 42. The obligation to "guard one part

of the society against the injustice of the other part" exists whether the oppressive

act is the result of referendum or other state action. Hence, every individual is

promised full citizenship under a written Constitution which, as Justice Harlan opined,

"neither knows nor tolerates classes among citizens." <I>Plessy v. Ferguson,</I> 163

U.S. 537, 559 (1895) (Harlan, J., dissenting). 

<P>

Judge Robert Bork, addressing the same covenant, wrote of what he referred to as the

"Madisonian dilemma," stating: 

<P>

The United States was founded as a Madisonian system, which means that it contains two

opposing principles that must be continually reconciled. The first principle is  self

government, which means that in wide areas of life majorities are entitled to rule, if

they wish, simply because they are majorities. The second is that there are nonetheless

some things majorities must not do to minorities, some areas of life in which the

individual must be free of majority rule. The dilemma is that neither majorities nor

minorities can be trusted to define the proper spheres of democratic authority and

individual liberty. To place that power in one or the other would risk either tyranny by

the majority or tyranny by the minority. 

<P>

Robert H. Bork, The Tempting of America: The Political Seduction of the Law 139 (1990)

(hereinafter "Bork"). Such a dilemma can only be resolved by resort to a neutral written

principal, the Constitution. We should look first to the text and to the understanding

manifested in the words used by the framers. <I>McCulloch v. Maryland,</I> 17 U.S. (4

Wheat.) 316, 421 (1819) (let the end be "within the scope of the constitution, and all

means which are appropriate . ..which are not prohibited, but consist with the letter

and spirit of the constitution, are constitutional"); <I>Colorado Ass'n of Public

Employees v. Lamm,</I> 677 P.2d 1350, 1353 (Colo. 1984) ("Where the language of the

constitution is plain and its meaning clear, that language must be declared and enforced

as written."); see also Bork at 145 ("If the Constitution is law, then presumably, like

all other law, the meaning the lawmakers intended is as binding upon judges as it is

upon legislatures and executives."). Where the words of the Constitution are

unambiguous, we need not look further. 

<p>

II A Section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution declares:

"All persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction

thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No

State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of

citizens of the United States . ..."  U.S. Const. amend XIV, section 1.FN13  The

Fourteenth Amendment, in section 1, made state citizenship derivative of national

citizenship and transferred to the federal government a portion of each state's control

over civil and political rights.FN14 By the force of an unfortunate history and a

refusal to rely upon the plain text of the constitution, our Fourteenth Amendment

jurisprudence has resulted in a Privileges or Immunities Clause that has been eclipsed

by the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses. As a consequence, no important line of

decision rests solely on the Privileges or Immunities Clause. Early on, in fact, the

original understanding was virtually written out of the Constitution by the United

States Supreme Court in the  SlaughterHouse Cases, 83 U.S. (16 Wall.) 36 (1873). 

<P>

In the Slaughter-House Cases, decided in 1873, a majority of the Court acknowledged the

Privileges or Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, but limited its effects to

those rights earlier existing under Article IV, without recognizing the creation of a

new national citizenship. In his opinion for the Court in Slaughter-House Cases, Justice

Miller declared that the rights conferred by national citizenship were those "which owe

their existence to the Federal government, its National character, its Constitution, or

its laws."FN15  83 U.S. (16 Wall.) at 79. A review of the legislative history, however,

will not permit such an ambivalent view.FN16  The statements of the framers of the

Fourteenth Amendment, Senator Howard and Representative Bingham, confirm that the

Privileges or Immunities Clause was originally intended to confer and make inviolate

certain minimal rights embodied in national citizenship.FN17 B The Fourteenth Amendment

Privileges or Immunities Clause was patterned after a similar clause in Article IV,

Section 2.FN18 The Fourteenth Amendment Clause was thought by its framers to be one of

the central elements of section 1. Cong. Globe, 39th Cong., 1st Sess., part 3, p. 2765

(1866) ("This is the first clause, and I regard it as very important.") (statement of

Senator Howard); see generally John H. Ely, Democracy and Distrust 22 (1980)

(hereinafter "Ely"); John Harrison, Reconstructing the Privileges or Immunities Clause,

101 Yale L.J. 1385 (1992). 

<P>

The Article IV Privileges and Immunities Clause imposes substantive limits upon the

states. <I>Corfield v. Coryell,</I> 6 F. Cas. 546 (No. 3230) (C.C.E.D.Pa. 1825). In

Corfield, Justice Washington held that this clause protected against state action the

privileges "which are, in their very nature, fundamental; which belong, of right, to the

citizens of all free governments."FN19  Corfield, 6 F. Cas. at 551. Washington went on

to state: 

<P>

What these fundamental privileges are, it would perhaps be more tedious than difficult

to enumerate. They may, however, be all comprehended under the following general heads:

Protection by the government; the enjoyment of life and liberty, with the right to

acquire and possess property of every kind, and to pursue and obtain happiness and

safety; subject nevertheless to such restraints as the government may justly prescribe

for the general good of the whole. 

<P>

Id. at 551-52.

<P>

It was this opinion which became the pole star for Representative Bingham and Senator

Howard, the framers of the Fourteenth Amendment. Presenting the Fourteenth Amendment to

the Senate, Senator Howard disclosed "the views and the motives which influenced that

committee," stating: 

<P>

To [the privileges and immunities listed in Corfield], whatever they may be -- for they

are not and cannot be fully defined in their entire extent and precise nature -- to

these should be added the personal rights guarantied and secured by the first eight

amendments of the Constitution; such as the freedom of speech and of the press; the

right of the people peaceably to assemble and petition the Government for a redress of

grievances, a right appertaining to each and all the people; the right to keep and to

bear arms; the right to be exempted from the quartering of soldiers in a house without

the consent of the owner; the right to be exempt from unreasonable searches and

seizures, and from any search and seizure except by virtue of a warrant issued upon a

formal oath or affidavit; the right of an accused person to be informed of the nature of

the accusation against him, and his right to be tried by an impartial jury of the

vicinage; and also the right to be secure against excessive bail and against cruel and

unusual punishments. 

<P>

decision of our courts and the present settled doctrine is, that all these immunities,

privileges, rights, thus guarantied by the Constitution or recognized by it, are secured

to the citizen solely as a citizen of the United States and as a party in their courts.

.. therefore, to restrain the power of the States and compel them at all times to

respect these great fundamental guarantees. 

<P>

Cong. Globe, 39th Cong., 1st Sess., part 3, pp. 2765-66 (1866) (emphasis added).<P> 



Senator Howard's list of privileges or immunities, which incorporated Corfield, was

representative rather than exhaustive. No case has ever attempted to identify the

totality of implied federal rights guaranteed by the Privileges or Immunities clause.

However, in <I>Twining v. New Jersey,</I> 211 U.S. 78 (1908), the Supreme Court did

provide a list of privileges or immunities which it ecognized: (1) the right to pass

freely from state to state;FN20 (2) the right to petition Congress for redress of

grievances; (3) the right to vote for national officers; (4) the right to enter the

public lands; (5) the right to be protected against violence while in the lawful custody

of a United States Marshal; and (6) the right to inform United States authorities of

violation of its laws. Twining, 211 U.S. at 97. These rights of national citizenship

receive absolute protection in the sense that the states never could have a legitimate

interest in terminating completely any of these rights. Rotunda & Nowac, Treatise on

Constitutional Law 351 (2d ed. 1992). 

<P>

III The United States Supreme Court has repeatedly held that the right to vote is

fundamental to the rights of citizenship and to a free and democratic society. <I>Burson

v. Freeman,</I> 112 S. Ct. 1846, 1859 (1992); <I>Reynolds v. Sims,</I> 377 U.S. 533,

561-62 (1963); Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U.S. 356, 371 (1886). In Evans I, we held the

right to participate equally in the political process to be a fundamental right.

<I>Evans v. Romer,</I> 854 P.2d 1270, 1282 (Colo. 1993).FN21 By "participate equally,"

although not assuring any political result, we did contemplate the right of the people

peaceably to assemble andpetition the government for a redress of grievances. This right

to participate, an attribute of the new national citizenship, was meant by the framers

of the Fourteenth Amendment to be a personal right guaranteed and secured by the

Privileges or Immunities Clause. See Cong. Globe, 39th Cong., 1st Sess., part 3, pp.

2765 -66 (1866). 

<P>

It should be axiomatic that the right peaceably to assemble and petition government

implies the ability of the duly elected representatives to respond, if so persuaded or

predisposed. Yet, if enforced, Amendment 2 provides that the state, acting "through any

of its branches or departments, or any of its agencies, political subdivisions,

municipalities or school districts," shall not "enact, adopt or enforce any statute,

regulation, ordinance or policy" granting to citizens a "claim of discrimination" based

on homosexual or lesbian status or sexual orientation. Because it would prevent the

General Assembly or other legislative bodies from enacting or adopting certain new laws

and bar the executive department and its agencies from enforcing existing laws,

Amendment 2 effectively denies the right to petition or participate in the political

process by voiding, ab initio, redress from discrimination. Like the right to vote which

assumes the right to have one's vote counted, the right peaceably to assemble and

petition is meaningless if by law government is powerless to act. 

<P>

IV Courts have been reluctant to develop a working constitutional analysis under the

Privileges or Immunities Clause since the Slaughter-House Cases, and, unfortunately,

have instead built upon the Equal Protection Clause and Due Process Clause. The Equal

Protection Clause, burdened by a history and analysis beyond this context,FN22 is not

the most appropriate of the Fourteenth Amendment provisions for securing the right to

participate equally in the political process and yet it is the primary mode of analysis

relied upon by the majority in this case.FN23 Certainly all must now agree that the

Fourteenth Amendment sought to protect citizens from oppression by state government. The

Equal Protection Clause of that amendment mandates that rights afforded to some are

granted equally to all. See Steven J. Heyman, The First Duty of Government: Protection,

Liberty and the Fourteenth Amendment, 41 Duke L.J. 507 (1991). From time to time the

acts of government intervene in the lives of its citizens.FN24 Under the Equal

Protection Doctrine, such government intervention is subjected to review, applying at

least one of three standards: strict scrutiny, intermediate review, or rational basis

analysis. The applicable standard of review to be applied depends upon the

characteristics or attributes of the citizens involved. Under the Equal Protection

Doctrine, when such governmental intervention occurs, such as with the enactment of

Amendment 2 in this case, regardless of the standard applied, it is contemplated that

certain abridgements of even fundamental rights are acceptable. For example, under the

strict scrutiny test, the most exacting standard and that applied by the majority, state

action is "constitutionally permissible [] if it is 'necessary to promote a compelling

state interest,' and [the state] does so in the least restrictive manner possible." Maj.

op. at 10 (citations omitted) (emphasis in original). 

<P>

Unlike the Equal Protection Clause, the Privileges or Immunities Clause guarantees

citizens that certain fundamental rights of national citizenship are inviolate, absent

due process.FN25 The syntax of the Fourteenth Amendment Clause seems inescapably that of

substantive entitlement. According to Ely, "the slightest attention to language will

indicate that it is the Equal Protection Clause that follows the command of equality

strategy, while the Privileges or Immunities Clause proceeds by purporting to extend to

everyone a set of entitlements." Ely at 24. The importance of the Privileges or

Immunities Clause is that it does not require varying standards of review and that its

protections are extended to every citizen. 

<P>

V Under Amendment 2, the rights of citizens "peaceably to assemble and petition the

government for a redress of grievances" so as to participate freely and equally in the

political process are compromised in a manner prohibited by the Fourteenth Amendment.

Because these political rights are fundamental and inherent in national citizenship they

are protected by the Privileges or Immunities Clause. Accordingly, I concur. 

</blockquote>

<B>JUSTICE ERICKSON dissenting:</B>

<blockquote>

I respectfully dissent. In <I>Evans v. Romer,</I> 854 P.2d 1270 (Colo.) (Evans I), cert.

denied, 114 S. Ct. 419 (1993), the majority crafted a new fundamental right that had

never been recognized by the United States Supreme Court or by any court other than a

federal district court in Ohio that relied on Evans I. Ironically, judicial review of

Amendment 2 has accomplished exactly what the voters who passed Amendment 2 sought to

prevent -- the majority has effectively created a heightened protection for homosexuals,

lesbians, and bisexuals.																																			 

<P>

In establishing what is essentially a new substantive due process right disguised as a

previously unrecognized "fundamental right," the majority disregarded the warnings of

Chief Justice Burger, who stated in his dissent to <I>Plyler v. Doe,</I> 457 U.S. 202,

244 (1982): "If ever a court was guilty of an unabashedly result-oriented approach, this

case is a prime example." Chief Justice Burger stated: 

<P>

Were it our business to set the Nation's social policy, I would agree without hesitation

that it is senseless for an enlightened society to deprive any children -- including

illegal aliens -- of an elementary education. ...However, the Constitution does not

constitute us as "Platonic Guardians" nor does it vest in this Court the authority to

strike down laws because they do not meet our standards of desirable social policy,

"wisdom," or "common sense." We trespass on the assigned function of the political

branches under our structure of limited and separated powers when we assume a

policymaking role as the Court does today. 

<P>

Id. at 242 (citations omitted).

<P>

The majority opinion has overlooked a crucial aspect of the case before us: we are not

evaluating an act of the legislature or pronouncement of the executive -- we are

reviewing a constitutional amendment adopted by the people of the State of Colorado.

While there are certainly some initiated constitutional amendments that a majority of

the electorate may attempt to visit on a minority that will not pass constitutional

scrutiny, we must not ignore the fact that we are reviewing the expressed will of the

citizens of this state. 

<P>

In Evans I, we remanded the case to the district court to determine whether the

preliminary injunction sustained by a majority of this court should be made permanent.

The district court, following Evans I with great precision, made extensive findings and

made the preliminary injunction permanent. Nevertheless, people of homosexual, lesbian,

or bisexual orientation have never been adjudicated to be a protected class and the

right to participate equally in the political process has never been determined, apart

from Evans I, to be a fundamental right. Accordingly, I would employ a rational relation

standard to Amendment 2 and vacate the permanent injunction. For the reasons set forth

in my dissent to Evans I, and for the reasons set forth below, I respectfully dissent. 

<P>

I The majority relies on Evans I and applies the strict scrutiny standard of review to

Amendment 2 because it holds that the Equal Protection Clause of the United States

Constitution guarantees the fundamental right to participate equally in the political

process. Maj. op. at 4; Evans I, 854 P.2d at 1276. Evans I established this standard of

review by assembling several United States Supreme Court decisions and interpreting

their collective teachings as implying a new fundamental right. See Evans I, 854 P.2d at

1276 (citing voting cases, ballot access cases, and "cases involving attempts to limit

the ability of certain groups to have desired legislation implemented through the normal

political processes"). In my view, no fundamental right or suspect class is implicated

by Amendment 2, and therefore the standard of judicial scrutiny applied by the majority

is erroneous. 

<P>

A The majority in Evans I extensively reviewed many United States Supreme Court

decisions to reach its conclusion, and emphasized a line of cases relating to citizen

participation in the political process. See <I>Washington v. Seattle</I> Sch. Dist. No.

1, 458 U.S. 457 (1982); <I>Gordon v. Lance,</I> 403 U.S. 1 (1971); <I>Hunter v.

Erickson,</I> 393 U.S. 385 (1969). The majority in Evans I interpreted these cases to

create the fundamental right to participate equally in the political process. Properly

understood, however, these cases involve suspect classifications and not the alleged

fundamental right to participate equally in the political process. 

<P>

In <I>Hunter v. Erickson,</I> 393 U.S. 385 (1969), the United States Supreme Court

addressed a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the federal constitution. Hunter

involved a city charter amendment that repealed a racial anti-discrimination ordinance

and required voter action before such an ordinance could be enacted. Id. at 387.

Although Hunter involved the political process, the Court invalidated the amendment

because it created an unjustified distinction based on race. The Court held: 

<P>

Because the core of the Fourteenth Amendment is the prevention of meaningful and

unjustified official distinctions based on race, racial classifications are

"constitutionally suspect," and subject to the "most rigid scrutiny." They "bear a far

heavier burden of justification" than other classifications. 

<P>

Id. at 391-92 (citations omitted). Courts and scholars reviewing Hunter have recognized

that the holding was predicated on an unconstitutional racial classification. See

<I>Tyler v. Vickery,</I> 517 F.2d 1089, 1099 (5th Cir. 1975) (stating that Hunter struck

down an amendment that was based on a racial classification), cert. denied, 426 U.S. 940

(1976); <I>Lee v. Nyquist,</I> 318 F. Supp. 710, 718 (W.D.N.Y. 1970) ("The principle of

Hunter is that the state creates an 'explicitly racial classification' whenever it

differentiates between the treatment of problems involving racial matters and that

afforded other problems in the same area."), aff'd, 402 U.S. 935 (1971); Citizens for

Responsible Behavior v. Superior Court, 2 Cal. Rptr. 2d 648, 655 (Cal. App. 4 Dist.

1991) (stating that "Hunter was a 'strict scrutiny' case in which the law invalidly

classified the affected parties on the basis of traditionally suspect characteristics");

Michael Klarman, An Interpretative History of Modern Equal Protection, 90 Mich. L. Rev.

213, 314 (1991) (noting that in place of a political process theory of equal protection

review, racial classifications are and should be considered presumptively

unconstitutional because they should be irrelevant to decision -making); Robert H.

Beinfield, Note, The Hunter Doctrine: An Equal Protection Theory that Threatens

Democracy, 38 Vand. L. Rev. 397, 405 (1985) (suggesting that the decision in Hunter is

based on racial classifications). 

<P>

In <I>Washington v. Seattle School District No. 1,</I> 458 U.S. 457 (1982), the Court

applied Hunter and struck down a state-wide initiative to terminate the use of busing to

achieve racial integration in the public schools. In finding that the initiative

violated the Equal Protection Clause, the Supreme Court held: 

<P>

[T]he political majority may generally restructure the political process to place

obstacles in the path of everyone seeking to secure the benefits of governmental action.

But a different analysis is required when the State allocates governmental power

nonneutrally, by explicitly using the racial nature of a decision to determine the

decisionmaking process. State action of this kind, the Court said, "places special

burdens on racial minorities within the governmental process," thereby "making it more

difficult for certain racial and religious minorities than for other members of the

community to achieve legislation that is in their interest." Id. at 470 (emphasis in

original) (citations omitted). The Court thus did not approve of "distinctions based on

race" and struck down the initiative because it would have created additional burdens

for a class of citizens who have had historical difficulty in changing the political

process. Id. at 486. See <I>Metro Broadcasting, Inc. v. Federal Communications

Comm'n,</I> 497 U.S. 547, 563-65 (1990) (holding that members of a traditionally suspect

class merit special protection); City of Richmond v. J.A. Croson Co., 488 U.S. 469,

490-91 (1989) (same); United States v. Carolene Products Co., 304 U.S. 144, 152-53 n.4

(1938) (noting that special protection may be offered for "discrete and insular"

minority groups). 

<P>

A similar issue was addressed in <I>Crawford v. Board of Education,</I> 458 U.S. 527

(1982), which was announced on the same day as Washington. In Crawford, the Court upheld

a state constitutional amendment that prohibited state courts from ordering mandatory

student assignment or transportation. The Court stated that if the constitutional

amendment employed a racial classification such as the classification in Hunter, the

Court would apply the strict scrutiny standard of review, but found Hunter inapplicable

because the amendment at issue did not "embody a racial classification." Crawford, 458

U.S. at 536-37.<P> 



The fact that the fundamental right created by the majority in Evans I has never been

recognized by the Supreme Court is evident in two cases, <I>James v. Valtierra,</I> 402

U.S. 137 (1971), and Gordon v. Lance, 403 U.S. 1 (1971). In James and Gordon, the Court

could have used the fundamental right found in Evans I and applied strict scrutiny

review to strike down constitutional measures. Instead, in both cases, the Court upheld

the provisions and refused to apply the strict scrutiny standard enunciated in Hunter. 

<P>

In James, the Supreme Court upheld the validity of a California constitutional measure

that prohibited state public bodies from developing, constructing, or acquiring

low-income housing projects until voters approved of the project in a referendum. Thus,

the citizens singled out in James were low-income people who would qualify for low-rent

housing and therefore the Court did not apply strict scrutiny. The Supreme Court said: 

<P>

Unlike the case before us, Hunter rested on the conclusion that Akron's referendum law

denied equal protection by placing "special burdens on racial minorities within the

governmental process." . .. Unlike the Akron referendum provision, it cannot be said

that California's Article XXXIV rests on "distinctions based on race." . ..The present

case could be affirmed only by extending Hunter, and this we decline to do. 

<P>

James, 402 U.S. at 140-41.

<P>

Similarly, in Gordon, the plaintiffs challenged West Virginia's constitutional provision

that required a sixty-percent approval for any bonded indebtedness incurred by the

political subdivisions of the state. As in James, the Supreme Court did not apply the

strict scrutiny standard of review because: 

<P>

Unlike the restrictions in our previous cases, the West Virginia Constitution singles

out no "discrete and insular minority" for special treatment. ...We are not, therefore,

presented with a case like Hunter, . ..in which fair housing legislation alone was

subject to an automatic referendum requirement. The class singled out in Hunter was

clear -- "those who would benefit from laws barring racial, religious, or ancestral

discriminations." Gordon, 403 U.S. at 5. James and Gordon demonstrate that strict

scrutiny should not be applied to review a restriction on the political process unless

the restriction singles out a discrete and insular minority.FN26 The Supreme Court of

the United States has never held, however, that the right to participate equally in the

political process is a fundamental right. 

<P>

B The development of fundamental rights in our jurisprudence has never been a matter for

ad hoc determination. <i>See Palko v. Connecticut,</i> 302 U.S. 319, 325 (1937) (stating

that fundamental rights are those that are "implicit in the concept of ordered liberty,"

such that "neither liberty nor justice would exist if [they] were sacrificed"); <i>Moore

v. East Cleveland,</i> 431 U.S. 494, 503 (1977) (noting that fundamental rights are

liberties that are "deeply rooted in this Nation's history and tradition"); see also

Bowers v. Hardwick, 478 U.S 186, 191-92 (1986); <I>Griswold v. Connecticut,</i> 381 U.S.

479, 481-86 (1965). Fundamental rights must be explicitly or implicitly guaranteed by

the United States Constitution. <I>San Antonio Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Rodriguez,</i> 411

U.S. 1, 33-34 (1973). Among the fundamental rights delineated by the Supreme Court are

the right to vote, the right to interstate travel, the right to privacy, and the

guarantees contained in the First Amendment. See <i>Police Dep't of Chicago v.

Mosley,</i> 408 U.S. 92, 101 (1972) (First Amendment); <i>Shapiro v. Thompson,</i> 394

U.S. 618, 634 (1969) (interstate travel); <i>Harper v. Virginia State Bd. of

Elections,</i> 383 U.S. 663, 670 (1966) (voting); Griswold, 381 U.S. at 484 (privacy). 

<P>

The Court has been reluctant to recognize new rights as fundamental. See Bowers, 478

U.S. at 195 ("There should be, therefore, great resistance to expand the substantive

reach of [the Due Process Clauses], particularly if it requires redefining the category

of rights deemed to be fundamental."); Geoffrey Stone, et al., Constitutional Law, at

831 (1986) (stating that the Court "has essentially frozen the list of 'fundamental'

interests"). The Court has refused to declare education, housing, the right to refuse

medical treatment, welfare payments, or governmental employment to be fundamental rights

worthy of heightened constitutional protection. See Cruzan by Cruzan v. Director,

Missouri Dep't of Health, 497 U.S. 261, 280 (1990) (right to refuse medical treatment);

<i>Massachusetts Bd. of Retirement v. Murgia,</i> 427 U.S. 307, 312 (1976) (employment);

Rodriguez, 411 U.S. at 35 (education); <i>Dandridge v. Williams,</i> 397 U.S. 471, 485

(1970) (welfare). Never before has any court recognized the right to participate equally

in the political process as a fundamental right, the curtailing of which warrants strict

judicial scrutiny.FN27 "It is not the province of this Court to create substantive

constitutional rights in the name of guaranteeing equal protection of the laws."

Rodriguez, 397 U.S. at 33. 

<P>

It is crucial to note, however, that even though equal participation in the political

process does not merit strict scrutiny analysis, the United States Constitution offers

protection for those who may be adversely affected by legislation. When individuals or

groups are singled out, as they have been here, they may still be protected by the Due

Process Clauses or the Equal Protection Clause.FN28 In this case, the class of citizens

is protected by the Equal Protection Clause. Accordingly, Amendment 2 must be struck

down only if its challengers can demonstrate that the legislation is not rationally

related to a legitimate state interest. 

<P>

II During oral argument before this court, counsel for the plaintiffs-appellees asserted

that even if strict scrutiny review were inappropriate, we should analyze Amendment 2

under a rational basis standard of review. Counsel noted that in Heller v. Doe by Doe,

113 S. Ct. 2637, 2642 (1993), the Supreme Court did not engage in strict scrutiny review

because it was not properly preserved at the lower levels and therefore urged this court

not to preclude rational basis review by ruling merely under strict scrutiny standards.

I find counsel's contention persuasive and therefore address Amendment 2 under a

rational relation standard. 

<P>

A In reviewing an act of the legislature or a voter-mandated constitutional amendment

that creates a classification involving neither a fundamental right nor suspect classes,

a court will review the classification under the "rational basis" standard of review.

See Heller, 113 S. Ct. at 2642; <i>Kadrmas v. Dickinson Public Sch.,</i> 487 U.S. 450,

462 (1988). Under the rational basis standard of review, the classification will be

"upheld against equal protection challenge if there is any reasonably conceivable state

of facts that could provide a rational basis for the classification." Federal

Communications Comm'n v. Beach Communication, Inc., 113 S. Ct. 2096, 2101 (1993); see

also Sullivan v. Stroop, 496 U.S. 478, 485 (1990); <i>Vance v. Bradley,</i> 440 U.S. 93,

111 (1979); Dandridge, 397 U.S. at 484-85. "Such a classification cannot run afoul of

the Equal Protection Clause if there is a rational relationship between the disparity of

treatment and some legitimate governmental purpose." Heller, 113 S. Ct. at 2642; see

also <i>Nordlinger v. Hahn,</i> 112 S. Ct. 2326, 2331-32 (1992). 

<P>

The inquiry into whether there is a rational basis for the classification, however, does

not authorize "the judiciary [to] sit as a superlegislature to judge the wisdom or

desirability of legislative policy determinations." <i>New Orleans v. Dukes,</i> 427

U.S. 297, 303 (1976) (per curiam). Instead, a classification that involves neither

suspect classes nor fundamental rights is accorded a strong presumption of validity.

(1981); Murgia, 427 U.S. at 314. 

<P>

Because of the strong presumption of validity, the purpose or rationale behind the

legislation need not be articulated at any time. Heller, 113 S. Ct. at 2642; Nordlinger,

112 S. Ct. at 2334; <i>Allied Stores of Ohio, Inc. v. Bowers,</i> 358 U.S. 522, 528

(1959). Additionally, the party challenging the classification bears the burden of

"negat[ing] every conceivable basis which might support it" whether or not it is

supported by the record. <i>Lehnhausen v. Lake Shore Auto Parts Co.,</i> 410 U.S. 356,

364 (1973); see also Heller, 113 S. Ct. at 2643. 

<P>

In an effort to ensure that rational basis review does not become a "license for courts

to judge the wisdom, fairness, or logic of legislative choices," Beach Communication,

113 S. Ct. at 2101, the reasons articulated are given great deference. See Id. at 2098

("[A] legislative choice is not subject to courtroom factfinding and may be based on

rational speculation unsupported by evidence or empirical data."); <i>Gregory v.

Ashcroft,</i> 501 U.S. 452, 470-71 (1991) ("In cases where a classification burdens

neither a suspect group nor a fundamental interest, 'courts are quite reluctant to

overturn governmental action on the ground that it denies equal protection of the

laws.'") (citation omitted); <i>Paris Adult Theater I v. Slaton,</i> 413 U.S. 49, 62

(1973) ("The fact that a congressional directive reflects unprovable assumptions about

what is good for the people, including imponderable aesthetic assumptions, is not a

sufficient reason to find that statute unconstitutional."); Dandridge, 397 U.S. at 485

(noting that a classification does not fail because "in practice it results in some

inequality") (citation omitted); <i>Metropolis Theatre Co. v. City of Chicago,</i> 228

U.S. 61, 69-70 (1913) ("The problems of government are practical ones and may justify,

if they do not require, rough accommodations -- illogical, it may be, and

unscientific."); see also Laurence Tribe, American Constitutional Law 1440 (2d ed. 1988)

("Within very broad limits, courts have traditionally exhibited extreme deference to the

legislative definition of `the general good,' either out of judicial sympathy for the

difficulties of the legislative process, or out of a belief in judicial restraint

generally."); John Nowak, Ronald Rotunda, Nelson Young, Constitutional Law 596 (2d ed.

1983) ("A majority of the justices today will uphold governmental classifications under

this standard unless no reasonably conceivable set of facts could establish a rational

relationship between the classification and an arguably legitimate end of government.");

Mark Strasser, Suspect Classes and Suspect Classifications: On Discriminating,

Unwittingly or Otherwise, 64 Temp. L. Rev. 937, 941 (1991) ("The rational basis test is

notoriously weak. When applied, there is 'little doubt about the outcome; the challenged

legislation is always upheld.'") (quoting Murgia, 427 U.S. at 319 (Marshall, J.

dissenting)); but see <i>City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Center,</i> 473 U.S. 432,

447 (1985) (striking down on rational basis review a zoning law that prohibited mentally

retarded individuals from residing in certain areas of town because the law was based on

the "bare . ..desire to harm a politically unpopular group") (citation omitted). This is

so because: 

<P>

The Constitution presumes that, absent some reason to infer antipathy, even improvident

decisions will eventually be rectified by the democratic process and that judicial

intervention is generally unwarranted no matter how unwisely we may think a political

branch has acted. Thus, we will not overturn such a statute unless the varying treatment

of different groups or persons is so unrelated to the achievement of any combination of

legitimate purposes that we can only conclude that the legislature's actions were

irrational. 

<P>

Vance, 440 U.S. at 97 (footnote omitted). Although the purposes and rationale of a voter

initiative are even more difficult to assess than legislative pronouncements,

initiatives passed by the citizens of the state which contain classifications not

related to fundamental rights or suspect classes are also given deference. See Gregory,

501 U.S. at 470 (applying the rational basis standard to a constitutional restriction

enacted by the people); <I>MSM Farms, Inc. v. Spire,</i> 927 F.2d 330, 333 (8th Cir.

1991) (applying a rational basis test to measures adopted through a referendum). 

<P>

It is the prerogative of the people of the State of Colorado, and not this or any other

court, to weigh the evidence and determine the wisdom and utility of the purposes behind

a measure adopted through the initiative process. See <I>Minnesota v. Clover Leaf

Creamery Co.,</i> 449 U.S. 456, 469 (1981) (stating that the Minnesota Supreme Court

erred in substituting its judgment for that of the legislature). Thus, whether in fact

Amendment 2 will meet its objectives is not the relevant question: the Equal Protection

Clause is satisfied if the people of Colorado could have rationally decided that

prohibiting homosexuals, lesbians, and bisexuals from enacting certain legislation might

further a legitimate interest. <i>Hawaii Housing Auth. v. Midkiff,</i> 467 U.S. 229, 242

(1984); Clover Leaf Creamery, 449 U.S. at 466. 

<P>

Amendment 2 was put to a plebiscite by initiative petitions and eventually won voter

approval by 813,966 votes to 710,151 votes. Because Amendment 2 was a product of a vote

of the citizens of Colorado, no purpose or rationale for Amendment 2 was explicitly set

forth. See MSM Farms, 927 F.2d at 332 ("Because the law was adopted through the

initiative and referendum process, there is little traditional legislative history

regarding its purpose."). However, the state has articulated several rationale in this

court and in the district court to establish that the interest behind Amendment 2 is not

only a rational interest but also a compelling state interest.FN29 III Although only one

legitimate state interest rationally related to the state's goals for a constitutional

amendment is necessary, the state has set forth several. The district court found that

two rationale -- the promotion of religious freedom and the promotion of family privacy

-- demonstrated compelling state interests, although it found that the means for

achieving the interests were not narrowly tailored to achieve the objectives.FN30  In my

view, there are at least three interests that satisfy the constitutional standard and

those asserting the invalidity of Amendment 2 have not met their burden of demonstrating

that there is no rational basis for the constitutional amendment. 

<P>

A The state asserts that the rational basis of Amendment 2 is that it prevents the

government from interfering with religious privacy. The root of the state's contention

is that under ordinances preempted by Amendment 2, individual landlords or employers,

including churches, who have profound religious objections to homosexuality, would

nonetheless be compelled to compromise those convictions under threat of government

sanctions. Thus, Amendment 2 prevents any political body from enacting legislation that

would hinder the right of individuals to choose who to rent to or who to employ on

religious grounds. The district court found that "[p]reserving religious freedom is a

compelling state interest" but that Amendment 2 was "not narrowly drawn to achieve that

purpose in the least restrictive manner possible." Freedom of individuals to practice

and hold particular religious beliefs is among the highest values in our society. See

<i>Murdock v. Pennsylvania,</i> 319 U.S. 105, 115-17 (1943); <i>Jones v. Opelika,</i>

319 U.S. 103, 104 (1943); see also <i>Martin v Struthers,</i> 319 U.S. 141, 149-50

(1943) (Murphy, J., concurring). It is not within the discretion of this or any court to

determine which beliefs are valid because "courts are not the arbiters of scriptural

interpretation."  <i>United States v. Lee,</i> 455 U.S. 252, 257 (1982). In fact,

"religious beliefs need not be acceptable, logical, consistent, or comprehensible to

others in order to merit [free exercise] protection."  <i>Thomas v. Review Bd.,</i> 450

U.S. 707, 714 (1981). Not only is it impermissible for courts to determine the validity

of religious practices and beliefs, but no government official or body may delineate

what is a "proper" form of faith and require citizens to act in accordance with

government-mandated religious standards. See<i> West Virginia State Bd. of Educ. v.

Barnette,</i> 319 U.S. 624, 642 (1943) ("If there is any fixed star in our

constitutional constellation, it is that no official, high or petty, can prescribe what

shall be orthodox in politics, nationalism, religion, or other matters of opinion or

force citizens to confess by work or act their faith therein."). 

<P>

Nevertheless, not all burdens on religion are unconstitutional. Lee, 455 U.S. at 257;

Thomas, 450 U.S. at 718 (stating that "only those interests of the highest order . ..

can overbalance legitimate claims to the free exercise of religion"). Even the highest

values, including religious freedom, must sometimes give way to the greater public good.

See <i>Sherbert v. Verner,</i> 374 U.S. 398, 403 (1963). Thus, governmental actions that

substantially burden a religious practice must be justified by a compelling governmental

interest. <i>Employment Div. v. Smith,</i> 494 U.S. 872, 883 (1990). In this case, the

state asserts that Amendment 2 is an attempt to protect religious freedom by precluding

legislation that would threaten sanctions against those who would refuse to employ or

rent to homosexuals, lesbians, and bisexuals. The state indicates several examples of

instances in which individuals or groups were forced to set aside their religious

beliefs based on legislative enactments protecting homosexuals. In Aspen, for example,

section 13-98 of the sexual orientation ordinance required churches to open their

facilities to homosexual organizations if the facilities were opened to any community

organization. Churches apparently could not refuse to hire employees, including pastors

or priests, on the basis of their sexual orientation. Similarly, Title 12 of the Boulder

Municipal Code did not allow a church or religious organization with deeply held moral

and religious views on the subject of homosexuality to refuse to hire someone based on

his or her sexual orientation. 

<P>

In my view, the state has a legitimate interest in protecting religious freedoms and

Amendment 2 bears a rational relationship to that interest. 

<P>

B Although the district court found that the state did not have a compelling interest in

deterring "factionalism," or "political fragmentation," the state does have a legitimate

interest in promoting state-wide uniformity and Amendment 2 is rationally related to

that interest. 

<P>

Prohibiting local action on matters affecting the entire state is advantageous inasmuch

as the state has an interest in uniformity of regulation: 

<P>

The central inquiry implicit in the concept of pre-emption is whether there should be

statewide uniformity in the regulation of specific conduct. If there is no need for

statewide uniformity, there is no need for state law to preempt local power to regulate.

. .This is the core of the preemption question -- to consider, on the one hand, the need

for statewide uniformity of regulation of a specific type of conduct, and, on the other

hand, the need of local governments to be able to respond to local, as distinguished

from statewide problems. 

<P>

Daniel R. Mandelker & Dawn C. Netsch, State and Local Government in a Federal System 237

(1977); see also Osborne M. Reynolds, Local Government Law 120 (1982) (stating that the

critical inquiry in the context of state preemption of local law is: 

<P>

"[I]s this an area where it is desirable to have a single, all -encompassing scheme of

regulation, so that local laws -- not just local laws that conflict with the state's,

but any local laws -- would unduly complicate the picture?"); Charles S. Rhyne, The Law

of Local Government Operations Sect. 19.11 (recognizing that preemption is rooted in the

necessity of statewide uniformity of regulation). 

<P>

In determining what is a matter of statewide concern, this court has not set forth a

strict legal standard. Instead, we have determined the nature of the concern on an ad

hoc basis. See  

<I>Denver & Rio Grande Western R.R. Co. v. City & County of Denver,</i> 673 P.2d 354,

358 (Colo. 1983). In <I>City & County of Denver v. State,</i> 788 P.2d 764, 767 (Colo.

1990), we stated: 

<P>

Although we have found it useful to employ the "local," "mixed," and "state-wide"

categories in resolving conflicts between local and state legislation, these legal

categories should not be mistaken for mutually exclusive or factually perfect

descriptions of the relevant interests of the state and local governments. Those affairs

which are municipal, mixed or of statewide concern often imperceptibly merge. 

<P>

State regulation is a matter of statewide concern in a broad variety of contexts. See

<I>Robertson v. City & County of Denver,</i> 874 P.2d 325, 350 (Colo. 1994) (Erickson,

J., dissenting). 

<P>

In this case, the state has a legitimate interest in promoting Amendment 2 because it is

a matter of statewide concern. Amendment 2 involves a matter of statewide concern

because the public is deeply divided over the issue of homosexuality.FN31 In fact, civil

rights has never been the type of concern reserved exclusively for local

governments.FN32 By adopting Amendment 2, the people of the state have sought to ensure

that the government will act on a uniform basis. Several local governments, such as

Denver, Aspen, and Boulder enacted sexual orientation laws, while others did not. By

voting to approve Amendment 2, the voters of Colorado indicated that they wanted a

statewide resolution of the issue that had formerly only been locally regulated and

subject to great debate. The citizens of the state have a right to the initiative

process which resolves conflicts between municipal and local governments when the issue

is a matter of statewide concern and the process is not repugnant to the

constitution.FN33 The Supreme Court has noted that "referendums demonstrate devotion to

democracy, not to bias, discrimination, or prejudice."FN34 James, 402 U.S. at 141. 

<P>

In my view, the state has a legitimate interest in promoting statewide uniformity in

matters of statewide concern and Amendment 2 bears a rational relationship to that

interest. 

<P>

C The state also contends that it has a legitimate interest in allocating its resources.

Specifically, the state suggests that laws prohibited by Amendment 2 would drain the

state's financial and labor resources set aside and budgeted for the protection of

traditionally suspect classes and diminish respect for traditional civil rights

categories. 

<P>

In this case, the testimony reflected that, although there was no current statute that

required the state to enforce civil rights legislation on behalf of homosexuals,

lesbians, and bisexuals, any such statute would decrease the funding available to

enforce existing laws protecting traditionally suspect classes.FN35 For example, the

investigative arm of the Civil Rights Commission has experienced steadily increasing

demands upon a shrinking budget. Two out of the last three years, the Division has been

unable to fulfill its part of a federally funded work-share agreement.FN36 The Division

received complaints from the black community that claims were not being thoroughly

investigated and prosecuted. The state, therefore, reasonably postulates that a law

requiring the protection of an additional group would further stretch scarce resources,

and Amendment 2 protects the civil rights enforcement for traditionally suspect

groups.FN37 Thus, the decision of the people of the State of Colorado to allocate

government resources in a particular manner is a legitimate state interest in this case.

See Dukes, 427 U.S. at 303 (upholding a New Orleans ordinance noting that states have

wide latitude in regulating their local economies); James, 402 U.S. at 143 (noting that

a referendum procedure "ensures that all the people of a community will have a voice in

a decision which may lead to large expenditures of local governmental funds" and

therefore found that a referendum measure did not violate the Equal Protection Clause). 

<P>

Additionally, the state has a legitimate interest in ensuring that the traditionally

suspect classes remain respected. See Crawford, 458 U.S. at 539 ("And certainly the

purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment would not be advanced by an interpretation that

discouraged the States from providing greater protection to racial minorities.").

Professor Joseph Broadus testified that the addition of homosexuals to civil rights

statutes or ordinances would lessen the public's respect for historic civil rights

categories. Testimony also indicated that, unlike the traditionally suspect classes,

homosexuals, lesbians, and bisexuals are a relatively politically powerful and

privileged special interest group. Indeed, former Civil Rights Commission Chairman

Ignacio Rodriguez testified that the inclusion of homosexuals as a suspect class would

represent a "drastic departure" from the historical aims of the civil rights laws. 

<P>

The State of Colorado, through entities such as the Colorado Civil Rights Division, has

attempted to further the interest in remedying specific instances of sexual and racial

discrimination through existing civil rights laws and enforcement programs. However,

owing to the fiscal constraints which are inevitably a part of public administration,

unlimited funds are not available for this purpose. Therefore, it is incumbent upon the

state to set priorities for its enforcement efforts. In this case, the setting of

priorities is a legitimate state interest and Amendment 2 is rationally related to that

interest. 

<P>

IV In my view, the correct standard of judicial review of Amendment 2 is a rational

basis standard of review. Additionally, the plaintiffs have not shown that Amendment 2

is not rationally related to the state's legitimate interest in protecting religious

freedom, encouraging statewide uniformity in the law, and allocating resources.

Accordingly, I would reverse the decision of the district court and vacate the

injunction. Therefore, I dissent. 

<P></blockquote><H3>Footnotes</H3><font size=-1><tt>

FN1 The trial court concluded that plaintiffs had met the threshold requirement of

Rathke v. MacFarlane, 648 P.2d 648 (Colo. 1982), by demonstrating that enjoining the

enforcement of Amendment 2 was necessary to protect their right to equal protection of

the laws under the United States Constitution. The trial court then determined that

because Amendment 2 may burden a fundamental constitutional right, its constitutionality

must be assessed by reference to the "strict scrutiny" standard of review. The court

concluded that under this standard, plaintiffs had shown to a reasonable probability

that Amendment 2 would be demonstrated to be unconstitutional beyond a reasonable doubt

at a trial on the merits. 

<P>

FN2 The state has not reasserted the sixth interest on appeal. 

<P>

FN3 The court rejected plaintiffs' argument that gay men, lesbians, and bisexuals should

be found to be either a "suspect class" or a "quasi-suspect class." The trial court

rejected this argument because it concluded that "[h]omosexuals fail to meet the element

of political powerlessness and therefore fail to meet the elements [necessary] to be

found a suspect class." This ruling has not been appealed and thus, we do not address

it. 

<P>

The trial court also declined plaintiffs' request to analyze the constitutionality of

Amendment 2 under the "rational basis test." In so doing, it stated: 

<P>

The Colorado Supreme Court has ruled that Amendment 2 invades a fundamental right of an

identifiable group and that the test to be applied is the strict scrutiny test. The

rational basis test is to be used when there is no fundamental right or suspect class

involved. Therefore this court declines to apply a legally inappropriate test to this

case. 

<P>

Plaintiffs have again argued to this court that Amendment 2 does not pass constitutional

muster under the less stringent rational basis test. They argue that each of the state's

purported compelling interests are not rationally related to the enactment of Amendment

2. Because we decline to revisit our holding in Evans I, see infra Part II, and again

conclude that Amendment 2 affects a fundamental right, its constitutionality must be

analyzed under the strict scrutiny standard of review. See Plyler v. Doe, 457 U.S. 202,

217 (1982) ("laws that impinge upon the exercise of a 'fundamental right' [require] the

State to demonstrate that its classification has been precisely tailored to serve a

compelling governmental interest"). 

<P>

FN4 After this court decided Evans I, a Federal District Court enjoined the enforcement

of a voter enacted amendment to the Cincinnati, Ohio city charter almost identical to

Amendment 2, which prohibited the city from enacting any ordinance, regulation, rule or

policy which entitled gay men, lesbian or bisexual individuals to minority or protected

status. Equality Foundation of Greater Cincinnati, Inc. v. City of Cincinnati, 838 F.

Supp. 1235 (S.D. Ohio 1993) (Equality I). The court found it highly likely that the

right to participate equally in the political process is a fundamental right, protected

by the Equal Protection Clause and requires strict judicial scrutiny on review. The

court concluded relevant Supreme Court precedent supported the proposition that

"[s]tates may not disadvantage any identifiable group, whether a suspect category or

not, by making it more difficult to enact legislation on its behalf." Id. at 1241

(citing Evans I, 854 P.2d 1270, 1281, 1283 (Colo. 1993); Gordon v. Lance, 403 U.S. 1, 7

(1971); Hunter v. Erickson, 393 U.S. 385, 393 (1969)). After a trial on the merits, the

court made the injunction permanent holding inter alia that the amendment violated the

plaintiffs' fundamental right to equal access to the political process. Equality

Foundation of Greater Cincinnati, Inc. v. City of Cincinnati, Slip op. at 26, 1994 WL

442746 at *11 (S.D. Ohio 1994). The court explained "any legislation that

disadvantimages an independently identifiable group of people by making it more

difficult for that group to enact legislation in its behalf, `fences' that group out of

the political process, and thereby violates their fundamental rights." Id. (citing

Equality I, 838 F. Supp. at 1238-42; Evans I, 854 P.2d at 1282.). 

<P>

FN5 We note at the outset that defendants argue that all of the asserted compelling

interests which support Amendment 2 are narrowly tailored on the grounds that "there is

absolutely no other way that the people could further the common elements of the various

compelling interests but through the enactment of Amendment 2." We do not specifically

address this argument for two reasons. First, as will be made clear below, none of the

interests identified by defendants are compelling. Second, defendants never articulate

what the "common elements of the various compelling interests" are, and we are simply

unable to ascertain any specific "common elements" which all of those interests share. 

<P>

FN6 Nevertheless, the court held, "it is clear that free exercise of religion as

protected by the First Amendment is not actionably infringed by applying to plaintiff a

facially neutral statute which merely proscribes marital status discrimination,

notwithstanding plaintiff's religious scruples against renting to unmarried couples."

Id. at 401. This conclusion was reached based on the fact that "if prohibiting the

exercise of religion effect of a generally applicable and otherwise valid provision, the

First Amendment has not been offended." Id. at 400 (quoting Employment Div., Ore. Dept.

of Human Res. v. Smith, 494 U.S. at 878 (1990)). 

<P>

FN7 We do not rule today on the adequacy of any religious exemptions contained in

existing antidiscrimination laws. The question whether antidiscrimination laws violate

the free exercise clause of the First Amendment by prohibiting discrimination based on

marital status has recently been addressed by two state supreme courts with mixed

results. See Attorney General v. Desilets, 636 N.E.2d 233 (Mass. 1994) (Statutory

mandate that landlords cannot discriminate against cohabitating unmarried couples

substantially burdened landlords' sincerely held religious belief protected by the

Massachusetts state constitution. Case remanded to decide whether a compelling

governmental interest in eliminating such discrimination justified the infringement);

Swanner v. Anchorage Equal Rights Comm'n, 874 P.2d 274 (Alaska 1994) (enforcement of

facially neutral fair housing laws did not violate a landlord's right to free exercise

of religion under either the state or federal constitution). 

<P>

FN8 The defendants' entire argument addressing the issue of personal privacy constitutes

a single paragraph. It reads: 

<P>

The court below found that both religious liberty and familial privacy are indeed

compelling interests. However, the court rejected the notion that personal privacy could

be a compelling interest, finding that the Defendants had addressed it only

"tangentially." This finding ignores testimony such as that offered by Ann Ready of

Madison, Wisconsin, who shared a house with four other women, but refused to share it

with a lesbian. She stated that she "had rejected several heterosexual males for the

same reason, namely the potential for [unwanted] physical, sexual attraction." Ms. Ready

was subsequently found to have violated both municipal and state sexual orientation

laws. That preventing this sort of intrusion into personal matters of the utmost privacy

is a compelling interest, should be obvious. 

<P>

(citations to the record omitted).

<P>

FN9 In this regard, it is significant to note that Colorado law currently proscribes

discrimination against persons who are not suspect classes, including discrimination

based on age, Sect. 24 -34402(1)(a), 10A C.R.S. (1994 Supp.); marital or family status,

Sect. 24-34-502(1)(a), 10A C.R.S. (1994 Supp.); veterans' status, Sect. 28-3-506, 11B

C.R.S. (1989); and for any legal, off-duty conduct such as smoking tobacco, Sect.

24-34-402.5, 10A C.R.S. (1994 Supp.). Of course Amendment 2 is not intended to have any

effect on this legislation, but seeks only to prevent the adoption of anti

-discrimination laws intended to protect gays, lesbians, and bisexuals. 

<P>

FN10 The trial court rejected the testimony of the defendants' witnesses who, while

having no experience in the enforcement of civil rights laws intended to protect gays,

lesbians, and bisexuals, speculated that doing so would create increased costs and limit

the ability to enforce laws intended to protect suspect classes. 

<P>

FN11 There is some dispute as to whether consideration of this asserted interest is

properly before this court. Plaintiffs point out that in contrast to the six

governmental interests addressed by the trial court, morality was not listed in the

state's disclosure certificate or the state's opening statement at trial as a separate

interest supporting Amendment 2. 

<P>

Defendants argue that it presented the interest in public morality to the district court

and as support, cites an introductory paragraph contained in its brief to that court

which stated that "the issue of public morality . ..permeates the discussion of

compelling interests and indeed, can be regarded as a compelling interest in its own

right." In our judgment, this is sufficient to conclude that the interest of public

morality was presented to the trial court as a rationale for Amendment 2 and thus, this

asserted interest is properly before this court. 

<P>

FN12 The Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides: "The powers not

delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States,

are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people." 

<P>

FN13 The words "privileges" and "immunities" first appear in the Constitution in article

IV, Sect. 2 ("The Citizens of each State shall be entitled to all Privileges and

Immunities of Citizens in the several States."). By virtue of Article IV, state

citizenship carries with it the right to nondiscriminatory treatment within each state

of citizens of all the states. 

<P>

Consistent with the text and for purposes of distinction, the Article IV clause will be

referred to as the "Privileges and Immunities Clause," and the Fourteenth Amendment

clause will be referred to as the "Privileges or Immunities Clause." 

<P>

FN14 It is widely agreed that section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment was intended at

least to empower Congress to pass the Civil Rights Act of 1866, ch. 31, 14 Stat. 27.

William Nelson, The Fourteenth Amendment: From Political Principle to Judicial Doctrine

104 (1988) ("Section one was added to the amendment at least in part to remove doubts

about the constitutionality of the 1866 act."); John Harrison, Reconstructing the

Privileges or Immunities Clause, 101 Yale L.J. 1385, 1389 (1992). Many commentators have

suggested that the amendment actually writes the substance of the 1866 Act into the

Constitution. See id. 

<P>

FN15 Subsequent cases suggested an even narrower definition of the rights of national

citizenship, but in Twining v. New Jersey, 211 U.S. 78 (1908), the Court in dictum

finally settled on the Slaughter-House definition as correct. 

<P>

FN16 As Justice Field observed in dissent, and it is not really possible to deny: 

<P>

If this inhibition . ..only refers, as held by the majority of the court in their

opinion, to such privileges and immunities as were before its adoption specially

designated in the Constitution or necessarily implied as belonging to citizens of the

United States, it was a vain and idle enactment, which accomplished nothing, and most

unnecessarily excited Congress and the people on its passage."

Constitution for some good purpose." Cong. Globe. 39th Cong., 1st Sess., part 3, p. 2765

(1866); see generally John H. Ely, Democracy and Distrust 22 (1980). 

<P>

FN18 Representative Bingham, the Congressperson who framed the Privileges or Immunities

Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, pointed to the Privileges and Immunities Clause of

Article IV as his model. Cong. Globe, 39th Cong., 1st Sess., part 2, pp. 103334 (1866). 

<P>

FN19 As Ely has observed, the drafters of the Fourteenth Amendment "repeatedly adverted

to the Corfield discussion as the key to what they were writing." See Ely at 29; Steven

J. Heyman, The First Duty of Government: Protection, Liberty and the Fourteenth

Amendment, 41 Duke L.J. 507, 555-56 (1991). Corfield was invoked by both Senator

Trumbull and Representative Wilson, the managers of the Civil Rights Act, to explain the

fundamental rights of citizenship secured by the Act. Similarly, Senator Howard quoted

from Corfield during the Congressional debates regarding adoption of the fourteenth

amendment. Cong. Globe, 39th Cong., 1st Sess., part 3, p. 2765 (1866). 

<P>

FN20 See Edwards v. California, 314 U.S. 160, 178 (1941), (the right of interstate

travel is an essential "incident of national citizenship protected by the privileges and

immunities clause of the Fourteenth Amendment . .."). 

<P>

FN21 See also Illinois State Board of Elections v. Socialist Workers Party, 440 U.S.

173, 184 (1979); Dunn v. Blumstein, 405 U.S. 330, 336 (1972); Gordon v. Lance, 403 U.S.

1, 5 (1971); Frank I. Michelman, Conceptions of Democracy in American Constitutional

Argument: Voting Rights, 41 Fla. L. Rev. 443, 459 n. 63 (1989). 

<P>

FN22 Historically, the Equal Protection Clause was called upon to protect insular

minorities. Similarities undoubtedly exist between unlawful discrimination based on

sexual orientation and that based on race or national origin. However, the record is

uncertain as to whether, as a general matter, victims of discrimination based on sexual

orientation share the same history or are subjected to a similar experience or condition

as victims of racial or ethnic discrimination. 

<P>

FN23 The defendants argue that the participation in the political process plaintiffs

seek is a particular end or the successful adoption of plaintiffs' views. I note,

however, that the right to participate in the political process does not guarantee

plaintiffs or any other qualified electors the success of any candidate or cause nor the

state's embracement of particular ideas. This right simply guarantees access to the

political process. Citizens may vote, petition or amend as a matter of right, but they

cannot necessarily win as a matter of right. 

<P>

Moreover, I am not unmindful that the state may deny the right to vote or participate in

the political process as an operation of due process. See, e.g., Moran v. Carlstrom, 846

P.2d 862, 874 (Colo. 1989) (the General Assembly may place reasonable restrictions on

the right to vote); see also People v. Russo, 713 P.2d 356, 360 (Colo. 1986) (jurors

disqualified if they do not have the right to vote by reason of criminal conviction). 

<P>

FN24 Government intervention may take the form of agency action, legislation,

constitutional amendment, or other conduct which has the effect of law. 

<P>

FN25 See supra, n.11.

<P>

FN26 Homosexuals, lesbians, and bisexuals have never been adjudicated to be a discrete

and insular minority by the Supreme Court. See High Tech Gays v. Defense Indus. Sec.

Clearance Office, 895 F.2d 563, 571 (9th Cir. 1990); Dahl v. Secretary of the United

States Navy, 830 F. Supp 1319, 1323-25 (E.D. Cal. 1993). 

<P>

FN27 Recently, however, a federal district judge, relying on Evans I, struck down an

anti-gay-rights measure approved by Cincinnati voters. In Equality Foundation of Greater

Cincinnati, Inc. v. City of Cincinnati, slip op. at 26 (S.D. Ohio Aug. 9, 1994), the

federal district court declared that a City Charter Amendment was unconstitutionally

vague and violated the First Amendment right of homosexuals to participate in the

political process. See also Equality Found. v. City of Cincinnati, 838 F. Supp. 1235

(S.D. Ohio 1993). 

<P>

FN28 When fundamental rights are denied to everyone, it raises due process concerns.

When fundamental rights are denied to some individuals only, it raises equal protection

concerns. The applicable standard in either case, however, is strict scrutiny. 

<P>

FN29 The district court found that the state alleged six compelling state interests: (1)

deterring factionalism; (2) preserving the integrity of the state's political functions;

(3) preserving the ability of the state to remedy discrimination against suspect

classes; (4) preventing the government from interfering with personal, familial and

religious privacy; (5) preventing the government from subsidizing the political

objectives of a special interest group; and (6) promoting the physical and psychological

well-being of children. 

<P>

FN30 The district court applied the strict scrutiny standard of review which requires

the state to prove that classifications affecting fundamental rights were necessary to

promote a compelling or overriding interest which is narrowly tailored. See Plyler v.

Doe, 457 U.S. 202, 217 (1982) (noting that the classification must be "precisely

tailored"); Dunn v. Blumstein, 405 U.S. 330, 342 (1972) (stating a classification

involving a fundamental right must be a compelling state interest); Shapiro v. Thompson,

394 U.S. 618, 634 (1969) (noting that there needed to be a compelling reason for the

government to restrict interstate travel). 

<P>

FN31 The issue of homosexuality and bisexuality is deeply controversial and divisive.

Unlike race and sex, there is no national consensus that sexual orientation is an

inappropriate basis for governmental, much less private, decisionmaking. A series of

constitutional amendments and acts of Congress have authoritatively settled the place of

race and sex in American life. The same simply cannot be said of non-traditional sexual

orientation. 

<P>

FN32 For example, in 1989, the General Assembly passed a law prohibiting insurance

companies from inquiring about or making coverage decisions on the basis of sexual

orientation. See Sect. 103-1104(1)(f), 4A C.R.S. (1993 Supp.). In 1992, the Colorado

Civil Rights Commission went on record recommending legislation adding sexual

orientation to the list of protected classes. 

<P>

FN33 Testimony of Harvard Government Professor Harvey Mansfield indicated that the use

of the initiative process to enact Amendment 2 supported stability and respect for the

political process, by giving "the people a sense that . ..government is not alien to

them, and that they can get together by their own initiative . ..to produce a result

that gives them a sense of satisfaction and accomplishment." 

<P>

FN34 The Court in James went on to cogently state: 

<P>

But of course a lawmaking procedure that "disadvantimages" a particular group does not

always deny equal protection. Under any such holding, presumably a State would not be

able to require referendums on any subject unless referendums were required on all,

because they would always disadvantage some group. And this Court would be required to

analyze governmental structures to determine whether a gubernatorial veto provision or a

filibuster rule is likely to "disadvantage" any of the diverse and shifting groups that

make up the American people. 

<P>

James v. Valtierra, 402 U.S. 137, 142 (1971). 

<P>

FN35 In United States v. Carolene Products Co., 304 U.S. 144, 152 (1938), the Supreme

Court announced its standard for reviewing legislative enactments in the economic

sphere: 

<P>

[T]he existence of facts supporting the legislative judgment is to be presumed, for

regulatory legislation affecting ordinary commercial transactions is not to be

pronounced unconstitutional unless in light of the facts made known or generally assumed

it is of such a character as to preclude the assumption that it rests upon some rational

basis within the knowledge and experience of the legislators. 

<P>

FN36 Under the agreement, the Division works on a certain number of cases involving only

federally-protected classes which, of course, does not include sexual orientation. The

Division only met the goals last year because the Equal Employment Opportunities

Commission reduced the number of cases necessary to satisfy the agreement. 

<P>

FN37 The United States Supreme Court has addressed the issue of fiscal concerns

impacting certain rights. In Plyler, 457 U.S. at 222-24, the Court held that whatever

savings might be achieved by the state by denying public education to undocumented

aliens were insubstantial compared to the costs to the children, the state, and the

nation of not educating them. In Shapiro, 394 U.S. at 618, and in Graham v. Richardson,

403 U.S. 365 (1971), the Court found fiscal integrity not to be a compelling interest

balanced against the right to interstate travel and the right to welfare assistance to

aliens. These cases are distinguishable as either fundamental rights cases or cases in

which the object was saving money not a basic allocation of funds.

The <I>Real</I> Trial of the Century</H2><center><blockquote><B>Can the war crimes

tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, poised to try its first defendant, redeem the rule

of law in Bosnia--and around the world?</B><P>by William W. Horne<br>

Re-printed from <I>The American Lawyer</I></center></blockquote>

<font size=+3>G</font>raham Blewitt--with 29 years' experience as a federal prosecutor

in Australia--is not given to exaggeration or emotional outbursts. As chief of an

Australian Nazi war crimes investigations unit from 1989 to 1994, Blewitt, 48, thought

he knew all there was to know about genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity.

When he joined the new International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia in The

Hague, the Netherlands, in early 1994 as its deputy prosecutor, he thought it would just

be more of the same. It wasn't.<P>

<img width=104 height=140 align=left src="/images/spotlight/bos.gif" alt=" * "> 

"I still shake my head when I come across these stories of these seemingly normal people

murdering their neighbors," says Blewitt in an uncharacteristically choked-up voice. "I

can't imagine sitting there at a barbecue drinking a beer or two with your neighbor one

day and then the next day you're murdering or treating that person in the worst way."<P>

The fury of the neighbor-on-neighbor violence-perpetrated largely by the Bosnian Serbs

against Muslims as part of a campaign of  "ethnic cleansing"--is one of the mysteries of

the Bosnian conflict for international spectators. Even the Nazis, Blewitt points out,

killed their victims in a cold, efficient manner; rape and torture were the exception,

not the rule: "But the atrocities here, this is blood lust."<P> 

This blood lust is not just about territory; it's about centuries-old hatred that has

boiled over into a cycle of atrocity and revenge. What happened to the European Jews 50

years ago at the hands of the Nazis is happening to Bosnian Muslims at the hands of the

Serbs right now.<P> 

For three-and-a-half years, Serbs have thumbed their noses at international attempts to

resolve this war on their Muslim neighbors. The world powers have wrung their hands,

their peacemaking and diplomatic efforts in the former Yugoslavia not only failing to

end conventional war-making--armed soldiers killing armed soldiers on a battlefield-but

failing also to deter the commission of war crimes. The Serbs, by far the biggest

perpetrators, have not been forced to answer for these crimes, and so they have not.<P>

But in November--after two-and-a-half years of battling its United Nations paymaster for

funding and overcoming the nightmarish logistics of collecting evidence in a war

zone--the tribunal is scheduled to try its first defendant, Bosnian Serb Dusko Tadic, in

front of three judges and a worldwide television audience. <a href=#tv><B>1</B></a><P> 

It may be the most important criminal trial in this century. More important than the

treason trials of Ethel and Julius Rosenberg and of East German spymaster Markus Wolf.

More important than the Watergate trials, the Rodney King case, the Chicago Seven trial,

and, yes, even O.J.<P>

Not because the alleged crimes--132 counts related to rape, murder, and torture--are

necessarily worse than those committed by the thousands of war criminals who now range

freely in Tito's former domain. And not just because the case will forge new

international legal precedents.<P>

Tadic's trial will likely be the most significant criminal trial in this century because

it is a chance, finally, for the world to redeem the international rule of law and prove

it learned <I>something</I> from the horrors of World War II. Unlike Nuremberg, the

Tadic trial will unfold in the middle of the war for the former Yugoslavia. While

Nuremberg came too late to help the Nazis' victims, the Tadic trial and those that

follow at least have a chance of deterring Serbs and others from continuing to commit

war crimes.<P>

Most of us have grown accustomed to, even bored by, that far-off conflict between Serbs

and Bosnian Muslims and Croats. The daily tales of atrocities are just that--too daily,

too regular to sink in. Sure, we may flinch when faced with a photograph of an injured

child or a corpse. Yet we turn the page or change channels, and the images vanish. That

apathy--that conclusion that war, murder, rape, even genocide are out of our control--is

why the Tadic trial is so important.<P>

The Tadic trial itself will not bring peace. That must ultimately come from the

participants. But no peace will last unless the victims see that some form of justice is

meted out to the perpetrators. And if the prosecutors are even half right, Dusko Tadic

(pronounced <I>DOO-shko TAH-ditch</I>) is a perpetrator of the worst sort.<P><hr

size=7><ul><UL><ul><font size=+1>TADIC HAS PLEAD NOT GUILTY AND CLAIMS HE WAS NOT AT THE

CAMPS WHEN THE CRIMES WERE COMMITTED. IN NOVEMBER, IF EVERYTHING GOES AS SCHEDULED, THE

WORLD WILL FIND OUT IF HE'S TELLING THE TRUTH.</font>></UL></UL></UL><HR SIZE=7> <P>



<font size=+3>T</font>>adic's alleged crimes make even a seasoned war crimes prosecutor

like Graham Blewitt blanch. Tadic, a 39-year-old former caf&eacute; owner in the

Prijedor <I>opstina,</I> or district, in northeastern Bosnia is charged with committing

war crimes and crimes against humanity for the part that prosecutors say he played in 13

deaths, a rape, and several torture incidents in Bosnia and Herzegovina in May through

August 1992. Among his more gruesome alleged exploits: forcing one prisoner to bite off

the testicle of another, who subsequently died as a result.<P>

	Most of the allegations against Tadic--including the castration charge--relate to

his activities at the now-notorious Omarska concentration camp, where hundreds if not

thousands of the Bosnian Serbs' prisoners--nearly all Bosnian Muslims, civilians and

soldiers, men and women--were horribly abused and often killed by their captors. What

makes Tadic's crimes even more heinous--if true--is that he was neither a commander nor

a guard at the camp; he was one of what prosecutors at the war crimes tribunal call

"camp visitors," outsiders who only visited the camps to participate in and direct the

sadistic treatment of the prisoners--many of them their former neighbors.<P> 

Tadic has pled not guilty and claims he was not at the camps when the crimes were

committed. In November, if everything goes as scheduled, the world will find out if he's

telling the truth.<P>

And if all goes as planned, those tuning in to the trial will see well-prepared

advocates from both sides before experienced judges in a gleaming new courtroom--the

epitome of smooth-running international justice.<P> 

But the road to Tadic has been a rocky one. As you will read, for those at the tribunal

who have made the journey, who have made personal and professional sacrifices in an

attempt to bring the rule of law back to Bosnia, Tadic represents the end of a tortuous

two-and-a-half-year odyssey. "There's always been a great sense of urgency, [a sense]

that the tribunal's future depended on getting results," says Blewitt.<P>

<H3>END-RUNNING THE U.N.</H3>

The international criminal tribunal for the former Yugoslavia is in a four-story

sand-colored building in a quiet suburb of The Hague. A yellow brick drive sweeps past a

reflecting pool dotted with modern sculpture, its surface mirroring the crescent-shaped

tribunal building. Only a tiny sign confirms the tribunal's existence. From the outside,

little activity is apparent on a midsummer's day.<P> 

Inside, it's a different story. Nine teams, each with four to seven experienced lawyers

and investigators, are working furiously to put together cases and indictments. In the

course of five days of interviews at the tribunal in late June, chief prosecutor Richard

Goldstone and his deputy, Blewitt, are everywhere, poking their heads into offices,

buttonholing people in the hallways, rushing off to strategy sessions.<P> 

	With 21 indictments issued in February and March and the Tadic trial looming, the

tribunal has suddenly become a factor in the Bosnian quagmire. Will the prosecutors'

actions affect the peace process? Are they prolonging the war or shortening it?<P>

	The war crimes prosecutors don't care about those issues. In late July they raised

the stakes even higher by indicting Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and his army

commander, General Ratko Mladic, for genocide and crimes against humanity "arising from

atrocities perpetrated against the civilian population throughout Bosnia-Herzegovina,

for the sniping campaign against civilians in Sarajevo, and for the taking of U.N.

peacekeepers as hostimages and their use as human shields," according to a tribunal

press release. They also indicted Croatian Serb leader Milan Martic for ordering the

shelling of Croatia's capital, Zagreb; 15 guards, camp commanders, and visitors to the

Luka and Keraterm concentration camps; and six local Serb politicians and paramilitary

leaders for directing the ethnic cleansing of a town called Bosanski Samac.<P> 

	The tribunal's spate of pretrial proceedings, indictments, and deferral proceedings

appear to be the result of a coordinated, well-funded effort by the U.N. and the

tribunal staff. The prosecutor is chasing, catching, and trying the bad guys, just as

prosecutors do the world over.<P>

	But these recent highlights cannot obscure the tribunal's painful road to maturity.

After all, the crimes with which Dusko Tadic is charged were allegedly committed in the

spring and summer of 1992, three-and-a-half years ago. The U.N. and international

community were well aware from press reports that summer that war crimes were being

committed in the Bosnian conflict and that death camps had reappeared in Europe for the

first time since 1945. From the beginning, however, the international response was

anemic; it took a handful of determined people to push toward a fully operational

international war crimes tribunal.<P><hr size=7><FONT SIZE=+1><UL><UL><UL>IN A

PARTICULARLY NAUSEATING INCIDENT, TADIC AND OTHER SO-CALLED "CAMP VISITORS" ALLEGEDLY

FORCED ONE PRISONER TO BITE OFF THE TESTICLE OF ANOTHER--WHO ULTIMATELY DIED FROM THE

ATTACK.</UL></UL></UL></font>><HR SIZE=7><P> 

<font size=+3>T</font>>he first was law professor Cherif Bassiouni of Chicago's DePaul

University. In October 1992 the U.N. Security Council established a five-member

commission of experts to collect evidence of alleged atrocities in the former

Yugoslavia. It was a meager start: The U.N. covered only the salary of the chairman and

five staff members and the expense of traveling to the former Yugoslavia. The U.N. did

not cover the enormous cost of conducting on-site investigations, and collecting and

recording that evidence in a central database.<P>

But it was a start, and Bassiouni, an international law expert who was a member of and

later chaired the U.N. commission, worked tirelessly to collect evidence while it was

fresh, recruiting scores of volunteers and experts lent to the commission by the

governments of such countries as Canada, Norway, and the Netherlands, and private groups

like Physicians for Human Rights. The governments of Austria, Germany, and Sweden

interviewed dozens of refugees in those countries on behalf of the commission, and the

commission itself conducted 35 field investigations.<P>

Bassiouni says that from the beginning it was obvious to him that certain powerful

member states of the U.N.--such as Great Britain and France--had no appetite to pursue

war criminals. "But I found a way to end-run the pattern of delay the U.N. was engaging

in," he says. When the U.N. declined his request to set up a database collection

operation in Geneva, he set one up right at his own university in Chicago. When funding

dried up, he drummed up more by convincing certain countries to kick in to a voluntary

trust fund he says the U.N. set up at his behest.<P>

Even at this early stage, the alleged deeds of Dusko Tadic did not escape the attention

of the war crimes investigators. On October 18, 1992, <I>Newsday</I> published a story

by Roy Gutman--one in a series that won a 1992 Pulitzer Prize--on the notorious Omarska

death camp.<P>

Among the dozens of survivors' stories Gutman recounted was one involving the castration

of a man named Emir Karabasic. Prosecutors would later determine that the victim's name

was Harambasic, but the facts alleged were the same. According to Tadic's February 1995

indictment, <I>"The group of Serbs, including [Dusko] Tadic, severely beat the prisoners

with various objects and kicked them on their heads and bodies. After Fikret Harambasic

was beaten, two other prisoners, "G" and "H," were called out. A member of the group

ordered "G" and "H" to . . . sexually mutilate Fikret Harambasic. "H" covered Fikret

Harambasic's mouth to silence his screams and "G" bit off one of Fikret Harambasic's

testicles. . . . Harambasic died from the attack."</I><P>

Press reports were an important source of information for the commission. That

castration-murder described in <I>Newsday</I> was entered into Bassiouni's growing

database-an incident that would later be cross-referenced to dozens of others involving

Tadic, a caf&eacute; owner and karate teacher turned alleged camp terrorist.<P>

	Tadic had become an important blip on the embryonic tribunal's radar screen.

<H3>ELEVEN JUDGES, NO PROSECUTOR</H3>

	The Security Council officially established a war crimes tribunal for the former

Yugoslavia May 25, 1993, shortly after the U.N. had received the experts commission's

first interim report. It took another four months for 11 judges to be confirmed by the

U.N.: three from Asia, two from Europe, two from Africa, two from North

America-including one of only two women on the panel, former Houston federal district

judge Gabrielle Kirk McDonald, who will also be hearing the Tadic case--and one each

from Latin America and Australia.<P> 

Italy's Antonio Cassese was elected by his fellow judges as the tribunal's president, or

chief judge. He administers the chambers, including assignment of judges to cases, and

is himself the head of the five-judge appeals chamber. (There are two trial chambers and

one appeals chamber at the tribunal.)<P>

Interviewed in his football field-sized office at the tribunal, Cassese, 58, is a small,

expressive man who takes his job seriously. Should he lapse into lightheartedness, he

has only to glance up at his walls; four large color photos depict the dead and walking

wounded in the former Yugloslavia, and a fifth is of wasted, hollow-cheeked inmates at

Omarska. But don't all these photos of Muslim victims give the appearance of anti-Serb

bias? "No, no, no," he exclaims, his hands chopping the air for emphasis. "It doesn't

matter to me what side of the conflict they are on. These are just to remind me of the

job we have to do here."<P>

When he arrived at The Hague to be inducted as a judge in November 1993, Cassese, an

international law professor at the University of Florence who has written extensively on

war crimes, was stunned by what he found. "There was zero!" he exclaims. "Nothing! We

had four secretaries, a few computers, and the U.N. had rented a meeting room and three

small offices in the Peace Palace. The rent was paid for two weeks."<P>

Eager to fulfill his mandate, Cassese convened the first working session of the tribunal

shortly after the judges' induction ceremony. He has apparently never let up. "Some of

us were saying, 'Let's go slow,' " recalls U.S. tribunal judge McDonald. "But to be

frank, [Cassese] wanted us to accomplish something quickly."<P>

The criminal procedure rules were hashed out in two plenary sessions that resulted in a

first draft in February 1994. (By contrast, it took a committee of American judges and

law professors four <I>years</I> to draft the federal Rules of Criminal Procedure in the

early 1940s.) Since most of the judges and the acting prosecutor were from common law

countries, the code is skewed toward that adversarial model, but it has clearly defined

elements from civil jurisdictions as well, such as allowing judges to call and question

witnesses of their own accord.<P>

Next, unperturbed by what had already become a fiscal tug of war with his U.N. masters,

Cassese found bigger, more expensive space to house the tribunal-its prosecution office,

chambers, and a courtroom. He commissioned construction of a custom-designed,

state-of-the-art courtroom. An expert on detention, Cassese toured several prisons to

determine the most humane, sophisticated design, then oversaw the construction of a

modern 24-cell detention center for the tribunal's accused that was built in the center

of a Dutch prison in The Hague, where the Dutch prison's former courtyard once was.

Prisoners have their own TV, radio, and shower, but security is extremely tight.

Visitors, for example, must go through first the Dutch prison's checkpoints and then the

U.N.'s before reaching the cells housing suspected war criminals. By May 1994 the court

had also issued comprehensive rules governing the detention of accused war criminals and

the assignment of defense counsel.<P>

"We had to invent and take a fresh approach to everything," Cassese recalls.<P>

Despite Cassese's forceful leadership, a key component of the tribunal was still

missing: a chief prosecutor. The Venezuelan who had been appointed in October 1993,

Ram&oacute;n Escobar-Salom, quit in February 1994 to take a position as minister of

interior relations with his government-without having done any significant work as

prosecutor. "I thought, 'You let us down,' " declares Cassese. "We asked him to at least

recruit a deputy before he left." 

<H3>WE HAVE A POPE!</H3>

Fortunately, a thousand miles away, Graham Blewitt was casting about for a new position.

After 24 years as a prosecutor, Blewitt had spent the last five as the director of the

Nazi war crimes investigation unit of the Australian equivalent of the FBI, known as the

National Crime Authority. (The Australian government had disbanded that unit after their

third prosecution wound down in late 1993.)<P> 

Blewitt remembers the chill he felt upon reading of Serbian "ethnic cleansing" in 1992.

That precise term had been used by the Nazi-backed Croats in their vicious campaign

against Serbs during World War II; Blewitt's war crimes investigations required him to

travel to the former Yugoslavia to interview witnesses and to the Ukraine to exhume

graves. Now the witnesses were young and the graves fresh. He sent a query letter to the

U.N. in early 1994, interviewed with Escobar, and was offered the job of acting deputy

prosecutor a few days after he returned to Australia.

<P><hr size=7><FONT SIZE=+1><UL><UL><UL>WHEN HE ARRIVED AT THE HAGUE TO BE INDUCTED AS A

TRIBUNAL JUDGE, CASSESE WAS STUNNED BY WHAT HE FOUND: "THERE WAS ZERO! NOTHING! WE HAD

FOUR SECRETARIES, A FEW COMPUTERS, AND THE U.N. HAD  RENTED A MEETING ROOM AND THREE

SMALL OFFICES. . . THE RENT WAS PAID FOR TWO WEEKS."</UL></UL></UL></font>><HR

SIZE=7><P>

<FONT SIZE=+3>W</font>>hen Blewitt joined the tribunal in late February 1994, "there

were hundreds of applications from people volunteering their services," he says. To his

chagrin, however, while there were many lawyers eager to join the tribunal as either

prosecutors or investigators, few veteran investigators had applied, and they were

crucial to the next stage of the tribunal's work. The massive final report of Professor

Bassiouni's commission of experts was due to arrive in late April, including 68,000

pimages of documentary evidence and some 300 hours of video evidence. Using that report

as a "blueprint," explains Blewitt, investigators could begin to develop the tribunal's

cases.<P>

Blewitt says he started calling potential investigators throughout the world and over

the next two months convinced a handful to come. Fate intervened at that point: The

United States lent 22 lawyers, prosecutors, FBI agents, and other experts on its payroll

directly to the tribunal for as long as they were needed. "It's worth saying that

without that contribution at that time we wouldn't have started to investigate as soon

as we did," says Blewitt.<P>

Meanwhile, the U.N. Security Council continued its search for a big-name prosecutor who

could lead the tribunal toward indictments and trials. It was a ridiculous effort that

highlighted the council's inability to act on crucial global issues. According to

Professor Bassiouni--who was nominated by U.N. secretary general Boutros Boutros-Ghali

in August 1993 but failed to get enough votes in the Security Council--it was individual

member states of the council that caused the delay in appointing a prosecutor.<P> 

The council considered both formally and informally half a dozen candidates for the

office between August 1993 and the summer of 1994. These included a high-ranking

Scottish prosecutor, the attorney general of Kenya, a Canadian war crimes prosecutor, a

former attorney general of India, a Swiss vice-president of the European Commission on

Human Rights, and a high court judge from Mauritius. Some didn't want the headache of

the job; others were nixed by Security Council members. (A single member could veto any

candidate.) Covington & Burling partner Charles Ruff, a former U.S. attorney, was pushed

by the U.S. delegation and the White House, says Bassiouni. But Russia reminded the U.S.

of an informal agreement among Security Council members not to nominate candidates from

any permanent members of the council, who were deeply involved in the peace negotiations

and peacekeeping activities in the former Yugoslavia. Ruff's name was withdrawn. (Ruff

confirms he was a candidate but says he does not know why his name was withdrawn; State

Department legal adviser Conrad Harper declines to comment on the appointment process. A

senior U.N. official concedes that there is "no question that time was lost," but

attributes the delay to political wrangling within the Security Council and an

unfortunate choice in Escobar.)<P>

Cassese says he grew desperate; the rules of procedure specified that only the

prosecutor was authorized to conduct investigations and file indictments. "I was so

dejected I said, `Why don't we resign en masse to show the public we cannot go on?' "

says Cassese. Instead, he took matters into his own hands. Throughout June he called

lawyers and judges around the world that he knew from his years on international

commissions and human rights organizations, soliciting candidates. One name popped up

more than once: South African judge Richard Goldstone, darling of the antiapartheid

forces.<P> 

Goldstone had just completed his work as chair of the Goldstone Commission, a massive,

controversial three-year probe into the causes of the South African political violence

that had left scores of black South Africans dead or wounded since 1991. On July 4

Cassese informally approached Goldstone. Would he take on the job as the tribunal's

chief prosecutor?<P>

	Goldstone says he was interested but was concerned about leaving South Africa at "an

exciting and important time in its history." When he first consulted with the new

minister of justice, the difficulty of his decision was compounded: He was told that he

was one of four judges that soon would be unanimously appointed to South Africa's new

11-judge Constitutional Court. By taking the two-year stint as prosecutor, Goldstone

would lose the opportunity to participate in seminal cases in South African

constitutional history. "It'd be like missing a chance to write <I>Marbury v.

Madison,</I>" says Vernon Grigg III, Goldstone's former clerk, now at San Francisco's

Keker & Van Nest.<P>    

	Mandela, however, had a solution: Goldstone would do both. "President Mandela

thought it was important for South Africa to accept the first prominent international

job offered to a South African since our readmission to the world," recounts Goldstone.

In fact, George Bizos, Mandela's personal lawyer, says Mandela felt indebted to the U.N.

for its role in obtaining his release from prison. So it was set: Goldstone would go to

the tribunal and Mandela, by pushing through a constitutional amendment, would hold open

Goldstone's spot on the high court until his return. (The new court's judges are

appointed to seven-year terms; Goldstone will return to serve out the five years

remaining in his term.)<P>

For two days, says Cassese, he tapped his fingers and paced, waiting for an answer. On

July 6 he had it: Goldstone accepted.<P>

An ebullient Cassese rushed out faxes to the tribunal judges with a traditional message

from the Vatican heralding papal succession: <I>"Habemus papum! "</I><P> We have a pope!

<H3>THE POPE ARRIVES</H3>

Richard Goldstone, 56, can be a charming, thought-provoking conversationalist and host.

He is well-traveled, reads prodigiously--favoring thick biographies of politicians,

lawyers, and civil rights leaders--frequently dines out (as in South Africa, with a

squad of bodyguards poised nearby), and is a world-class wine connoisseur. But when it

comes to his work, Goldstone, a short, stern-faced man with a piercing gaze and an

unflappable demeanor, is all business.<P>

In fact, Goldstone's straightforward style is probably the perfect counterbalance to

that of more emotional members of the tribunal, notably Cassese. Upon arriving in The

Hague in mid-August of 1994, Goldstone recognized that his was a big-picture diplomatic

role and that the hands-on prosecution work could be pushed down to experienced

prosecutors and investigators like Blewitt--at least for the time being.<P>

"I felt that my first goal was to turn around the credibility crisis," recounts

Goldstone. "The international media had become very antagonistic because of the delays

in getting going. They had determined there was some sort of conspiracy, that the U.N.

set up the tribunal only as a conscience salver, as a bargaining chip in the peace

process."<P>

Goldstone says he gave two dozen interviews and press conferences during his first month

at the tribunal. He got out the message that the tribunal was in business and was not

conspiring to dawdle while the war criminals got away with murder. It was a comfortable

role; after all, Goldstone had made daily appearances on South African TV while he

chaired the eponymous commission that routed out the causes of South African violence

and paved the way for the 1994 elections there.<P> 



<FONT SIZE=+3>S</font>>till, the media and cynics like Cherif Bassiouni-who had had his

fingers burned by the U.N.'s seeming apathy to his work on the experts

commission-quickly put Goldstone's patience to the test.<P> 

On October 2, six weeks after he joined the tribunal, CBS television newsmagazine <I>60

Minutes</I> ran an unflattering story about the tribunal called "An Exercise in

Hypocrisy." While the tribunal and Goldstone were not faulted for the court's failure to

indict, much less try, any war criminal to date, Professor Bassiouni, former secretary

of State Lawrence Eagleburger, and John Fox, a former State Department official who had

been monitoring the former Yugoslavia, lambasted the "hopelessly complex U.N.

bureaucracy . . . intent on throttling the tribunal's every effort," in the words of

Mike Wallace.<P> 

Goldstone, recognizing that good press required tangible results, began his own push for

progress. The tribunal was still operating on a quarterly budget; every three months the

tribunal had to reapply to its U.N. paymaster for the next quarter. "Imagine how hard it

is to attract good people with that kind of job security," says Blewitt. And new hires

were subjected to the U.N.'s time-consuming, paper-intensive vetting process.<P>

Goldstone made numerous calls and two trips to New York in the fall of 1994,

ingratiating himself with  the various U.N. policy wonks who control funding, working

the maze of power and pettiness. He asserts now that he discovered that the U.N. had

<I>not</I> been consciously tugging at the new court's purse strings. "It took a while

to sort out," he says, "but it was not a question of the U.N.'s ill will. They simply

had great difficulty fitting a judicial body into the U.N. structure." A senior U.N.

official concurs with Goldstone's assessment, adding that the general assembly has made

"a real effort" to accommodate the tribunal's financial needs: "We won't pretend this

was all done impeccably, but this is the first time anything like this has been

done."<P>

Still, it wasn't a pleasant task. "Dealing with [the U.N.'s] bureaucratic rules was

extremely frustrating and time-wasting," Goldstone recalls.<P>

But Goldstone managed to convince the U.N. funding committee to give his new hires

guaranteed one-year contracts, allowing him nearly to double the tribunal from 45 to 80

employees by the end of 1994, and to grow to its current size of some 250. (In 1994 the

tribunal's budget was $11 million. For the first half of 1995 the tribunal requested and

received quarterly installments of an unapproved $28 million annual budget. That budget

was finally approved on July 18.)<P>

Goldstone also played diplomat, forging critical relationships with the U.N. High

Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC),

and the U.N. Protection Force in Bosnia (UNPROFOR). The UNHCR and ICRC monitor the

shifting Muslim and Serb populations in the wake of the Serbs' ethnic cleansing

campaigns and interview victims and witnesses to alleged atrocities. UNPROFOR, among

other things, maintains reports on the shelling of civilian targets, conducts its own

investigations of alleged war crimes, and provides protection and access to the

tribunal's investigators when they conduct investigations in the former Yugoslavia.

"Without our own police force we must convince others to perform forensics tests, etc.,

for us," says tribunal investigator J.J. Du Toit, a prosecutor who worked for the

Goldstone Commission before joining the tribunal. "[Goldstone] opened the doors to get

that information back to the tribunal."<P>

All this shuttle diplomacy to New York, London, and Geneva took Goldstone away from the

tribunal during his first two months on the job. But it was worth the payoff. "He

ensured the tribunal's survival," says senior prosecuting trial attorney Grant Niemann,

the veteran Australian prosecutor who will prosecute Tadic.<P>

With money and staffing concerns allayed, Goldstone turned next to the tribunal's

mandate, prosecuting war criminals. With no potential defendants in custody, Goldstone

considered the next best possibility, an indictment.

<H3>NO NUREMBERG</H3>

As with everything having to do with an international tribunal that attempts to meld

people from 29 different cultures into a single cohesive unit, putting together a simple

indictment can take images. The lawyers are dealing with unfamiliar crimes committed in

a foreign country, interpreting a brand-new code of evidence, working with unfamiliar

people. Their primary targets--the Bosnian Serbs--are the victors rather than the losers

of this conflict so far. And the Serbs, unlike the meticulous Germans in the last world

war, have kept no detailed accounts of their deeds. So suspects and evidence are hard to

come by. "There's no question that this is no Nuremberg," concedes senior prosecuting

trial attorney Minna Schrag.<P>

When Goldstone started looking for someone to indict in the fall of 1994, the office's

best evidence concerned Serbian ethnic cleansing activities in the Prijedor district in

northeastern Bosnia, where the Keraterm, Trnopolje, and Omarska concentration camps were

located. The commission of experts report had concentrated on that region, concluding

that the prewar population of some 53,000 non-Serbs in that region had been reduced to

approximately 2,500 by May 1994 through forcible eviction. But was there enough evidence

to indict? It depended on whom you asked.<P>

Tribunal investigator Jean-Pierre Getti, a well-known French investigating judge who

conducted the war crimes investigation of former Nazi collaborator Paul Touvier, recalls

that a healthy debate broke out at the tribunal over the standard for indicting.<P>

The civil law view, Getti explains through an interpreter, is to require "serious and

corroborated" evidence, while the common law interpretation is stricter: evidence

sufficient to establish a "prima facie" case.<P>

The prosecutors went with the more conservative common law interpretation, delaying the

first three indictments somewhat, Getti says. For the last five indictments, says Getti,

the prosecutors settled on a standard that falls somewhere between the two

interpretations.<P>

The culture clash over evidentiary standards was hardly the first dispute among the

tribunal's disparate, polyglot assemblage of lawyers, investigators, and judges. (French

and English are the official languimages of the tribunal; English is the de facto

working language.) Even the smallest details continue to be debated--and slow the pace

of the proceedings. "What form should the interviews [of witnesses] take?" queries

prosecutor Minna Schrag, now on leave from New York's Proskauer Rose Goetz & Mendelsohn,

where she is a litigation partner [In the News, April]. "What should an indictment look

like? None of the indictments we've issued has looked the same, and the next indictment

won't look like any of the previous indictments."<P>

Another member of the tribunal defends its deliberative style. Patricia Viseur Sellers,

a former Philadelphia public defender, is the tribunal's legal adviser on gender-related

crimes, namely rape. (Rape has long been categorized as a war crime or crime against

humanity under the Geneva Conventions. But the Tadic trial will be one of the first

times, say prosecutors, that rape, used as a systematic tool of terror and intimidation

against a civilian population, will be prosecuted as a war crime.) Sellers asserts that

prosecutors simply want to do things right the first time around because they "know

every step might be historically important, that they are on a world stage."<P>



<FONT SIZE=+3>N</font>>onetheless, through a process of trial and error, the kinks--for

the most part--have been eliminated from the tribunal's system of investigations and

indictment, which now works something like this: The nine investigation teams assemble

proof of the underlying crimes-evidence that includes depositions, reports by military

observers, press reports, photographs, maps, charts, autopsy reports, etc. Each team has

a data analyst to organize and ensure the chain of custody of evidence. The teams or

portions of the teams may travel to the former Yugoslavia and other countries to depose

witnesses and victims, and collect other evidence both as to the alleged crimes and on

any suspects that have emerged. (In 1994 20 three-member teams conducted field

investigations; 45 teams are expected to conduct such investigations this year, each for

an average of two weeks per month.)<P> 

The legal adviser assigned to each group works with one of the three senior prosecuting

trial attorneys to determine under which article of the tribunal's authorizing each

alleged crime falls. (Those trial attorneys, Australian Grant Niemann, American Minna

Schrag, and Swede Eric Ostberg, will lead the prosecution teams at trial.) A rape, for

example, may be a crime against humanity (Article 5) and a war crime (Article 3). An

indictment is then crafted by those attorneys that ties the acts alleged to the charge

under the statute. Commander William Fenrick, a Canadian expert on the laws of war, is

often consulted at that stage about the finer points of fitting the alleged acts into a

military context. Those preliminary indictments and the offers of proof--often hundreds

of pimages of documents and testimony--are then reviewed by deputy prosecutor Blewitt,

who in turn forwards it to chief prosecutor Goldstone for final approval.<P>

While the system sounds simple, even the smallest detail takes far more time and

resources than would be necessary, for example, in a federal criminal investigation in

the United States. Consider a simple victim or witness statement, as described by

American prosecutor Schrag. First investigators have to locate a witness to a particular

crime. Many witnesses are in refugee camps or otherwise transient and difficult to

reach. Once the witness is contacted, he or she has to agree to speak against the

perpetrator. Many with families in occupied areas fear retaliation and will not testify;

others, particularly victims, are too scarred by their experiences to do so. "These are

badly damaged people," says Tadic prosecutor Niemann.<P>

If they do agree to speak, an interpreter and two investigators must travel from the

tribunal to wherever in Europe the witness is located. As one investigator questions a

witness, the interpreter translates the Serbo-Croat into English and vice versa while

another investigator takes notes. Those notes are later typed up into a statement in

English that is then read back to the witness in Serbo-Croat for oral approval. The

witness makes adjustments, and then the final statement, in English, is signed by the

witness.<P>

In spite of these logistical obstacles, the tribunal rumbled along through the fall of

1994 and finally, on November 7, Goldstone issued his first indictment, of Susica camp

commander Dragan Nikolic.

<H3>POTEMKIN TRIBUNAL?</H3>

Nikolic was probably not the best choice for the first indictment. He had some command

responsibility for a small group of guards, and had allegedly participated in multiple

murders and torture. But he could not be charged with genocide, the crime of crimes, and

was not accused of rape--a little prosecuted international war crime that prosecutors

hoped to showcase at the tribunal as a crucial means of deterring more rapes from being

committed during the conflict. He was not even within the investigators' main region of

concentration, the Prijedor district. He also was not in custody.<P>

Did that first indictment relieve the pressure on the tribunal to get results? "Not very

much," Goldstone admits. (At press time Nikolic remained at large; the prosecution has

filed no further proceedings concerning him since his indictment.)<P>

In fact, in an interview with <I>The American Lawyer</I> shortly after the indictment

was issued, Professor Bassiouni, the former head of the commission of experts, voiced

his concern about the tribunal's ability to carry out its mandate.<P> 

"You should call your story the 'Potemkin Tribunal,' " fretted Bassiouni last November.

"They have a magnificent building in The Hague, a great prosecution team. But in the end

when you look behind that to see what's there, the answer is 'not much.' "<P>

Bassiouni suggested then that despite the Nikolic indictment, the tribunal was still

merely a facade behind which the U.N. could hide when criticized for botching its

so-called "peacekeeping" mission in the Balkans. The U.N., he posited, had no intention

of letting its own tribunal muck up the peace that some of its more powerful members,

namely France and Great Britain, were then brokering with the Serb leaders--leaders who

had been identified as probable war criminals way back in December 1992 by then--U.S.

Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger.<P>

"Even after you achieve something, people just want more," sighs Goldstone.

More, however, was just around the corner.<P> 

In February 1994 German police had arrested Dusko "Dule" Tadic in Munich, where he had

been hiding out at his brother's apartment. Refugees from the Serbian death camps now

living in Germany had spotted their tormentor and identified him to German authorities

as a Bosnian Serb who participated in a series of horrific crimes against his former

Muslim neighbors in the Prijedor district of Bosnia. (Germany arrested and charged Tadic

under international war crimes laws with aggravated assault and murder, or crimes

against humanity, as well as genocide.)<P>

Graham Blewitt had heard of Tadic's arrest long before Goldstone's arrival and had been

keeping tabs on the German proceedings. Shortly after Goldstone came on the scene in

August 1994, though, Goldstone locked in on the bird nearly in hand, shifting a team of

20 investigators, lawyers, and analysts to Tadic and others who allegedly committed

atrocities at the Omarska concentration camp in mid-1992.<P>

On November 8, the day after Nikolic was indicted, Goldstone formally asked Germany to

defer prosecution of Tadic to the tribunal. (In addition to the practical effect of

granting the tribunal exclusive jurisdiction, deferral proceedings are a potent public

relations tool, permitting the prosecution to air unsubstantiated charges against

individuals prior to their indictment and signaling the tribunal's imminent indictment

of those accused in local war crimes proceedings.) The tribunal supported its request

with 13 pieces of documentary evidence-such as maps, newspaper clippings, and

photographs-and 19 statements from witnesses scattered throughout Germany, the

Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland. But it took nearly six months for the

German parliament to pass a law permitting the transfer of the case to the

tribunal.<P><hr size=7><FONT SIZE=+1><UL><UL><UL>"THEY HAVE A MAGNIFICENT BUILDING IN

THE HAGUE, A GREAT PROSECUTION TEAM," CHARGED ONE CRITIC. "BUT IN THE END WHEN YOU LOOK

TO SEE WHAT'S THERE, THE ANSWER IS 'NOT MUCH.' "</UL></UL></UL></font>><HR SIZE=7><P>

<FONT SIZE=+3>M</font>>eanwhile, pressure on the prosecutors to act came from a

surprising new quarter: the tribunal judges. On February 1 president Cassese issued an

odd press release on the judges' behalf in which they "wished to express their concern

about the urgency with which appropriate indictments should be issued," and that went on

to state that the judges "were anxious that a programme of indictments should

effectively meet the expectations of the Security Council and of the world community at

large."<P> 

The release is pure Cassese: prickly, brazen, impassioned. But it also betrays Cassese's

civil law roots, where the prosecutor and the judges are often more or less on the same

side, as well as perhaps the hubris and inexperience of a law professor turned judge.<P> 

Prosecutors who had been in the trenches for months weren't pleased. "They were

impatient and frustrated," says Blewitt. "But we were already aware of the urgency of

getting some results. We thought it was a useless statement."<P>

Indeed, two other judges interviewed for this article, McDonald and Malaysian judge Lal

Vohrah--both from common law countries--say they do not believe it is their role to tell

the prosecutor how to do his job. "We want to work, to try cases," says Vohrah, 61, a

thoughtful, articulate jurist who gave up a spot on what is now Malaysia's highest court

to join the tribunal. "But who is to be prosecuted is not our responsibility." (Vohrah,

in fact, says he does not remember if he discussed Cassese's release before it went

public.)<P>

Goldstone is diplomatically taciturn on the topic, noting only that he had spoken to

Cassese before the statement was released and agreed that issuing indictments of the

leaders with command responsibility as soon as possible was a goal. He declines

otherwise to comment, noting that the relationship between the prosecutors and the

judges was a "sensitive one that was not a matter for public debate."<P>

	Cassese makes no apologies. "Nikolic was small fry," he contends. "Allegedly he

killed a few people. Minor thugs who rape or kill, without command responsibility,

should be [handled] by the state courts." (The indictment does specifically refer to

Nikolic's command responsibility as camp commander; and includes eight counts of

murder.)<P> 

	The tension between the two men and their departments now seems to be subsiding. But

Judge McDonald's delicate assessment? "Let's just say that relations between the office

of the prosecutor and the judges have not been as close as they were in the past."<P>

Whether or not it was Cassese's doing, the tribunal did blast into action shortly after

this intramural spat. 

<H3>THE TURNING POINT</H3>

On February 13 the tribunal indicted Tadic and his 20 death camp colleagues--the

commander, guards, and several Serb visitors to Omarska. In April Germany turned Tadic

over to the tribunal in The Hague, where he became the sole occupant of Cassese's

twenty-first-century detention center. The tribunal finally had a defendant in

custody.<P>

In May Goldstone dropped two bombshells. First, he expanded the tribunal's prosecutorial

scope by requesting Bosnian authorities to cease their own prosecution in the Lasva

River Valley investigation. That investigation--into the April 1993 slaughter of some

114 Muslim women, children, and old men from the village of Ahmici, Bosnia, in front of

scores of survivors and other witnesses--targeted Bosnian Croats. Previously, all 21 of

those indicted by the tribunal were Bosnian Serbs. It was a carefully calculated move by

Goldstone: "It's crucial that the mechanism is perceived as fair by all sides" to the

conflict, he explains, in order to "break through the endless cycle of atrocity and

revenge."<P> 

Goldstone had again taken a page from his South African experience investigating the

causes of political violence. "He recognized that the credibility of the tribunal

depended on demonstrating we would go after Croats, Serbs, and Muslims alike," says

deputy prosecutor Blewitt.<P>

Then, a week after the Lasva Valley deferral application was filed last May, Goldstone

filed a controversial deferral application with the Bosnian war crimes commission

related to the Bosnian Serb leadership--namely Karadzic, General Mladic, and former

police chief Mico Stanisic. (Bosnia has set up its own war crimes commission and was

then in the process of investigating the Bosnian Serb leadership.) The application

specifically mentioned investigating their command responsibility for "genocide, other

serious offenses against civilians, and destruction of cultural and historical

monuments," as well as the "protracted siege of Sarajevo and the unlawful attacks upon

civilian members of humanitarian agencies, members of the United Nations peacekeeping

forces, aid convoys, and aircraft at Sarajevo."<P>

The peace negotiators instantly expressed their distress at Goldstone's timing. "This

decision could damage the peace efforts in the Balkans," warned a spokesman for the

Russian foreign ministry. A cease-fire was on the verge of expiring; negotiators now

faced the prospect of making a new deal with named war crimes suspects. To add insult to

injury, Goldstone announced that the suspects would likely face indictments by the end

of the year.<P> 

At an April 24 press conference, according to a wire report from Agence France-Presse,

Goldstone had a simple response to the supposed political inconvenience of his

announcement: "We're not politicians, we're lawyers."<P>

With the Tadic arraignment, the deferral applications, and nine investigation teams

churning toward more indictments, the image of the tribunal as a do-nothing Security

Council lapdog has been vanquished, possibly forever. Even Professor Bassiouni voices

cautious optimism on the future of the tribunal: "I think there is a momentum building

in world public opinion, a moral drive by the media, [the human rights] community, and

scholars to give legitimacy and credibility to this tribunal."<P>

Since April, in fact, the tribunal has had enough activity from Tadic alone to keep up a

steady trickle of good press. In June the trial chamber heard motions on the protection

of victims and witnesses in the case. In July the court heard a defense motion

challenging its jurisdiction; on August 10 the tribunal denied the defense motion. The

court will soon hear defense motions to exclude testimony obtained from the German

prosecutors and on double jeopardy. (The defense claims that because German authorities

had commenced judicial proceedings against Tadic, the tribunal is precluded from trying

him.)<P>

On July 25 the tribunal indicted the Bosnian Serb leadership, Karadzic and General

Mladic, for their command responsibility for the commission of genocide, war crimes, and

crimes against humanity. (Karadzic, Mladic, and 43 other war crimes indictees are still

at large in Serbian-held areas of Bosnia or Croatia. Not surprisingly, Karadzic does not

recognize the tribunal's competence and has said he will not turn over his citizens to

stand trial.) Decisions, appeals, and perhaps more indictments can be expected to keep

the tribunal in the public eye sporadically until November. With no other suspects in

custody, prosecutors may also consider filing a Rule 61 proceeding for some of those

indicted, such as Susica camp commander Dragan Nikolic.<P>

<font size=+3>R</font>>ule 61 of the tribunal's code of criminal procedure is the common

law answer to trials in absentia. It permits the prosecutor, after trying and failing to

get jurisdiction over an indictee, to put on his entire case against that suspect, in

public, before the tribunal. Witnesses may be called and evidence entered. If there are

reasonable grounds for concluding that the accused committed the crimes indicated, the

tribunal says so and issues an international arrest warrant. "It literally turns those

indicted into international fugitives," says Goldstone.<P>

If a U.N. member state refuses to turn over the subject of the arrest warrant, the

matter is referred to the Security Council, which may consider imposing sanctions

against the offending state.<P> 

The net effect of Rule 61 is to air allegations and, more importantly, to restrict the

accused to their own country. If they travel to or through any of the 185 U.N. member

states, they are subject to arrest. "Sooner or later we will [get custody of more

alleged war criminals]," says Minna Schrag, the American prosecutor. "Because we keep

getting information on people who travel."<P>

But for now the tribunal has a far more interesting proceeding to pursue: the Tadic

trial.<P>

<H3>ALLEGED BLOOD LUST</H3>

Dusko Tadic would have been cut from the first casting call to play a war criminal in

the 1961 movie <I>Judgment at Nuremberg.</I> The somber, shifty-eyed man in the dock

during the pre-trial proceedings (a Dustin Hoffman look-alike) looks more like an

insurance or car salesman than a war criminal.<P>

Yet court papers and press reports paint a picture of Tadic as a thuggish part-time

karate instructor and caf&eacute; owner in the town of Kozarac, who rose to power in the

local Serbian Democratic Party as pan-Serb nationalism exploded in late 1991. Even the

photographs of Tadic taken prior to his arrest suggest a burlier, more dangerous person

than the cowed man in the button-down shirts now appearing at the tribunal.<P>

He was described by one Muslim refugee as an arrogant, vengeful man who liked to show

off his martial arts skill. "He was known around Kozarac as gratuitously violent, ready

to beat up those who had slighted him," <I>The New York Times Magazine</I> reported last

October. "And he was financially vulnerable, in debt to Muslim acquaintances."<P>

The stage was set, then, for Tadic to strike back at his perceived enemies when the

Serbs seized control of Kozarac and other towns in the Prijedor area in early 1992.

According to the declaration that war crimes prosecutor Michael Keegan filed in Tadic's

November 8 deferral proceeding (which summarized the testimony of dozens of witnesses

and several documents), "although [Tadic] had very good relations with the Muslim

population prior to 1992, at the start of the tensions in the area, he banned Muslims

from his caf&eacute;."<P>

When the policy of ethnic cleansing was instituted to rid the Prijedor region of

non-Serbs, Tadic became one of its chief proponents. "Eyewitness accounts identify Tadic

as being personally involved in the forced removal of Muslims from the Prijedor area and

the looting and destruction of Muslim homes," Keegan attested.<P>

Prosecutors claim Tadic, a married father of two, became his former Muslim neighbors'

worst nightmare.<P> 

According to Keegan's declaration, Tadic had served as a local policeman and was an

officer in the reserve militia. After the conflict broke out, he assisted local Serb

commanders who were compiling a death list of the area's intellectuals, civic leaders,

and prominent Muslims. When the death camps like Omarska opened in early 1992, many of

their first prisoners were on these lists and were allegedly killed or have since

disappeared.<P>

<hr size=7><UL><UL><UL><font size=+1>TRIBUNAL PROSECUTORS WANT TO DO THINGS RIGHT THE

FIRST TIME AROUND, SAYS ONE OF THE TRIBUNAL'S LEGAL ADVISERS, BECAUSE THEY "KNOW EVERY

STEP MIGHT BE HISTORICALLY IMPORTANT, THAT THEY ARE ON A WORLD

STAGE."</font>></ul></ul></ul> <hr size=7><P> 

<font size=+3>I</font>>n May 1992, according to Tadic's indictment, Serb forces rounded

up all Bosnian Muslims and Croats in the Kozarac area and marched them into the city of

Prijedor, where they boarded buses for the various camps that had been set up in the

Prijedor <I>opstina.</I><P>

In a similar incident in June, Tadic allegedly forcibly removed 13 unarmed non-Serb men

from their homes, made the victims "lie on the ground, beat them with thick wooden

sticks, kicked them, and then took them from the village to an unknown location,"

according to the indictment.<P>

The Keegan declaration alleges that the worst of Tadic's sadistic activities took place

at the Omarska death camp, which he visited "almost daily (or nightly)." Omarska was an

abandoned iron ore complex. The 5,000 prisoners who reportedly passed through lived in

inconceivably inhumane conditions. Many were held in an open ore pit, with no shelter,

no toilets, and little food or water. Tadic held no rank in the Bosnian Serb army and

was not part of the camp's Serbian staff. Yet he allegedly often wore a camouflage

uniform (and occasionally a black mask) and directed the activities of the men who

accompanied him and the camp guards. "Tadic was also seen in the presence of the camp

commander, giving directions to camp staff on the arrival of new prisoners," alleged

Keegan.<P>

The Keegan declaration claims that Tadic "beat and tortured prisoners on a daily basis

and is personally responsible for the murder of more than ten prisoners. . . ." The

indictment zeroes in on six incidents in which Tadic is accused of raping one woman,

murdering 13 men, and torturing those men and scores of others. And then, of course,

there is the alleged castration incident.<P>

According to the indictment, in late June 1992 Tadic and other Serbian camp visitors

entered a large building at Omarska known as the "hangar" and called five prisoners out

of their rooms by name. The <I>Times Magazine </I>noted that three of those men were

supposed rivals of Tadic for women or karate championships. One, according to a report

in <I>Newsday,</I> may have been a policeman with whom Tadic had had a run-in prior to

the war.<P> 

Tadic and others then "severely beat the prisoners with various objects and kicked them

on their heads and bodies," the indictment charges. After Fikret Harambasic was beaten,

two more prisoners, identified in the indictment as "G" and "H," were allegedly called

out. What happened next, as asserted by G himself, was a spectacle so traumatic, so

nauseating, that it "shattered camp morale," according to the <I>Times Magazine.</I><P>

One Serb, the indictment continues, "ordered G and H to lick Harambasic's buttocks and

genitals and then to sexually mutilate Harambasic. H covered Harambasic's mouth to

silence his screams and G bit off one of Harambasic's testicles."<P> 

The versions of the story contained in the <I>Times Magazine,</I> the <I>Newsday</I>

account, Keegan's declaration, and the indictment vary in minor details. But the end

result is uncontroverted, at least among these accounts, which Tadic denies. Harambasic

was castrated; he and two other prisoners who had been beaten unconscious with metal

rods, truncheons, and knives died from their injuries.<P> 

Tadic has pled not guilty to all charges and claims all these accounts of his activities

are untrue. "His main defense will be the defense of alibi, that he was not at the

places at the times alleged," says his lead defense counsel, Dutchman Michail

Wladimiroff.<P>

The prosecutors, led by senior prosecuting trial attorney Grant Niemann, expect to put

50 to 60 witnesses on the stand who will testify otherwise. "The evidence is quite

good," says Niemann.<P>

<H3>POST-TADIC?</H3>

Grant Niemann, 45, is well-suited to prosecute the first international war crimes case

in 50 years. One of the first prosecutors to arrive at the tribunal, in June 1994, he

immediately began working on the prosecution of ethnic cleansing and the war crimes

committed in the Prijedor section of Bosnia, where Tadic allegedly committed his

crimes.<P>

A stocky, ruddy-complexioned Australian with wavy white hair tucked back behind his

ears, Niemann comes off as a pugnacious prosecutor but also a compassionate advocate for

the war crimes victims. That soft center is perhaps unsurprising for a lawyer who spent

his early years representing aboriginals in their land claims against the Australian

government. And the gruff exterior can likewise be traced to his past: as the equivalent

of the U.S. attorney in Adelaide from 1985 to 1994, Niemann tried two Nazi war crimes

cases and assisted on a third. (The first ended in an acquittal; the second was

adjourned for lack of evidence and the third was terminated after the defendant suffered

a heart attack and was deemed unfit to stand trial.)<P>

	According to Niemann, the decision to indict and try Tadic was, in one respect, an

easy one. In stark contrast to the 21 other indicted war criminals, Tadic was in

custody. It didn't hurt that the Tadic files were fairly complete. "The Germans had done

a very good and very thorough investigation themselves and turned their material over to

us," says Niemann.<P>

	Still, Goldstone has repeatedly said that the tribunal's resources do not permit it

to go after low-level players. Where does Tadic fit into that grand scheme?<P>

Goldstone admits the obvious: You have to start somewhere. "Witnesses can only implicate

those they came into contact with on a local level," he explains. "Some of the leaders

are saying that the events were random and unplanned. We need to establish a pattern of

activity." And, he adds, go after people involved at a local level, like Tadic.<P>

The Tadic case, Goldstone and Niemann acknowledge, may not exactly open the judicial

floodgates; at press time he was the sole defendant in the tribunal's custody. And the

trial of a single man is, of course, only a small step toward justice and accountability

in the Balkans. "It'd be nice to know what happens after the first case ends," says

Niemann. "It'd be nice to have them lined up."<P>

But if Tadic is the only trial, it will be that much more important.  Because at the

very least "we expose those who committed the crimes to public scrutiny," explains

tribunal president Cassese. "And with the international community so totally impotent to

deal with these crimes otherwise, this result is not so meager."<P>

And more importantly, the Tadic trial, beamed throughout the world by satellite, could

send a message to the Serbs, Croats, and Bosnians--and for that matter, citizens of

every country--that war crimes will not be tolerated, that whether it is next week or

ten years from now, those who step over the bounds of acceptable behavior may end up

being held accountable for their actions.<P> 

As Judge McDonald succinctly puts it: "We are here to tell people that the rule of law

has to be respected."

vlink=0000ff><img width=100 height=92 border=0 align=left src="/images/spt2.gif" alt=" *

">

After the death of Jeffrey Dahmer a dispute has ensued as to the final disposition of

his brain. Joyce Flint, Dahmer's natural mother, has entered a motion to have his brain

turned over to the <a href=http://www.dml.georgetown.edu/gumc.html>Georgetown Medical

Center</a> for scientific research. A researcher, Dr. Jonathon Pincus, states that the

opportunity to study the brain "represents an unparalleled chance to possibly determine

what neurological factors could have contributed to his bizarre criminal behavior."

Dahmer's father opposes the motion, arguing that his son's will, which asked that his

body be cremated "as soon as possible," should be honored. As Lionel Dahmer points out,

"The brain is part of his body. That's all." After this hearing, the judge has asked for

further details of the study to be conducted on Jeffrey Dahmer's brain before issuing a

ruling.

<H3>TRANSCRIPT OF PROCEEDINGS</H3>



(11:10 a.m.  Mr. Dahmer via speaker phone.) 

<P>

<B>THE COURT:</b>  All right.  This is in the

matter of the Estate of Jeffrey L. Dahmer.  It's Case Number 94-PR-175.  Appearing here

today on a motion is Attorney Robert Fennig, is that correct?  

<P>

<B>MR. FENNIG:</b>    That's correct.

<P>

<B>THE COURT:</b>  And you are appearing on behalf of Mr. Dahmer's mother --  

<P>

<B>MR. FENNIG:</b>    Joyce Flint. 

<P>

<B>THE COURT:</b>  -- Joyce Flint. 

And telephonically we have the father of Jeffrey Dahmer appearing personally.  Your name

is Lionel Dahmer, correct?  

<P>

<B>MR. DAHMER:</b>    Correct. 

<P>

<B>THE COURT:</b>  And are you there with an

attorney, or are you on your own? 

<P>

<B>MR. DAHMER:</b>    I am on my own. 

<P>

<B>THE COURT:</b>  Okay. 

<P>

Any other appearances on behalf of any other party?  Appears to be no other interested

parties present in the courtroom. 

<P>

We have a motion brought on by Mr. Fennig on behalf of Ms. Flint to have Jeffrey

Dahmer's brain, as I understand it, turned over for purposes of scientific research. 

And based on correspondence that I have received from Lionel Dahmer, that is opposed by

him.  

<P>

Is that correct, Mr. Dahmer? 

<P>

<B>MR. DAHMER:</b>    That is correct, Judge. 

<P>

<B>THE COURT:</b>  Okay.  Mr. Fennig, before we went on the record here today I provided

you with copies of the correspondence that the Court had received from Lionel Dahmer. 

Although they had been received some days ago, I had not had an opportunity to see them

until today, having been out of the office for the last week.  

<P>

Have you had an opportunity to review them?  

<P>

<B>MR. FENNIG:</b>    I have looked at them in the short time that I've been here.  And

I didn't get any of these sent to my office either, so this came as a -- no surprise,

but it -- I didn't get any other notice that there would be opposition to the motion.  

<P>

<B>THE COURT:</b>  Okay. 

<P>

<B>MR. FENNIG:</b>    If I may? 

<P>

<B>THE COURT:</b>  Hang on just a moment.

<P>

Mr. Dahmer, I want to touch base with you momentarily.  Are you hearing Mr. Fennig? 

<P>

<B>MR. DAHMER:</b>    Barely.  I can pick up a little bit of what he's saying.  I think

he said that he did not receive any correspondence.  Of course, I've been at a business

meeting, and I have sent you two pieces of information, faxes, on September 8th and

October 1st.  

<P>

<B>THE COURT:</b>  Okay.  The -- those have been received by the Court.  But like I

indicated, I didn't read them until today and they were provided to Mr. Fennig today. 

<P>

Mr. Fennig, are you prepared to go forward on your motion?  

<P>

<B>MR. FENNIG:</b>    Yes.  Would it accommodate<P>

Mr. Dahmer, if I got closer to the bar?  

<P>

<B>THE COURT:</b>  It may help to some degree.  That's a fairly good microphone system,

but it's not perfect obviously.  

<P>

(Mr. Fennig approaches Bench)

<P>

<B>MR. FENNIG:</b>    Mr. Dahmer, tell me if you can hear me better now.  

<P>

<B>MR. DAHMER:</b>    That's better.

<P>

<B>THE COURT:</b>  Okay.  Go ahead then.

<P>

<B>MR. DAHMER:</b>    Not perfect, but better.

<P>

<B>MR. FENNIG:</b>    Well, we'll use what we have.  

<P>

This motion, as the papers indicate, is

brought by Joyce Flint, the natural mother of the decedent in this matter.  

<P>

After the autopsy there remained brain and other tissue that was kept under the care and

supervision of Dr. Robert W. Huntington at the University of Wisconsin Medical School. 

And he had these tissues under lock and key in one of the University Hospitals in

Madison.  

<P>

Attempts were made to contact him by my

client back in June with the thought of submitting this tissue for scientific study.  It

was indicated by Dr. Huntington that he would not release the tissue unless there was

some authoritative decision made in that regard.  

<P>

Mrs. Flint had been trying to contact       Mr. Dahmer by telephone, and she used other

parties to attempt to contact him.  She never got a response by any of her phone calls. 

Now from what I have read from Mr. Dahmer, he denies getting any phone calls.  

<P>

<B>MR. DAHMER:</b>    That's not true. 

<P>

<B>THE COURT:</b>  Okay. 

<P>

<B>MR. FENNIG:</b>    Would you let me finish,

Mr. Dahmer? 

<P>

<B>MR. DAHMER:</b>    I didn't know that I wasn't supposed to respond in kind during the

speaking.  

<P>

<B>THE COURT:</b>  Okay.  Let me explain how we will run the procedure here today.  



First of all, Mr. Fennig is going to be allowed to present his argument.  Then, Mr.

Dahmer, I will hear from you before rendering any kind of decision.  Because Mr. Fennig

is the moving party, he will then have a final rebuttal opportunity after you have

spoken.  

<P>

<B>MR. DAHMER:</b>    Okay, that's fine. 

<P>

<B>THE COURT:</b>  If you can keep your comments until I address you, and then I will

hear your argument in total.  

<P>

<B>MR. DAHMER:</b>    The only problem I have is

remembering -- if it gets too long -- remembering where I was going to respond.  

<P>

<B>THE COURT:</b>  Okay. 

<P>

<B>MR. DAHMER:</b>    Okay. 

<P>

<B>MR. FENNIG:</b>    I'll keep it quite brief. 

The -- based on nonresponses from Mr. Dahmer to Ms. Flint, it was suggested by

contacting my office and I represented her back in November immediately after the

situation at the -- at the jail.  And I advised her that I would call Dr. Huntington and

find out what it took to see to it that there may be a possibility of this occurring and

under what circumstances Dr. Huntington would agree to it.  

<P>

I was then made aware that Mrs. Flint had contacted the Georgetown University Medical

Center, and this was made by reference from some folks out in California.  And Dr.

Pincus has a widely known reputation in pathological neurological study.  

<P>

I was -- I was advised that Dr. Pincus had grant money to take care of the

transportation and the research at hand.  

<P>

I wrote to Dr. Huntington about this, and he said he would accept that if I could get a

Court order with respect to that.  I -- when I was here on the September 6th motion that

was brought by all the claimants in the estate, I then secured a court date for this

motion and mailed it to all the interested parties as shown on my certificate of

mailing.  That was sent out, I believe, on the 12th.  And Mr. Dahmer -- Mr. Dahmer got

that, by acknowledgment in his letter, on the 18th. I contacted Dr. Huntington and

advised him what Dr. Pincus was available -- I mean Dr. Pincus was available to accept

this tissue.  I contacted Dr. Huntington who asked me for authority from Dr. Pincus. 

Dr. Pincus give gave me a fax which I am showing to the Court now.  

<P>

<B>THE COURT:</b>  Let's have it marked as an

exhibit. 

<P>

<B>MR. FENNIG:</b>    And it's, I believe, short

enough to read. 

<P>

(Exhibit marked) 

<P>

<B>THE COURT:</b>  Are there any other exhibits contemplated? 

<P>

<B>MR. FENNIG:</b>    Just one more. 

<P>

<B>THE COURT:</b>  Have it marked. 

<P>

(Exhibit marked) 

<P>

<B>THE COURT:</b>  Okay.  The first exhibit, for your benefit, Mr. Dahmer, is on

letterhead from the Georgetown University Medical Center and bears the signature of Dr.

-- I'm assuming doctor?  Yes.  

<P>

<B>MR. FENNIG:</b>    Pincus. 

<P>

<B>THE COURT:</b>  There it is, Jonathan Pincus. 

<P>

"I am grateful for this opportunity to study the brain of Jeffrey Daumer (sic).  It

represents an unparalleled chance to possibly determine what neurological factors could

have contributed to his bizarre criminal behavior. 

<P>

"We will be glad to examine the brain tissue microscopically at Georgetown University. 

My grant will guarantee payment for the safe transportation of the brain in formaldehyde

to my office at Georgetown University School of Medicine in Washington D.C."  

<P>

That's the extent of that exhibit.  Go on, Mr. Fennig.  

<P>

<B>MR. FENNIG:</b>    Well, in answer, after I

transmitted that fax of that letter to

Dr. Huntington, he called me.  We had a

conversation, and I requested something in writing from his office with respect do Dr.

Pincus' offer.  And that is Exhibit 2.  And that I believe is short enough to read, as

well.  If you would?  

<P>

<B>THE COURT:</b>  Exhibit Number 2 has been given to the Court.  It is on University of

Wisconsin Madison Medical School letterhead, bears the signature of Robert Huntington

who is identified as an associate professor and who did the post-mortem.  It reads as

follows: 

<P>

"Dear Attorney Fennig, Thank you for

forwarding the letter for Dr. Pincus.  My original thought was to have the brain

carefully studied at McLean Hospital in Boston.  I am not acquainted with Dr. Pincus and

his studies.  

<P>

"The brain of Mr. Dahmer is to be studied carefully, as I would hope, I would also hope

that scrupulous care be exercised against any premature conclusions. 

<P>

"Mr. Dahmer's brain should, I would submit, be carefully compared against the range of

brains from persons who exhibited normal and those showing severely antisocial behavior. 

In other words, I submit that concluding anything from this one brain by itself is

perilous and antiscientific.  If Dr. Pincus observes such scientific conditions, I would

see no problem, on my part alone, in submitting that brain to his study.  Sincerely." 

And this bears Huntington's signature.  

<P>

Go on. 

<P>

<B>MR. FENNIG:</b>    Now the matter with respect to Mrs. Flint is that we have -- we

have gone through the cremation process, which happened within the past two or three

weeks.  And this ultimate disposition of what is left of the remains of her son would

bring final closure to her, at least.  And -- and I believe there would be no other

means to do it better than this.  

<P>

It would satisfy her.  It would not be in -- against any interests of the public.  In

fact, I think the public may benefit from it.  And I don't believe it would be in the --

against any interests of Mr. Dahmer, the decedent himself, to have this done.  

<P>

If you recall, by the means of his will -- 

<P>

And I bring that up because Mr. Lionel Dahmer made reference to it stating that any --

any such disposal, either by cremation or the way we are asking for it, would be against

what he set forth in his will.  Mr. -- He also indicated that he didn't want to have any

funeral services.  And   Mr. Dahmer had, if you will recall, had a memorial service

within a couple of days after his death.  

<P>

The point is, really, closure for  Mrs. Flint.  I think this would put her at rest.  It

would satisfy her to the point that some good has come out of all of this bad news in

the last couple of years.  

<P>

And for that reason her request is not

outrageous.  Her request is for the scientific --  whatever scientific good can be made

of this and I think deserves consideration by the Court.  

<P>

<B>THE COURT:</b>  Okay.  Mr. Dahmer, I will hear from you. 

<P>

<B>MR. DAHMER:</b>    Okay.  As to Joyce Flint

contacting me personally, as she had said, she has had no response to her personal

attempts.  There were no personal attempts.  I addressed that in my October 1st fax to

you, Judge.  

<P>

<B>THE COURT:</b>  Okay.  Mr. Dahmer, just for your information and to shorten up any

kind of argument that we might have here, the fact that Joyce Flint may or may not have

attempted to get your position on this matter or any kind of negotiations really has

nothing to do with the Court's decision and isn't important to me.  

<P>

<B>MR. DAHMER:</b>    I feel it's irrelevant, too.  But I just wanted to answer that,

remember when I broke in just a little bit ago.  

<P>

<B>THE COURT:</b>  Right.  Okay, go ahead.  On the merits of the matter then.  

<P>

<B>MR. DAHMER:</b>    Okay.  I think I probably

summarized the main point of disregarding Jeff's instructions in his last testament, and

I feel that that should take precedent.  It's not a matter, I feel, of whether I do or

don't want scientific study.  I personally have strong feelings regarding the

nonefficacious character of that proposal.  But that's neither here nor there. I feel --

I feel that the main point is what his last wishes were, and to violate that would be

legally wrong.  

<P>

<B>THE COURT:</b>  Okay.  Mr. -- 

<P>

<B>MR. DAHMER:</b>    I could go on and on regarding the efficacious or nonefficacious

character of the study, but I would rather -- I'm more of a writing person as opposed to

an articulate on the spot  verbal person, and I would rather put that in writing.  But I

want to emphasize at this moment  the compliance with his last testament, as for anyone.  

<P>

<B>THE COURT:</b>  Mr. Fennig? 

<P>

<B>MR. FENNIG:</b>    If I can refer to his last

testament.  Page two of his Will, paragraph 4, he stated, "Upon my death I wish for the

body to be cremated as soon as possible.  I do not want a funeral ceremony to be

performed before or after the cremation.  No open casket.  No headstone or marker." 

<P>

If you will recall, Mr. -- Mr. Dahmer saw to a memorial service within days of the death

of Jeffrey. And if he wants to go literally, he violated what he is now claiming would

be a violation of the intentions of the decedent.  So I think that's close to being

doublespeak.  

<P>

So, I think we do have a very good

possibility that possibly something good can come of this by this scientific study.  And

for that reason, the motion has been made.  

<P>

<B>THE COURT:</b>  Mr. Dahmer, I'll give you one brief opportunity to respond if you

wish.  

<P>

<B>MR. DAHMER:</b>    Okay.  As to the funeral

service, it was a private memorial service for my immediate family.  And if he wants to

argue to  that point and seize upon that point, then he may want to prosecute me

regarding that.  But we are talking about the disposal of the wishes of Jeff for

cremation of his body.  The brain is part of his body.  That's all.  

<P>

<B>THE COURT:</b>  Okay.  The Court has heard

argument concerning this matter.  And I have received -- or actually will state now that

I will receive Exhibit 1 and 2 from the two respective physicians or doctors involved in

this matter,   Dr. Huntington and Dr. Pincus.  

<P>

The Court recognizes a rather unusual situation here.  It's one that I have certainly

never encountered before and probably won't again. 

<P>

We do have competing interests from the two parents of the deceased.  Those positions

have been expressed here today.  There is in essence a balancing test that the Court

needs to perform. 

<P>

I recognize the statement of the wishes of Jeffrey Dahmer.  It was contained in a

document entitled his Last Will and Testament.  And although it is not technically a

legal will from the standpoint of disposition of any of his property, it's not

officially been admitted to probate.  In fact, there was a stipulation and agreement by

all parties that it wouldn't constitute a legal will of sorts with any sort of

dispositive effect on what to do with his remains.  Nonetheless, it is an expression

that the Court gives some consideration to of the deceased's wishes as to what's to be

done with his body.  

<P>

And that certainly is a factor that the Court takes into consideration here.  

<P>

I am also concerned with the issue of closure.  This is a difficult situation in our

human existence, so to speak.  It's a rather evil chapter.  And I believe that it would

be beneficial to the public and to all concerned that there be closure, and that this

matter be resolved once and for all, and that we move on.  

<P>

There also obviously is some interest from a scientific standpoint.  And perhaps there

is some good that could come from an otherwise particularly vile series of events. 

Perhaps there is some type of scientific research that could be conducted that might

shed some kind of light on why acts of this nature occurred.  

<P>

However, the Court is again looking at a balancing kind of test there in terms of the

potential good and bad that could come from the research.  There is -- or there are many

different types of scientific research that can be conducted and many different levels

of research that can occur from good to bad in range. 

<P>

The Court is extremely concerned over the potential for exploitation of this type of

research.  I am very concerned and I have made some notes of my own, which pretty much

coincided with the kinds of concerns raised by Dr. Huntington. 

<P>

I am very fearful over the type of inquiry that's going to be made into this analysis. 

What sort of comparisons are going to be made?  What sort of samples of population we

are dealing with in terms of comparing the tissue from Mr. Dahmer's brain to other types

of brains, brains from other individuals.  I don't know what is contemplated, and I am

extremely concerned about the propriety of the handling of this issue and the avoidance

of exploitation from the standpoint of any kind of pop research, pop psychology, that

kind of thing.  

<P>

So what I would like to do, Mr. Fennig, is I would like something from Dr. Pincus that

would enlighten this Court in greater detail as to where we are going with this. 

Preferably I would like an opportunity to have him testify, which could be done by

telephone just as Mr. Dahmer is participating here today.  What I would like you to do

is contact Mr. Pincus -- or Dr. Pincus and find out what his availability is and find

out whether he would be willing to submit a more detailed analytical approach as to what

direction he intends to take with his analysis, and preferably whether he would be

willing to testify by telephone. 

<P>

And after hearing that I would be inclined to make a decision with respect to what to do

with this material.  Because at this point to just carte blanche say, here you go, do

with it as you wish, is beyond what this Court is willing to tolerate.  And we could end

up with a situation that digresses considerably from the purpose that is contemplated.  

<P>

So, Mr. Dahmer, -- 

<P>

<B>MR. DAHMER:</b>    Yes? 

<P>

<B>THE COURT:</b>  -- I will be getting some kind of feedback from Attorney Fennig

concerning Dr. Pincus' position, at which time we will be doing some scheduling of

another hearing of this nature.  And between now and then I would also invite you to, as

you indicated during your argument here today --  

<P>

<B>MR. DAHMER:</b>    Yes. 

<P>

<B>THE COURT:</b>  -- you would like to present further written argument to me, feeling

that you can do so in a more effective manner than speaking --  

<P>

<B>MR. DAHMER:</b>    Well, the fact is I've been sitting up at night in a motel room

typing.  

<P>

<B>THE COURT:</b>  I recognize the difficulty in terms of responding --  

<P>

<B>MR. DAHMER:</b>    Thank you. 

<P>

<B>THE COURT:</b>  -- extemporaneously here today.  So between now and the next hearing,

if in fact we are to have another hearing --    I would contemplate such depending on

what Dr. Pincus is going to tell us.  Between now and then you may submit anything in

writing. 

<P>

You have received notice from Mr. Fennig of today's proceedings, correct?  

<P>

<B>MR. DAHMER:</b>    Yes. 

<P>

<B>THE COURT:</b>  So you have his address. 

<P>

Anything you send to the Court should likewise be copied to Mr. Fennig.  

<P>

<B>MR. DAHMER:</b>    I certainly will. 

<P>

<B>THE COURT:</b>  That will terminate then today's proceedings.  Mr. Fennig, if you

would contact my scheduling clerk after you've received information from Dr. Pincus and

arrange for another hearing of this nature, she will be able to accommodate you.  Any

questions?  

<P>

<B>MR. FENNIG:</b>    Just one thing.  I think what I will also get will be a vitae with

respect to Dr. Pincus' qualifications. 

<P>

<B>MR. DAHMER:</b>    I'm sorry.  I can't hear that.  

<P>

<B>THE COURT:</b>  What he's saying is he would attempt to get a vitae -- curriculum

vitae, a resume, whatever you want to call it -- from Dr. Pincus. 

That would be very helpful for the Court, as well. 

<P>

<B>MR. FENNIG:</b>    And I will send it to Mr. Dahmer prior to the hearing.  

<P>

<B>THE COURT:</b>  Anything Mr. Fennig sends to the Court will likewise be sent to you,

Mr. Dahmer.  I assume he has your proper address.  

<P>

<B>MR. DAHMER:</b>    Yes, it is.  Thank you. 

<P>

<B>THE COURT:</b>  That will conclude today's

proceedings. 

<P>

<B>MR. DAHMER:</b>    Thank you, Judge. 

<P>

<B>MR. FENNIG:</b>    Thank you.

<H3>A Discussion with Catharine MacKinnon About Her Suit Against Serb Leaders</H3>

<img width=104 height=140 align=right src=/images/spotlight/bos.gif>

  In April 1992, a Muslim woman known as "K." was run out of her home in

Bosnia-Herzegovina by Serbian soldiers, and taken to a Serbian-run prisoner camp. Over

the next 21 days, she was starved and raped- every day, 10 times a day.<P>



K.'s story forms the basis for an unusual suit by feminist legal scholar Catharine A.

MacKinnon, with the National Organization for Women Legal Defense and Education Fund as

local counsel, seeking to hold Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic responsible for

genocidal rape, murder and forced prostitution of Bosnian Muslim and Croat women.

<P>

As war rimages out of control in the former Yugoslavia, MacKinnon is pressing her

litigation in U.S. federal courts. The suit invokes international law under the Alien

Tort Claims Act and a federal statute, the Torture Victim Protection Act. Filed in New

York in 1993, the suit was dismissed last year by Judge Peter Leisure of the U.S.

District Court for the Southern District of New York. Leisure held, among other things,

that Karadzic was a private actor, not a head of state, and was therefore beyond the

reach of international laws against genocide.

<P>

The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals heard MacKinnon's appeal on June 20. The court's

ruling is pending.

<P>

Also unresolved is whether the U.S. government will take up the 2nd Circuit's invitation

to submit its views in the case.

<P>

Solicitor General Drew Days III has asked the court to have until Sept. 13 to say

whether the government will weigh in.

<P>

MacKinnon has represented women in innovative legal claims since 1978. She has been a

professor of law at the University of Michigan since 1990.

<P>

She discussed her suit, <I>K. v. Karadzic,</I> during a recent interview on Counsel

Connect. Excerpts of the exchange appear below.<P>

<blockquote>

<B>Catharine A. MacKinnon:</B> <I>K. v. Karadzic</I> is a civil action under the Alien

Tort Claims Act (ATCA) and the Torture Victim Protection Act by Bosnian women for torts

of rape and murder as genocide, torture and war crimes.

<P>

The legal issues the case raises for discussion include whether rape can be an act of

genocide, whether survivors of genocide can sue under the ATCA, and whether the head of

a de facto outlaw regime can be reached in such an action for acts in his official

capacity. The case generally directs attention to the place of women's human rights

under international law and the availability of access to U.S. courts for violations of

internationally protected rights.

<P>

The District Court below dismissed the action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,

holding that international law does not apply to acts of private individuals-which is

legally incorrect-and also that Karadzic is a private actor- which is factually

incorrect, according to both plaintiffs' pleadings and defendant's affirmations. The

appeal was argued before the 2nd Circuit on June 20.

<P>

Related developments include the indictment last month of Karadzic by the International

Tribunal for former Yugoslavia in The Hague on charges of genocide, war crimes, and

crimes against humanity. The relation of this proceeding to our suit raises interesting

issues, as does the 2nd Circuit's request after oral argument of Attorney General

[Janet] Reno for the views, should she wish to submit them, of the United States on this

litigation.

<P>

Questions or discussion of this action and its many implications are welcome.

<P>

<B>Ronald Maines, attorney, Maines & Harshman, Washington, D.C.:</B> Do you have any

sense from your oral argument of the 2nd Circuit's attitude?

<P>

<B>MacKinnon:</B> It is always difficult to get any real sense of what is going on with

a panel, as I'm sure you know. Sometimes their vociferous attacks are just a crisis of

healing. Sometimes they hide the ball entirely.

<P>

But in my view, and that of all observers there who talked with me after the argument,

the 2nd Circuit was highly favorable to our arguments. They were authentically

interested and kept us well over time. Their questions, while penetrating, were not

hostile, and did not feel entrenched against us. I did not have the sense (with which I

am very familiar) of coming up against a solid wall of resistance that the arguments

themselves never reach. Instead, the questions they raised felt like they were actually

the questions they had, rather than posturing for a decision to be made on some other

basis.

<P>

This panel is very intelligent-much wattage-and was impressively well-prepared. Both

make me optimistic about the result. It's easy to be wrong, but I had the feeling they

want to do something for us.

<P>

More concretely, it seemed as though they were considering remanding <I>Doe v.

Karadzic</I> for a hearing on the service of process issues. They clearly wanted to ask

the United States its views on the litigation, which they have now done.

<P>

There also was some sense that they might remand for a hearing on the factual issues of

whether Karadzic is the head of a de facto regime, but since the parties agree that he

is, this would be odd.

<P>

<I>Terry Weyna, associate general counsel, Mutual of Omaha, Omaha:</I> Do you have any

sense of where Janet Reno will come down on these issues?

<P>

<B>MacKinnon:</B> The process that will produce the United States' reply, if there is

one, will likely be interagency, including State, our U.N. ambassador's office, Justice,

the Solicitor General, possibly Defense, and maybe more-in addition to Janet Reno, to

whom the 2nd Circuit sent the request. So the result will reflect a lot more than her

attitude.

<P>

We don't know the attorney general's views on the specific legal issues involved, but we

do know her views on violence against women and on civil rights. Applied here, these

views would support a strong U.S. position in favor of our plaintiffs being able to

proceed on this claim in this forum.

<P>

<B>Eleanor Kerlow, managing editor, Washington, D.C., Counsel Connect:</B> In terms of

these issues-particularly rape as genocide-is there any legal precedent for this case?

Can you provide some context about when this kind of argument may have been raised

before? Some people say that you're bringing this case as a publicity stunt and

denigrating the seriousness of all of the crimes that have been committed in Bosnia.

What is your reaction to that?

<P>

<B>MacKinnon:</B> There is precedent for rape being used as a tool of genocide, but no

precedent for squarely recognizing it legally that I know of. This is in spite of the

fact that rape is clearly an act that produces serious physical and mental harm and, in

situations like this one, is part of an effort to destroy an ethnic/religious/national

group in whole or in part.

<P>

Much rape, and some prostitution in camps (that is, particularly well-organized rape),

was reported as part of the Holocaust.

<P>

Some of this information is in the reports of the Nuremberg trials. It was ignored. Rape

was used as the basis for convictions of Japanese generals in the Tokyo trials after

World War II-as war crimes, not as genocide.

<P>

It is my view that the role of sexual assault in genocide (like sexual assault

generally) has probably never been reported as fully as it has occurred. The existence

of the women's movement, in the support it has given to women going public about sexual

atrocities committed against them, has changed this to a considerable extent. This time,

in Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina, women refused to be silent about their rapes to an

unprecedented degree, against a massive wall of silence. It took months and months of

trying to get any word out about the rapes.

<P>

The result of some success in this is that we know more about the sexual assaults in

this genocide than in previous ones. It is also possible, and I think probably the case,

that rape has never before been such a self-conscious tool of a genocide, or such an

explicit part of the policy and orders to an army in prosecuting it. That means it is

likely more prevalent and systematic this time than it has been before.

<P>

The denigration of the survivors, and their efforts to stop the onslaught and hold their

perpetrators accountable, implicit in calling their own civil claim "a publicity stunt"

is unspeakable. The assumption that this case is something I initiated, rather than

something they asked me to do for them, is false as well as insulting to them, and

impugns our lawyer-client relationship. The implication that our motives are "publicity"

rather than stopping the genocidal war is demeaning and outrageous as well as untrue. It

also reflects the luxury of a mindset that is so far away from the reality of

destruction, horror, and devastation of this war that it can afford to speculate that

anything other than stopping it matters.

<P>

Many people assume that anyone who is in the public eye has sought publicity. Maybe

these people want more publicity than they get. I get more publicity than I want. I do

not perform stunts; I represent clients. I do not seek publicity, I seek to avoid it; it

seeks me.

<P>

Sometimes discussing an issue in the media is a responsible way of carrying forward a

public dialogue. (Some- times it is simply unavoidable.) It is interesting that this

lawsuit has received almost no publicity. While this is largely a relief, the issues

themselves deserve to be more widely discussed-as serious issues, not as publicity

hooks. It is a pleasure to be able to discuss them here. It is interesting that the

media can so debase the subjects it touches that the very fact that the media is

interested in something or someone can make them into a kind of dirt.

<P>

A genocide is going on. Nobody is doing anything about it, really. Those few who have

managed to live through it-having been repeatedly raped, made forcibly pregnant, and

having watched their families slaughtered-hire their own lawyer to try to do something

about it. "Some people" then call this a "publicity stunt." What does this look like to

you?

<P>

<B>Kerlow:</B> Your response to my questions and your <I>Ms.</I> article settle any

doubts I may have had about a publicity motive. You've raised an even more disturbing

question, one that is related to an Op-Ed piece in [the Aug. 1] <I>USA Today</I>: that

Bosnia is a war no one cares about.

<P>

Not only has there been little coverage of your suit but also a dearth of news coverage

generally of the warfare and many of the horrendous acts you outlined in the piece.

There is certainly no day-to-day coverage of this war, only sporadic reports of failed

negotiations, bombing on Sarajevo, and prisoner or refugee camps. It is a difficult

situation to understand because there are no clear good guys and bad guys. There is

nothing that can be boiled down to a fight for oil, a fight to protect our borders, or

the killing of our own husbands, wives, sons, and daughters. Do you think there's been

less coverage also because the war involves "ethnic cleansing" and other acts that are

being directed against women, somehow minimizing its significance to the American

public?

<P>

<B>MacKinnon:</B> The most ignored part of the war has been the part against Croatia. I

think this has been a success of Serbian propaganda, historical as well as current,

which seeks to justify the Serbian extermination of Croatians and Bosnian Croats in this

war as a response to the slaughter of Serbs by the Croatian Nazi puppet regime in World

War II. This is "one genocide deserves another" logic; no genocide can be justified.

<P>

But Croatians have been branded this way, and the attempt to exterminate them today is

thereby made to look less serious.

<P>

Although the coverage of the war in Bosnia has varied in quantity, there has been

considerable public attention to it. It has not been ignored. More problematic is the

quality of the coverage. Specifically, the Western powers' aversion to calling this what

it is-a genocide-has been pervasive in the media's calling it a "civil war" (read: two

sides equally involved, not our problem), a "conflict" of "ancient hatreds" (read: it's

emotionally based, deep-rooted, unsolvable), and a bog like Vietnam (read: U.S., do not

intervene).

<P>

The Holocaust was not a civil war between German Aryans and German Jews, and no amount

of history makes a genocide not a genocide, and my clients do not "hate" any group and

never did. Why we have to know that solving these problems will be easy before we stop a

genocidal onslaught against civilians because of who they are, is beyond me. The

Genocide Convention compels it.

<P>

To say there are no clear good guys and bad guys is a product of this coverage that

seeks to obscure the fact that this group of Serbian fascists is the aggressors, seeking

to exterminate Muslims and Croats, who are the victims. "Good" and "bad"-who people are

morally-is not my issue; perpetrators of aggression and their victims-what is being done

and who is doing it-is my issue. While those are clear here, most media attention has

been predicated on a false "atrocities on all sides" equivalence. (This is not to say

that every atrocity that has been committed by anyone should not be punished; it

should.)

<P>

<B>Terry Moran, anchor, Court TV, New York: </B>1. Does making rape a genocidal crime

reinforce the racism that drove the rapist? By that I mean, if the rapist has a

viciously deluded notion that his victim is less human than he is merely because of her

ethnicity, doesn't saying that her victimization is worse than any other woman's admit

the validity of his delusion? The motive behind rape should be irrelevant, no? It is

criminal because it is an assault on a human being, not because it is an assault on a

Bosnian human being. I suppose one could say the same for murder and genocide, but how

much of the ethnic identity of a child born out of rape (the point of "genocidal rape")

is determined by the father in the moment of assault? Very little, it seems to me. The

child will always be his mother's son.

<P>

2. I'm sure the documentation of these crimes is overwhelming, and I am not in any sense

trying to diminish what happened, but have you run into anything you might consider

propaganda in your search for evidence of victimization? I'm thinking of the stories

about the Huns killing the Belgian babies in World War I, and wondering if you've run

into any problems in this regard.

<P>

<B>MacKinnon:</B> 1. Genocidal rape is a description of reality, of what is happening to

women in Bosnia-Herzegovina. It says who, what, and why: rape, because they are women

who are not Serb. This is. It needs to be faced. Calling it what it is, is part of

facing it. It says nothing whatsoever about being "worse than any other woman's rape."

It merely identifies the reality.

<P>

Not all rapes are genocidal; that doesn't improve them.

<P>

There is nothing to be gained in obscuring the gender or ethnic specificity of injuries

that are, in fact, based on sex and race. Exposing that ground is not the same as

attributing "motive" in the ordinary language sense. Ethnicity and sex explain the

selection of targets for abuse; they are not necessarily matters of individual

psychology. To identify the fact that rape is an injury to a female human being does not

diminish her humanness-it merely specifies it. (The Enlightenment thought that humanity

lay in universality, but we have learned a lot since, including to notice the rather

obvious fact that there is no universality that is not embodied in particulars.) So, an

injury to a female Muslim human being is an injury to a human being. To be injured "as"

a member of these groups says why it is occurring. To say that a woman is being raped

because she is a member of her national community in a particular situation is also to

insist that the definition of "human" be reconstituted to include her, by recognizing

her injury as an injury to a human being. This is the point of all anti-discrimination

claims.

<P>

2. I am sure there are false reports floating around. The Serbian propaganda machine

specializes in them, certainly. As to atrocities to victims, more than false reports, I

have encountered resistance to true reports out of fear that they might be false.

<P>

My work has taught me that the reality of violence against women is always far more

horrible than what is known of it. The result is, the public instinct for what is a

credible degree of horror is miscalibrated, based on information that radically

understates how frequent and how awful the acts are.

<P>

So while skepticism is healthy, and courts require proof, women's situation is usually

worse than you think-often dramatically worse.

<P>

<B>Rick Bulman, marketing director, Florida Counsel Connect, Miami:</B> 1. I don't

understand your use of the term "genocidal rape." I think Terry Moran alluded to the

fact that the term "genocidal rape" was imprecise. I think it an impossibility.

<P>

Conventional definitions interpret genocide as "extinguishing a race" and rape as "a

sexual act committed by force." Even at a stretch, rape may create a life-whether Serb

or Croat-and this act is clearly not an extermination of life, despite a possible

difference in the proportion of "pure" Serbs and/or Croats subsequent to any resultant

births.

<P>

2. Rape as a part of a scheme of intimidation would seem to be no less egregious than

any other form of torture. In this case we are talking about a crime against women, but

clearly there have been similar crimes perpetrated by men against men. Is the

distinction simply a tactical move to take advantage of international law?

<P>

3. While you state that your intention is to right the injustice suffered by your

clients, it is impossible not to notice the political implications of your activities-an

opportunity to establish a universal standard of accountability for those exercising any

kind of political power. If so, why not start with something a bit more manageable, like

the U.S. Senate?

<P>

4. Finally, apart from international law, are there no other laws to be relied upon to

pursue such a case (religious/secular/civil)? Why should there be any distinction in the

crime, punishment, or civil remedy afforded the Bosnian authorities are hiding behind

the mantle of the state?

<P>

<B>MacKinnon:</B> The Genocide Convention, Art. II, defines genocide as "any of the

following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national,

ethnical, racial or religious group, such as: ... (b) Causing serious bodily or mental

harm to members of the group. ... (d) Imposing measures intended to prevent births

within the group ... ." So the destruction of a people, for purposes of the law against

genocide that is the customary definition, is not limited to extermination through

killing.

<P>

Rape is being committed by the Serbian fascists in Bosnia- Herzegovina and Croatia as

part of "ethnic cleansing"-that is, with intent to destroy Muslims and Croats as

national, ethnic, religious groups. Rape causes serious bodily and mental harm. To the

reproductive point, some of the rape is committed with intent to create "Serbian

babies," that is, arguably, to prevent births of Muslims and Croats. This is simply how

rape can be an act of genocide on the most obvious legal level.

<P>

The definition of genocide in the Genocide Convention was taken from

reality-specifically, from what was understood of the facts of the Holocaust. As

mentioned earlier, it is likely that a lot more sexual assault was part of that genocide

than was documented. The definition of genocide, like other legal definitions, is a

response to life and is capable of responding to increasing information about it.

<P>

When women are seen as human, their destruction as women will be understood as part of

destroying a human community. Such an understanding would lead to a definition of

genocide that would reflect on its face the reality of genocide better than it does now.

<P>

To Rick Bulman's other queries: We are suing for rape as torture under the Torture

Victim Protection Act. Men also rape men, including a few reported cases in this war.

Are you asking why women matter? Why these women matter? If I were making a tactical

choice based on simply wanting to win, I would represent men.

<P>

What makes you think I exempt the U.S. Senate from my work? I am not "starting" in this

case to hold power accountable for its atrocities-in pursuit of which, I am part of a

rather old tradition.

<P>	

The availability of laws other than the ones we invoke has nothing to do with the merits

of the use of these laws to redress these crimes, does it?

<P>

<B>Jennifer Fox, law editor, Counsel Connect, Atlanta:</B> How do you predict that

Karadzic's indictment by the International Tribunal for former Yugoslavia in The Hague,

on charges of genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity, will affect the outcome

of your appeal?

<P>

<B>Scot C. Stirling, attorney, Sacks Tierney, Phoenix:</B> On a specific related point,

I would also like to know whether you think this will affect the response that the

United States may give to the 2nd Circuit. I understand the court has asked Janet Reno

for the "position" or the opinions of the DOJ with respect to the issues raised by your

lawsuit against Karadzic.

<P>

Ordinarily, I would not expect a court hearing a private tort action to "defer" to a

criminal prosecution that may or may not accomplish anything, anyway, but the tone of

the oral argument suggested to me that the court may be thinking that somebody has got

to do something, but that they wish it wasn't them, or a U.S. District Court in their

circuit- especially if they doubt that their judgment will be enforced effectively

against Karadzic.

<P>

If they believe the only real effect of a judgment against Karadzic in the District

Court is to announce our condemnation of his conduct, aren't these judges more likely to

say that a prosecution of an international war crimes and genocide trial is a better

venue for those issues? I understand that doesn't answer the point you made at oral

argument, that Congress has already made the decision that the U.S. courts are open to

these plaintiffs, if they can establish the court's personal jurisdiction over the

defendant-but I have the sense that the court would like to pass the buck, if it can

only do so without disgracing itself.

<P>

<B>MacKinnon: </B>It would be very wrong for the solicitor general, or the 2nd Circuit,

to "defer" to The Hague on Karadzic for a number of reasons.

<P>

First, we have the defendant. He has been served with process by us, no contest. The

Hague does not have him and may never. It would be deferral to a proceeding that may

never occur. They do not do trials in absentia, but we could even get a default judgment

that would be legally binding.

<P>

Second, the ITY does not represent our clients or seek our relief. We are asking for an

injunction against the ethnic cleansing (specifically, that Karadzic be ordered to order

it to end) and damimages. Neither of these are part of what The Hague can do. Our

clients are not parties to their proceedings and have nothing to say about how they are

done, either. (No survivors are.)

<P>

Third, the fact of The Hague and its recent indictment of Karadzic only supports our

access to court, rather than undermines it. The entire legal basis for the indictment

and prosecution there affirms ours, and U.S. government support for the legal basis of

the Hague tribunal is not only consistent with support for access to federal court for

our clients, it requires it.

<P>

No doubt the eternal search for a place to pass the buck goes on, but this particular

panel has backbone as well as brightness, so there is hope.

CONTEMPT; GRANTING ERLICH'S MOTION TO VACATE THE WRIT OF SEIZURE; AND DENYING
PLAINTIFFS' REQUEST FOR SANCTIONS AGAINST ERLICH'S COUNSEL <P>

<P>

This case involves the scope of intellectual property rights on the
Internet.[FN1] Plaintiffs, two Scientology-affiliated organizations claiming
copyright and trade secret protection for the writings of the Church's founder,
L. Ron Hubbard, brought this suit against defendant Dennis Erlich ("Erlich"), a
former Scientology minister turned vocal critic of the Church, who allegedly put
plaintiffs' protected works onto the Internet.[FN2] <P>

On June 23, 1995, this court heard the parties arguments on eight motions, five
of which relate to Erlich and are discussed herein: (1) plaintiffs' motion for a
preliminary injunction against Erlich and Erlich's related motion to dissolve or
amend the Amended TRO; (2) plaintiffs' application to expand the TRO; (3)
plaintiffs' motion for contempt against Erlich; (4) Erlich's motion to vacate the
writ of seizure; and (5) and plaintiffs' request for sanctions against Erlich's
counsel.[FN3] For the reasons set forth below, the court grants in part and
denies in part plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction against Erlich and
Erlich's motion to dissolve the TRO, denies plaintiffs' application to expand the
TRO, denies plaintiffs' motion for contempt against Erlich, grants Erlich's
motion to vacate the writ of seizure, and denies plaintiffs' request for
sanctions against Erlich's counsel. <P>

<H3>I. BACKGROUND</H3>

Defendant Dennis Erlich was a member of the Church of Scientology ("the
Church")[FN4] from approximately 1968 until 1982. During his years with the
Church, Erlich received training to enable him to provide ministerial counseling
services, known as "auditing." While with the Church, Erlich had access to
various Scientology writings, including those of the Church's founder, L. Ron
Hubbard ("Hubbard"), which the Church alleges include published literary works as
well as unpublished confidential materials (the "Advanced Technology works").
According to plaintiffs, Erlich had agreed to maintain the confidentiality of the
Advanced Technology works. <P>

Since leaving the Church, Erlich has been a vocal critic of Scientology and he
now considers it part of his calling to foster critical debate about Scientology
through humorous and critical writings. Erlich has expressed his views about the
Church by contributing the Internet "Usenet newsgroup" called
"alt.religion.scientology" (the newsgroup")[FN5], which is an on-line forum for
the discussion of issues related to Scientology.[FN6] <P>

Plaintiffs allege that in the six months prior to their filing suit, Erlich
unlawfully posted to the newsgroup works from two separate categories of writings
by Hubbard which are contained in Exhibits A and B of the FAC. Following
Hubbard's death in 1986, ownership of Hubbard's copyrights passed to Author's
Family Trust-B. In 1993, the copyrights were distributed to the Church of
Spiritual Technology ("CST"), a California nonprofit religious corporation.
Plaintiff Bridge Publications, Inc. ("BPI"), a nonprofit branch of the Church,
claims to be the exclusive licensee of CST's copyrighted literary works listed in
Exhibit A to the Complaint ("Exhibit A works"), which consist mainly of policy
letters and bulletins from the Church. <P>

Plaintiff Religious Technology Center ("RTC"), a nonprofit religious
corporation, "was formed by Scientologists, with the approval of [Hubbard], to
act as the protector of the religion of Scientology and to own, protect, and
control the utilization of the Advanced Technology[FN7] in the United States."
FAC, Ex. C, at 2. RTC claims to be the exclusive licensee of the copyrights and
the owner of the other rights in the unpublished Advanced Technology works listed
in Exhibit B to the Complaint (the "Advanced Technology" works or the "Exhibit B
works"). <P>

BPI and RTC allege that Erlich infringed the copyrights in the Exhibit A and B
works. RTC also alleges that Erlich misappropriated its trade secrets in the
Exhibit B works, the confidentiality of which it alleges has been the subject to
elaborate security measures. RTC further claims that those works are extremely
valuable to the Church. Erlich admits to having posted excerpts from some of the
works, but argues that the quotations were used to provide context for debate and
as a basis for his criticism. Erlich further argues that he has neither claimed
authorship of any of the works nor personally profited from his critique, satire,
and commentary. Erlich contends that all of the Exhibit B documents he posted had
been previously posted anonymously over the Internet, except for item 1, which he
claims he received anonymously through the mail. <P>

From August to December 1994, plaintiffs exchanged a series of letters with
Erlich, warning him to stop posting their protected writings onto the newsgroup.
Plaintiffs also demanded that defendants Netcom and Klemesrud take actions to
prevent Erlich's continued postings of protected materials. Erlich indicated that
he would not stop, claiming he had a right to continue with his criticism and
satire. On February 8, 1995, plaintiffs filed this action against Erlich,
Klemesrud, and Netcom for copyright infringement and, against Erlich alone, for
misappropriation of trade secrets, seeking actual, statutory, and punitive
damages, injunctive relief, impoundment of the infringing materials and
equipment, and attorneys' fees and costs. <P>

On February 10, 1995, the court granted plaintiffs' ex parte application for a
temporary restraining order ("TRO") prohibiting Erlich from making unauthorized
use of works identified in the exhibits to the complaint and an order directing
the clerk to issue a writ of seizure under 17 U.S.C. section 503(a). On February
13, 1995, in execution of the writ of seizure, local police officers entered
Erlich's home to conduct the seizure. The officers were accompanied by several
RTC representatives, who aided in the search and seizure of documents related to
Erlich's alleged copyright infringement and misappropriation of trade secrets.
Erlich alleges that RTC officials in fact directed the seizure, which took
approximately seven hours. Erlich alleges that plaintiffs seized books, working
papers, and personal papers. After locating Erlich's computers, plaintiffs
allegedly seized computer disks and copied portions of Erlich's hard disk drive
onto floppy disks and then erased the originals from the hard drive. Although
plaintiffs returned to Erlich's counsel some of the articles seized, Erlich
contends that plaintiffs have not returned all of the seized articles, including
ones that are unrelated to the litigation. <P>

On February 23, 1995, the court issued an "Amended TRO," which sought to clarify
what types of use were prohibited and to emphasize that Erlich could make "fair
use" of the Exhibit A works. <P>

<H3>II. PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION/DISSOLUTION OF TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER[FN8]</H3>

<B>A. Legal Standards</B><P>

A party seeking a preliminary injunction may establish its entitlement to
equitable relief by showing either (1) a combination of probable success on the
merits and the possibility of irreparable injury, or (2) serious questions as to
these matters and that the balance of hardships tips sharply in its favor. First
<I>Brands Corp. v. Fred Meyer, Inc.,</I> 809 F.2d 1378, 1381 (9th Cir. 1987). These two
tests are not separate, but represent a continuum of equitable discretion whereby
the greater the relative hardship to the moving party, the less probability of
success need be shown. <I>Regents of University of California v. American
Broadcasting Cos.,</I> 747 F.2d 511, 515 (9th Cir. 1984). The primary purpose of a
preliminary injunction is to preserve the status quo pending a trial on the
merits. <I>Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum Commission v. National Football League,</I> 634
F.2d 1197, 1200 (9th Cir. 1980). <P>

<B>B. Likelihood of Success on Copyright Infringement Claims</B> <P>

To establish copyright infringement, plaintiffs must demonstrate (1) they own a
valid copyright and (2) Erlich violated any of their exclusive rights, including,
inter alia, the rights to reproduce or prepare derivative works from the
original, or to distribute or display copies publicly. 17 U.S.C. sections
106(1)-(3) & (5), 501(a); Feist Publications, Inc. v. Rural Telephone Service
Co., 111 S.Ct. 1282, 1296 (1991). Erlich, for the most part, admits to having
"copied" the Exhibit A and B works, but contends that plaintiffs are not able to
establish ownership of a valid copyright interest in those works. Erlich also
argues that his activities do not constitute infringement because his use was a
"fair use." <P>

1. Ownership of a Valid Copyright<P>

Proof of ownership of an existing, valid, and registered copyright interest is a
statutory prerequisite to filing an infringement action. 17 U.S.C. section 411.
Registration, when "made before or within five years after first publication of
the work[,] shall constitute prima facie evidence of the validity of the
copyright," including originality, compliance with statutory formalities, and
copyrightability. Id. section 410(c); 3 Melville B. Nimmer & David Nimmer, Nimmer
on Copyright (1995) ("Nimmer") section 12.11[B]. When registration is made more
than five years after first publication, the evidentiary weight of the
certificate of registration is within the court's discretion. Id. section
12.11[A],[B]. Where the plaintiff is not the author of a work, he must provide
evidence of a chain of title from the registrant to him. Nimmer section 12.11[C].<P>


Plaintiffs provide evidence of registration for all of the Exhibit A and B
works. See FAC, Ex. H. Plaintiffs further provide copies of assignment and
licensing agreements purportedly showing the necessary chain of title from
Hubbard, the author of the works, to plaintiffs RTC and BPI. Attached to the FAC
are assignments of all rights in the Advanced Technology works from Hubbard and
his estate to RTC. Id., Exs. C, D, F & G. Under the "Literary Agreement" attached
to the FAC, BPI is the exclusive licensee of various published, non-fiction
Hubbard works, including those works in Exhibit A to the FAC. Id., Ex. E. <P>

Erlich sets forth in his "Appendix re: Copyright Issues" a host of purported
irregularities and defects with the registrations, maintaining that plaintiffs
have failed to prove a likelihood of success on ownership of many, if not all, of
the works. The court find that, except as to item 4 of Exhibit A, Erlich has
failed to rebut the presumption of validity. <P>

Erlich's contention that item 4 of Exhibit A ("20 Nov 1961, Routine 3D
Commands") has fallen into the public domain appears to be correct. The
registration for item 4 gives a first publication date of 1961. Under the
Copyright Act of 1909 ("the 1909 Act"), which still applies to works that were
first published prior to January 1, 1964, an author is entitled to an initial
28-year copyright term, which expires unless the copyright is renewed by the
author or his statutory successors during the final year of the initial term. 2
Nimmer section 9.05[B][1]. The copyright notice date on item 4 is evidence that
the work was first prohibited in 1961. See <I>New Era Publications International,
ApS v. Carol Publishing Group,</I> 729 F. Supp. 992, 995 (S.D.N.Y.), aff'd in part,
rev'd in part, 904 F.2d 152 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 921 (1990). Because
there is no evidence that the copyright for item 4 was renewed in 1989. 28 years
after its initial publication, the court finds that it fell into the public
domain and cannot be the subject of an action for infringement. See id.
Plaintiffs argue, however, that item 2 was part of a collection that was
registered in 1976, the year that it was first published. As such, plaintiffs
contend that the collective work is not yet subject to renewal. While those parts
of the 1976 collection that were first published in 1976 were not subject to
renewal in 1989, those previously published portions of the collection, such as
item 4, must still be timely renewed notwithstanding the registration as a
collection in 1976. See 1 Nimmer sections 3.07[C], 3.04[A], at 3-19. <P>

Erlich's next claim is that plaintiffs have not registered the works that were
infringed, but only the compilations in which they were included. Where, as here,
the author of a collection or derivative work is also the author of the
preexisting work, registration of the collection is sufficient. <I>Abend v. MCA,
Inc.,</I> 863 F.2d 1465, 1471-72 (9th Cir. 1988), aff'd, 495 U.S. 207 (1990); 2
Nimmer section 7.16[B][2], at 7-168 to -170 (distinguishing this situation from
that where copyright owner of collective work is not also the owner of the
preexisting work). Here, Hubbard was the author of the underlying work and was
also the author of the collection of his own works. Accordingly, registration of
the collections that include the Exhibit A works constitutes registration of the
underlying works. <P>

Erlich's next argument, that plaintiffs have not shown that Hubbard's statutory
successors assigned the renewal terms of the copyrights to plaintiffs, is clearly
rebutted by the evidence. See Hawkins Decl., Exs. A-1. The Exhibit B works do not
require renewal because they were unpublished as of January 1, 1978, the
effective date of the Copyright Act of 1976 ("the 1976 Act"), and were thus
protected only by common law copyright. See 2 Nimmer section 9.01[B][2], at 9-17
to -18. As of January 1, 1978, these works became protected by statutory
copyright under the new scheme of the 1976 Act, which does not require renewal.
Id. <P>

Finally, Erlich contends that the automatic statutory presumption of validity
does not apply because many of the works were published more than five years
before registration. The dates specified in a copyright notice are evidence of
the date of publication. New Era, 729 F. Supp. at 995. As to the unpublished[FN9]
Exhibit B works, registrations were made before first publication in accordance
with section 410(c) and thus the presumption is still valid. However, it appears
Erlich is correct that the statutory presumption does not apply as to items 1, 2,
4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 of Exhibit A. It is within the court's discretion what weight
to give the copyright registrations in determining the validity of the copyright
interests of those works for which plaintiffs are not entitled to an automatic
presumption of validity. In light of plaintiffs' evidence of validity, see
Hawkins Decl., and the lack of a persuasive challenge to the validity of the
copyrights by Erlich, the court finds that plaintiffs' registrations are strong
evidence of the validity of their claimed copyrights.[FN10] <P>

2. Direct Infringement<P>

Except as to item 9 of Exhibit A and item 9 of Exhibit B, see Oakley May 12,
1995 Decl., Ex. B, Erlich does not dispute that he engaged in "copying," which
would constitute direct infringement under section 106. As to the item 9 works,
there is no evidence that Erlich ever made any postings of or otherwise copied
those items. The court will therefore consider plaintiffs' infringement claims as
to the remaining works.[FN11] <P>

3. Fair Use Defense<P>

"Infringement" consists of violating the author's exclusive rights. 17 U.S.C.
section 501. Although the author has the exclusive rights to reproduce,
distribute, and display a copyrighted work under section 106, these rights are
limited by the defense[FN12] of "fair use". <P>

Notwithstanding the provisions of section 106 and 106A, the fair use of a
copyrighted work, including such use by reproduction in copies. . . or by any
other means specified in that section, for purposes such as criticism, comment,
news reporting, teaching (including multiple copies for classroom use),
scholarship, or research, is not an infringement of copyright. <P>

17 U.S.C. section 107 (emphasis added). The defense "permits and requires courts
to avoid rigid application of the copyright statute when, on occasion, it would
stifle the very creativity which that law is designed to foster." <I>Campbell v.
Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.,</I> 114 S.Ct. 1164, 1170 (1994) (citation omitted). Congress
has set out four nonexclusive factors to be considered in determining the
availability of the fair use defense: <P><OL>

<LI> the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a
commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes; <P>

<LI> the name of the copyrighted work;<P>

<LI> the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the
copyrighted work as a whole; and <P>

<LI> the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the
copyrighted work. <P></ol>

17 U.S.C. section 107. The fair use doctrine calls for a case-by-case analysis.
Campbell, 114 S.Ct. at 1170. All of the factors "are to be explored, and the
results weighed together, in light of the purposes of the copyright." Id. at
1170-71. <P>

a. First Factor: Purpose and Character of the Use <P>

The first statutory factor looks to the purpose and character of the defendants'
use. Erlich argues that his use was criticism, which is one of those uses listed
in the preamble to section 107. Similarly, Erlich maintains that his use was
meant to "evoke discussion regarding various Scientology philosophies." Mot. To
Dissolve at 22. Use for the purpose of criticism weighs in favor of fair use. See
New Era, 904 F.2d at 156-57 (using Hubbard's works in critical biography meets
first factor for fair use). Plaintiffs contest Erlich's characterizations of his
use, claiming that most of Erlich's postings were verbatim copies, with little or
no added comment or criticism.[FN13] Plaintiffs further contend that Erlich's
purpose was spite or some other destructive reason. However, plaintiffs give no
explanation as to why Erlich's purpose was other than to criticize or to evoke
discussion regarding Scientology. Because there is insufficient evidence to
support plaintiffs' claim that Erlich's copying was made out of spite or for
other destructive reasons, the court will assume Erlich's intended purpose was
criticism or comment. <P>

Transformative Use<P>

Plaintiffs' argument that the amount of added criticism belies Erlich's critical
purpose can also be construed as an attack on the "transformative" nature of
Erlich's use. In Campbell, the Supreme Court held that the central purpose of the
first inquiry is to determine whether the new work is transformative (also
described as "productive"), that is, whether it "adds something new, with a
further purpose or different character, altering the first with new expression,
meaning, or message." 114 S.ct. at 1171. Erlich's use is only minimally
transformative since, unlike the typical critic, Erlich adds little new
expression to the Church's works. Accordingly, despite Erlich's purported
critical purpose, the actual character of his use does not weigh heavily in his
favor because it has only a slight transformative nature. In any case, the
Supreme Court held in Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc., 464
U.S. 417, 455 n.40 (1984) that the fair use defense is not "rigidly
circumscribed" by the productive use requirement. The Court found that a home
viewer's verbatim copying of copyrighted television shows for the purposes of
time shifting was fair use even though there was only a minimal showing of
increased convenience to the home user. <P>

Commercial Nature of Use<P>

Where the use is not highly transformative, as here, the court will focus on
whether the use is of a commercial nature. The Campbell Court emphasized that a
commercial use does not dictate against a finding of fair use, as most of the
uses listed in the statute are "generally conducted for profit in this country."
114 S.Ct. at 1174. Nonetheless, the Court recognized that a commercial use weighs
against a finding of fair use. Id. The fact that there is no evidence that Erlich
gains financially from his criticism of the Church weighs in his favor. <P>

Plaintiffs argue, however, that Erlich personally gains through increased status
and recognition among his peers and the public. In <I>Weissmann v. Freeman,</I> 868 F.2d
1313 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 883 (1989), the Second Circuit recognized
that, in the unusual setting of academia, a defendant can profit personally from
copying despite the lack of a monetary gain. The defendant in Weissman was a
professor who copied a former assistant's scholarly work, used it for the same
purpose as the author, and claimed credit for himself, thereby aiding his
professional advancement. Id. at 1324. Here, there is neither evidence that
Erlich took credit for any of plaintiffs' works nor that he is personally
profiting, professionally or otherwise, as a result of his postings. If mere
recognition by one's peers constituted "personal profit" to defeat a finding of a
noncommercial use, courts would seldom find any criticism fair use and much
valuable criticism would be discouraged. Thus, the court finds that Weissman is
inapplicable here, and that its holding should not be stretched to swallow all
nonprofit criticism motivatedby concern for status. Accordingly, based on the
clearly noncommercial nature of the use and the protected purpose of criticism,
the court finds that the first fair use factor weighs slightly in Erlich's favor
despite the minimally transformative nature of Erlich's use. <P>

Defendant's Conduct<P>

Plaintiffs contend that, regardless of the results of weighing the four fair use
factors, a finding of fair use is nonetheless precluded because Erlich's copies
were made not from legitimate copies of the works but from unauthorized copies.
Although plaintiffs discuss this purported "good faith" prerequisite[FN14] to
fair use apart from the four factors, it is properly a factor to be considered
with the first statutory factor regarding the character of the use. 3 Nimmer
section 13.05[A][1][d], at 13-171 to -174 (discussing "defendant conduct" as one
aspect of the first statutory factor). <P>

The court finds that plaintiffs' showing on bad faith is mixed at best. There is
no evidence here that Erlich obtained his copies of plaintiffs' works through
deceit. Cf. Atari, 975 F.2d at 836, 843 (finding no fair use where defendant
obtained plaintiff's source code by lying to copyright office). Unlike Sega,
there is no admission by the defendant that he does not possess any legal copies.
As to several of the Exhibit A works, it appears that Erlich possessed
legitimate, published books containing some of the works, plaintiffs offer no
evidence that Erlich obtained these books in some unlawful or illegitimate
manner.[FN15] However, as to those works where Erlich claims he obtained his
copies over the Internet or anonymously through the mail, this does not negate an
inference that he received those copies in an improper manner. Erlich's copies of
Exhibit B works were more likely unauthorized than not; plaintiffs have provided
substantial evidence that the Advanced Technology works are kept confidential,
see infra part II, C.2, and that Erlich would not have been given permission to
keep a copy of those works. For most of the disputed works, the fact that Erlich
may have obtained his copies in an unauthorized manner tends to weigh in
plaintiffs' favor. This finding, however, will not bar Erlich's fair use defense,
but will merely be considered with the other factors. <P>

b. Second Factor: Nature of the Copyrighted Work <P>

The second factor focuses on two different aspects of the copyright work:
whether it is published or unpublished and whether it is informational or
creative. <P>

Published vs. Unpublished<P>

The unpublished status of a work is "a critical element of its 'nature."' Harper
& Row, 471 U.S. at 564 (finding no fair use where <I>The Nation</I> magazine used
unpublished manuscript to scoop <I>Time</I> magazine). <I>The Nation</I> case held that "the
scope of fair use is narrower with respect to unpublished works." Id. In a case
involving copying of allegedly unpublished works by Hubbard, the Second Circuit
recognized that where the works were unpublished no court had yet found in favor
of the infringer on the second factor. New Era, 904 F.2d at 155. Nevertheless,
the Second Circuit affirmed a finding of fair use where a biographer quoted
portions of unpublished letters. Wright v. Warner Books, Inc., 953 F.2d 731 (2d
Cir. 1991); see also <I>Norse v. Henry Holt & Co.,</I> 847 F. Supp. 142, 147 (N.D.Cal.
1994) (finding fair use where 50 words copied from unpublished letters and all
but the second factor weighed in favor if defendant). In 1992, Congress amended
section 107 of the 1976 Act to clarify that the unpublished nature of a work
should not itself bar a finding of fair use. See H.R. Rep. No. 102-286, 102d
Cong., 2d Sess. 8 (1992) (House Report) (citing Wright with approval and
criticizing earlier Second Circuit decisions that created a per se rule against
fair use of unpublished works); see also 3 Nimmer section 13.05[A][2], at 13-184
to -186. Congress construed the Nation's statement that the scope of fair use is
narrower for unpublished works to mean that the amount of permissible copying
will be less in the case of an unpublished work. Id. <P>

Even though a work is read by a large group of people, it is still unpublished
where it is held confidential and the authors do not relinquish control over
their copies of the work. See College <I>Entrance Examination Board v. Cuomo,</I> 788
F.Supp. 134-41 (N.D.N.Y. 1992) (finding that administered secure tests were
necessarily unpublished because author did not relinquish control and finding for
author on second fair use factor). Plaintiffs have adequately demonstrated that
the Exhibit B Advanced Technology works are kept confidential using tight
security measures. See infra part II.C.3. Although there is evidence that
individuals may have made unauthorized public disclosures of some of these works,
see id., the works are still "unpublished" for the purposes of the fair use
defense. See discussion supra note 9. However, the Exhibit A works, with one
exception, are published. Accordingly, this portion of the second factor weighs
in Erlich's favor as to the published Exhibit A works and strongly in plaintiffs'
favor as to the Exhibit B works. <P>

Informational vs. Creative<P>

The second aspect of this factor looks to broaden the protection of those works
that are creative, fictional, or highly original and lessen the protection for
those works that are factual, informational, or functional. See Campbell, 114
S.Ct. at 1175. The Second Circuit noted the obvious difficulty in applying this
test in a case involving a large number of works by Hubbard: <P>

We agree. . . that there is no easy distinction between works that are "factual"
on the one hand, and "creative" or "expressive" on the other, because
"'[c]reation of a nonfiction work, even a compilation of pure fact, entails
originality."' Thus, reasonable people can disagree over how to classify
Hubbard's works. <P>

New Era, 904 F.2d at 158 (citations omitted). The Second Circuit concluded that
"although some of the quoted passages can accurately be described as expressive -
e.g., Hubbard's poetry - our review of the record persuades us that most simply
cannot be so characterized." A district judge in this Circuit, considering works
that are part of the Church's Advanced Technology, concluded that "Hubbard's
works are the product of his creative thought process, and not merely
informational."[FN16] <I>Bridge Publications, Inc. v. Vien,</I> 827 F.Supp. 629, 635-36
(S.D. Cal. 1993). <P>

In the present case, this court also finds the task of categorizing Hubbard's
writings difficult. In their complaint, plaintiffs describe Hubbard as the author
of "original works on applied religious philosophy and spiritual healing
technology, including training materials and course manuals of the Scientology
religion." FAC 9. In reviewing the Exhibit A works, which are predominantly
"policy letters" of the Hubbard Communications Office, the court finds that these
works, although creative, are primarily functional or instructive. Item 1 of
Exhibit B, the Class VIII "Assists" Tape, appears more original and creative than
the other works, and is thus deserving of greater fair use protection. The
remaining Exhibit B works, however, are part of the methodology of the Church's
"applied religious philosophy," and as such are more instructive and functional
than fictional. This court is not convinced, however, that this factor should
play a major role in the context of religious works, which do not easily fit into
the creative/informational dichotomy. <P>

Because the Exhibit B works are unpublished and large portions of them were
copied by Erlich, see infra part II.B.3.c, this factor weighs heavily against
Erlich with respect to those works, despite the informational nature of most of
them. The Exhibit A works, however, are published and primarily informational,
and this factor weighs in favor of Erlich as to those works. <P>

c. Third Factor: Amount and Substantiality of the Portion Used <P>

The third factor concerns both the percentage of the original work that was
copied, and whether that portion constitutes the "heart" of the copyrighted work.
Harper & Row, 471 U.S. at 564-65. The copying of an entire work will ordinarily
militate against a finding of fair use, although this is not a per se rule. Sony,
464 U.S. at 449-50 (finding exception to this rule for time-shifting by home
viewers to enable them to see works that they were invited to see in their
entirety free of charge). The amount of copying that is acceptable will depend on
the character of the use and degree to which the copy transforms the original.
Campbell, 114 S.Ct. at 1175-76 (finding parody can copy enough of original to
"conjure [it] up" so the audience will recognize what is being parodied). Less
copying will be acceptable where the original is unpublished. See 3 Nimmer
section 13.05[A][2], at 13-185 n.200. <P>

Plaintiffs allege that Erlich's posting copy substantial amounts of the
originals or, in some cases, the entire works. Erlich responds that, as to some
of the copied works, the original documents are actually only a small part of a
larger collection. See Oakley Reply Decl., Ex. C. Erlich claims that the court
should look at the entire registered collective work to determine the percentage
of that work which Erlich copied. However, the Ninth Circuit held in <I>Hustler
Magazine, Inc. v. Moral Majority, Inc.,</I> 796 F.2d 1148, 1155 (9th Cir. 1986) that
"[a] creative work does not deserve less protection just because it is part of
composite work." The Second Circuit held in <I>American Geophysical Union v. Texaco,
Inc.,</I> 802 F. Supp. 1, 17 (S.D.N.Y. 1992), aff'd, 37 F.3d 881 (2d Cir. 1994) that
copying an entire article from a journal whose copyright has been registered as a
whole still constitutes copying the entire work. Similarly, here, although many
of Hubbard's lectures, policy statements, and course packets are collected into
larger volumes, and registered as a whole, they may still constitute separate
works for the purposes of this factor. <P>

It appears Erlich copied all or almost all of many of the works,[FN17] which
were predominantly short documents of less than three pages, and mostly with no
comments or with very brief comments[FN18] at the beginning or end. See McShane
February 27, 1995 Decl., Ex. A, B, C-1. The court further finds that where Erlich
only copied a portion of a work, that portion constituted the "heart: of the
work. Compare February 27, 1995 App. in Support of Warren McShane, Exs. 1A-188A
with 1B-188B; see Harper & Row, 471 U.S. at 564-65 (finding a quotation of 300
out of 200,000 words that were "essentially the heart of the book" not fair use).
Accordingly, this factor weighs heavily in plaintiffs' favor, especially as to
the unpublished works, where the amount of acceptable copying is even lower. <P>

d. Fourth factor: Effect of the Use upon the Potential Market for the Work <P>

The fourth and final statutory factor concerns "the extent of market harm caused
by the particular actions of the alleged infringer" and "whether unrestricted and
widespread conduct of the sort engaged in by the defendant . . . would result in
a substantially adverse impact on the potential market' for the original."
Campbell, 114 S.Ct. at 1177 (quoting 3 Nimmer section 13.05[A][4]) (remanding for
consideration of this factor). Although the results of all four factors must be
weighed together, id. at 1171, the fourth factor is central to the fair use
analysis, 3 Nimmer section 13.05[A][4], at 13-188 to -189 (citing Harper & Row,
471 U.S. at 566), 13-207 (observing that fourth factor explains results in recent
Supreme Court cases). <P>

Plaintiffs contend that Erlich's posting of plaintiffs' copyrighted works over
the Internet, where more than 25 million subscribers could access them, could
potentially have a detrimental effect on plaintiffs. Plaintiffs point to the fact
that, in the past, the Church has faced "ex-parishioners using copyrighted
materials to set up and market 'religious' training adapted from the Scientology
religion." Pltfs.' Opp'n at 39. In Vien, the defendant had left the Church of
Scientology to start her own competing ministry, taking with her some of the
Church's Advanced Technology works, which she used in her courses and offered for
sale. 827 F.Supp. at 632-34. The court held that "since defendant uses the works
for the same purpose intended by plaintiffs, it appears defendant's unauthorized
copies fulfill the 'demand for the original' works and 'diminish or prejudice'
their potential sale." Id. at 636. <P>

Plaintiffs' case is not as strong here as it was in Vien. The demand of those
seeking out the Church's religious training till hardly be met by Erlich's
postings.[FN19] Even if Erlich's copying of plaintiffs' works were not for a
critical purpose, plaintiffs would still have not shown that Erlich's posting
diminish the demand by Church followers in the courses. According to the Church,
these courses must be studied in a systematic fashion, following one "course" at
a time, with proper guidance. McShane May 31, 1995 Decl. 7-8; see Wollersheim,
796 F.2d at 1091 (noting RTC's argument that Advanced Technology works are trade
secrets whose misappropriation would cause "'religious harm' . . . [to] adherents
from premature unsupervised exposure to the materials"). Although many of
Erlich's postings contain much of an original work, each of these works is only a
small portion of the teachings necessary for a particular "course." See Oakley
Reply Decl., Ex. C. For the most part, Erlich's postings are sporadic and
incomplete. The court is thus not convinced that postings like Erlich's could be
effectively used by rival Scientology-like religious groups. Moreover, there is
no evidence that the Church currently faces any competition by ex-parishioners,
see Oakley Reply Decl., Ex. B., McShane Depo. at 95, although there is
circumstantial evidence that such competition could occur in the future, based on
the fact that several groups have competed with the Church in the past. See id.
at 93-94. <P>

There is little evidence of a systematic attempt by Erlich at posting the
complete works necessary for setting up a competing religious group. It seems
unlikely, although possible, that Erlich's postings, if continued and expanded,
could supply such a group with the means to compete with plaintiffs. See
discussion infra part II.B.3. While the demand for a particular work may be
suppressed through criticism, it is unlikely that the demand for the Church's
unique ability to provide parishioners with a complete and guided access to the
various course materials will be suppressed. The court finds it unlikely that
Erlich's noncommercial use, or widespread conduct like Erlich's use by others,
would diminish or prejudice the potential sale of plaintiffs' works, interfere
with their marketability, or fulfill the demand for the works. See <I>Maxtone-Graham
v. Burtchaell,</I> 803 F.2d 1253, 1264 (2d Cir. 1976), cert. denied, 481 U.S. 1059
(1987) (finding no market harm where pro-choice work was excerpted in
anti-abortion book because of differing viewpoints and editorial formats);
Hustler, 796 F.2d at 1155-56; <I>Religious Technology Center v. Lerma,</I> _ F. Supp. _,
No. 95-1107-A, slip op. at 10 (E.D. Va. August 30, 1995) (finding fair use
defense probably valid in part because no separate market for Advanced Technology
works where Scientologists cannot effectively use them without the Church's
supervision); <I>Religious Technology Center v. F.A.C.T. Net. Inc.,</I> No. 95-B-2143,
slip op. at 11-14 (D. Colo. September 15, 1995) (finding valid fair use defense
because financial harm to the Church was unlikely and there was no showing of a
potential effect on the market for plaintiffs' works). Accordingly, the court
finds that this factor weighs in Erlich's favor. <P>

e. Equitable Balancing<P>

In balancing the various factors, the court finds that the percentage of
plaintiffs' works copied combined with the minimal added criticism or commentary
negates a finding of fair use. Although criticism is a favored use, where that
"criticism" consists of copying large portions of plaintiffs' works - and
sometimes all of those works - with often no more than one line of criticism, the
fair use defense is inappropriate. Erlich has not adequately justified his
copying verbatim large portions of plaintiffs' works. The amount of copying was
particularly unacceptable with the unpublished Exhibit B works. <P>

While copying all or most of a work does not necessarily preclude fair use,
those cases recognizing fair use for complete copying are easily distinguishable.
Although the Sony Court found acceptable the copying of entire television shows
with no added content, this was necessary for the purpose of time-shifting.
Unlike Erlich, the time-shifters in Sony were already given permission to view
the works in their entirety for free. Sony, 464 U.S. at 449-450. The Court
further noted in Sony that time-shifters are just as likely to buy prerecorded
videos as live viewers, and thus there is no effect on the market for the
original. Id. at 450 n. 33. The case that perhaps best supports Erlich's
position, Belmore, is also distinguishable. See supra note 17. The original work
copied verbatim in Belmore was shorter than many of the works Erlich copied and
the added criticism in Belmore was far longer than most of the criticism that
Erlich made. 880 F. Supp. at 678-79. Additionally, unlike the district court in
Belmore, this court does not find reasonable Erlich's claim that he copied no
more than was necessary for his purpose. Moreover, this court is not convinced
that Belmore is supported by Ninth Circuit law. See <I>Supermarket of Homes, Inc. v.
San Fernando Valley Board of Realtors,</I> 786 F.2d 1400, 1409 (9th Cir. 1986)
("Generally, no more of a work may be taken than is necessary to make the
accompanying comment understandable."). <P>

While use of a large percentage or the "heart" of the copyrighted work does not
rule out fair use per se, other factors are not sufficiently in Erlich's favor to
overcome this third factor. Further, the second factor weighs strongly against
Erlich as to the unpublished works. The almost verbatim copying here shows that
Erlich's work is only minimally transformative and that it is unlikely that
Erlich is "truly pursuing a different functional milieu" from the original. 3
Nimmer section 13.05[D][1], at 13-231. In addition, as to the unpublished
materials, Erlich's use of possibly illicit copies of those works weighs against
him. Thus, Erlich's showing on the first factor is not very strong despite his
critical purpose. Similarly, Erlich's showing on the fourth factor does not
persuasively suggest fair use. If Erlich's use were to become widespread, it
could potentially have an effect on the market for plaintiffs' works by supplying
future splinter groups with the materials needed to compete with the Church. The
court views this potentiality as somewhat remote. Nevertheless, given plaintiffs'
very strong showing on the third factor, the court finds that, on balance, the
equities do not favor a finding of fair use. The case against fair use is even
more compelling for the unpublished works.[FN20] But see Lerma, slip op. at 10
(order denying temporary restraining order against defendant Washington Post from
using Advanced Technology documents obtained from open court files in Fishman;
finding fair use defense exists where no separate market for works because
Scientologist cannot effectively use them without the Church's supervision);
F.A.C.T. Net, slip op. at 11-14 (denying preliminary injunction against copying
of Advanced Technology works based on fair use defense because financial harm to
the Church was unlikely, there was no commercial motive, works were used in part
of "ongoing dialogue" on the Internet, and there was no showing of a potential
effect on the market for plaintiffs' works). <P>

4. Conclusion<P>

Accordingly, plaintiffs have demonstrated a likelihood of success on its claims
that Erlich infringed their copyrights on all of the Exhibit A and B works,
except items 4 and 9 of Exhibit A and item 9 of Exhibit B. <P>

<B>C. Likelihood of Success on Trade Secret Claim </B><P>

In third cause of action, plaintiff RTC alleges that Erlich misappropriated its
trade secrets. California has adopted a version of the Uniform Trade Secret Act
("UTSA"), Cal. Civ. Code section 3426.1 et seq. The UTSA defines a trade secret
as <P>

information, including a formula, pattern, compilation, program, device, method,
technique, or process, that: <P><OL>

<LI> Derives independent economic value, actual or potential, from not being
generally known to the public or to other persons who can obtain economic value
from its disclosure or use; and <P>

<LI> Is the subject of efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances to
maintain its secrecy. <P></ol>

Cal. Civ. Code section 3426.1(d).[FN21] The UTSA further defines
"misappropriation" of a trade secret as <P>
<OL>
<LI> Acquisition of a trade secret of another by a person who knows or has reason
to know that the trade secret was acquired by improper means; or <P>

<LI> Disclosure or use of a trade secret of another without express or implied
consent by a person who: <P><UL>

<LI> Used improper means to acquire knowledge of the trade secret; or <P>

<LI> At the time of disclosure or use, knew or had reason to know that his or her
knowledge of the trade secret was; <P><oL>

<LI> Derived from or through a person who had utilized improper means to acquire
it; <P>

<LI> Acquired under circumstances giving rise to a duty to maintain its secrecy
or limit its use; or <P>

<LI> Derived from or through a person who owed a duty to the person seeking
relief to maintain its secrecy or limit its use; or <P></ol>

<LI> Before a material change of his or her position, knew or had reason to know
that it was a trade secret and that knowledge of it had been acquired by accident
or mistake. <P></ul>

Id. at 3426.1(b). </OL><P>

To establish its trade secret claim, RTC must show, inter alia, that the
Advanced Technology works (1) have independent economic value to competitors and
(2) have been kept confidential. <P>

1. Nature of Works<P>

As a preliminary matter, Erlich argues that the Advanced Technology works cannot
be trade secrets because of their nature as religious scriptures. In Wollersheim,
796 F.2d at 1090-91, the Ninth Circuit rejected the Church's application for a
preliminary injunction on the basis of a trade secret claim against a splinter
Scientology group that had acquired stolen copies of the Advanced Technology. The
Church argued not that the works gave them a competitive market advantage but
that disclosure of the works would cause its adherents "religious harm . . . from
premature unsupervised exposure to the materials." Id. Although the Ninth Circuit
rejected plaintiffs' trade secret argument based on the spiritual value of the
harm, it later noted that it had left open the question of whether the Advanced
Technology works could qualify as trade secrets, assuming plaintiffs could prove
that the secrets confer on them an actual economic advantage over competitors.
<I>Religious Technology Center v. Scott,</I> 869 F.2d 1306, 1310 (9th Cir. 1989); cf.
Vien, 729 F. Supp. at 629.[FN22] Nonetheless, the court noted that such an
allegation would "raise grave doubts about [the Church's] claims as a religion
and a not-for-profit corporation."(23) Id. (quoting Wollersheim 796 F.2d at
1091). <P>

The Church contends that the Advanced Technology works consist of "processes and
the theory behind those processes . . . that are to be used precisely as set
forth by L. Ron Hubbard to assist parishioner in achieving a greater spiritual
awareness and freedom." McShane February 27, 1995 Decl. 9 (emphasis added).
Erlich responds that the works are essentially religious texts. Cf. FAC 9
(describing Hubbard as author of "applied religious philosophy and spiritual
healing technology" and works as "training materials and course manuals of the
Scientology religion"). Erlich argues that the Church cannot have trade secrets
because trade secret law is necessarily related to commerce. See <I>Kewanee Oil Co.
v. Bicron Corp.,</I> 416 U.S. 470, 481, 485 (1974). The Church contends that, like
other organizations, it must pay bills, and that licensing fees from these
documents allow it to continue operating. McShane February 27, 1995 Decl. 7. <P>

The Church's status as a religion does not itself preclude it from holding a
trade secret. Restatement section 39 cmt. d, at 429 ("[N]onprofit entities such
as . . . religious organizations can also claim trade secret protection for
economically valuable information such as lists of prospective members or
donors."); UTSA section 3426.1(c) (defining "person" to include a "corporation .
. . or any other legal or commercial entity"); cf. <I>United Christian Scientists v.
Christian Science Board of Directors,</I> 829 F.2d 1152, 1169 (D.C. Cir. 1987)
(noting that Church was entitled to copyright protection on same basis as
nonreligious groups). With the exception of the Vien case, there is little
authority to support a finding that religious materials can constitute trade
secrets. However, there is "no category of information [that] is excluded from
protection as a trade secret because of its inherent qualities." <I>Clark v. Bunker,</I>
453 F.2d 1006, 1009 (9th Cir. 1972) (citing Restatement of Torts, section 757
cmt. b. at 5) (upholding as a trade secret a "detailed plan for the creation,
promotion, financing, and sale of contracts for 'prepaid' or 'pre-need' funeral
services"); see also <I>Smith v. Dravo Corp.,</I> 203 F.2d 369, 373 (7th Cir. 1953) ("We
assume that almost any knowledge or information used in the conduct of one's
business may be held by its possessor in secret."). <P>

Nor is there any authority to support Erlich's argument that the Church's
religious texts cannot be trade secrets because, unlike most trade secrets, these
secrets are not used in the production or sales of a commodity but are the
commodities themselves. The Church's Advanced Technology "course" materials,
which are an integral part of the Church's spiritual counseling techniques, do
not appear fundamentally different from the course manuals upheld as trade
secrets in <I>SmokEnders, Inc. v. Smoke No More, Inc.,</I> 184 U.S.P.Q. 309 (S.D. Fla.
1974): <P><blockquote>

The [SmokEnders ("SE") program requires attendees to follow a rigid structured
regimen comprised of specific assignments and detail[ed] concepts as recited in
[the manual]. . . . <P>

The SE program is a step-by-step regimented program which requires that each
person attending a SE program perform each act of the program at a particular
time. Each act required by a SE seminar attendee must be performed by attendees
at the same time in the program, with each a minimum departure from the program. <P>

The SE trade secret resides in the composite program as it is arranged for
step-by-step delivery to the attendees. <P></blockquote>

Id. at 312 (emphasis added). SmokEnders is arguably distinguishable because only
the "moderators" and not the attendees were given access to the course materials
in that case. However, the adherents of the Church, unlike the attendees and like
the moderators in SmokEnders, are under a duty of confidentiality as to the
materials. This case is analogous to SmokEnders because in both cases the
"commodity" that is produced from the trade secrets is the result achieved by the
person using the course materials and their techniques (whether it be stopping
smoking or reaching a "higher spiritual existence"). <P>

Thus, there is at least some precedent for granting trade secret status to works
that are techniques for improving oneself (though not specifically spiritually).
Conversely, there is no authority for excluding religious materials from trade
secret protection because of their nature. Indeed, there is no authority for
excluding any type of information because of its nature. While the trade secret
laws did not necessarily develop to allow a religion to protect a monopoly in its
religious practices, the laws have nonetheless expanded such that the Church's
techniques, which clearly are "used in the operation of the enterprise,"
Restatement section 39, at 425, are deserving of protection if secret and
valuable. <P>

Although trade secret status may apply to works that are techniques for
spiritually improving oneself, the secret aspect of those techniques must be
defined with particularity. See Restatement section 39 cmt d, at 430 (requiring
plaintiff to define the information claimed as a trade secret with sufficient
definiteness). It appears that plaintiffs are claiming that the entire works
themselves, which they describe as "processes and the theory behind those
processes," constitute the trade secrets. See Pltfs.' Mem. in Support of Prelim.
Inj. at 17. This definition is problematic because it is impossible to determine
when the "secret" has been lost after portions of the works have been disclosed.
Cf. F.A.C.T. Net, slip op. at 16 ("In the course of the hearing . . . RTC changed
its position with regard to what materials constitute the purported trade
secrets."). Although plaintiffs' definition has at least some support in
SmokEnders, where the court upheld as a trade secret a "composite [stop-smoking]
program" found in an instructional manual, 184 U.S.P.Q. at 312, this court is not
satisfied that plaintiffs have identified their trade secrets with sufficient
definiteness to support injunctive relief. <P>

2. Independent Economic Value<P>

A trade secret requires proof of "independent economic value, actual or
potential, from not being generally known to the public or to other persons who
can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use." UTSA section 3426.1(d)(1).
A trade secret must have sufficient value in the owner's operation of its
enterprise such that it provides an actual or potential advantage over others who
do not possess the information. Restatement section 39 cmt. e, at 430. <P>

RTC's president, Warren McShane, attests that <P>
<blockquote>
[t]he Advanced Technology is a source of substantial revenue for RTC in the form
of licensing fees paid by Churches that are licensed to use the Advanced
Technology. These Churches themselves receive a significant amount of their
income from donations by parishioners for services based upon the Advanced
Technology. These Churches pay RTC a percentage of the donations paid by
parishioners for the services based upon the Advanced Technology. These donations
and fees provide the majority of operating expenses of these various Church
organizations. <P></blockquote>

McShane May 31, 1995 Decl. 16; see also Vien, 827 F. Supp. at 633 (finding
Advanced Technology has value to Church by helping support its operations
world-wide). The Church's need for revenues to support its services is no less
because of its status as a religion. Id. (citing <I>Murdock v. Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania,</I> 319 U.S. 105, 111 (1943)). RTC points out that it receives six
percent of what the individual churches receive in licensing fees. J. Kobrin May
31, 1995 Decl, Ex. A ("McShane Depo."), at 43. This evidence is sufficient to
establish the value of the Advanced Technology works to the Church. <P>

Erlich also argues that, to constitute a trade secret, information must give its
owner a competitive advantage, which implies that the Church must have
competitors, as it did in Vien. See <I>Ruckelshaus v. Monsanto Co.,</I> 467 U.S. 986,
1011 n.15 (1984); <I>Abba Rubber Co. v. Seaquist,</I> 235 Cal. App. 3d 1, 18 (1991).
Although Erlich is clearly not a "competitor" of the Church, there is no
requirement that a trade secret have any value to the defendant; the value can be
to "others who do not possess it." UTSA section 3426.1(d)(1). The Church has
admitted, however, that it currently has no "competitors." McShane Depo. at 95.
However, the definition of trade secret does not require that there currently be
competitors, only that there be actual or potential value from the information
being secret. Thus, potential competition is sufficient. Id. This evidence can be
shown by direct evidence of the impact of the information on the business or by
circumstantial evidence of the resources invested in producing the information,
the precautions taken to protect its secrecy, and the willingness of others to
pay for its access. Restatement section 39 cmt. e, at 431. The several past
instances of breakaway Scientology-like groups exploiting RTC's Advanced
Technology works for their profit constitute reasonable circumstantial evidence
that these works give the Church a competitive advantage. See McShane Depo. at
93-94 (citing several former Church members who started rival factions); Vien,
827 F. Supp. at 634 (describing a rival faction); Wollersheim, 796 F.2d at 1078
(same). In fact, McShane's declaration constitutes direct evidence that the works
have a significant impact on the donations received by the Church, providing a
majority of its operating expenses. McShane May 31, 1995 Decl. 16. The status of
the Advanced Technology works as trade secrets should not depend on Erlich's use
of them. Accordingly, this court finds support for the court's conclusion in Vien
that the Church has shown independent economic value. <P>

3. Secrecy<P>

Information protectable as a trade secret where the owner has taken "efforts
that are reasonable under the circumstances to maintain its secrecy." UTSA
section 3426.1(b)(2) (emphasis added). "Reasonable efforts" can include advising
employees of the existence of a trade secret, limiting access to the information
on a "need to know basis," <I>Courtesy Temporary Service, Inc. v. Camacho,</I> 222 Cal.
App. 3d 1278, 1288 (1990), requiring employees to sign confidentiality
agreements. MAI, 991 F.2d at 521, and keeping secret documents under lock, 1
Milgrim section 1.04, at 1-126. Accord Restatement section 39 cmt. g at 435. The
court finds that RTC has put forward sufficient evidence that it took steps that
were reasonable under the circumstances to protect its purported trade secrets.
RTC's president describes elaborate means taken to ensure the confidentiality of
the Advanced Technology works, including use of locked cabinets, safes, logging
and identification of the materials, availability of the materials at only a
handful of sites worldwide, electronic sensors attached to documents, locked
briefcases for transporting works, alarms, photo identifications, security
personnel, and confidentiality agreements for all of those given access to the
materials. McShane February 8, 1995 Decl. 13-18. McShane testifies that all
copies of the Advanced Technology works that are outside of the Church were
gained through improper means, such as by theft. Id. 22-24. Thirty-five other
declarants confirm that the measures mentioned by McShane have been used, though
not in exactly the same manner, in other Churches and at other times. See, e.g.,
Sydejko Decl. (describing measures used at Erlich's facilities during relevant
time period); Byrne Decl. 15 (stating works have been kept confidential since at
least 1968). There is further evidence that Erlich himself signed confidentiality
agreements with respect to the Advanced Technology materials and, specifically,
the upper-level "NOTS" course materials. See McShane February 8, 1995 Decl., Exs.
H-I; McShane February 27, 1995 Decl., Exs. D-F; McShane Depo. at 201-03; H.
Kobrin Marcy 31, 1995 Decl., Ex. A ("Erlich Depo."), at 84-88. The court is
unpersuaded by Erlich's claims that the Church's measures have not covered all
locations where the Advanced Technology works are found and do not cover crucial
time periods.[FN24] Efforts at maintaining secrecy need not be extreme, just
reasonable under the circumstances. Legislative Committee Comment - Senate, Cal.
Civ. Code section 3426.1, at 147 (West Supp. 1995). The church has made more than
an adequate showing on this issue.[FN25] <P>

Erlich raises a number of objections to the Church's claims of confidentiality.
Erlich argues that the Church's trade secrets have been made available to the
public through various means. The unprotected disclosure of a trade secret will
cause the information to forfeit its trade secret status, since "[i]nformation
that is generally known or readily ascertainable through proper means by others .
. . is not protectable as a trade secret." Restatement section 39 cmt. f, at 432;
see also Cal. Civ. Code section 3426.1(d); Kewanee Oil, 416 U.S. at 484; <I>Chicago
Lock Co. v. Fanberg,</I> 676 F.2d 400, 404 (9th Cir. 1982); 1 Milgrim at 1-135. Once
trade secrets have been exposed to the public, they cannot later be recalled. In
re Remington Avenue Arms Co., 952 F.2d 1029, 1033 (8th Cir. 1991); Smith, 203
F.2d at 373. <P>

Erlich argues that many of the Advanced Technology documents have been available
in open court records in another case. <I>Church of Scientology Int'l v. Fishman,</I>
Case No. 91-6426 HLH (C.D. Cal.), destroying the necessary element of secrecy.
Cf. Lerma, slip op. at 2 (noting that some of Advanced Technology works were
available in the court file in Fishman and that they were not subject to a
sealing or protective order). However, the Fishman court recently issued an order
sealing the file pending a decision on whether the documents are trade secrets.
Even if those records were temporarily open to the public, the court will not
assume that their contents have been generally disclosed, especially when this
question is still pending before the district court in Fishman. Such a
disclosure, without evidence that the secrets have become generally known, does
not necessarily cause RTC to forfeit its trade secrets. See <I>Gates Rubber Co. v.
Bando Chemical Industries, Ltd.,</I> 9 F.3d 823, 848-49 (10th Cir. 1993) (finding
that information retained its secret status despite being disclosed at hearing,
where plaintiff evidenced continuing intent to maintain its secrecy by acting to
seal the record). The contrary result would mean that if documents were ever
filed without a sealing order, even for a short time, the court would not be able
to decide that they should be sealed because the documents would have lost their
potential trade secret status by virtue of the temporary unsealing. The only fair
result would be to allow trade secret status for works that are otherwise
protectable as trade secrets unless they were somehow made generally available to
the public during the period they were unsealed, such as by publication. <P>

Erlich further asserts that the Advanced Technology has been largely disclosed
in the popular press, as evidenced by various publications attached to the Berger
Declaration, which was originally filed in the Fishman case.[FN26] These articles
may reveal information referring to or hinting at the trade secrets, but may not
disclose the secrets themselves, see McShane May 31, 1995 Decl. 12 (cataloging
what was disclosed by the Exhibits in Fishman).[FN27] However, as previously
noted, the court is not certain how to properly define the "secrets." To the
extent that someone uses or discloses any information taken from any of these
articles, there is clearly no trade secret claim. However, much of Erlich's
postings copied all or almost all of sections of the Advanced Technology works,
which is far more than has ever been disclosed in the popular press. See id.
12-15. In fact, several of the works posted by Erlich are not mentioned in any of
the clippings in the Berger declaration. Id. Arguably, the Church's alleged
secrets are such that their value depends on the availability of the complete
courses and not mere fragments, thus disclosures that describe parts of the works
or disclose isolated portions do not necessarily suffice to ruin the value of the
entire works as secrets. Cf. SmokEnders, 184 U.S.P.Q. at 317 (finding that
secret's value can be from unified design including components that are
individually in the public domain). However, without a clearer definition of what
constitute the "secrets," the court is unable to determine whether some have been
made generally known to the public.[FN28] <P>

Finally, Erlich newly emphasizes in his Reply that the works he posted were not
secrets because he received them through proper means: eight of the documents
were allegedly previously posted anonymously to a public portion of the Internet
and one of the documents (item 1 of Exhibit B) allegedly came to Erlich
anonymously through the U.S. mail. Erlich claims that because the alleged trade
secrets were received from "public sources," they should lose their trade secret
protection. Although the Internet is a new technology, it requires no great leap
to conclude that because more than 25 million people could have accessed the
newsgroup postings from which Erlich alleges he received the Exhibit B works,
these works would lose their status as secrets. While the Internet has not
reached the status where a temporary posting on a newsgroup is akin to
publication in a major newspaper or on a television network, those with an
interest in using the Church's trade secrets to compete with the Church are
likely to look to the newsgroup. Thus, posting works to the Internet makes them
"generally known" to the relevant people - the potential "competitors" of the
Church. <P>

The court is troubled by the notion that any Internet user, including those
using "anonymous remailers"[FN29] to protect their identity, can destroy valuable
intellectual property rights by posting them over the Internet, especially given
the fact that there is little opportunity to screen postings before they are
made. See Eduardo M. Carreras, "Intellectual Property: First Casualty on the
Information Highway," 13 No. 1 ACCA Docket 26 (Westlaw) ("Carreras") (Jan.-Feb.
1995) at *29-*32 (suggesting that trade secret protection is lost as soon as
information is disclosed on the Internet). Nonetheless, one of the Internet's
virtues, that it gives even the poorest individuals the power to publish to
millions of readers, see Eugene Volokh, "Cheap Speech and What It Will Do," 104
Yale L.J. 1805, 1806-07 (1995), can also be a detriment to the value of
intellectual property rights. The anonymous (or judgment proof) defendant can
permanently destroy valuable trade secrets, leaving no one to hold liable for the
misappropriation. See Carreras at *30. Although a work posted to an Internet
newsgroup remains accessible to the public for only a limited amount of time,
once that trade secret has been released into the public domain there is no
retrieving it. In re Remington Arms, 952 F.2d at 1033. While the court is
persuaded by the Church's evidence that those who made the original postings
likely gained the information through improper means, as no one outside the
Church or without a duty of confidence would have had access to those
works,[FN30] this does not negate the finding that, once posted, the works lost
their secrecy. Although Erlich cannot rely on his own improper postings to
support the argument that the Church's documents are no longer secrets, see 3
Milgrim section 15.01[1][a][ii], at 15-43, evidence that another individual has
put the alleged trade secrets into the public domain prevents RTC from further
enforcing its trade secret rights in those materials. Because there is no
evidence that Erlich is a privy of any of the alleged original misappropriators,
he is not equitably estopped from raising their previous public disclosures as a
defense to his disclosure.<I> Underwater Storage, Inc. v. United States Rubber Co.,</I>
371 F.2d 950, 955 (D.C. Cir. 1966), cert. denied, 386 U.S. 911 (1967) ("Once the
secret is out, the rest of the world may well have a right to copy it at will;
but this should not protect the misappropriator or his privies."). The court is
thus convinced that those postings made by Erlich were of materials that were
possibly already generally available to the public. See Lerma, slip op. at 14-15
(finding that RTC could not show the Advanced Technology works were not
"generally known" to support injunctive relief); F.A.C.T. Net, slip op, at 16
(same). Therefore, RTC has not shown a likelihood of success on an essential
element of its trade secret claim.[FN31] <P>

4. Conclusion and Alternative Test<P>

Because RTC is the plaintiff, and because it is moving for injunctive relief, it
bears the burden of proving its trade secrets. 3 Milgrim section 15.01[1]. The
court finds that RTC has failed to adequately define its trade secrets and, at
least as to those works that have been made available to the public through
previous Internet postings not by Erlich, RTC has failed to meet its burden on
the issue of secrecy. Therefore, RTC has failed to show a likelihood of success
on its trade secret misappropriation claim. <P>

RTC's failure to prove a likelihood of success on its trade secret claim of
secrecy does not necessarily preclude it from showing an entitlement 1to a
preliminary injunction. RTC can meet the second formulation of the preliminary
injunction test by showing a combination of serious questions going to the merits
of its trade secret claim and that the balance of hardships tips in its favor.
However, since the trade secrets have not been adequately defined, the court
cannot find that serious questions going to the merits have been sufficiently
raised to justify a preliminary injunction on the trade secret claim. Until RTC
better describes what its trade secrets are, it is impossible to determine
whether previous public disclosures of parts of the Advanced Technology works are
sufficient to destroy the secrecy of the entire work. While parts of many of the
works have been mentioned in various published articles and books, the court is
unclear what effect such disclosures would have on the secrecy and value of an
entire work. The court is also not entirely persuaded by RTC's argument that its
secrets have competitive value to future breakaway groups. These issues will have
to be resolved before RTC can ultimately prevail on its trade secret claims. <P>

<B>D. Irreparable Injury and Balance of Hardships </B><P>

The court will presume irreparable harm for the copyright claim because
plaintiffs have shown a likelihood of success on their claims of infringement.
<I>Johnson Controls, Inc. v. Phoenix Control Systems, Inc.,</I> 886 F.2d 1173, 1174 (9th
Cir. 1989); <I>Apple Computer, Inc. v. Formula International, Inc.,</I> 725 F.2d 521
(9th Cir. 1984). <P>

<B>E. First Amendment Concerns</B><P>

In his Reply, Erlich argues that there is a strong presumption against any
injunction that could act as a "prior restraint" on free speech, citing <I>CBS, Inc.
v. Davis,</I> 114 S. Ct. 912, 913-14 (1994) (Justice Blackmun, as Circuit Justice,
staying a preliminary injunction prohibiting CBS from airing footage from inside
meat packing plant). The court notes, however, that the 1976 Act explicitly
sanctions the use of preliminary injunctions in the case of copyright
infringement. 17 U.S.C. sections 501(a), 502(a). The Supreme Court has recognized
that the Copyright Act itself embodies a balance between the rights of copyright
holders, guaranteed by the Constitution, U.S. Const. art. I, section 8, and the
protections of the First Amendment. See Harper & Row, 471 U.S. at 557-60; In re
Capital Cities/ABC, Inc., 918 F.2d 140, 143-44 (11th Cir. 1990). The doctrine of
fair use already considers First Amendment concerns. New Era Publications
International, <I>ApS v. Henry Holt & Co.,</I> 873 F.2d 576, 584 (2d Cir. 1989), cert.
denied, 493 U.S. 1094 (1990) (rejecting defendant's argument that First Amendment
concerns precluded granting an injunction, though finding other equitable
considerations dictated denial of injunctive relief). Because Erlich is able to
continue to criticize the Church and use its published and unpublished works to
the extent allowed by the doctrine of fair use and because the injunctive relief
sought is no broader than necessary to protect plaintiffs' copyrights, Erlich's
First Amendment interests have been adequately considered. <P>

<B>F. Conclusion</B><P>

Plaintiffs have shown a likelihood of success on the merits of their copyright
claims except as to item 4 of Exhibit A, for which the copyright has expired.
Plaintiffs gain the benefit of a presumption of irreparable harm as to this
claim. Accordingly, plaintiffs are entitled to a preliminary injunction
prohibiting any further copying of plaintiffs' copyrighted Exhibit A and B works
pending a trial on the merits, except as to item 4 of Exhibit A and as allowed by
the doctrine of fair use.[FN32] Under the fair use doctrine, Erlich may post, or
otherwise publish, his criticism of the Church, using plaintiffs' copyrighted
Exhibit A and B works to the extent necessary to carry out his critical purpose.
However, the court notes that copying the works in their entirety with very
little added criticism is almost certainly not fair use. <P>

Accordingly, the court grants in part and denies in part plaintiffs' application
for a preliminary injunction and Erlich' motion to dissolve the TRO. <P>


<H3>III. PLAINTIFFS' APPLICATION TO EXPAND THE TRO </H3>

Plaintiffs have applied to expand the scope of the preliminary injunction
against Erlich to include more of plaintiffs' works that are allegedly protected
by copyright and trade secret law, beyond those listed in Exhibits A and B of the
FAC. This request comes after plaintiffs maintain that Erlich violated a promise
he made to the court to convince it to continue the contempt hearing. On March
14, 1995, counsel for Erlich stated that Erlich "would agree not to publish any
of Mr. Ron Hubbard's writings, or copyright-registered writings of the Church of
Scientology, until the contempt hearing." See March 16, 1995 Order Setting
Hearing Dates. Plaintiffs seek to expand the number of documents covered by the
injunction to include 52 works because Erlich allegedly "furnished a copy of
another copyrighted, confidential work, taken from the same course as the
document which he posted in his first violation of the TRO, to a litigant in
another lawsuit." Ex Parte App. for Amended TRO at 4. However, plaintiffs have
not provided Erlich or the court with the registrations for these materials to
allow a determination that they are the subject of valid copyright interests. The
scope of this case should not be expanded to encompass all or a large number of
Hubbard's copyrighted works merely because Erlich made a promise to allow the
postponement of the contempt hearing. Now that there has been a contempt hearing,
and given the court's finding that Erlich was not in contempt, see part IV infra,
the court does not believe that an overly expansive preliminary injunction is
appropriate. In fact, a broad injunction which goes beyond the scope of the
allegedly infringing activities should be avoided for First Amendment reasons.
See 3 Nimmer section 14.06[C], at 14-106 to -109 (noting that scope of injunction
should be coterminous with, and no broader than, infringement); In re Capital
Cities/ABC, Inc., 918 F.2d at 144 (calling for a "surgical" restraint to
accommodate First Amendment rights). Accordingly, the court denies plaintiffs'
application for an expansion of the injunctive relief.[FN33] <P>

Request To Seize Erlich's Computer<P>

The court finds plaintiffs' request that Erlich's computer and other equipment
be seized to be wholly without merit. No amount of excessive copying in the
context of criticism, which is potentially subject to a valid fair use defense,
would warrant such a seizure. Here, Erlich's equipment is hardly an instrument of
infringement. Rather, it is essential to the operation of his business and other
affairs. While a specifically-tailored injunction in a copyright case does not
offend the First Amendment, attempting to shut down a critic's speech activities,
including those that do not implicate the copyright laws in the least, would
constitute an unwarranted prior restraint on speech. Cf. 3 Nimmer section
14.06[C], at 14-107 to -109; <I>RCA Records v. All-Fast Systems, Inc.,</I> 594 F. Supp.
335, 340 (S.D.N.Y. 1984) (where action not against record pirates, court should
not seize equipment which can be used for non-infringing purposes). <P>

<H3>IV. MOTION FOR CONTEMPT</H3>

The Ninth Circuit set forth the standards for civil contempt in In re Dual-Deck
Video Cassette Antitrust Litigation, 10 F.3d 693 (9th Cir. 1993): <P>
<blockquote>
Civil contempt in this context consists of a party's disobedience to a specific
and definite court order by failure to take all reasonable steps within the
party's power to comply. The contempt "need not be willful," and there is no good
faith exception to the requirement of obedience to a court order. But a person
should not be held in contempt if his action "appears to be based on a good faith
and reasonable interpretation of the [court's order].'" "Substantial compliance"
with the court order is a defense to civil contempt, and is not vitiated by "a
few technical violations" where every reasonable effort has been made to comply. <P>

The party alleging civil contempt must demonstrate that the alleged contemnor
violated the court's order by "clear and convincing evidence," not merely a
preponderance of the evidence. <P></blockquote>

This set of rules is easy to articulate but difficult to apply. [The court must
properly determine] (1) that [plaintiff] violated the court order, (2) beyond
substantial compliance, (3) not based on a good faith and reasonable
interpretation of the order, (4) by clear and convincing evidence. <P>

Id. at 695 (citations omitted). Plaintiffs allege that Erlich has violated the
terms of the Amended TRO on three separate occasions. <P>

<B>A. First Alleged Contempt</B><P>

First, plaintiffs allege that Erlich was in contempt of this court's February
10, 1995 TRO or its February 23, 1995 Amended TRO when, on February 26, 1995,
Erlich posted portions of item 1 of Exhibit B, the Class VIII "Assists" tape
transcript ("the Assists transcript"). Erlich contends that he had not received
the court's Amended TRO at the time he made the posting. At the time of the
posting, Erlich was not yet represented by counsel. The court's original TRO
enjoined Erlich from making certain uses of the Exhibit A and B works, but did
not make clear that Erlich could make fair use of the non-trade secret Exhibit A
works. From the content of Erlich's posting, it seems that Erlich thought he was
engaging in fair use of the Assists transcript. While the court did not
explicitly indicate that Erlich could make "fair use" of any of the unpublished,
confidential Exhibit B works at the February 21, 1995 hearing, the court
indicated that its Amended TRO would "prohibit any publication of confidential
matter or any publication of copyrighted matter that was not that which is fair
criticism or comment or fair use." Erlich's March 15, 1995 Opp'n, Ex. A, Tr.
30-31. Elrich may have reasonably misconstrued this language so that he believed
the exception for fair use also modified the first clause, "prohibit[ing] any
publication of confidential matter," especially given Erlich's pro se status at
the hearing. Accordingly, the court does not find that plaintiffs have shown by
clear and convincing evidence that Erlich's mistake was not a "good faith and
reasonable interpretation of the [court's oral] order." In re Dual-Deck Video
Cassette Antitrust Litigation, 10 F.3d at 695. Although the court is not
convinced that Erlich's use of the Exhibit B works, to which the fair use defense
would not have applied at the time, was in any case a fair use, the defense was
not adequately explained in the context of the hearing such that Erlich's
violation could be considered a violation of a "specific and definite" court
order. See id. <P>

<B>B. Second Alleged Contempt</B><P>

Plaintiffs allege that Erlich provided copies of one of Hubbard's Advanced
Technology writings to another litigant to be used in a declaration. As the court
found in its May 5, 1995 "Order Denying Plaintiffs' Ex Parte Application To
Shorten Time re Contempt Hearing," plaintiffs have not demonstrated how Erlich
has clearly violated the Amended TRO, which prohibited certain uses of the
Exhibits to the complaint, by attaching to a declaration a work not listed in the
Exhibits to the complaint but merely "related to" one of those works. Plaintiffs
have submitted to new evidence on this issue that would lead the court to change
its earlier ruling. <P>

<B>C. Third Alleged Contempt</B><P>

Third, plaintiffs allege that on May 15, 1995, an interview of Erlich appeared
on a BBC television show which contained a segment related to this case.
Plaintiffs have attached a declaration stating that plaintiffs believe Erlich
disclosed information "taken right out of" one part of the Advanced Technology
listed in Exhibit B-1[FN34] to the First Amended Complaint. Erlich disputes that
he disclosed any portion of the Exhibit B works on the British television show,
and argues that the information he disclosed is already widely available to the
public, as evidenced by several articles in newspapers and magazines. Erlich
further objects to the declaration of Warren McShane offered by plaintiffs, as it
lacks foundation for the content of the BBC interview. Even accepting the
validity of McShane's declaration regarding what was disclosed on the BBC show,
the court finds that plaintiffs have failed to prove by clear and convincing
evidence that Erlich in fact disclosed any of the Exhibit B works which were the
subject of the Amended TRO. To the extent that Erlich' extremely brief statement
relating to the Advanced Technology discloses information from one of those
works, the court further finds that Erlich stated nothing more than has appeared
in numerous newspaper and magazine articles and books about the Church. See,
e.g., Joel Sappell & Robert W. Welkos, "The Man Behind the Religion" L.A. Times,
June 24, 1990, at A36, Oakley May 31, 1995 Decl., Ex. C, at 81. <P>

<H3>V. ERLICH'S MOTION TO VACATE WRIT OF SEIZURE</H3>

Erlich challenges the February 10, 1995 writ of seizure[FN35] on the grounds
that it was not authorized under the Federal Rules and that it is
unconstitutionally overbroad. Erlich seeks the vacation of the writ of seizure,
the return of all materials seized, and an increase in the amount of the bond. <P>

Erlich argues that the writ of seizure is invalid because plaintiffs did not
comply with the requirements of Rule 65(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure. Plaintiffs respond that the seizure was authorized by the Supreme
Court's Copyright Rules, which provide for a summary process of seizure separate
from the Federal Rules. Plaintiffs further argue that, even if Rule 65(b)
applies, its requirements were met prior to the issuance of the writ. <P>

<B>A. SUPREME COURT'S COPYRIGHT RULES</B><P>

The 1976 Act provides for the impoundment of allegedly infringing articles: <P>
<blockquote>
At any time while an action under this title is pending, the court may order the
impounding, on such terms as it deems reasonable, of all copies . . . claimed to
have been made or used in violation of the copyright owner's exclusive rights,
and of all plates, molds, matrices, masters, tapes, film negatives, or other
articles by means of which such copies . . . may be reproduced. <P>
</blockquote>
17 U.S.C. section 503(a) (emphasis added). Unlike the 1909 Act, the 1976 Act
gives the court discretion whether to issue an impounding order. 3 Nimmer section
14.07, at 14-112. <P>

In 1909, the Supreme Court issued Copyright Rules ("Rules"), pursuant to section
25(e) of the 1909 Act, setting forth procedures for seizure and impoundment. See
17 U.S.C. foll. section 501. The Rules allow the clerk of the court to summarily
issue a writ of seizure of allegedly infringing articles without requiring any
preseizure notice or hearing. <I>Paramount Pictures Corp. v. Doc.</I> 821 F. Supp. 82,
86 (E.D.N.Y. 1993); 3 Nimmer section 14.07, at 14-113 to -114. Although neither
the Supreme Court nor the 1976 Act explicitly repealed the Copyright Rules,
<I>Warner Bros. Inc. v. Dae Rim Trading, Inc.,</I> 877 F.2d 1120, 1124 (2d Cir. 1989),
courts and commentators have questioned the Rules' continuing validity, both as a
matter of statutory construction and constitutional law. See <I>WPOW, Inc. v. MRLJ
Enterprises,</I> 584 F. Supp. 132, 134-35 (D.D.C. 1984) (rejecting continuing
validity of Rules based on added discretion in 1976 Act which is inconsistent
with summary and mandatory procedure of Rules); Paramount, 721 F. Supp. at 87-91
& n.4 (finding provisions of Rules "clearly inconsistent with the discretionary
powers" of the 1976 Act, noting that the 1976 Act "arguably supersedes and
renders null and void" the Rules, and holding that Rules run afoul of Fourth and
Fifth Amendments); <I>Van Deurzen & Assoc. v. Sanders,</I> 21 U.S.P.Q.2d 1480 (D. Kan.
1991); 3 Nimmer & 14.07, at 14-115 to -119 (noting that Rules' ex parte
proceedings are subject to "serious question" as to whether they violate free
speech, due process, and freedom from unreasonable searches and seizures); cf.
<I>First Technology Safety Systems, Inc. v. Depinet,</I> 11 F.3d 641, 648-49 & n.8 (6th
Cir. 1993) (noting debate regarding sufficiency of compliance with Rules and
applying Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(b) where seizure not authorized by Rules). <P>

Plaintiffs cite <I>Duchess Music Corp. v. Stern,</I> 458 F.2d 1305 (9th Cir.), cert.
denied sub nom. <I>Rosner v. Duchess Music Corp.,</I> 409 U.S. 847 (1972) to support
their position that the Rules still permit a summary procedure for the ex parte
granting of writs of seizure. In Duchess, the Ninth Circuit reversed the district
court's order that certain seized items be returned, holding that "[n]either the
[1909 Act] nor the Supreme Court rules give the District Court any discretion to
determine what to impound" and that the "process Congress granted the aggrieved
copyright proprietor is a summary one." Id. at 1308. Given the discretionary
language of the 1976 Act, and the expansion of the Fifth Amendment in cases such
as <I>Mitchell v. W.T. Grant Co.,</I> 416 U.S. 600 (1974), the court finds plaintiffs'
reliance on the Copyright Rules and Duchess to be misplaced. Instead the court
finds persuasive the reasoning of the courts in Paramount and WPOW questioning
the current validity of the summary process approved by the 1909 Act and Supreme
Court Rules and requiring plaintiffs to meet the requirements of Rule 65(b) of
the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. <P>

<B>B. Requirements of Rule 65(b)</B><P>

Rule 65(b) provides that ex parte injunctive relief will be granted <P>
<blockquote>
only if (1) it clearly appears from specific facts shown by affidavit or by the
verified complaint that immediate and irreparable injury, loss, or damage will
result to the applicant before the adverse party or that party's attorney can be
heard in opposition, and (2) the applicant's attorney certifies to the court in
writing the . . . reasons supporting the claim that notice should not be
required. <P> </blockquote>

Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(b) (emphasis added).<P>


1. Irreparable Injury<P>

In their ex parte applications for relief, plaintiffs argued that interim
injunctive relief was necessary because Erlich had repeatedly infringed
plaintiffs' copyrighted works, even after being warned by plaintiffs. In his
deposition, McShane testified that plaintiffs would suffer injury from Erlich's
unauthorized posting of plaintiff's works because "if people read those documents
they're not supposed to, and if that affects them from ever doing the service,
stops them from doing the service, obviously they won't make donations to the
church which will directly affect RTC economically." Oakley Reply Decl., Ex. B,
at 112. McShane also stated that he was "quite concerned that [Erlich] will
continue to defy requests to cease infringement even if ordered to do so by the
Court. Mr. Erlich has already placed multiple copyrighted works, including
several that are confidential, onto a massive computer network potentially
accessed by 25 million people." McShane February 8, 1995 Decl. Paragraph 56. The
court finds this evidence sufficient to establish a likelihood that, absent a
writ of seizure, Erlich would have continued to post plaintiffs' copyrighted
works prior to a hearing. Such a likelihood of further infringement before Erlich
could respond, combined with a reasonable likelihood of success on the copyright
infringement claim, allows the court to presume irreparable injury. See Apple,
725 F.2d at 525 (holding that reasonable likelihood of success of copyright
infringement claim allows presumption of irreparable injury); WPOW, 584 F.Supp.
at 138 (allowing presumption in context of impoundment. <P>

2. Reasons Why Notice Should Not Be Required <P>

The second element of Rule 65(b) permits injunctive relief without notice only
where notice to the adverse party is impossible, in some limited circumstances,
where notice would render further action fruitless. First Technology, 11 F.3d at
650. Plaintiffs may meet the latter exception to the notice requirement by
showing that Erlich "would have disregarded a direct court order and disposed of
the goods within the time it would take for a hearing." Id.; 3 Nimmer Section
14.07, at 14-115. This may be shown with evidence of a defendant's history of
violating court orders or destroying evidence, such as in the case of a member of
a counterfeiting ring who, if given notice, would simply transfer his inventories
to another member of the ring.[FN36] Id.; In re Vuitton et Fills S.A., 606 F.2d
1,4-5 (2d Cir. 1979). Plaintiffs provide evidence of the need for a pre-notice
seizure: Erlich stated that the decision whether to stop posting Scientology
works was his and that "[n]o local government or court in the [U.S.] has the
power to tell [him] otherwise." FAC, Ex. J. Although the court was persuaded at
the time of its seizure order that this evidence indicated that there was a
chance that Erlich would not follow a court order, the court has reconsidered its
original conclusion. Erlich's statement of defiance, made in the context of an
exchange of hostile letters between the parties, does not rise to the level
necessary to meet Rule 65(b)'s demanding requirements for dispensing with notice.
Further, other than this isolated statement, there was no evidence of Erlich's
propensity to defy a court order. The court does not find that this case is
analogous to that of a counterfeiter who, if given notice, might transfer the
infringing works elsewhere. Erlich is not "engaged primarily in illegitimate and
infringing activities and [is thus not]likely to disregard an order from [the
court] preventing [him] form disposing of or destroying any [evidence of
infringement]." Paramount, 821 F. Supp. at 89. The court further notes that
plaintiffs already had evidence of Erlich's infringing copies in the form of the
newsgroup postings, thereby reducing the importance of preserving other evidence
of infringement. Because there was an insufficient showing under Rule 65(b) to
support a writ of seizure, the writ must be vacated.[FN37] <P>

<B>C. Unconstitutionally Overbroad?</B><P>

Although the court has found that the requirements of Rule 65(b) were not
sufficiently met, the court further notes that one aspect of the order was
overbroad. "It is well settled that the Fourth Amendment prohibition against
unreasonable intrusions...governs not only criminal investigations but also
searches and seizures make pursuant to civil proceedings." Paramount, 821 F.Supp.
at 90 (citing <I>Soldal v. Cook County,</I> Ill., 113 S.Ct. 538, 546 & n.10 (1992)),
including "seizure orders directing the United States Marshal to impound
allegedly infringing articles under the Copyright Act," id. (citing <I>Warner Bros.,
Inc. v. Dae Rim Trading, Inc.,</I> 677 F.Supp. 740, 765 (S.D.N.Y. 1988), aff'd in
part, rev'd in part on other grounds, 877 F.2d 1120 (2d Cir. 1989)). To comply
with the requirements of the Fourth Amendment, a writ of seizure should specify
with particularity the premises to be searched and the articles to be seized. Id.
The scope of the search must thus be limited by "the object of the search and the
places in which there has been a showing that the object is likely to be found"
Id. (citing <I>Maryland v. Garrison,</I> 480 U.S. 79, 84 (1987)). The order should
"enable the executing officer to ascertain and identify with reasonable certainty
those items that the [court] has authorized him to seize." <I>Time Warner
Entertainment Co. v. Does,</I> 876 F. Supp. 407, 413 (E.D.N.Y. 1994) (citing <I>United
States v. George,</I> 975 F.2d 72, 75 (2d Cir. 1992)). <P>

The purpose of preliminary injunctive relief is to maintain the status quo.
Impoundment is also meant to allow for a possible remedy of destruction of the
infringing articles. 3 Nimmer Section 14.07, at 14-119. The the extend that the
order allowed the seizure of "articles and things that appear to be works of L.
Ron Hubbard protected by copyrights," it went beyond the purpose of the Copyright
Act to prevent the unauthorized "reproduction" of protected works; the mere
possession of copyrighted works does not offend the Copyright Act. This language
is also somewhat vague, as it describes a category of works which cannot be
identified by any easy to apply criteria. The criteria used to determine what
items are to be seized must not be overly subjective, such that the decision of
what to seize rests solely in the hands of plaintiffs' expert rather than the
U.S. Marshal. Paramount, 821 F.Supp. at 91. (finding application constitutionally
deficient where only some of distinguishing markings for identifying unauthorized
videocassettes were listed in plaintiffs' application); Time Warner, 876 F.Supp.
at 413 (finding plaintiffs' application insufficient where murky photocopies of
copyrighted designs and trademarks provided insufficient guidance to marshal).
Here, there were no specific criteria given by which a marshal could identify
which works were written by Hubbard and were protected by copyrights. In effect,
this language gave plaintiffs' experts the authority to search through Erlich's
possessions and computer files using their discretion in deciding what to seize,
unchecked by any law enforcement officials. <P>

Plaintiffs contend, however, that its use of a computer expert to enable the
search of materials on Erlich's computers and an expert in the works of
Scientology to enable the identification of plaintiffs' works was justified,
citing a criminal case, <I>State v. Wade,</I> 544 So.2d 1028, 1030-31 (Fla. Dist. Ct.
App. 1989). In Wade, the Florida appellate court upheld a search for stolen
computer equipment where law enforcement officers were aided by computer
consultants employed by the victim computer manufacturer. Id. The Wade court
reasoned that searches in areas beyond law enforcement officers' expertise
necessitate the use of experts and noticed that the employees of the victim are
perhaps the best experts to identify the allegedly stolen equipment. Id. at `030
(citing 2 Wayne R. LaFave, Search & Seizure Section 4.11(b), at 343 (1987)
(commenting that practice of using victims to help advise in search in
unobjectionable in exceptional situations such as where only the victim can
adequately identify what items are stolen)).[FN38] The court finds that, in the
context of identification of allegedly infringing copies of literary works, use
of an expert to aid the marshal my be justified. In this case, the number of
potentially infringed works was too great to permit the plaintiffs to bring
originals to be used in verifying the source of copies. Accordingly, plaintiffs
were justified in using an expert to identify the allegedly infringing works.
Accordingly, plaintiffs were justified to aid in finding the materials.[FN39] See
Wade, 544 S.2d at 1030; cf Oakley Reply Decl., Ex. C, at 200 (Erlich Depo.)
(indicating that police officers at seizure were not computer literate). <P>

However, such works should have been adequately identified before the seizure to
"ensure[] that the search [would] be carefully tailored to its justifications and
[would] take on the character of the wide-ranging exploratory searches the
Framers intended to prohibit." Paramount, 821 F.Supp. at 90 (quoting Garrison,
480 U.S. at 84). The inclusion of language allowing the seizure of "any articles
and things appearing to be works of L. Ron Hubbard protected by copyrights"
arguably made the writ overbroad, giving RTC officials too much discretion in
identifying Hubbard works and in determining which works were subject to
copyright protection and which copies were unauthorized. In effect, plaintiffs'
agents were given the authority to seize even lawfully owned copies of Hubbard's
works for which there was no evidence of any infringing use, which exceeds the
authority of 17 U.S.C. Section 503(a). <P>

<B>D. Conclusion</B><P>

Because plaintiffs' ex parte application for a writ of seizure did not meet the
requirements of Rule 65(b), the court vacates the writ. Plaintiffs must return to
Erlich all articles seized within ten (10) days of this order.[FN40] <P>

<H3>VI. Plaintiffs' Request For Sanctions Against Carla Oakley </H3>

The court is disturbed by the parties' seemingly endless applications to the
court, consolidated oppositions, sur-replies, objections to sur-replies, and
other such inappropriate pleadings. In their objections to Erlich's "Consolidated
Opposition to Plaintiffs' Ex Parte Applications," plaintiffs request that
Erlich's counsel, Ms. Carla Oakley, be sanctioned under Rule 11 of the Federal
Rules of Civil Procedure and 28 U.S.C. Section 1927 for filing "frivolous"
pleading which multiply the proceedings "unreasonable and vexatiously." <P>

To the extent that the Consolidated Opposition contains new arguments, the court
finds that these arguments are necessary to address plaintiffs' multiple ex parte
applications alleging three different instances of contempt. Erlich's sur-reply
to the motion to expand the TRO was arguably justified by plaintiffs' mention of
a new instance of alleged contempt for the first time in their Reply.[FN41] The
court therefore denies plaintiff's' requests for sanctions. Plaintiffs' request
that the court strike the arguments in the Consolidated Opposition because they
are merely repetitive arguments that were "cut and past[ed]" from previous briefs
is unnecessary to the extent that the briefs add noting new. However, the court
orders that the parties not file any further post-Reply briefing, which only
wastes the court's and parties' resources, without first seeking leave of the
court. See Civil L.R. 7-3(e). The court further rejects plaintiffs' claim that
Erlich's "Consolidated Opposition" reveals alleged trade secrets from plaintiffs'
Advanced Technology works, and should have been filed under seal. Nothing in the
"Consolidated Opposition" reveals information not already publicized in the
popular press. See supra part IV.C. <P>

<H3>VII. Order</H3>

For the reasons set forth above, the court orders as follows: <P>
<UL>
1. Defendant Dennis Erlich and his agents, servants, and employees, all personal
acting or purporting to act under his authority, direction or control, and all
persons acting in concert or in participation with any of them who receive notice
of this Order, shall be and are restrained and enjoined pending further court
order: <P><UL>

a. From all unauthorized reproduction, transmission, and publication of any of
the works of L. Ron Hubbard that are protected under the Copyright Act of 1976,
as codified in its amended form at 17 U.S.C. Section 101 et seq. Such works are
found, for the purposes of this order only, to be those works identified in
Exhibits A and B to the complaint, except for item 4 of Exhibit A. A copy of said
exhibits are attached hereto with item 4 of Exhibit A redacted. <P>

i. Unauthorized reproduction, transmission, or publication includes placement of
a copyrighted work into a computer's hard drive or other storage device;
"browsing" the text of a copyrighted work resident on another computer through
on-screen examination; scanning a copyrighted work into a digital file;
"uploading" a digital file containing a copyrighted work from the computer to a
bulletin board system or other server; "downloading" a digital file containing a
copyrighted work from a bulletin board system or other server to the computer;
and "quoting" a copyrighted work that is cited in an on-line message in sending,
responding to or forwarding that message. <P>

ii. Nothing in this section of the order shall be construed to prohibit fair use
of such works, as set forth in 17 U.S.C. Section 107 and interpreted by
applicable case law. Fair use of the copyright material for the purposes of this
order includes use of the copyrighted work for the purpose of criticism, news
reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research but does not include: (1) use of
the material for a commercial purpose where the user stand to profit form
exploitation of the copyrighted material without paying the customary price or
giving the usual consideration or sue that would have a significant effect on the
potential market value of the copyrighted work; (2) use which fulfills the demand
for the original work; (3) use of the heart of the work -- no more of a work may
be taken than is necessary to make any accompanying comment understandable. With
respect to unpublished materials, the amount of copied material must comprise
only a very small percentage of the copyrighted works both from a quantitative
and a qualitative standpoint. <P>

iii. The prior postings by defendant Erlich that form the basis of this order do
not qualify as fair use primarily because of the quantity of the material posted
and the very limited transformative use made of those materials. Identical or
similar postings are therefore enjoined. <P>

b. From destroying, altering, concealing or removing from the district in which
defendant Erlich resides, any reproduction, copy, facsimile, excerpt, or
derivative of any work of L. Ron Hubbard that is described in Exhibit A or B
including all such works returned pursuant to this order. Defendant Erlich or his
counsel shall safely retain possession of any such items. <P>

c. A condition of this preliminary injunction is that a $25,000 bond shall be
posted (or continued in place) pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(c).<P>
</ul>

2. Plaintiffs' application to expand the TRO is denied without prejudice. <P>

3. Plaintiffs' motion for a finding of contempt against defendant Erlich is
denied. <P>

4. Plaintiffs are ordered to return within ten (10) days of the date of this
order to defendant Erlich through his counsel all items seized pursuant to the
writ of seizure issued February 10, 1995. <P>

5. Plaintiffs' request for sanctions against defendant Erlich's counsel, Ms.
Carla Oakley, is denied. <P>
</ul>

FOOTNOTES</H3><font size=-1>

(1) The Internet is a world-wide network of networks, made up of approximately 7
million computers interconnected through 60,000 networks, all sharing a common
communications technology. Anthony M. Ruthkowski, Federal News Service, July 27,
1995. It is decentralized in that there is no central hub through which
information must be routed and no central governing body. United States v. Baker,
1995 WL 388472, at *13 n.1 (E.D. Mich. 1995). Started as a project by the
Department of Defense, the Internet has expanded to include universities,
government agencies, and commercial enterprises. There are currently over 25
million users worldwide accessing the Internet, and the numbers are doubling
every year. MTV Networks v. Curry, 867 F.Supp. 202, 203 n.1 (S.D.N.Y. 1994).
Users of the Internet can access such services as e-mail, Usenet newsgroups, file
exchanges, and the "World Wide Web," a distributed hypertext information service,
accessed using a "Web browser." Guardian, Sept. 1, 1994, at T8. <P>


(2) Plaintiffs additionally sued defendants Tom Klemesrud ("Klemesrud"), who
operates the bulletin board service ("BBS") used by Erlich, and Netcom On-Line
Communication Services, Inc. ("Netcom"), who provides that BBS with access to the
Internet. <P>


(3) The court will address plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction
against Klemesrud and Netcom. Klemesrud's motion for judgment on the pleadings,
and Netcom's motion for summary judgment in a separate order. <P>


(4) Plaintiffs describe the works of the "Scientology Religion" as applied
religious philosophy and spiritual healing technology." First Am. Comp. ("FAC")
9. The Ninth Circuit described the Church's teachings as follows: <P>

The Church . . . teaches that a person's behavior and well-being are improved by
removing "engrams" from the unconscious mind. Engrams are impressions recorded by
the unconscious mind in times of trauma in this life or in previous lifes.
Engrams return in moments of similar stress to the detriment of the person's
behavior. Removing engrams from the unconscious permits the person's analytical
mind to function unhindered. <P>

Engrams are located and purged through "auditing." Auditing uses the
"technology" and "advanced technology" of the Church. . . . The adherent must
proceed through a series of increasingly sophisticated technologies of closely
structured questions and answers to reach "a higher spiritual existence." <P>

The Church asserts that the unsupervised, premature exposure of an adherent to
these materials will produce a spiritually harmful effect. <P>

Religious Technology Center v. Wollersheim, 796 F.2d 1076, 1077 (9th Cir. 1986),
cert. denied, 479 U.S. 1103 (1987). <P>


(5) Usenet news, which is one of the most popular features of the Internet,
allows users of systems "subscribing" to the groups to participate by reading and
"posting" messages on a particular topic, such as intellectual property rights
("misc. int-property") or table tennis ("rec.sport.table-tennis"). "Posting," as
a noun, refers to an article in a newsgroup and, as a verb, refers to the act of
sending an article one has written for distribution to the newsgroup's
subscribers. When a message is posted to a group, it is distributed to the
computers of all those systems that subscribe to that group so that the users of
that system can access the message. There are currently thousands of different
newsgroups, with about 50,000 new articles posted each day. John R. Levine &
Carol Baroudi, The Internet for Dummies 131 (2d ed. 1994). <P>


(6) Erlich gained access to the Internet by using a personal computer and a
modem in his home to connect to defendant Klemesrud's BBS, to which Erlich was
one of 512 subscribers paying an annual fee. Klemesrud Decl. 13. Klemesrud's BBS,
in turn, was connected to the Internet through an arrangement with defendant
Netcom under which Klemesrud leased access to the Internet at a fixed rate. <P>


(7) These works are part of the "course" materials used in the upper-levels of
Scientology training, and are only available to those Scientologists who have
successfully completed all of the lower courses. <P>


(8) The parties treated the motion to dissolve the TRO as superseding the
earlier application for a preliminary injunction. The court finds no differences
in the legal standards for dissolving a TRO and for granting a preliminary
injunction, except for the potentially different relevant timeframes. Here, both
motions concern whether further injunctive relief prior to trial is appropriate.
Accordingly, the motions will be discussed together. <P>


(9) Although the court concludes in its discussion of the trade secrets claims,
infra part II.C.3, that most of the Exhibit B works may no longer contain trade
secrets (assuming they ever did), this does not mean that, for the purposes of
copyright protection, they are not unpublished. "Publication," as defined in 17
U.S.C. section 101 requires that the cover consent to selling, leasing, loaning,
giving away, or otherwise making available to the general public, the original or
copies of the work. 1 Nimmer section 4.04, at 4-17 to -19 & n.8. There is no
evidence of any consensual release of any of these works to the public. <P>


(10) The court is unpersuaded by the various alleged technical deficiencies,
such as title discrepancies, in the copyright registrations. Errors, such as
incorrectly naming the author, do not make the copyright invalid absent some
evidence that the defendant was misled. 2 Nimmer section 7.20, at 7-201 to -207. <P>


(11) The court will address the issue of direct infringement more fully in its
order on the motions concerning defendants Netcom and Klemesrud. <P>


(12) Even though fair use is an affirmative defense, Harper & Row, Publishers,
Inc. v. Nation Enterprises, 471 U.S. 539, 561 (1985), the court notes that
plaintiffs, as the parties moving for a preliminary injunction, have the burden
of proving a likelihood of success on their infringement claim, including the
fair use defense. See 2 William Schwarzer et al., California Practice Guide:
Federal Civil Procedure Before Trial 13:47 (1994) (citing Original Appalachian
Artworks v. Topps Chewing Gum, 642 F.Supp. 1031, 1034 (N.D. Ga. 1986)). However,
in determining whether plaintiffs have met their burden, the court recognizes
that fair use is an affirmative defense on which defendants will have the burden
of proof at trial. <P>


(13) Erlich response that the documents that he posted "speak for themselves,"
and thus little further commentary was necessary. The court will address this
dispute under the third statutory factor. <P>


(14) Plaintiffs cite Sega Enterprises Ltd. v. Maphia, 857 F.Supp. 679 (N.D. Cal.
1994) for the proposition that there can be no fair use defense where the
defendant did not use an authorized copy to make his copies. In Sega, the
defendant, who had allegedly copied Sega videogame cartridges onto an electronic
BBS where others could copy them, id. at 683, admitted that he did not own any
copies of Sega's game cartridges, id. at 687. Sega relies on language from Atari
Games Corp. v. Nintendo of America Inc., 975 F.2d 832, 843 (Fed. Cir. 1992)
stating that "[t]o invoke the fair use exception, an individual must possess an
authorized copy of a literary work." Atari, in turn, relies on Harper & Row's
discussion of the first statutory factor. In Harper & Row, 471 U.S. at 563, the
Supreme Court cited the trial court's finding that the defendant "knowingly"
exploited a purloined manuscript" as weighing against a finding of fair use on
the first factor. Nothing in Harper & Row indicates that the defendants' bad
faith was itself conclusive of the fair use question, or even of the first
factor. After Campbell, it is clear that a finding of bad faith, or a finding on
any one of the four factors, cannot be considered dispositive. Campbell, 114 S.
Ct. at 1170-71, 1174 & n.18. Campbell cited Harper & Row's good faith discussion
without comment, but noted that the defendant's use of the plaintiff's work,
despite the plaintiff's explicit denial of permission, would not, in any case,
constitute bad faith. Id. at 1174 n.18. Campbell, the Supreme Court's most recent
pronouncement on fair use, thus hardly endorses the good faith requirement. See 3
Nimmer section 13.05[B][3], at 13-205 n.298. Accordingly, the court will treat
bad faith as merely one aspect of the first factor. <P>


(15) The court is unpersuaded by plaintiffs' argument that an intermediate copy
made for the purposes of posting or uploading work makes the subsequent copy
unauthorized such that fair use is unavailable. Sega and Atari merely suggest
that fair use is unavailable where the defendant does not possess any authorized
copy; not that the challenged copying cannot be made from a secondary copy. While
the extra copying may constitute infringement (for which there may or may not be
a separate fair use defense), it should not affect the availability of the fair
use defense as to the critical or parodic use. <P>


(16) Somewhat inconsistently, Erlich argues on the trade secret claim that many
of the Exhibit B works are "more prosaic than formulaic." Reply at 13. <P>


(17) Erlich also argues that, even if he did copy most or all of many of the
works, he copied no more than was reasonable for his purposes. Erlich cites
Belmore v. City Pages, Inc., 880 F. Supp. 673, 678-89 (D. Minn. 1995), in which
the court found fair use where the defendant copies verbatim an entire short
article from a police newspaper for the purpose of criticism with added
commentary constituting only about one fourth of the defendant's article. The
court found reasonable the alleged infringer's explanation that he copied the
original in its entirety because the original "took the form of a parable and was
relatively short" and because he "decided that the repulsive message it appeared
to convey could not be adequately communicated except by printing the story as a
whole." Id. at 679. Erlich fails to mention that the Belmore court concluded that
the third factor weighed in favor of the plaintiff; only a strong showing by the
defendant on the first and fourth factor overcame the fact that the defendant had
copied the entire work. Moreover, unlike the defendant in Belmore, Erlich never
adequately explains why it was essential for him to copy verbatim the amount of
the works that he copied, merely asserting in a conclusory fashion that it was
"reasonable in relation to the purpose of the copying." Further, Erlich's added
criticism was far less substantial than the thirty-four lines of added commentary
in Belmore. The court is unconvinced that Erlich's wholesale copying of Hubbard's
works with little or no commentary was necessary for his critical purposes. <P>


(18) To the extent that courts look at how much of the allegedly infringing work
is made up of copied material, see Harper & Row, 471 U.S. at 565-66, this factor
also weighs heavily against Erlich. Most of Erlich's postings constitute verbatim
quotes from Hubbard's works, with occasional commentary such as "The perfect
reference for any occasion," "I believe a discussion of this policy is in order."
"Any questions?" and "Someone requested this, I assume, to discuss." Standing
alone, these remarks are hardly criticism or commentary. <P>

However, Erlich argues that the critical nature of Erlich's postings must be
viewed in light of the extended nature of "threads" on newsgroups. A thread is an
article on a particular topic, together with all the follow-up articles, and the
follow-ups to the follow-ups. Levine & Baroudi, supra note 5, at 399. While an
entire thread might be considered one composite work authored by all those adding
to the thread, there is no evidence in the record that any of Erlich's postings
were followed up with further comments or criticism on the works that are
excerpted. Erlich argues that it is common practice on the Internet to repeat
large portions of a previous posting verbatim, which is necessary to add context
for those who are late in joining a discussion. While this would perhaps justify
the copying of works that were previously posted by their authors on the basis of
an implied license or fair use agreement, see Maureen A. O'Rourke, "The Future of
Copyright and Contract Law in a Networked World," Federal Bar News & Journal
(August 1994), these defenses would not apply where the first posting made an
unauthorized copy of a copyrighted work. The court accepts, however, the
possibility that a particular quotation of a copyrighted work in the context of a
long thread that involves significant criticism or commentary could be fair use. <P>


(19) To the extent that Erlich's postings suppress demand for the original works
by "persuad[ing] [potential buyers] that Hubbard was a charlatan" or that the
Church is a fraud, as clearly Erlich intends, such a "devastating critique" is
not "within the scope of copyright protection." New Era, 904 F.2d at 160
(citation omitted); Campbell, 114 S.Ct. at 1178 (citing Fisher, 794 F.2d at 438).<P>

<P>

(20) The court notes the difficulty of coming to this conclusion based on the
lack of guidance in how to weigh the various factors. See Rubin v. Brooks/Cole
Publishing Co., 836 F. Supp. 909, 922 (D. Mass. 1993) (citing 3 Nimmer section
13.05[A][5], at 13-199). <P>


(21) The new Restatement provides a similar definition of a trade secret: <P>

A trade secret is any information that can be used in the operation of a
business or other enterprise and that is sufficiently valuable and secret to
afford an actual or potential economic advantage over others. <P>

Restatement (Third) of Unfair Competition ("Restatement") section 39, at 425
(1995). Although California has adopted the UTSA, courts also look to the
Restatement to help interpret the UTSA. See Restatement section 39, cmt. b. at
427; cf. 1 Milgrim section 1.01[1], at 1-3 (noting that UTSA jurisdictions
frequently rely on the Restatement's definition of a trade secret). <P>


(22) In granting summary judgment for the Church on its claim that a splinter
group had misappropriated the Advanced Technology works, the Southern District of
California did not address this preliminary question of whether religious
scriptures should be unprotectable as trade secrets because of their
noncommercial, religious nature. Vien, 827 F. Supp. 629. Instead, the court found
that the works were trade secrets because the Church had used reasonable steps to
keep the works secret and because they had independent economic value both to
plaintiffs, who use the proceeds from the sale of these materials to support the
operation of the Church, and to the defendant, who was a competitor of the Church
who also charged for Scientology-like courses. Id. at 633-34. <P>


(23) Neither the Church's status as a religion nor its not-for-profit status are
at issue in the current dispute. <P>


(24) In a declaration that was prepared in Church of Scientology Int'l v.
Fishman, No. 91-6426 HLH (Tx), Erlich cites to books and articles by former
Scientologists on the lack of security measures accompanying the study of the
Advanced Technology materials. Erlich's Request for Judicial Notice, "Berger
Decl.," Exs. 10, 22. This is clearly hearsay if offered to show the truth of the
statements that the security measures were inadequate. The court nonetheless
notes that the documents confirm that works were taken home in locked bags. See
id., Ex. 10, at 30. <P>


(25) The notion that the Church's trade secrets are disclosed to thousands of
parishioners makes this a rather unusual trade secrets case. However, because
parishioners are required to maintain the secrecy of the materials, McShane May
31, 1995 Decl. 3, the court sees no reason why the mere fact that many people
have seen the information should negate the information's trade secret status.
See SmokEnders, 184 U.S.P.Q. at 318 (citing Chicago Board of Trade v. Christie G
& S Co., 198 U.S. 236 (1905)) ("A trade secret owner does not lose his right by
communicating the results to persons; even if many, in confidential relations to
itself, under a contract not to make public.") While it is logically more likely
that a secret will leak out when more people are entrusted with it, absent
evidence of leakage the court finds that giving out the secrets to a large number
of people, though no more than necessary, is not itself an unreasonable security
step. <P>


(26) Despite plaintiffs' argument to the contrary, these articles, several of
which have been separately authenticated by Erlich's counsel, are not hearsay as
they are being offered not for their truth but for the fact that they allegedly
disclose to the public RTC's trade secrets. <P>


(27) Erlich further cites as relevant authority the Ninth Circuit's observations
in its unpublished opinion regarding the confidentiality of the Advanced
Technology works. See Fishman, 1994 U.S. App. LEXIS 23848 (9th Cir. Aug. 30,
1994). This court notes that the Ninth Circuit's Memorandum opinion is not to be
cited, except where relevant under the doctrines of law of the case, res
judicata, and collateral estoppel. Ninth Cir. Rule 36-3. It appears that none of
the exceptions applies here. Further, the Ninth Circuit made no findings as to
the secrecy of the Advanced Technology works, but rather made "observations" that
the district court might "wish to take into consideration" on remand. Id. at *8. <P>


(28) There is no merit to Elrich's claim that the registration of the Advanced
Technology works with the Copyright Office forfeited their trade secret status,
as it appears that these works were registered in masked form. McShane May 31,
1995 Decl., Ex. A. There is likewise no merit to Erlich's argument that the Class
VIII Assists lecture tape is not properly licensed to RTC and has not been kept
confidential. See McShane Depo. at 134, 140; Byrne Decl. 7-14. <P>


(29) See Trotter Hardy, "The Proper Legal Regime for 'Cyberspace'," 55 U. Pitt.
L. Rev. 993, 1055 n.45 (Summer 1994) (noting that "anonymous remailer" exists in
Finland to allow anonymous or pseudonymous use of the Internet). <P>


(30) See, e.g., McShane May 31, 1995 Decl. 10. In another case involving some of
the same Advanced Technology works, the court found misappropriation of trade
secrets where the works were stolen from a Church in Denmark and the defendant's
copies must have been connected to the stolen documents, thereby defeating the
defendant's argument that he had acquire the information through proper means.
Religious Technology Center v. Wollersheim, 228 U.S.P.Q. 534, 536-37 (C.D. Cal.
1985), rev'd on other grounds, 796 F.2d 1076 (9th Cir. 1986). The present case is
distinguishable because there was no argument in Wollersheim that the defendants
had received the Church materials in a manner that would destroy their secrecy,
i.e., over the Internet or by some other type of publication. <P>


(31) Although Erlich does not specifically address the element of
misappropriation, the court notes that RTC has shown that Erlich's disclosures
over the Internet of RTC's Exhibit B works, like that of the defendant in Vien,
may constitute misappropriation. The fact that Erlich's postings were not of the
"entire secret," and included only portions of courses, does not mean that
Erlich's disclosures are not misappropriations. While previous partial
disclosures arguably made public only those parts disclosed, Erlich's partial
disclosures of non-public portions of the secrets may themselves be actionable
because they constitute "disclosure . to know that his . . . knowledge of the
trade secret was . . . . [either] [d]erived from or through a person who had
utilized improper means to acquire it [or] [a]cquired under circumstances giving
rise to a duty to maintain its secrecy or limit its use." UTSA section 3426.1(b).<P>


Erlich argues that this case is distinguishable from Vien because in Vien the
defendant was "a competitor of plaintiffs' [sic], who used the Advanced
Technology in the delivery of the courses for which she [was] paid" and for which
she charged as much as $3000. Vien, 827 F. Supp. at 633-34 (emphasis added).
Unlike the defendant in Vien, Erlich neither offers Scientology-like services nor
charges anyone for the use of the materials. Additionally, Erlich seems to argue
that his activities are distinguishable from those of the defendants in Vien and
Wollersheim because he never profited from his use of the trade secrets and thus
has not misappropriated the works. However, nothing in the UTSA requires that the
defendant gain any advantage from the disclosure; it is sufficient to show "use"
by disclosure of a trade secret with actual or constructive knowledge that the
secret was acquired under circumstances giving rise to a duty to maintain its
secrecy. UTSA section 3426.1(2); Ashton-Tate Corp. v. Ross, 916 F.2d 516, 523-24
(9th Cir. 1990). Thus, Erlich's admitted posting of the information, regardless
of any alleged fair use defense or lack of financial motive may constitute
misappropriation of the Church's trade secrets. <P>


(32) Although there is no evidence that Erlich "copied" item 9 of Exhibits A and
B, the court is satisfied that plaintiffs have shown the document to be
protectable and of the same nature as other Exhibit A and B documents. Therefore,
it is reasonable to include those documents in the injunction. <P>


(33) This conclusion, however, is without prejudice to plaintiffs' filing a
request for leave to file a supplemental complaint that contains further
allegations of infringement of copyright or to request that the preliminary
injunction be expanded to cover works which were seized from Erlich and are now
being returned. The application would need to show that plaintiffs hold valid
copyright interests in the documents. <P>


(34) Exhibits A and B, and not Exhibits A-1 and B-1 to the FAC, are the subject
of the TRO and the Amended TRO. <P>


(35) The writ of seizure provides in relevant part: <P>

TO THE UNITED STATES MARSHAL OR OTHER LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS: <P>

Pursuant to the Order [of February 10, 1995 to Clerk To Issue Writ for Seizure
of Articles Infringing Statutory Copyright], which commands me to issue this Writ
of Seizure. <P>

YOU ARE DIRECTED to seize, using such force as may be reasonably necessary in
the premises, the following articles and things which you may then or otherwise
thereafter find on the person, in the possession, or under the control of
defendant Dennis Erlich ("Erlich") and/or defendant's agents and persons acting
in concert with defendant, at [defendant's home address], or elsewhere where
defendant Erlich or any such agents and persons may be found in the territory in
which you may serve this Writ, including any building, annex or other structure
adjacent to or on the premises identified above, to wit: any and all copies,
reproductions, or embodiments of all or any part of the literary works identified
on Exhibits A and B to the Complaint (copies of Exhibits A and B are attached
hereto), including any 3-1/2" or 5-1/4" computer disks and printed materials; all
masters and tapes; any articles and things that appear to be works of L. Ron
Hubbard protected by copyrights; but excluding all personal computers (including
all ancillary equipment and disk drives, found at or within the above-described
locations[)]. <P>

February 10, 1995 Writ of Seizure (emphasis added). <P>


(36) Although Erlich's use of plaintiffs' materials for what is arguably
criticism can hardly be analogized to the case of a professional counterfeiter,
other considerations make this a good case for ex parte relief. Computer files
can be easily uploaded and copied from one location to another and are easy to
transport, conceal, or delete. The ability of users to post large amounts of
protected works nearly instantaneously over the Internet makes it a rather
dangerous haven for copyright infringers. <P>


(37) Plaintiffs allege that Erlich has shown his propensity to conceal evidence
and lie by his concealment of the computer containing the infringing materials in
a closet in a locked room during the February 13, 1995 seizure. This evidence,
which Erlich disputes, is irrelevant to the question of what evidence presented
to the court prior to the issuance of the ex parte seizure order showed that the
court should dispense with the usual notice requirement. See First Technology, 11
F.3d at 651-52. <P>


(38) The cases cited by plaintiffs for the proposition that a very broad seizure
is justified are not on point. The extremely broad searches and seizures in those
 cases were justified because of the pervasiveness of the crime or fraud. <P>


(39) The court is disturbed by the possibility that plaintiffs copied the
entirety of Erlich's hard drive onto a tape for examination at their leisure. If
Erlich did not, as he claims, consent to this part of the seizure, this would
constitute a significant intrusion into Erlich's private affairs that was not
justified by the need to identify infringing copies. But see McShane February 21,
1995 Decl. Paragraph 7 (stating that Erlich consented to plaintiffs' reviewing
his floppy disks off the premises if the non-infringing disks were returned). The
court is also disturbed by allegations that plaintiffs deleted materials from
Erlich's hard drive if such materials were not also saved on floppies or tape
back-up for possible later restoration. <P>


(40) Erlich's additional arguments are mooted by the court's conclusion. The
court has already disposed of Erlich's argument that plaintiffs' failure to prove
likelihood of success on the merits and irreparable harm is an independent ground
for vacating the writ of seizure. Because the court has determined that the writ
of seizure should be vacated, there is no need to consider Erlich's request to
increase the amount of the bond. Erlich's request for the return of certain
improperly seized articles is also moot as all materials must be returned. <P>


(41) The court notes that plaintiffs are not alone in placing new arguments in
their Reply--Erlich's Reply in support of his motion to dissolve the TRO
contained several new arguments. The proper response to such new arguments,
however, would be to object to the new arguments, not to endlessly continue the
arguments back and forth. <P></font>>

The NFL has brought suit against Al Davis's  Raiders for past, ongoing, and future

violations of the NFL's constitution. The suit alleges that the Raider's recent move to

Oakland was in violation of League rules, and that the Raiders'  stated intention to

exclude revenues committed to their new  landlords in Oakland from the League's revenue

sharing pool is  also a breach of contract.

<P>

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT<P>



CENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA

<P>

AUG 31, 1995</B>

<P>



COMPLAINT FOR<br>

DECLARATORY AND<br>

INJUNCTIVE RELIEF<P>

</ul>

1. This action addresses two disputes between defendant Los Angeles Ralders (the "Club"

or the "Raiders") Plaintiff National Football League (the "League" or "NFL") that arise

out of and/or relate to the NFL Constitution and Bylaws and resolutions, policies, and

proceduras romuigatad thereunder.  The subject matters of the disputes -- (1)

determining the location of club playing sites and (2) allocating between the home club

and other member clubs of the League the "gross receipts" associated with regular season

games -- have been committed by contract to collective resolution pursuant to procedures

prescribed by the NFL Constitution and Bylaws.  The Raiders maintain that they have no

obligation to recognize or to comply with those collective determinations, in the former

case asserting that the procedures at issue violate the federal antitrust laws. 



<H3>THE PARTIES</H3>



2.   The National Football Leagua is a joint enter- prise composed of thirty (30) member

clubs, inciuding the Raiders, engaged in the production and marketing of profession- al

football entertainment.  The NFL is an unincorporate not- for-profit organization with

its principal offices located ln New York City, New York. 

<P>

3.   Defendant Los Angeles Raiders, Ltd. is a California limited partnership that very

recently moved its home territory from Los Angeles, California to Oakland, Cali~ornia.

The Raiders are, and since 1970 have been, a member club of the NFL, and they continue

to conduct business in the Los Angeles area with offices at 332 Center Street, El

Segundo, Calfornia. 



<H3>JURISDICTION AND VENUE</H3>



4.   This action is brought pursuant to 15 U.S.C. Section 1.  This Court has federal

question jurisdiction over Count I of this Complaint under 28 U.S.C.  1331 and  1337. 

The declaratory relief prayed for is authorized by 28 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2201 et seq. 

The Court has supplemental jurisdiction over Count II pursuant to 28 U.S.C.  &#167;

1367. 

<P>

5.   Venue is proper in this District because defen- dant resides and is licensed to do

business in this District. Plaintiff's claims also arise in this District.  28 U.S.C.

&#167;&#167; 1391(b) and (c). 



<H3>THE NFL'S JOINT BUSINESS ENTERPRISE</H3>



6.   The NFL is composed of 30 teams that jointly produce and market a sports

entertainment product.  In producing and marketing their joint product, the member clubs

operate as co-producers and co-sellers in a form of joint or partnership enterprise. 

<P>

7.   Decisions about the locations at which member clubs operate and play their home

games are an essential element of the conduct of the NFL as a cooperative venture. for

purposes of fostering fan and media interest, and thereby increasing the attractiveness

of their joint entertainment product, the NFL's members have divided themselves into

conferences and divisions.  These subdivisions create additional separate "title" races.

Public interest is further fostered by various intercity rivalries.  Thus, divisional

placement and alignment are of concern to all League members, and a relocation by one

club withhout the consent of its co-venturers  jeopardizes the benefits that all clubs

receive from this carefully developed arrangement. 

<P>

8.   As further described below, Count I of this Complaint addresses the member clubs'

agreement, and the poli- cies and procedures promulgated thereunder, by which they

determine collectively the locations of their member clubs. The Raiders, who have moved

their home territory and home playing location to Oakland, have repeatedly asserted that

these agreements are invalid under the federal antitrust laws and have threatened to

bring an antitrust action for damages and/or injunctive relief based upon the League's

reliance on these rules, policies, and procedures. 

<P>

9.   Another crucial aspect of the NFL joint venture is a set of revenue sharing

arrangements that cause the NFL to be the most economically integrated league in all of

professional sports.  Over 90 percent of club revenues are derived  from sources shared

with every othar club. For example, the television rights of all NFL teams are jointly

sold by the League under terms requiring the broadcasters to televise each regular

season game.  The resulting television revenues are divided equally among all clubs. 

The clubs also share equally post-season revenues, as well as revenues from licensing

and filming operations. 

<P>

10.  Gate receipts from each of the games jointly presented by the League's taams are

also shared.  In tha regular season, after limited deductions relating to operatinq

costs, the home team retains 60% of the revenues; the balance is directly  shared with

the visiting team and/or contributed to a revenue sharing pool.  Sharing of gate

receipts provides balanced rewards and incentives for both home and visiting teams in

the joint presentation of individual games and of the League season.  In this way, each

club benefits from other clubs having full stadiums and generating large gate receipts

As further explained below, Count II of this Complaint addresses the member clubs'

agreement collectively to determine the allocation of such receipts and the Raiders'

failure to comply with that agreement. 

<P>

11.  These sharing measures have the effect of more evenly distributing revenues among

better situated clubs operating in larger markets and less well-off clubs operating in

smaller markets, and are essential components of the structure that permits the NFL to

operate with 30 teams in a varietv of disparate economic conditions throughout the

United States. Since joining tha NFL in 1970, the Raiders have not only acknowledged,

abided by, and at citated in these revenue sharing procedures, but that Club also has

greatly benefitted from such procedures 

<P>

12.  These sharing measures are, in turn, the foundation for other fundamental League

agreements to which all member clubs are parties and from which all member clubs,

including the Raiders, derive benefits.  For example, in 1993, the NFL entered into a

collective bargaining agreement thac requires each club to pay its player-employees a

guaranteed Minimum Team Salary.  That obligation was premised upon continued adherence

to the basic principles of revenue sharing described above. 

<P>

13.  Because of these relationships, each NFL member club has a direct economic interest

in the successful business operation of each of the other member clubs in the League.

Rather than acting as traditional horizontal competitors, the members clubs of the NFL

are cooperative partners in a joint business venture.  No NFL club has an interest in

forcing another team out of business, or in seeing it seriously weak- ened financially. 

While the clubs are vigorous competitors on the playing field, they act as partners in

conducting their business operatlons. 



<H3>THE MEMBER CLUBS' CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS TO ADHERE TO LEAGUE RULES, RESOLUTIONS AND

POLICIES</H3> 



14.  All of the NFL member clubs "subscribe to agree to be bound by the Constitution,

bylaws, rules and Regu- lations of the League and any amendments or modifications

thereof."  NFL Constitution and Bylaws, Section 3.3(A)(6) Attached as Exhibit A.  This

provision specifically, and the Constitution and bylaws generally, impose a contractual

relationship among the member clubs of the NFL, including the Raiders. Accordingly, the

right of each NFL member club to regulate its own affairs is expressly subject to its

contractual obligations under the NFL Constitution and Bylaws and related NFL policies. 

<P>

15. Under the NFL Constitution and Bylaws, the basic business decisions of  the NFL  are

made  primarily by the NFL Executive Committee,  which is composed of one representative

from each member club.  The overwhelming majority of NFL busi- ness decisions, including

decisions as to where  each member club will  play its  home games, require the

agreement of three- fourths -- or 23 -- of the NFL member clubs. 

<P>

16.  Each member club of tne League, including the Raiders, has "agree[d] to be bound by

the following obligations of membership in the League: 

<P><UL>

(b)  They, and each of them, shall be bound by and will observe all decisions, rulings

and action of the Executive Committee or the member clubs of the League in every matter

within the jurisdiction of such Committee or such member clubs, as the case may be. 

<P>

(g)  They, and each of them, agree to be bound of the terms and provisions of the

Constitution and By-Laws of the League as now or hereafter in effect 

<P>

NFL Constitution and Bylaws, Section 3.11((b) and (g)</ul> 



<H3>COUNT I - FEDERAL ANTITRUST CLAIM</H3>



17. Plaintiff incorporates herein by reference Paragraphs 1-l5 of this Complalnt. 

<P>

18. Pursuant to Section  3.4  of the  NFL's Constitu- tion and Bylaws, the receipt of an

NFL franchise constitutes a commitment to the other members to operate in a designated

home location, which is  defined (in Section 4.1)  as  "the city in which such club is

located and for which it holds a franchise and plays its home games, and includes the

surrounding territory to the  extent of 75 miles in every direction from the exterior

corprorate limits of such  city." For the 1994 playing season, the Raiders designated

franchise location was the Los Angeles metropolitan area and its designated plaving site

was Los Angeles. 

<P>

19.  Section 4.2(c) of the Constitution and Bylaws prohibits any club from playing

regular season games "within the home territory of any other club unless a home club is

a participant."  Section 4.3 of the Constitution and Bylaws provides that a member club

may play its home games outside of its designated home territory, but only with the

approval of three-fourths of the member clubs of the League.  The provision states (with

emphasis added): 

<P>

The League shall have exclusive control of the exhibition of football games by member

clubs within the home territory of each member.  No member club shall have the riaht to

transfer its franchise or playing site to a different city either within or outside its

home territory without prior approval by the member clubs of the League. 

<P>

20.  Based on various compelling considerations, the NFL in 1980 declined to acquiesce 

to a franchise move by the Raiders from Oakland to Los Angeles.  The NFL and lts member

clubs were sued for violating the antitrust laws, and in Febru- ary 1984 a panel of the

Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, by a two-to-one vote, upheld the verdict of a Los

Angeles jury that Section 4.3, as applied to the Ralders' proposed move, was in

violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act.  <I>Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum Comm'n V.

National Fottball League,</I> 726 F.2d (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 990 (1984) 

("Raiders"). In reaching this determination, the Raiders decision depended heavily on

the particular circumstances surrounding the Raiders' move.  In future cases, the court

declared, League restrictions on team movement would withstand antitrust scruti- ny if

they were more narrowly tailored to serve the NFL's needs; if they were "shaped by

considerations of objective factors," such as population, economic projections,

facilities, regional balance, and fan loyalty; and if they provided some sort of

"procedural mechanism" to ensure consideration or all of the above factors, including an

opportunity for the team proposing to move to present its case. 

<P>

21.  In response to the concerns identified by the Ninch Circuit Court of Appeals in

Raiders, the NFL revised its procedures and prescribed objective criteria to govern

proposed franchise relocation decisions.  The NFL procedures and criteria now reflect

every one of the factors that the Raiders court indicated would enable the relocation

process to "withstand antitrust scrutiny" and conform precisely to the Ninth Circuit's

decislon. See  procedures for Proposed Franchise Relocations (attached as Exhibit 3). 

<P>

22.  In March 1994, without complying with or recognizing these rules and procedures in

any respect, the Raiders demanded that the NFL effectively transfer its home playing

site to Oakland, California, by scheduling the Raiders' 1994 season home games in

Oakland.  The NFL informed the Presldent of the General Partner of the Club, Al Davis,

that without a vote of the NFL member clubs approving a permanent or temporary change in

the Club's designated playing site to Oakland, the Raiders' home games for the 1995

season would have to be scheduled and played in the Los Angeles area.  The NFL

thereafter prepared a schedule that required the Raiders to play their 1994 home games

in Los Angeles rather tnan in Oakland. 

<P>

23.  Since the spring of 1994, Mr. Davis has repeatedly asserted, to League officials

and in League meetings, that the Raiders are entitled to relocate their home territory

based upon the club's own unilateral decision and that tha League's reliance upon its

franchise relocation rules as a justification for refusing to schedule the Raiders' 1994

home games in Oakland violated the antitrust laws and caused serius financial injury to

the Raiders. For example, at the League's Annual Meeting in March 1995, Mr. Davis

asserted that tha Raiders had been the victim in 1994 of an "NFL conspiracy" that

violated  the antitust laws. 

<P>

24. Based on information available to the NFL, unless the requested relief is granted,

the defendant will bring an antitrust damages action against the NFL for the League's

refusal to schedule the Club's 1994 home games ln Oakland, California.  In that event,

the Club will maintain that it was not required to submit a request or the proposed

change in its designated 1994 playing site because the Club is entitled to relocate its

home territory based upon its own unilataral decision and because the NFL's rules and

procedures pertaining to franchise relocation violate tha federal antitrust laws.  On

that basis, it will assert that the League's refusal to permit the move in 1994 caused

the club antitrust injury. 

<P>

25. Without a d~etermination by this Court of the legality of the League's rules and

procedures regarding franchise relocation, including specifically the requirement that

any request for a change in the designated playing sites be submitted to the League for

evaluation and approval, the NFL cannot enforce its agreements and procedures and cannoc

require defendant or other clubs to adhere to those commitments to which it has

subscribed without undue risk of protracted antitrust litigation and exposure to treble

damage liability. 

<P>

26.  By reason of the foregoing, this Court should exercise its jurisdiction to resolve

the present controvesy between the parties by ruling that the determination of fran-

chise location is committed by agreement to tha collective determination or the league

members, and that the NFL's rules and procedures rega~~rding relocation of franchises

are consistent with, and do not violate, the federal ant~itrust laws. 

<P>

<H4>COUNT II - CLAIM FOR BREACH OF CONTRACT</H4>



(AGREEMENT TO ABIDE BY COLLECTIVE DETERMINATION AND ALLOCATION OF GROSS RECEIPTS) 

<P>

27. Paragraphs 1-16 of this Complaint are hereby incorporated by reference. 

<P>

28. By this Count, plaintiffs seek to enforce the Raiders' contractual obligation to

comply with thelr membership covenants, arising from the NFL Constitution and Bylaws and

subsequent action of the Executive Committee, by which the Club committed to internal

League decisionmaking processes the definition of gross receipts and the principle of

allocating gross receipts between home and visiting clubs.  This Count involves tne same

parties as Count I and arises out of the same contract at issue in Count I, the NFL

Constitution and Bylaws. and related League rules and regulations. 

<P>

29.  Under Section 19.1(A) of the NFL's Constitution and Bylaws, each NFL franchise

participating in a regular season game as the home club is obligated to gua~rantee the

visiting club certain levels of revenue with the visiting club being entitled to receive

40% of the gross receipts after a number of specified deductions, none of which is

relevant here. The amount of this commitment is sometimes referred to as the "visiting

team share." 

<P>

30.  Section l9.1(A)(3) defines "Gross Receipts" to lnclude "all receiDts derived from

the sale of tickets, including taxes and special charges but excluding ticket handllng

chages."  The scope off this definition was confirmed and clarified by agreement among

the clubs in 1987 when, pursuant to the NFL Constitution and Bylaws, they adopted 1987

Resolution FC-7, whicn provides: 

<P>

<TT>Any income in excess of the stated ticket price from the sale, leasing, or licensing

of seats of admission to any game, including club seats or other premium pricing but

excluding box suites, is to be included in the gross receipts of the same as defined in

Article XIX, &#167; 9.1 of the Constltution and Bylaws.</TT> 

<P>

31. The scope of the definition of "gross receipts" was further clarified by agreement

among the clubs in May 1995 when, pursuant to the NFL Constitution and Bylaws, they

adopted 1995  Resolution G-5,  which precsibed that certain categories of gross receipts

would be shared by payments to a revenue sharing pool, to be divided annually among

"low-revenue" member clubs in accordance with procedures for determining eligibility and

payment amounts outlined in such resolution, rather than by payments directly to

visiting clubs.  That resolution, which the Raiders supported, required that the

following categories of gross receipts be paid to the revenue sharing pool: 

<P>

monies received, directly or indirectly, by any party, including any member (a) in

excess of the stated ticket price for any "club" or "premium" seat (other than seats in

luxury suites) attributable to the sale, lease, or licensing for use of such seat, or

(D) from any party's sale or issuance of any "permanent seat licenses" or other similar

instruments that give purchasers the right to acquire tickets to NFL 

<P>

32.  From time to time, in accordance with the Constitution and Bylaws and upon the

application of a member club, the NFL members have voted to exclude temporarily from a

club's sharing obligation particular categories of gross receipts, usually to enable

that club to fund construction of a new stadium or stadium improvements specifically

described to the League.  No such waiver has been sought by the Raiders or approved in

connection with the gross receipts at issue here. 

<P>

33.  The Raiders have informed the League of their lntention not to share gross receipts

from their regular season home games as required bv the NFL Constitution and Bylaws.

Raiders' refusal to share focuses on all, or a portion, of the following categories of

gross receipts: (1) Revenues received from season ticket purchasers to~ the right to

acquire season tickets to Raiders home games (the PSL revenues), including annual "loge

maintenance" charges levied against PSL purchas- ers,  (2) club seat premium revenues,

and (3) revenues, characterized as "location" fees, received from season ticket holders

who do not purchase PSLs.  The sharable portion of such sums should be paid, in total or

in substantial part, into the League's revenue sharing pool for later distribution;

accordingly the NFL, as agent for all clubs having a potential inter- est in a share of

such gross receipts, is entitled to enforce these obligations. 

<P>

34.  The Raiders have asserted that they are relieved of their obligation fully to share

these categories of gross receipcs because they have assigned to their stadium landlord

the right to receive some or all of the associated revenues. This is an issue that,

pursuant to their membership covenants and obligations, the Raiders have committed to

resolution by internal League governance procedures. 

<P>

35.  On information and belief, apparently recognizing that their failure fully to share

gross receipts would violate the club's contractual commitments, the Raiders recently

entered into an agreement that induced certain third parties financially to support the

Raiders in litigation of this issue and to indemnify the Raiders for some portion of any

court determined Raiders' liabllity to share gross receipts. 

<P>

36.  The Raiders' failure to observe their contractual commitments to abide by internal

League governance procedures and their declared intention to refuse fully to share gross

receipts in accordance with their contractual commitments both constitute a breach of

contract, an anticipatory breach of contract, and a continuing breach of contract. 

<P>

37.  As a result, the NFL, on behalf of the 29 other clubs of the League, is entitled to

declaratory and injunctive relief (1) confirming that the extent of the Raiders'

obligation to share gross receipts, and the interpretation of the term "gross receipts"

for purposes of defining the scope of such sharing obligation, are matters committed to

resolution by internal League governance processes and collective decision by the thirty

member clubs and (2) requiring the Raiders to comply with that contractual commitment. 



<H4>WHEREFORE, plaintiff prays for judgment:</H4> 



(A)  On the first count, declaring (1) that the determination of franchise locations is

committed by contract to internal League governance procedures; (2) that the NFL did not

violate the Sherman Act by relying by its rules and procedures regarding franchise

relocation to reject defendant's demand unilaterally to relocate its franchise for the

1994 NFL season; and (3) that such rules and procedures are consistent with and comply

fully wlth the Federal antitrust laws; 

<P>

(B)  On the second count,  (1) confirming that the Raiders and the other NFL member

clubs have committed to internal League governance procedures and collective

determinaaation the definition of gross recelpts and the allocatlon of gross receipts

between home and visiting clubs and (2) requiring the Raiders to comply with that

contractual commitment; and 

<P>

(C) Awarding such other relief as the Cou~rt may deem appropriate~ in the circumstances.

Plaintiff OAKLAND RAIDERS, A

California Limited Partnership,  ("Raiders"), formerly known as the Los Angeles Raiders,

Plaintiff CITY OF OAKLAND, Plaintiff OAKLAND-ALAMEDA COUNTY COLISEUM AUTHORITY, a Joint

Powers Agency,; and Plaintiff COUNTY OF ALAMEDA, each by its undersigned attorneys,

brings this civil action against the above-named defendants and, demanding trial by

jury, for its Complaint and claims against defendants, avers as follows: 



<H3>GENERAL ALLEGATIONS</H3>



1.   All of the allegations in this

Complaint are made based upon each plaintiff's information and belief.  Such counts or

claims as pertain less to than all of the plaintiffs the Raiders will be designated as

such. 



<H4>Nature of this Action</H4>



2.     On June 23, 1995, the Raiders signed a letter of intent ("letter of intent") with

the Oakland- Alameda County Coliseum Authority, a Joint Powers Agency, the City of

Oakland, the County of Alameda, and related entities ("Oakland Entities").  That letter

sets forth certain of the terms under which the Raiders contracted to provide necessary

facilities for the operation of a major league professional football team in Oakland,

California. On August 7, 1995, the Raiders and the Oakland Entities signed the

definitive agreements, ("definitive agreement") and the Raiders started producing and

exhibiting football games in Oakland commencing in August 1995. 

<P>

3.   The defendant entities which,

along with the Raiders, are the member clubs of the National Football League have

agreed, with the exception of the Raiders, to operate as an anti-competitive cartel and

to take steps pursuant to a long-standing conspiracy, to hinder and impede the Raiders

and the Oakland Entities from performing their obligations under the letter of intent

and the definitive agreements.  The impetus to the Raiders' move to Oakland was to

improve competition and the Raiders' and Oakland Entities' competitive positions.  The

defendants have attempted to bar the Raiders' relocation through their acts and conduct,

including without limitation their application of unlawful, standardless and

confiscatory rules and practices that (i) violate federal antitrust law; (ii) tortiously

interfere with the Raiders' right to perform under the terms of the letter of intent and

definitive agreements providing for the relocation; (iii) breach the existing agreements

between and among the Raiders, the League and the defendant teams; (iv) breach the duty

of care owed to the Raiders, as a member of the League, by certain NFL officers and

employees and defendant and other teams; (v) are part of an improper, anti- competitive

attempt to demand monetary and non-monetary concessions from the Raiders; and (vi) are

otherwise wrongful and illegal, as alleged in this Complaint.  From at least 1978 to

date, the Raiders have consistently opposed the application and enforcement of Rule 4.3

of the NFL Constitution as a naked restraint of trade.  The Oakland Entities were an

intended targets of the acts alleged herein to block or interfere with the move of the

Raiders to Oakland. 

<P>

4. As more specifically set forth below, plaintiff accordingly seeks injunctive relief

holding that (i) the NFL's cartel rules restricting relocation are unlawful, both on

their face and as applied to the Raiders' move to Oakland; (ii) the  cartel's

application of those rules is an unlawful restraint of trade and a breach of contract

designed to render the Raiders less able to compete and, in turn, to enrich the Raiders'

competitors; (iii) the Raiders were free to contract with the Oakland Coliseum in 1994,

and were free to move to the City of Oakland to play major league professional football

in 1995, without the cloud of uncertainty created by the NFL and other defendants that

have harmed and delayed the efforts to sell bonds, renovate the stadium, and market

suites and tickets in Oakland; and mandating that (iv) the defendants cease and desist

from unreasonable economic demands relating to the Raiders' relocation to Oakland and

playing of home games in Oakland.  Plaintiffs further seek single, treble and punitive

damages for economic injury sustained by virtue of defendants' breaches and violations

of duties and obligations and the defendants' unlawful interference with and impedance

of the relocation of the Raiders to Oakland. 



<H4>The Parties</H4>



5.   Plaintiff Oakland Raiders is a

California limited partnership, doing business in Oakland, California, and Los Angeles,

California, and formerly known as the Los Angeles Raiders.  The Raiders are playing

their major league professional football home games in Oakland, California. 

<P>

6.   The City of Oakland is a

municipal corporation under the laws of the State of California.  The Oakland-Alameda

County Coliseum Authority, a Joint Powers Agency, was established by the City of

Oakland, a municipal corporation and a charter city duly organized and existing under

the laws and Constitution of the State of California and the County of Alameda, a

political subdivision of the State of California pursuant to the Amended and Restated

Joint Powers Agreement dated as of July 1, 1995.  The Raiders are now playing their 

major league professional football home games in the Oakland- Alameda County Coliseum. 

The Oakland-Alameda Coliseum Authority operates and manages the Oakland Coliseum complex

as an independent contractor and not as an agent of Oakland or County. All net revenues

from the operation of the Oakland Coliseum complex are returned equally to Oakland and

County. 

<P>

7.   The County of Alameda is a

government entity created by California law. 

<P>

8.   Defendant Paul Tagliabue 

("Tagliabue") is an individual and the Commissioner of the NFL. 

<P>

9.   Defendant Neil Austrian 

("Austrian") is an individual and the President of the NFL. 

<P>

10.  Defendant National Football

League (the "NFL") is an unincorporated association with its headquarters in New York,

New York.  The NFL is a group of persons and entities that have joined together for a

common purpose and constitutes a combination under federal and state antitrust laws. 

The rules, regulations, resolutions, and Constitution & Bylaws of the NFL that are at

issue in this case constitute contracts between and among the Raiders, NFL and the

defendant teams. 

<P>

11.  The following listed defendants

own and operate 16 of the 30 existing NFL franchises in the cities indicated below,

which franchises are separate business entities that engage in substantial competition

defendants, and in pursuit of the contracts, combinations, and conspiracy to restrain

trade described herein. 

<P>

14.  The defendants named in

Paragraphs 11 and 12 are sued in their individual capacities and in their capacities as

<H4>Jurisdiction and Venue</H4>



15.  This Court has jurisdiction

over the subject matter of this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1331, 1337,

1367, and 2201 and Sections 4 and 16 of the Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 15 and

26). 

<P>

16.  The plaintiffs' federal claims

are instituted against the above-named defendants pursuant to Sections 4 and 16 of the

Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. &#167; &#167; 15 and 26) based on their violations of Section 1

of the Sherman Act (15 U.S.C.  &#167; 1), to secure injunctive relief to prevent the

continuation of such violations (15 U.S.C  &#167; 26), and to secure declaratory relief

pursuant to the Declaratory Judgment Act (28 U.S.C.  &#167; 2201). 

<P>

17.  This action is also based on

state law for injury resulting from defendants' tortious interference with business

relations, breaches of fiduciary duty, negligence, mismanagement, breaches of contract,

and civil conspiracy.  

<P>

18.  Venue in this action is proper

pursuant to 28 U.S.C.  &#167; 1391 and 15 U.S.C.  &#167; 15, 22. Each of the Defendants

resides and/or transacts business in the Northern District of California directly or

through agents.  The interstate trade and commerce described hereinafter has been

carried out in part within this District.  A substantial part of the events and injury

giving rise to the plaintiffs' claims occurred in this District, and a substantial part

of the property that is the subject of the action is situated in the Northern District

of California. 

<P>

19.  This proceeding is also brought

in this District pursuant to an agreement between the Raiders, through Allen Davis, and

the NFL, through Tagliabue, that before any litigation was filed there would be dialogue

between Tagliabue and the Raiders -- in essence, that there would be no sneak attack

lawsuit -- and that  any litigation between them arising out of the relocation of the

Raiders to Oakland would be in the Northern District of California:<P>  

<UL>

a.   This agreement was made

when the NFL requested that the Raiders

submit their proposed move from Los

Angeles to Oakland for approval by the

NFL owners in accordance with Rule 4.3 of the NFL Constitution.  The Raiders' position

was that no such approval was necessary, but in consideration of the NFL's promise to

permit any litigation to be filed and prosecuted in the Northern District of California,

the Raiders agreed to submit their proposed relocation to the NFL members and not to

file any suit of their own until after such meeting had been held.  

<P>

b.   The Raiders performed

their part of the bargain, and, on July

21, 1995, proceedings under Rule 4.3 were held and resulted in a unanimous approval of

the move to Oakland.  

<P>

c.   However, on August 31,

1995, three days before the grand opening day at the Oakland Coliseum and Raider game

against the 1994 American Conference champion, in the midst of tumultuous week-long

welcome-back ceremonies, the NFL breached its venue agreement by filing a sneak lawsuit

in the Central District of California.  

<P>

d.   The NFL breach was

committed because of the NFL's forum-

shopping for a tribunal deemed favorable to the NFL.  In its haste, the NFL did not

receive approval of that litigation from NFL owners, nor were any owners joined as

plaintiffs though they were (and are) indispensable parties to the NFL's suit.</ul> 



<H4>Trade and Commerce</H4>



20.  The factual bases of this

action -- the defendants' interference with the relocation of major league professional

football teams in the United States -- involves and affects interstate commerce.  The

unlawful actions alleged herein have restrained trade and commerce between the states. 





<H4>Relevant Markets</H4>



21.  There are two relevant markets

that are at issue in this litigation: (i) the market for stadiums offering their

facilities to major league professional football teams in the United States, and (ii)

the market for major league professional football including the geographic area around

the San Francisco - Oakland Bay Area. 



<H4>The Stadium Market</H4>



22.  There is a limited supply of

stadia that are capable of providing the facilities necessary for the operation of a

major league professional football team.  The stadia must be, inter alia:  (a) properly

designed to provide clear lines of vision for tens of thousands of patrons; (b)

comfortably and attractively designed to provide amenities sufficient to draw fans to

the park, including, but not limited to, box suites and club seats; (c) large enough to

make the business a viable venture; and (d) comprehensive enough to provide necessary

training, storage, locker rooms, and office space. 

<P>

23.  The sellers in the stadium

market are the stadium owners and lessors, including the Oakland Coliseum, which operate

and lease stadiums and their associated facilities and market those stadiums and

facilities to major league professional football teams, including the Raiders and the

other member clubs, which contract with stadium facilities.  Stadium owners and lessors

do not view any other prospective tenant as reasonably interchangeable with, or as

effective substitutes for, major league professional football teams, such as the Raiders

and the other member clubs. 

<P>

24.  The relevant geographic market

for assessing competition in the product market for major league professional football

stadia is the United States. The NFL has power in the major league professional football

stadium market in the United States. 



<H4>The Major League Professional

Football Market</H4>



25.  The second relevant product

market is the market for major league professional football.  This is a market involving

the sale of the right to live attendance at major league professional football games. 

The sellers in this product market are major league professional football teams.  The

buyers are the consumers who pay to attend the games. 

<P>

26.  Consumers of major league

professional football do not consider such football functionally interchangeable with

other sports and non- sports entertainment. 

<P>

27.  The relevant geographic market

for assessing the legality of defendants' restraints on the product market for major

league professional football is the United States including, as a sub-market, the San

Francisco-Oakland Bay Area. 

<P>

28.  The Raiders seek the right to

compete freely to supply major league professional football to the San Francisco-Oakland

Bay Area.  The defendants have market power and monopoly power in the San

Francisco-Oakland Bay Area. 



<H4>The Defendants' Unlawful Conspiracy</H4>



29.  Since sometime prior to 1978,

the NFL and the defendant teams have agreed, combined and conspired to restrict,

restrain, and prevent relocation of NFL teams outside of their "home territories." 

"Home territory" is defined to be the corporate limits of the city in which an NFL team

plays its home games plus the "surrounding territory to the extent of 75 miles in every

direction from the exterior corporate limits of such city."  In 1982, NFL Commissioner

Pete Rozelle admitted to Congress that, during the period from 1960 to 1980, "not one

NFL club was permitted to abandon its home territory." 

<P>

30.  During that same time period,

approximately 19 of the then 28 NFL teams relocated to new stadia within their home

territories.  The League policy prohibiting moves outside a member club's "home

territory" was formally memorialized in Article 4.3 of the League Constitution and

By-Laws, which gave every member club the absolute, unfettered right to veto any

relocation by any member club outside of its home territory. 

<P>

31.  In 1978, the Los Angeles

Memorial Coliseum Commission ("LAMCC") -- then seeking a professional football tenant in

the wake of the Los Angeles Rams' move from the Los Angeles Coliseum to nearby  Anaheim

-- filed an antitrust suit against the NFL and certain of its member teams, alleging

that Article 4.3 was unlawfully preventing it from securing an NFL team to play in the

Los Angeles Coliseum.  In response to this lawsuit, and aware that the unanimous

approval requirement was manifestly anti-competitive, the Executive Committee of the NFL

amended Article 4.3 to require three-quarters approval, instead of unanimous approval,

for all relocations. 

<P>

32.  The amended version of Article

4.3 was nevertheless challenged by the LAMCC as violative of the antitrust laws.  After

the NFL destroyed the Oakland Raiders' negotiations to remain in Oakland, and after the

Raiders consummated a deal with LAMCC to relocate to Los Angeles, the Oakland Raiders

joined the LAMCC suit.  A judgment was entered against the NFL and most of its member

teams on a jury verdict finding that the League's use of Article 4.3 to prohibit the

Raiders' relocation to Los Angeles violated Section 1 of the Sherman Act.  The jury

found that even though the relocation of the Raiders to Los Angeles was pro-

competitive, not a single NFL team had voted to approve the relocation.  The jury also

found that the NFL had unlawfully restrained trade in two markets, including the first

relevant market at issue in this case -- the market for stadia offering their facilities

to major league professional football teams in the United States.  This judgment

subsequently was affirmed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in

<I>Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum Comm'n v. NFL,</I> 726 F.2d 1381 (9th Cir.), cert.

denied, 469 U.S. 990 (1984). 

<P>

33.  In the opinion  affirming the

jury verdict holding Article 4.3 unlawful, the United States Court of Appeals for the

Ninth Circuit advised the defendants that they should replace their standardless voting

procedures with restrictions narrowly tailored to consider objective factors related to

the anti- competitive effects and pro-competitive benefits of preventing relocation in

each particular case. 

<P>

34.  Given the member clubs'

unwillingness to substantively change Article 4.3 and Commissioner Rozelle's and the

NFL's continued commitment to the NFL's prohibition against moves out of home

territories, the League and the teams needed a way to improve their litigation prospects

when future relocations outside home territories were proposed and consistently

disapproved pursuant to Article 4.3.  The solution developed by Commissioner Rozelle was

to impose a set of arbitrary procedures on relocating teams, the highlights of which

are: 



<P>

a.   A team seeking to relocate<br>

must submit a relocation proposal to<br>

the League, containing a statement<br>

of reasons why the relocation "is<br>

justified" and why it "is in the<br>

League's best interest" to approve<br>

the relocation.  A relocating team<br>

must also submit voluminous<br>

additional information that supports<br>

relocation.<P>



b.   The procedures identify<br>

nine specific factors that<br> 

may be considered when an<br>

NFL team seeks to relocate<br>

"outside [its] home territory."<br>

These are alleged to be the<br>

factors "that the League has<br>

considered vital in connection<br>

with team location decisions in<br>

the past," and they were drawn<br>

from a "bill reported by a<br>

senate committee in 1984."  The<br>

procedures require any NFL team<br>

seeking to relocate outside its<br>

home territory to include a<br>

written submission "stating<br>

specifically why such a move is<br>

regarded as justified on these<br>

standards."<P>



c.   A member club seeking to<br>

relocate has a right<br>

to a "fair hearing" before its<br>

application to relocate can be<br>

acted upon.<P> 



35.  These procedures do not remedy

the illegality of Article 4.3, but rather reflect a cosmetic change and an additional

burden that a relocating owner must endure before the NFL defendants disapprove the

relocation of his team out of its home territory:  

<br><UL>

a.   First, the procedures

relate only to information and factors

that the Commissioner may consider before he issues a report to the teams, in which he

states his views as to whether the owners should vote to approve a relocation.  The

teams are not compelled to apply any particular standards or even to consider the

Commissioner's report or views when they vote on a proposed relocation pursuant to

Article 4.3.  

<p>

b.   Second, the factors

identified in the procedures are not

germane to an assessment of whether a

given relocation enhances or harms

competition.  Some of the factors are

contrary to such an analysis, and, taken as a whole, the factors reflect an open

hostility toward any relocation out of a team's home territory, even if the team were on

the verge of bankruptcy in its existing location.</ul>    

<p>

36.  Furthermore, current NFL

Commissioner Tagliabue has stated that the League is free to consider "factors other

than the criteria specifically enumerated in the policy" and that the teams are entitled

to "make a reasoned business decision based on the totality of the circumstances,"

irrespective of the "guidelines."  For these reasons and other reasons described herein,

defendants have rendered the guarantee of a right to a fair hearing based on objective

guidelines completely illusory. 

<p>

37.  Since the adoption of these

procedures, the defendants have continued to apply, and to threaten to apply, Article

4.3 to block, deter, hinder and burden all relocations of NFL franchises out of teams'

home territories.  In all but three instances, defendants have demonstrated little

interest in applying even the Commissioner's deficient relocation procedures, and, in

every instance, defendants have failed to perform any adequate objective assessment of

the competitive benefits and harms occasioned by potential relocations out of home

territories. 

<p>

38.  The defendants' combination and

conspiracy has involved a variety of unlawful conduct. In addition to enacting and

applying invalid and illegal rules, bylaws, provisions, and resolutions, and applying

and misapplying standardless and unlawful procedures to prevent relocation of teams, the

defendants have used the improper threat that they will require the payment of

unreasonable fees to interfere with and to abort proposed relocations out of home

territories, and to diminish the value of contracts teams have negotiated on the

competitive merits with stadia to which they propose to relocate. 

<p>

39.  The NFL and certain of its

employees have also misapplied such NFL rules as do exist:  They have applied those

rules in an inconsistent and arbitrary manner; they have granted waivers or exemptions

to those rules by executive fiat, and without reasonable justification; they have

ignored rule violations by League members when it was convenient to do so; they have

created rules without authority to do so; they have interpreted their rules in ways to

benefit some teams at the expense of plaintiff and others; and they have used their

rules to invest wide-ranging powers in a select cadre of market competitors. 

<p>

40.  The defendants' illegal

combination and conspiracy has also involved invalid and illegal rules, bylaws,

provisions, resolutions, and policies.  Among other misconduct, by applying and

misapplying supposed "revenue sharing" rules, defendants have unreasonably demanded

specific revenues that accrue to a limited number of League members, while allowing

other League members to withhold and retain for themselves vast sums of equivalent

revenues, thereby placing plaintiff and certain other member clubs at a competitive and

financial disadvantage.  

<p>

41.  As a result of such capricious

and inconsistent application of the rules, currently, only a very limited number of

teams (generally only relocating teams or teams moving to an expanded stadium) are

subject to the "revenue-sharing" decrees pertaining to club seats or premium seat

location fees.  

<p>

42.  Conversely, luxury suite income

has been excluded from the League's "revenue-sharing" rules, in part, because luxury

suites were initially controlled by a coterie of original and dominant competitors, and

in part because the Raiders never had luxury suites.  The result of these actions has

been to enhance the competitive ability of certain League members, while simultaneously

curtailing the competitive position of other League members, including the Raiders. 





<H4>The Anti-Competitive Effects of the Defendants' Conduct and the Pro-Competitive

Consequences of a Relocation of the Raiders to Oakland</H4> 



43.  The defendants' unreasonable

restraints of trade and other anti-competitive conduct have all caused anti-competitive

effects in the relevant markets at issue in this case. 

<p>

44.  The defendants' conduct and

conspiracy to restrict, impede, and interfere with relocation by NFL teams in general,

and the Raiders' relocation to Oakland in particular, have caused many anti-competitive

effects in the stadium market, including the following:<p><UL> 



(a)  They have deterred

potential owners of football stadia from incurring the costs associated with the

designing and building of first-class football stadia;  

<p>

(b)  They have increased the

difficulties and costs associated with

securing financial support for the

construction and operation of such; 

<p>

(c)  They have caused NFL teams

to remain in stadia that provide lower

quality facilities than the stadia those teams would otherwise occupy;  

<p>

(d)  They have created a strong

disincentive for existing stadium

landlords to expend time and resources to compete to secure major league professional

football teams as tenants;  

<p>

(e)  They have restricted the

supply of stadia that are capable of

providing the facilities necessary for

the operation of major league

professional football teams; and

<p>

(f)  They created delay and a

cloud of uncertainty over the Raiders'

relocation that adversely impacted,

burdened and made more costly and less

financially advantageous the planned

financing and stadium renovation.</ul><p>



As a result of these anti-competitive actions, the overall quality of the stadia and

associated facilities in which NFL member clubs operate is less than it would otherwise

be. 



<H4>The 1994 Misconduct</H4>



45.  Following the January 1994

Northridge earthquake in which the Los Angeles Coliseum was severely damaged and

rendered unusable, the Raiders repeatedly asked the NFL to prepare a schedule for the

1994 NFL season with their home games in Oakland to ensure that the Raiders would have a

home facility for that season in which to play all of their home games and to eliminate

the uncertainties attendant to the timing of repairs to the Los Angeles Coliseum.  The

Raiders and the Oakland plaintiffs had agreed on the terms of a lease for the Oakland

Coliseum, for the 1994 NFL season. 

<p>

46.  Tagliabue and other NFL

officials categorically refused these requests of the Raiders.  This placed the Raiders

at a competitive and financial disadvantage vis-a-vis other member clubs.  In doing so,

defendants engaged in an illegal group boycott, pursuant to which the NFL refused to

schedule Raider 1994 games in Oakland, despite the earthquake-damaged condition of the

Los Angeles Coliseum.  The boycott was promoted by the 49ers who acted from

anti-competitive motives.    



<H4>The 1995 Misconduct</H4>



47.  On or about June 23, 1995,

after vigorous competition by the Oakland Coliseum against other stadium owners and

lessors, an agreement was reached by and between the Oakland Coliseum and the Raiders,

pursuant to which the Raiders agreed to move to Oakland and to play football games in

the  Oakland Coliseum for 16 football seasons.  The Raiders believed relocation to

Oakland would better their competitive position over their situation in the Los Angeles

Coliseum, and would better serve competition in the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Area. 

<p>

48.  On July 21, 1995, the NFL,

under pressure of mounting circumstances that precluded any further attempt to block

relocation of the Raiders to Oakland, agreed to "allow" the move; but acted to interfere

with and to impair the transaction for the purpose of lessening the ability of the

Raiders to compete, in particular against the San Francisco 49ers and in general against

other NFL clubs. 

<p>

49.  The 49ers as well as certain

League members attempted, at first successfully, to block the Raiders' relocation

entirely, then to defer approval and, finally, to demand economic tribute from the

Raiders either by forced agreement or by stealth. 

<p>

50.  The effort to block relocation

was abandoned, because the circumstances of a Raiders' return to Oakland had generated

such public enthusiasm and momentum that it could not be stopped without a public

relations fiasco for defendants or threat of government or private actions for unlawful

conduct. Moreover, the prior victory of the Raiders against the NFL for unlawful

application of Rule 4.3 was buttressed thereafter by the stated opinion of NFL counsel

that the Raiders met the hardship standards of the relocation rule. 

<p>

51.  In these circumstances,

defendants then resorted to a demand for unreasonable amounts of funds from the Raiders

and Oakland, as had been imposed previously by the NFL on the Los Angeles Rams.  The

demand against the Rams for their move to St. Louis resulted in a reluctant surrender by

the Rams of a commitment to pay approximately $50 million of benefits which the Rams had

successfully negotiated with authorities in St. Louis.  The Raiders, however, refused to

submit to what was deemed to be, and expressed as, unreasonable tribute.  The Raiders

acted for themselves and Oakland in their refusal to agree to these NFL terms. 

<p>

52.  The Raiders contended that they

did not need NFL approval to relocate to Oakland, but agreed to allow Tagliabue to

submit the proposal to the membership at a meeting scheduled in Chicago for July 14,

1995, but postponed at the urging of the 49ers to July 21, 1995, when it was passed

unanimously by the other 29 NFL clubs.  

<p>

53.  At the time of the vote and

thereafter, defendants engaged in the following actions, among others, in furtherance of

their anti-competitive combination and conspiracy directed against the Raiders and the

Oakland Entities to deter and burden the relocation to Oakland and to deprive the

Raiders and the Oakland Entities of the financial benefits of their freely negotiated

agreements: 

<p><UL>

(a.) The president of the

general partner of the Raiders expressed to Tagliabue on at least two occasions, to the

Finance Committee, and to the general NFL membership immediately prior to the vote, that

approval of the relocation was on condition that neither the Raiders nor Oakland would

pay any money, however denominated, to the NFL from, among other sources, seat licenses,

club seats, and maintenance fees, other than the Raiders had previously agreed to

(namely, the visiting team's share of the club seat revenues actually received by the

Raiders, as distinguished from Oakland or other third-persons).  This was clearly stated

and understood as part of the vote about to be taken.  The unanimous vote adopted the

conditions as repeatedly stated. 

<p>

(b.) At the time of the vote,

the Commissioner and his coterie of

insiders had begun to undermine this

agreement and, on July 22, 1995, sent to the Raiders a duplicitous letter making oblique

references to sharing of unspecified "gross receipts" from the Raider-Oakland contracts. 

The letter had already been prepared at or prior to the time of the vote, but was

deliberately concealed and withheld by defendants from the Raiders and the owners

outside of the Commissioner's inner circle. 

<p>

(c.) The Raiders promptly

disavowed the revenue condition set forth in the letter, reiterating that the vote was

conditioned upon the commitment that neither Oakland nor the Raiders would have to pay a

single additional penny following the relocation or by reason of the terms of the

contracts between Oakland and the Raiders. 

<p>

(d.) The minutes of the meeting

of July 21, 1995, were written

deliberately to omit the stated

conditions under which the members voted. The Raiders duly protested this omission. 

<p>

(e.) As a condition for

submission to the member clubs of the

Raiders' proposal to relocate to Oakland and the Raiders' commitment not to file suit

against the NFL or member clubs to vindicate their position before the owners meeting to

consider the relocation, the NFL agreed that it would not initiate litigation against

the Raiders without consultation with the Raiders, and that venue for any litigation

that might arise in connection with the Raiders' relocation to Oakland or related

matters would lie in the Northern district of California. 

<p>

(f) In breach of the agreement

on venue, the NFL, on August 31, 1995,

three days before the Raiders' tumultuous opening game in the Oakland Coliseum, and

without prior discussion with the Raiders, filed a spurious "declaratory judgement" suit

in the Central District of California in Los Angeles.  The suit did not name any member

clubs as plaintiffs, and it was filed in haste, without the knowledge or consent of

member clubs of the NFL. 

<p>

(g.) The Los Angeles suit by

the NFL was secretly prepared and hastily filed in a scheme of "forum shopping" in

breach of the agreement to place venue in the Northern District of California.<p></ul> 



54.  The defendants additionally

interfered with the Raiders' Oakland negotiations and implementation of the letter of

intent and definitive agreements in the following ways, among others: 

<p><UL>

(a)  They made public

statements that the Raiders were not

serious about relocating to Oakland;

<p>

(b)  After the Raiders agreed

to move to Oakland, the President of the '49ers and other NFL owners publicly made

personal attacks on the Raider President, as well as derogatory statements: 

<p><UL>

(i)  That the Raiders would not<br>

get the NFL votes to move;

<p>

(ii) That the Raiders delayed<br>

their relocation decision in order<br>

to evade and avoid NFL rules;

<p>

(iii) That Oakland had made a<br>

bad deal for the City and Alameda<br>

County; and

<p>

(iv) That the Raider-Oakland<br>

contract would hurt the NFL's<br>

relationship with NBC; whereas in<br>

truth and in fact, NBC had no<br>

objection to the Raiders' relocation<br>

to Oakland;</ul>

<p>

(c)  Defendants dealt directly

with Oakland authorities attempting to

split the Raiders and Oakland.

<p>

(d)  The NFL succeeded in

creating a cloud of uncertainty over the transaction that has adversely impacted the

sales and marketing of personal seat licenses, suites, club seats and other components

of the transaction. 

<p></ul>

Moreover, not only did defendants thus interfere with implementation and performance of

the Raiders-Oakland definitive agreements, defendants failed affirmatively to endorse,

support, facilitate and favorably publicize the Raiders' relocation to Oakland, as they

have consistently done in the case of the relocation of other teams. 





<H4>Competitive Effects of Relocation</H4>



55.  The Raiders' relocation to

Oakland has and will:

<P>

(a) improve the quality of the Raiders' stadium facilities; (b) increase the quality of

the product and associated services provided to the fans who purchase tickets to attend

Raider home games; (c) substantially increase the attendance at Raiders' home games; (d)

eliminate the television blackout problems associated with Raiders home football games

that were not sold out in Los Angeles; (e) increase significantly the Raiders' financial

resources, thus allowing the Raiders to improve the quality of their product and to

compete more aggressively with the defendants in all of the markets where they compete;

and (f) provide substantial economic benefits to the Oakland Entities, including use

fees, seat licensing revenue, and other associated revenue. 

<P>

56.  The Raiders' relocation

responds to the substantial unsatisfied consumer demand for major league professional

football in the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Area.  Defendants' unlawful conduct delayed

and hindered plaintiff's relocation to Oakland, thereby depriving consumers and

plaintiffs of the pro- competitive benefits the relocation yields in the market for

major league professional football in the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Area. 





<H4>ANTITRUST INJURIES AND DAMAGES SUFFERED BY THE PLAINTIFF</H4> 



57.  As a direct result of the

defendants' unlawful agreements and conduct, the Raiders and Oakland have been denied

the right to participate and compete, free from artificial and anti-competitive

restrictions, in the market for stadium facilities for major league professional

football in the United States.  The defendants are trying to force the Raiders and the

Oakland Coliseum to pay forced, unreasonable economic tribute to the defendants. 

<P>

58.  The defendants' purported

application of their rules, regulations, resolutions and provisions in 1994 constituted

an agreement among the defendants collectively and concertedly to refuse to schedule or

to play games against the Raiders in Oakland and to boycott the Oakland Coliseum pay

economic tribute to the League. 

<P>

59.  The attempted economic coercion

aimed at the Raiders in 1995 constitutes a collective and concerted refusal to deal with

the Raiders and Oakland unless they pay economic tribute, which conduct threatens the

Raiders and Oakland with severe adverse consequences if they must accede to and comply

with the defendants' anti-competitive demands, and simultaneously enhances the economic

ability of the Raiders' competitors to compete with the Raiders, using specific revenue

sources developed by the Raiders and Oakland. The Raiders and Oakland would be

significantly more profitable, more competitive, and better able to produce a higher

quality product if they were free to compete, free from limitations or unreasonable and

discriminatory exactions of Raider and Oakland Coliseum revenue.  The Raiders' and

Oakland's interest in free competition in both relevant markets coincides with the

public's interest in vigorous competition responsive to consumer demand.  

<P>

60.  As a direct and proximate

result of the violations alleged herein, and defendants' continuing unlawful conduct,

plaintiffs have been, are being, and will be, immediately and irreparably injured in

their business and property, inter alia, by the threatened withholding of television

revenues. Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law.  If defendants are not restrained

by an order of this Court, plaintiffs will suffer the injuries described above,  a loss

of substantial goodwill, a diminution of revenues, a decrease in the value of the team,

and a lessening of their ability to compete on the unrestricted merits. / / / / / / /

/<P> 





<H3>FIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF</H3>

(Violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act Restraint of Trade in the Stadium Market By

All Plaintiffs Against All Defendants except Does 40-60) 

<P>

61.  Plaintiffs repeat and reallege paragraphs 1 through 60 as though fully set forth

herein. 

<P>

I.  In January 1994, the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum ("LA Coliseum"), where the

Raiders had played their home games for the past 12 NFL seasons, was severely damaged by

an earthquake.  Substantial doubt existed as to whether the LA Coliseum would be

available for use at the start and during the 1994 NFL season. 

<P>

1.  Early in February of that year,

Oakland officials offered their stadium to the Raiders as a gesture of good will.  The

Oakland Coliseum was made available to the Raiders for 1994, or for whatever length of

time was necessary to repair the LA Coliseum.  Oakland officials even held a press

conference to make their offer. Consequently, the entire country was made aware of

Oakland's offer.  Negotiations between the Raiders and Oakland had settled the

substantial terms of the lease for the Raiders to play in the Oakland Coliseum. 

<P>

2.  Under the circumstances, the Raiders contacted Tagliabue and requested that the

Raiders be scheduled in Oakland for the 1994 NFL season.  The Raiders' repeated requests

in that regard were made in writing, in face to face meetings, and over the telephone to

Tagliabue and other NFL officials. 

<P>

3.  By  letter dated April 29, 1994, the Raiders told Commissioner Tagliabue:  "As you

are aware the City of Oakland offered to make its facility available to us in the event

we are unable to, or choose not to, play in the earthquake damaged Los Angeles Memorial

Coliseum.  We told the League, and in fact I implored you, to schedule us in a manner

which would allow us to play in Oakland if the need arose.... [y]ou have been advised

that if we play in Oakland rather than Los Angeles we will realize, for one season

alone, an increase of approximately ten million dollars in revenue....Paul, this

situation results from a natural disaster. I came to you in good faith for help." 

<P>

4. Yet, notwithstanding the Raiders' legitimate request that arose from the earthquake

disaster, the NFL even refused to design a proposed schedule that could have allowed the

Raiders to play in Oakland in 1994.   

<P>

II. Additionally, certain members of the League, most prominently the San Francisco

49ers, were actively involved in ensuring that the Raiders' request to be scheduled in

Oakland for the 1994 season would go unheeded. In 1982 when the Raiders moved to Los

Angeles, the NFL gave Oakland a moral, if not legal commitment to place an NFL expansion

team in Oakland.  The NFL breached that commitment to preserve a territorial monopoly

for the 49ers. 

<P>

III.  Ultimately,  the NFL, for anti-competitive reasons, blocked the Raiders' move to

Oakland and did not schedule the Raiders to play in Oakland for the 1994 NFL season, as

the Raiders had requested.  Having refused to prepare a schedule for Raider home games

in Oakland in 1994, defendants precluded a Raider move to Oakland in 1994 under any

circumstances and rendered meaningless application of even the NFL's own illegal

relocation rules, similar to the NFL's prior boycott of 1980 where the members all

agreed that they would not travel to the LA Coliseum to play the Raiders. 

<P>

1.   Since the LA Coliseum would not

be, and was not, ready for use during the entire NFL pre- season, the Raiders were

forced to play their entire 1994 pre-season schedule on the road.  This created a

significant hardship and financial loss for the Raider organization, and correspondingly

a significant loss for Oakland. 

<P>

2.  As a further result of the NFL's

refusal to schedule the Raiders in Oakland for the 1994 NFL season, the Raiders were

forced to play their 1994 regular season games in the LA Coliseum, a stadium Tagliabue

has repeatedly called inadequate for the NFL.  By the end of the 1994 NFL season, it had

become apparent that the losses suffered by the Raiders for 1994 alone were in excess of

$20 million dollars.  Had the Raiders played in Oakland in 1994, as they requested, they

and Oakland would have sold more tickets and at a higher price than the Raiders were

able to sell in Los Angeles, and plaintiffs would have received substantial income from

luxury suites that was not available at all in Los Angeles. 

<P>

3.   The City of San Francisco, in

collaboration with the 49ers, have made an exhaustive study to demonstrate that a

Superbowl game in Candlestick Park would generate approximately $200,000,000 in revenues

spent for hotels, food, travel, and entertainment.  That sum is for a single game.  In

1994-95, the Raiders would have played nine games in Oakland, and a reasonable estimate,

based on the San Francisco study, is that nine games in 1994-95 would have generated at

least three times the amount generated by a single Superbowl game.  Plaintiffs' share of

these funds in the form of sales taxes, other taxes, landing fees, license fees, and

Coliseum revenues would have amounted to at least $50,000,000. 

<P>

4. Defendants' agreements and joint

conduct, discussed above, constitute "contract(s), combinations(s)..., and

conspirac(ies)" that were designed to restrain trade and have restrained trade

unreasonably in the market for major league professional football in the San

Francisco-Oakland Bay Area, in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C.

Section 1. 

<P>

A.  Defendants' anti-competitive conduct and agreements have harmed competition as

explained above, by restraining competition and by compromising the competitive process. 

<P>

IV.  Defendants' violations of Section 1 of the Sherman Act have proximately caused

injury and damage to the Raiders' and Oakland's business and property.  The plaintiffs

were denied the right to compete freely to supply major league professional football in

the Oakland area, and were denied the substantial financial benefits they would

otherwise have received under the terms of an agreement between the Raiders and Oakland. 

<P>

1.  Defendants' violations of Section

1 of the Sherman Act have proximately caused injury and damage to plaintiffs' business

and property.  The Raiders and Oakland were denied the right freely to compete in the

market for stadia for major league professional football teams in the United States and

were denied substantial financial benefits as a direct result. 





<H3>SECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF</H3>

(Violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act Restraint of Trade in the Market for Major

League Professional Football By Plaintiff Raiders Against all Defendants except Does

40-60) 

<P>

2.  Plaintiffs repeat and reallege

paragraphs 1 through 5 and 8 through 60 as though fully set forth herein. 

<P>

3.  The Raiders informed the NFL of their intent to relocate to Oakland for the 1995

season. Representatives of the NFL admitted to the Raiders that they fulfilled all of

the NFL's so-called "guidelines" that relate to franchise relocation.  NFL

representatives also gave assurances to the Raiders that there would be no relocation or

associated fees sought by the League from the Raiders as a result of the relocation. 

<P>

4.   On July 20, 1995, and July 21,

1995, Raider representatives met with the NFL Finance Committee in Chicago preparatory

to a full meeting of NFL owners.  The Finance Committee is appointed by the

Commissioner, and is composed of seven team owners or executives, who are active

competitors of the Oakland Raiders.  The committee meetings were called to discuss the

Raiders' relocation to Oakland.  The Raiders unequivocally and repetitively told the

Finance Committee that the Raiders would pay no fee or other money, under any name or

guise, in connection with the relocation, other than what was reflected in the

submissions the Raiders had made to the NFL. 

<P>

5.   Later in the day on July 21,

1995, the League members met to discuss the proposed return of the Raiders to Oakland. 

After an initial discussion, Tagliabue insisted that the Raiders leave the room.  While

the Raiders were absent, NFL staff distributed a proposed Resolution G-7.  The Raiders

were subsequently allowed back into the room for the vote, but were made to vote out of

turn and without being afforded an adequate or reasonable opportunity to read Resolution

G-7.  In fact, the Raiders even had to ask to see a copy of the Resolution which was

being voted upon. 

<P>

6.   Just prior to the vote, the

Raiders' representatives again made explicit and clear that neither the Raiders nor

Oakland could or would pay any fees, however labelled, to the NFL as part of the

relocation, other than the Raiders had already committed to.  The League then proceeded

to vote on Resolution G-7. The Resolution passed without a single dissenting vote.

Nowhere does Resolution G-7 mention any fees that would be required from the Raiders or

Oakland.  As part of the vote, the NFL tried to sneak through a portion of Resolution

G-7, which purported to restrict access to the Los Angeles opportunity.  The NFL had

never told the Raiders that this restraint would be part of the vote to approve the

Raiders' relocation.  The Raiders abstained from voting on Resolution G-7 and

immediately challenged the NFL on the propriety of this maneuver.  The Raiders

continuously, both verbally and in writing, rejected any notion that the NFL as a League

had any exclusive rights in the area. 

<P>

7.   The next day, the Raiders

received a letter from Tagliabue to the effect that the approval of the relocation was

premised upon the Raiders' payment of certain substantial fees to the NFL under the

guise of so-called "revenue-sharing."  The fees demanded by the NFL were not part of

Resolution G-7 and were directly contrary to the terms upon which the relocation was

tendered to the NFL for approval.  Moreover, the fees are completely unreasonable,

discriminatory, and contrary to the assurances given to the Raiders at the League

meeting when the vote was taken. 

<P>

8.   Irrespective of whether the fees

demanded are "relocation fees" or "revenue-sharing" fees, the result is the same:  The

NFL would seize the economic benefits to the Raiders of the Oakland transaction and

would use them to line the coffers of the Raiders' competitors.  The NFL would deprive

the Raiders of the economic benefits of their freely negotiated transaction and transfer

those benefits to the Raiders' competitors. The NFL's demand for tribute is an

unreasonable restraint of competition in both of the relevant markets. 

<P>

9. Defendants' agreements and joint

conduct, discussed above, constitute "contract(s), combinations(s)..., and

conspirac(ies)" that were designed to restrain trade, and have restrained trade,

unreasonably in the market for major league professional football in the San

Francisco-Oakland Bay Area, in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C.

Section 1. 

<P>

A.  Defendants' anti-competitive conduct and agreements have harmed competition as

explained above, by restricting output, by otherwise restraining competition and by

compromising the competitive process. 

<P>

V.  Defendants' violations of Section 1 of the Sherman Act have proximately caused

injury and damage to the Raiders' business and property.  The Raiders have been denied

the right to compete freely to supply major league professional football in the Oakland

area, free from arbitrary and discriminatory provisions, and have been denied the

substantial financial benefits they would otherwise receive under the terms of their

agreement in the absence of any forced economic tribute levied by defendants. 

<P>

1.  Defendants' foregoing unlawful acts and agreements have left the Raiders with no

adequate remedy at law.  If this Court does not grant the request for injunctive relief,

the defendants will continue to require illegal and unreasonable payments from the

Raiders and the Oakland Coliseum, thereby harming the Raiders, competition, and

consumers in the relevant market. 

<P>



<H3>THIRD CLAIM FOR RELIEF</H3>

(Breach of Contract

By the Raiders Against Defendants NFL and Does 01-39) 

<P>

2.   Plaintiff repeats and realleges

paragraphs 1 through 5, 8 through 60 and 77 through 82 as though fully set forth herein. 

<P>

3.   Under the defendants' relocation

procedures, a team proposing to relocate has a right to a fair hearing at which its

proposal to relocate will be considered.  In addition, the various contractual

agreements between the Raiders and the defendants include implied obligations to act

fairly and in good faith. 

<P>

4.   The Raiders were not afforded a

fair or meaningful hearing to make their case for a proposed relocation to Oakland, and

the defendants have not acted fairly or in good faith.  Prior to the League meeting to

discuss the proposed relocation, certain NFL defendants stated that the Raiders would

only be allowed to move if they agreed to pay indeterminate financial tribute to the

NFL.  Thus the defendants prejudged the move and sought to extract large sums of money

in order to approve the move for improper reasons, on the basis of improper criteria,

and through the application and misapplication of an unlawful, standardless League rules

and a preordained League vote. 

<P>

5.   Additionally, defendants, through

the NFL's Constitution and By-Laws, have a contractual obligation to make a good faith

determination of whether a team may relocate to another territory. 

<P>

6.   On July 21, 1995, the defendants

voted to approve the Raiders' relocation without a single dissenting vote.  Just prior

to the vote the defendants were explicitly told that no further costs or fees could or

would be paid to the League after the move.  Nevertheless the defendants voted to

approve the relocation. 

<P>

7.   The next day, the Raiders

received a letter from Tagliabue demanding that escalating fees be paid to the NFL as

part of the relocation.  These terms were not contained in the Resolution voted on by

the defendants that approved the relocation.  The Raiders were not told of this secret

condition prior to the vote or during the preceding discussion among the owners, thereby

making the "hearing" guaranteed by the NFL regulations and procedures, meaningless and a

complete sham. 

<P>

8.   Defendants have breached their

contract with the Raiders, as well as their implied duty thereunder to act in good faith

and to deal fairly with a team that proposes to relocate.  The NFL also sent out

purported minutes of the July 21, 1995 meeting that are deliberately false, incomplete

and misleading.  The Raiders promptly notified Tagliabue of the various errors and

omissions contained in its alleged minutes, and asked that the minutes be corrected. 

Tagliabue has refused to do so. 

<P>

9.   The Raiders have been injured by

reason of defendants' breach of contract in an amount presently unknown but which will

be proven at the time of trial. 

<P>



<H4>FOURTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF</H4>

(Breach of Contract)<BR>

(By the Raiders Against All Defendants

except Does 40-60)

<P>

10.  Plaintiff Raiders repeats and

realleges paragraphs 1 5, 8 through 60 and 77 through 82 as though fully set forth

herein. 

<P>

11.  As alleged in paragraphs 53(a),

78, 80 and 91 above, prior to the vote by the NFL owners on the relocation of the

Raiders to Oakland, the Raiders orally and repeatedly told Tagliabue, the NFL Finance

Committee members, and the assembled owners that neither the Raiders nor Oakland would

pay any money, however denominated, to the NFL from, among other sources, seat licenses,

club seats, and maintenance fees, other than the Raiders had previously agreed to

(namely, the visiting team's share of the club seat revenues actually received by the

Raiders, as distinguished from Oakland or other third- persons).  

<P>

12. That statement was repeated to

the NFL owners and officials immediately before the vote on the relocation.  None of

them voiced objection or challenged that premise or condition.  The actual relocation

resolution unanimously approved by the NFL owners, Resolution G-7, was not inconsistent

with the Raiders' statement.  The Raiders were not advised by anyone during or prior to

the vote that approval of the relocation was conditional in any respect. 

<P>

13.  As a result, an oral or implied-

in-law contract, supported by good and valid consideration, was formed providing that,

after the relocation of the Raiders to Oakland, the Raiders would not have to pay any

money, however denominated, to the NFL from, among other sources, seat licenses, club

seats, and maintenance fees, other than the Raiders had agreed to. 

<P>

14.  Defendants have breached that

contract by demanding payments from the Raiders, including portions of seat licenses,

club seat premiums, and maintenance fees, in violation of and inconsistent with the

terms of the contract. 

<P>

15.  The Raiders have and will suffer

damages from defendants' breach of contract in an amount presently unknown but which

will be established at the time of trial.

<H4>FIFTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF</H4>

(Tortious Interference with Economic Advantage By Raiders Against All Defendants except

Does 40-60) 

<P>

VI.    Plaintiff Raiders repeats and realleges paragraphs 1 through 5, 8 through 60 and

77 through 82 as though fully set forth herein. 

<P>

VII.  The letter of intent and the definitive agreements that provided for the

relocation of the Raiders to Oakland are  valid, lawful and  enforceable contracts. 

<P>

1.  Defendants were well aware of the letter of intent and definitive agreements and of

the Raiders' proposed relocation.  Both the Raiders and the Oakland Coliseum have in

good faith supplied the NFL with countless pages of documents and have given detailed

explanations to the NFL of the terms of the agreements. 

<P>

VIII.  Defendants have interfered with these agreements and the business relations of

and between the plaintiff and the Oakland Entities by approving the Raiders' relocation

to Oakland and then, the next day, purportedly making that unconditional approval

conditional upon payment by the Raiders and the Oakland Coliseum of illegal and

unreasonable fees to the NFL, through the improper application and misapplication of

unlawful NFL rules and through making false and improper statements to members of the

Oakland Coliseum Board of Directors.  The actions of the defendants were and are

knowing, intentional and willful. 

<P>

ti.  The actions taken by the

defendants delayed the performance of the letter of intent and definitive agreements,

created delays and uncertainties concerning performance of those agreements, and made

performance of the mutual obligations thereunder more difficult and less advantageous,

inter alia, by harming sales of tickets, personal seat licenses, club seats, and luxury

suites, which consequences and effects would not have occurred but for defendants'

actions. 

<P>

IX.  Defendants have no justification for intentionally interfering with the letter of

intent and definitive agreements or with plaintiffs' business relations with Oakland and

related entities. 

<P>

1.  Plaintiff has been injured by reason of this unlawful interference in an amount

presently unknown, but which will be proven at the time of trial.  Further, defendants'

conduct toward the Raiders has been oppressive and engaged in with an intent to injure,

vex and harass plaintiff and others.  Plaintiff is therefore entitled to an award of

exemplary damages in an amount sufficient to punish and to make an example of defendants

and each of them.

<H3>SIXTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF</H3>

(Tortious Interference with Economic Advantage) (By Oakland Entity Plaintiffs Against

All Defendants) 

<P>

2.   The Oakland Entities repeat and

reallege paragraphs 1 through 4, 6 through 18 and 77 through 81, and 102 through 106 as

though fully set forth herein. 

<P>

3.   The letter of intent and the

definitive agreements that provided for the relocation of the Raiders to Oakland are

valid, lawful and enforceable contracts. 

<P>

4.   Defendants were well aware of the

letter of intent and definitive agreements and of the Raiders' proposed relocation.  All

plaintiffs have, in good faith, supplied the NFL with documentation and have given

detailed explanations to the NFL concerning the terms of the agreements. 

<P>

5.   Defendants have interfered with

these agreements and the business relations of, and between, the Raiders and the Oakland

Entities by, on the one hand, approving the raiders' relocation to Oakland yet, on the

other hand, purporting to condition approval upon payment by the Raiders of the illegal

and unreasonable fees to the NFL, through the improper application of NFL rules and

through violations of contractual obligations. 

<P>

6.   The action taken by defendants

delayed performance of the letter of intent and the definitive agreements, has created

delays and uncertainties concerning further performance of those agreements, and has

made performance of the mutual obligations thereunder more difficult and less

advantageous, all to plaintiffs' damage. 

<P>

7.   Plaintiffs are informed and

believe that defendants have no justification or privilege for intentionally interfering

with the letter of intent or definitive agreements or with the pl<P>aintiffs' business

relationships. 



8.   Plaintiffs have been injured by

reason of this unlawful interference in an amount presently unknown but which will be

proven at trial.  Further, plaintiffs are informed and believe that defendants' conduct

toward plaintiffs has been malicious, oppressive, fraudulent and engaged in with an

intent to injure, vex and harass plaintiffs.  Plaintiffs are therefore entitled to an

award of exemplary damages in an amount sufficient to punish and to make an example of

defendants. 





<H4>SEVENTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF</H4>

(For Declaratory Relief Against All Defendants on Behalf of the Oakland Entities) 

<P>

9.   The Oakland entities repeat and

reallege paragraphs 1 through 60, 77 through 82 and 109 through 113 as though fully set

forth herein. 

<P>

10.  By this claim for relief, the

Oakland entities seek a judicial declaration that defendants are not entitled to share

in the revenues and other benefits that should otherwise flow to plaintiffs from their

definitive agreements with the Raiders. 

<P>

11.  The Oakland entities are informed

and believe that the defendants contend that gross receipts generated by the definitive

agreements are subject to "revenue sharing" under NFL Rules, By-Laws and resolutions.

The Oakland entities are also informed and believe that the Raiders have informed the

League of their intention not to share certain gross receipts generated by and through

the definitive agreements.  Further, based upon the terms of the definitive agreements

with the Raiders, defendants' efforts improperly to divert revenues from the Raiders

financially impacts the Oakland entities. 

<P>

12.  As a result, a ripe case or

controversy exists between these plaintiffs, on the one hand, and defendants on the

other, and the Oakland entities are entitled to declaratory relief that the Raiders have

no obligation to share with defendants the revenues generated from their transaction

with the Oakland entities with defendants and for such other relief as may be proper. 





<H4>EIGHTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF</H4>

(Breach of Fiduciary Duty)<BR>

(By the Raiders Against Tagliabue, Austrian, and Does 1-30)<P> 



13.  Plaintiff repeats and realleges

paragraphs 1 through 5 and 8 through 93 of this Complaint as though fully set forth

herein. 14.  Defendants owe a fiduciary duty to plaintiff as a member club to apply,

interpret, and enforce the purported Constitution, By-laws, and rules of the NFL in a

fair, consistent, and equitable manner. 

<P>

15.  Defendants have consistently

breached that duty by applying, interpreting, and enforcing such provisions in an

arbitrary, inconsistent, and discriminatory manner. 

<P>

16.  Far from an even-handed approach

to the league's purported rules, defendants have, without justification or good cause,

capriciously authorized exemptions and exceptions to the supposed rules for a coterie of

insiders, thereby creating for them opportunities for financial gain not available to

plaintiff.     

<P>

17.  To the contrary, defendants have

repeatedly targeted the Raiders for conduct allegedly in violation of NFL rules, while

waiving or ignoring similar or equivalent conduct on the part of other member clubs. 

<P>

18.  Plaintiff has been injured by

reason of these breaches of fiduciary duty in an amount presently unknown, but which

will be proven at the time of trial.  Further, defendants' conduct toward the Raiders

has been malicious and oppressive, and engaged in with an intent to injure, vex and

harass plaintiff and others. Plaintiff is therefore entitled to an award of exemplary

damages in an amount sufficient to punish and to make an example of defendants and each

of them. 



<H4>NINTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF</H4>

(Breach of Contract)<BR>

(By the Raiders Against Defendants Tagliabue and NFL) 

<P>

19.  Plaintiff repeats and realleges

paragraphs 1 through 5 and 8 through 60 of this Complaint as though fully set forth

herein. 

<P>

20.  As alleged in paragraphs 19 and

53(e) above, in or about June of 1995, the Raiders, through Allen Davis, and the NFL,

through its Commissioner, Paul Tagliabue, entered into an oral contract that, in

consideration of the Raiders' participating in the submission of their proposed

relocation to a vote of the NFL owners (contrary to the Raiders' contention that no such

submission or vote is or can lawfully be required), and in consideration of the Raiders'

not filing suit relating to the proposed relocation prior to the July 21, 1995 meeting

of NFL owners, any litigation arising out of the relocation would take place in the

Northern District of California. 

<P>

21.   The Raiders duly performed their

obligations under the contract by participating in the NFL meetings to discuss their

relocation to Oakland, by supplying the NFL with financial and other data and a fulsome

submission discussing the relocation, and by forebearing from any suit relating to the

relocation before said meetings. 

<P>

22.  Defendants, however, breached

their reciprocal commitment under the contract by ignoring the venue agreement and, on

August 31, 1995, initiating, or causing or participating in the initiation of,

litigation against the Raiders in the Central District of California relating to the

relocation. 

<P>

23.  As a result of defendants' breach

of contract, the Raiders have been damaged, inter alia, by incurring costs and fees to

participate in and to seek the transfer of the action wrongfully filed in the Central

District of California.  The amount of such damages is not presently known but will be

established at the time of trial. 





<H4>TENTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF</H4>

(Breach of the Implied Covenant of

Good Faith and Fair Dealing)<br>

(By the Raiders Against All Defendants except Does 40-60) 

<P>

24.  Plaintiff repeats and realleges

paragraphs 1 through 5, 8 through 107 and 126 through 129 of this Complaint as though

fully set forth herein. 

<P>

25.  The purported Constitution, By-

laws, and other agreements between the member clubs contain an implied covenant of good

faith and fair dealing. 

<P>

26.  By engaging in the conduct

referred to in paragraphs 19 and 45 through 53, 62 through 70, 78 through 82, 88 through

93, and 110 through 111 of this Complaint, defendants have violated their obligations

under the implied covenant.          

<P>

27.  Plaintiff has been injured by

reason of these breaches of the covenant in an amount presently unknown, but which will

be proven at the time of trial. 



<P>

<H4>ELEVENTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF</H4>

(Negligence and Mismanagement)<br>

(By the Raiders Against Defendants

Tagliabue, Austrian, NFL and Does 1-30, 40-49) 



<P>

28.  Plaintiff repeats and realleges

paragraphs 1 through 5 and 8 through 19 of this Complaint as though fully set forth

herein. 

<P>

29.  The World League is an affiliated

entity of the NFL.  Prior to 1995, member clubs could, but did not have to, participate

in profits and losses from World League operations.  

<P>

30.  In 1991 and 1992, Tagliabue,

Austrian and certain NFL employees had negligently operated and managed the World League

and thereby caused the member clubs to incur huge losses and to be exposed to

preventable liabilities.  This mismanagement consisted, inter alia, of hiring cronies at

great expense, failing to supervise and control those executives who ran up massive

expense accounts, entering into deficient franchise agreements with World League clubs

that gave operating control to the clubs but left liability with the NFL, and using the

NFL member clubs' money to settle with the disgruntled World League owners.  Those

losses became so overwhelming that the participating member clubs voted to suspend World

League operations after the 1992 season. 

<P>

31.  In 1995, the World League resumed

playing professional football after a three-year hiatus. At the time the member clubs

were considering the revival of the World League, the Raiders proposed that, instead of

resurrecting the discredited World League that did not appear financially viable, the

NFL should establish a series of high quality retail stores overseas to accomplish the

NFL's stated objective of increasing sales of NFL merchandise in foreign countries. 

However, defendants negligently and inaccurately assured the Raiders and other member

clubs that they would be fully in control of World League operations, that there would

be no repeat of the losses previously suffered on account of the World League, that the

World League would be well-run by them, that they had professional financial

projections, and that the World League would operate at a profit, and that the World

League would more profitably and certainly accomplish the objective of increased sales

of merchandise. 

<P>

32.  By making the statements and

giving the assurances referred to above, defendants intended the member clubs to rely on

them in deciding to revive the World League, and defendants deprived the member clubs of

their right and opportunity to discuss and decide that matter based upon full and

accurate information.  The member clubs relied upon defendants' assurances in reviving

the World League, and, but for those representations of defendants, the member clubs

would not have approved the revival of the World League.    

<P>

33.  The Raiders were opposed to the

revival of the World League as proposed by Tagliabue and other NFL officials, and the

Raiders stated that they would not be part of any such endeavor, electing to opt-out as

other members clubs had done in the past.  Tagliabue, however, made the decision that

the Raiders had no choice in the matter and were compelled to be participants in this

newest venture.  

<P>

34.  Due to their representations and

the positions of responsibility they held and assumed with respect to the World League,

defendants had a duty to act reasonably, professionally and with due care and

consideration for the financial interests of the Raiders and other member clubs, which

would have to bear any World League losses. 

<P>

35.  Further, under the circumstances,

defendants owed the highest duty of care and loyalty to the Raiders and the other member

clubs to ensure that their representations were accurate, that risks and potential risks

were fully and forthrightly disclosed, and that the World League  activities  would be

well-managed and all necessary steps taken to protect the financial interests of the

Raiders and other member clubs.  Defendants also owed a duty fully to account to all

member clubs concerning the economic details of World League  activities. 

<P>

36.  Despite these duties, defendants

negligently managed, operated and supervised the World League in 1995, once again hiring

friends to run the World League, and then making significant management changes,

diverting millions of dollars that would otherwise have been available to the NFL from

sponsors into the World League despite the promise that the World League would not cost

the member clubs any money, failing to obtain a television contract for the London

franchise, and failing to control its financial operations generally. 

<P>

37.  As a direct result of such

negligence and mismanagement, the Raiders have incurred and will incur substantial

monetary losses from World League activities in 1995 in amounts unknown but which will

be determined at the time of trial. 



<H3>TWELFTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF</H3>

(By the Raiders For An Accounting Against Tagliabue, Austrian, NFL and Does 1-39)<P> 



38.  Plaintiff repeats and realleges

paragraphs 134 through 142 of this Complaint as though fully set forth. 

<P>

39.  Defendants have asserted that the

Raiders and the other member clubs are obligated to share the substantial losses

incurred by the NFL from or in connection with the operation of the World League.

However, defendants have refused to provide a detailed financial accounting, or any

meaningful accounting, to plaintiff and other member clubs of the losses and potential

losses incurred from World League operations. 

<P>

40.  Defendants have also failed to

provide to plaintiff and other member clubs an accounting for the losses supposedly

suffered by the World League from 1991 through 1993, which they have been required to

bear, including, without limitation, an explanation as to how much was paid to close

down the World League operations, how much was paid to settle contractual claims arising

from World League operations, and how much was paid to former NFL employees who had been

hired to work for the World League. 

<P>

41.  Over the past several years,

plaintiff and other member clubs were repeatedly told that the NFL was attempting to

finalize an accounting and that the member clubs would be provided with an accounting

when it was ready.        

<P>

42.  The refusal to provide these

accountings is without any justification. 

<P>

43.  Plaintiff is entitled to a full

and complete accounting of World League operations, finances and losses for the 1991,

1992, and 1995 seasons. 





<H3>THIRTEENTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF</H3>

(Breach of Fiduciary Duty)<br>

(By the Raiders Against Tagliabue, Austrian, and Does 1- 10, 50-59) 

<P>

44.  Plaintiff repeats and realleges

paragraphs 1 through 5, 8 through 60 and 135 through 142 of this Complaint as though

fully set forth herein. 45.  Properties is a corporation organized and existing under

the laws of the State of California.  The sole shareholders are the member clubs,

including plaintiff.  The member clubs share the profits and losses of Properties. 

Properties asserts and functions as if it controls the trademarks of the NFL and all

member clubs, including the Raiders.  Properties also asserts that it controls the

marketing of merchandise bearing those trademarks, and it is charged with protecting and

furthering the financial interests of the member clubs. For many years, the Raiders were

the standard-bearer in sales for Properties.  The Raiders were the leader in merchandise

sales, and in some years accounted for as much as 30% of the total merchandise sold by

Properties.  All of the income generated by these sales of Raider merchandise was shared

equally among the member clubs. 

<P>

46.  In November 1990, Tagliabue

altered pre-existing procedures under which various rotating member clubs directed

Properties, and instead dictated that Properties report directly and exclusively to his

office.  Since that time, Tagliabue and other NFL officials and employees have had

responsibility and authority over Properties' activities. 

<P>

47.  Due to the duties and positions

of responsibility they held and assumed in connection with Properties and the NFL, and

their conduct, defendants owed a fiduciary obligation to the Raiders and other member

clubs. 

<P>

48.  The Raiders and other member

clubs put their trust and confidence in defendants to be candid and truthful,

professional and diligent, in the exercise of all of their duties for Properties, and,

as fiduciaries, defendants owed the Raiders and other member clubs the highest duty of

care, loyalty and candor. 

<P>

49.   Allegations have arisen that,

while Properties was being directly managed by defendants, a former president, vice

president and other officers of Properties usurped certain corporate opportunities of

Properties and that certain of Properties' employees have engaged in other untoward

activity, all to the apparent economic detriment of plaintiff and other member clubs. 

<P>

50.  After such allegations and

scandal became public, some of the implicated Properties' officers and employees were

fired, and the Office of the United States Attorney has obtained various indictments.

Nonetheless, some of these same employees who were fired in the wake of the scandal

have, with the knowledge and encouragement of defendants, continued to do business with

the NFL and continued to enjoy NFL privileges, including, without limitation, Super Bowl

tickets, attendance at League parties, member clubs' locker rooms, and other

perquisites.  Despite plaintiff's requests, defendants have failed to provide any

meaningful explanation for this state of affairs.      

<P>

51.  Although reports have been

prepared concerning these activities at Properties, including a report by an outside

consulting group, and although defendants have acknowledged to plaintiff that the

reports contain evidence of gross misdeeds, they have failed and refused to provide

copies of the report to plaintiff, even though plaintiff and the other member clubs may

be called upon to bear the resulting losses.          

<P>

52.  As one part of the duties they

owed to the Raiders and other member clubs, defendants had a responsibility to provide a

full and complete explanation and accounting of the conduct of the former employees of

Properties and an explanation of the financial impact of their activity.  To date,

defendants have refused to send copies of their reports or investigation to plaintiff or

other League members, even though the League members own Properties. 

<P>

53.  As part of its functions,

Properties, in addition, licenses the manufacture of apparel and other goods bearing the

logo or logos of member clubs, prepares and distributes catalogues of merchandise of

member clubs, works with merchandise manufacturers on advertising, designs and places

advertising, recruits NFL players to endorse Properties' licensed merchandise, and

generally promotes the image and visibility of all member clubs.  

<P>

54.   However, under their management

and operation of Properties, defendants have acted in such a manner as to devalue the

Raider color scheme, minimize and curtail advertisements featuring Raider players and

logo, and de-emphasize the desirability of Raider merchandise, through, in part, giving

away the Raiders' colors to other member clubs without the Raiders' permission, limiting

production of Raider merchandise, curtailing promotion of Raider players and the Raiders

and the team's merchandise.  Such conduct has and has had an adverse economic impact on

the Raiders, inter alia, through decreased ticket sales and decreased revenues for

advertising and sponsorships. 

<P>

55.   In addition, under their

management and operation of Properties, defendants have, without justification and for

no reasonable or valid business reason, rejected highly lucrative offers for the

manufacture of goods bearing the logos of member teams, in favor of much less lucrative

offers from, in some cases, unsuccessful and financially insolvent manufacturers, with

consequent loss of profits for Properties and the member clubs, including plaintiff,

which own Properties and share its profits. 

<P>

56.  Defendants have further

demonstrated their mismanagement of and/or loss of control over Properties by, inter

alia, hiring law firms, secretly preparing lawsuits and suing a member club allegedly

without the involvement of Tagliabue, making trips to attempt to enter into contracts

with potential sponsors, all in secret from the member clubs, and in this connection

using at least one representative whose club is currently violating Properties' rules. 

<P>

57.  Additionally, Properties has made

deals with manufacturers whereby Properties has taken less money for member clubs in

order to divert money into the ill-fated World League venture.  To accomplish its

agenda, Properties has turned down larger dollar contracts from manufacturers who did

not want to participate in the World League and given guarantees to the manufacturers

who would participate in the plan that they would not grant licenses to competing

manufacturers. 

<P>

58.  As a direct result of the

foregoing misconduct and breaches of fiduciary duty, plaintiff has been injured in an

amount presently unknown but at least $100 million which will be established at the time

of trial.  

<P>

59.  Further, defendants' conduct

toward the Raiders has been oppressive and engaged in with an intent to injure, vex and

harass plaintiff and others. Plaintiff is therefore entitled to an award of exemplary

damages in an amount sufficient to punish and to make an example of defendants and each

of them. 

<P>

60.  Plaintiff is also entitled to an

accounting of the activity at Properties and of its financial impact. 





<H3>FOURTEENTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF</H3>

(Negligence and Mismanagement)<BR>

(By the Raiders Against Tagliabue, Austrian, and Does 1- 10, 50-59) 

<P>

61.  Plaintiff repeats and realleges

paragraphs 150 through 152 and 155 through 163 as though fully set forth herein. 

<P>

62.  In performing their

responsibilities in connection with Properties, defendants owed a duty to the Raiders

and other member clubs to act reasonably, professionally and with due care and

consideration for their financial interests.   

<P>

63.  Among other obligations,

defendants owed a duty to the Raiders and other member clubs adequately to manage and

supervise the activities of Properties and its personnel, and to ensure that Properties

was properly and professionally operated to protect the financial interests and

reputations of the member clubs. 

<P>

64.  Defendants were negligent and

breached those duties through the acts, omissions, and mismanagement described in

paragraphs 155 through 163 of this Complaint. 

<P>

65.  As a direct result of the

foregoing negligence and mismanagement, plaintiff has been injured in an amount

presently unknown but at least $100 million which will be established at the time of

trial. 





<H3>FIFTEENTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF</H3>

(Civil Conspiracy)<br>

(By All Plaintiffs Against All Defendants) 

<P>

66.  Plaintiffs repeat and reallege

paragraphs 1 through 171 as though fully set forth herein. 

<P>

67. Each of the defendants

participated in the above-described concerted action and conspiracy and took and/or

participated in the furtherance of the wrongful and tortious acts described above. 

<P>

68.  Each of the acts of the

defendants set forth above were taken knowlingly and in furtherance of the joint

agreements, concerted action and/or conspiracy between and among the defendants. 

<P>

69.  As the direct and proximate

result of the conspiracy and concerted action detailed herein, plaintiffs have suffered

damages, as set forth above. 

<P>

70.  The acts of the defendants were

outrageous and were taken with evil motive and/or with reckless indifference to the

rights of others. 



<H3>PRAYER FOR RELIEF</H3>



WHEREFORE, plaintiffs pray that this

Court enter

judgment against the defendants providing for relief as follows: 

<P>

relocation constitute an unlawful restraint on trade and commerce in violation of

violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act; 

<P>

3.   Permanently enjoin and restrain

the defendants, as well as their agents, employees and representatives and those in

active concert with the defendants who receive actual notice of this Court's order, from
