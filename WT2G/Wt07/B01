<dd>The Global Community Guidebook is an entryway to economic and community development resources across the

<dd>To assist the Network it its efforts, the Department of Economic Development's Public Information Office began compiling lists of development programs generally centered around the Department's main divisions: <A HREF="http://www.ded.state.ne.us/assist/assist.html">Existing Business Assistance</a>, <A HREF="http://www.ded.state.ne.us/industry/recruit.html">Business Recruitment</a>, <A HREF="http://www.ded.state.ne.us/crd/crd.html">Community and Rural Development</a>, <A HREF="http://www.ded.state.ne.us/tourism.html">Travel and Tourism</a>.
<dd>Wherever possible, this electronic version of the Guidebook contains interactive links to persons through their Email addresses, and to programs through World Wide Web home pages on the Internet. Thus, when you see a program you wish to know more about, you may contact the persons involved using the phone numbers or FAX numbers provided. Email addresses, when known, also are included.

<B>Registration Deadline for Nebraska Edge Courses nears</B>
</CENTER></FONT>
LINCOLN (JAN 7, 1997)  - Entrepreneurs interested in small business training
should quickly register for the next Nebraska Edge Entrepreneurial Training
Course to be offered in their area.  <B>This once a year course will be begin
in January or February of 1997</B> (depending upon the location).  The course
will help individuals build a small business management team and learn the
financial skills necessary to run a successful small business.

Running a business is a continual challenge, no matter who you are, or how
much experience you have. Yet many people say that one of their dreams is to
own their own business. What better way for you reach that dream than to
take a course that will help you successfully developed a business plan and
guide you through the business start-up.

The 40 hours of instruction are designed to enable participants to do create
a marketing strategy, conduct a cashflow analysis, create an income
statement and balance sheet and produce a business plan - all catered to
your specific business. <B>The course is for those thinking of expansion, as
well as those considering a business startup.</B>

The program, now in its fourth year has assisted more than 500 entrepreneurs
with business start and expansion.  In a 1995 confidential survey conducted
of first year participants, participants indicated that since they enrolled
in the Nebraska Edge course, 55% opted to expand their businesses and 11%
decided to start a business. Additionally, after taking the course, not
everyone's business idea was found feasible and 34% decided not to expand or
start the business. In many instances, the community sponsored course has
helped start a local business but conversely, has also saved a person's
income from a business failure.

The <B>course will be offered in nine locations throughout Nebraska.</B>  Although
cost of the course varies per location, the average course cost is $200. All
course instructors are small business owners and/or individuals with a small
business experience and background.

<H1><CENTER>Workshops share ways to finance affordable housing</CENTER></H1>
<DD>LINCOLN (Jan. 10, 1996)_A series of workshops will teach community housing leaders how to bridge the gap between what private lending institutions can profitably finance and the actual cost of housing.<BR>
<DD>"The key to any successful affordable housing development is to identify and secure the appropriate resources," said Julie Jordan Hendricks, housing coordinator for the Nebraska Department of Economic Development.<BR>
<DD>The Federal Home Loan Bank of Topeka and the Nebraska Housing Partnership Inc., is offering the workshops titled "The Economics of Community Development and Housing," in Ogallala, Norfolk and Lincoln. <BR>
<DD>Housing development experts from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Topeka and the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City will share methods for finding resources that fill financing gaps in housing development. The workshop will focus on financial issues, development tools, available resources and actual case studies related to developing affordable housing projects.
Hendricks said that leaders from Nebraska's communities experiencing a housing shortage should benefit from the workshop, as well as lenders, realtors, nonprofit housing officials, builders and developers. <BR>
<DD> Participants will learn how partnerships help build affordable housing; how to identify financing gaps; what kinds of financing resources exist and how these resources can be used separately or pooled with other resources; how lenders can profitably participate in financing affordable housing while satisfying lending criteria; and how to analyze housing development projects in their own communities. They also will receive a notebook containing state and federal government resources for housing along with the names, addresses and telephone numbers of program administrators. Dates and locations of the workshops are:<UL>

<LI>Tuesday, Jan. 21, 8 am (mountain standard time) Ogallala_Best Western Stagecoach Inn</LI>

<LI>Thursday, Jan. 25, 8 am (central standard time) Norfolk_Northeast Community College</LI>

<H1><CENTER>Recycling creates 66 jobs in Nebraska in first half of 1995</CENTER></H1>
<BODY>

<dd>LINCOLN (Jan. 15, 1996) -- Gov. Ben Nelson today announced that a state survey has found that 66 jobs were created in 12 recycling entities in Nebraska during the first half of 1995. One company alone created 16 full-time positions. The survey was conducted by the Nebraska Department of Economic Development's (DED) Recycling Economic Development Advocate (REDA) program with assistance from the Nebraska Chapter of the Service Corps of Retired Executives (SCORE).<br> 
<dd>"We're excited to see an increasing number of jobs created within Nebraska's newest, fast-growing recyclables industry," Nelson said. "Equally encouraging is that this industry is creating a wide-ranging job marke--from positions for low-to-semi-skilled workers to engineers and chemists." <BR>            
<dd>In addition, 13 recycling companies invested $3.5 million in new capital during the same time, bringing to 16 the recycling companies that either invested new capital and/or created new jobs in Nebraska during the first half of 1995. Surveys were mailed to 34 recycling companies and associations statewide and  28 responded. Among Nebraska's growing recycling companies surveyed were Sandhill Plastics, Inc. of Kearney, which converts plastic milk jugs into lumber; Midland Recycling of Lincoln, which collects and processes recyclables; and Greenstone Industries of Norfolk, which converts old newspapers into cellulose insulation.<BR>
<dd><A HREF="mailto:kimberly@ded1.ded.state.ne.us">Kim Newell</a>, coordinator of Nebraska's REDA program, said the use of recyclable materials in the manufacturing process is gaining wider acceptance due in part to higher land costs; a shortage of available landfill space; increasing concerns about air and water pollution and decreasing natural resources; and high costs associated with cleaning up garbage and replacing natural resources. <BR>
<dd>"These costs are beginning to hit consumers and manufacturers in the form of escalating landfill fees and increasing prices on products and services not using recyclable materials," Newell said. "With the development of advanced equipment and improved collection systems, the quality and quantity of recyclable materials is improving; new technologies and research and development efforts are finding new uses for recyclables; and manufacturers are realizing the benefits of recyclables over their current virgin feedstock."<BR>
<dd>The study revealed materials collected, processed and/or used in manufacturing increased by 19,500 tons from the first half of 1994 to the first half of 1995. According to a recent study published by the Nebraska State Recycling Association (NSRA), the volume of materials recycled in 1994 was 232,586 ton--up 41 percent from 1993. <BR>
<dd>"Assuming that the growth rate for the second half of 1995 remains steady, we can expect to recycle a record 271,586 tons of material for the entire year, based on the findings of our survey participants," Newell said. "When we add in collection programs not included in the survey, this number could increase significantly." <BR> 
<dd>The survey was developed to document and record the volume of recyclable materials diverted from landfills and used to manufacture new products and to provide a base for measuring employment and capital investment in Nebraska's recycling industry, said Newell. The information will be used in determining the economic impact of the recycling industry in Nebraska. Initiated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, REDA supports the growth of recycling businesses and the creation of jobs. <BR>
<dd>Nebraska's REDA program focuses on recycling market development as a job creation and economic development strategy. The Nebraska program was initiated in 1995 by DED, in cooperation with other government and private agencies, including the Department of Environmental Quality, the Department of Administrative Services, the Nebraska Energy Office, the Nebraska State Recycling Association and SCORE.<BR><BR><BR>

<BODY>         

<Dd>LINCOLN (Jan. 24, 1996)--People who want to work as summer vacation guides have until Feb. 16 to complete and return applications to the Nebraska State Personnel office for interview consideration. Vacation guides work from Memorial Day to Labor Day at Interstate 80 visitor centers, Nebraska Game and Parks offices in Omaha and Wildcat Hills in Gering and the Sergeant Floyd Riverboat Welcome Center and Museum in Sioux City, Iowa.<BR>
<Dd>The positions are offered through the Nebraska Vacation Guide program which has been in operation for more than 20 years. The program is managed by the Nebraska Department of Economic Development's Travel and Tourism Division.<BR>
<Dd>Applicants must be high school graduate age or older. "Traditionally, vacation guides have been college students, but we have seen an increasing number of  senior citizens and 'empty-nest' parents  selected for the program," said Dave Miller, program manager.<BR>
<Dd>Applicants also must have reliable transportation to and from and live near the center or office they work in. Once hired, they must be certified in CPR before beginning their jobs. All selected staff will be offered the opportunity to participate in a seven day training tour of western Nebraska before beginning work on Memorial Day weekend.<BR>
<Dd>"We can't emphasize enough the important role our vacation guides play in the vitality of the state's third leading industry, tourism," Miller said. "Each summer, these guides are responsible for keeping $8 million within Nebraska's borders primarily due to their enthusiasm, sales ability, and knowledge of state attractions, events and facilities." <BR>

<H1><CENTER>Community Builders explore priority housing needs</CENTER></H1>
<BODY>

<dd>CHAPPELL (Jan. 29, 1996)--Solving a critical demand for housing in Nebraska's Southern Panhandle was the priority of individuals attending the Community Builders meeting in Lodgepole on Monday, Jan. 15. The 25 participants from Kimball, Cheyenne and Deuel counties identified a variety of housing to meet the needs of individuals, couples and families in all age and income brackets--from homes for purchase, and apartment and home rentals to affordable housing for rent or purchase, independent apartments for seniors, and dependent care quarters for disabled and elderly individuals<br> 
<dd>The group discussed ways to involve community, business and non-profit leaders, private investors, economic developers and local government officials throughout the southern panhandle region in partnering to finance new housing projects. The advantages to establishing such a partnership included pooling grants, sharing workloads, regional resources and contractors, and qualifying for available quantity discounts. Before the meeting, the group toured the community, stopping at Lodgepole Restoration and the Lodgepole Blacksmith Shop.<BR>
<dd>Lodgepole Restoration, an antique automobile restoration business specializing in makes and models through 1964, is owned and operated by Ken Way and sons. The Ways work on automobiles from around the country, relying on satisfied customers to advertise their business. They estimated they have two years of projects lined up. Donald Messing, owner of the Lodgepole Blacksmith Shop, started up his forge and demonstrated several machines used in repairing farm equipment and constructing parts. The group also drove by the old opera house, public library, elementary and high schools and the First State Bank of Lodgepole.<BR>
<dd>Following dinner at the First United Methodist Church, Bob Davis, principal, grades K-12, Lodgepole School District, presented a brief history of Lodgepole and Ken Disney spoke about his 1,600-acre certified organic farm operation, where he grows and locally markets alfalfa, clover and sunflower sprouts. Bob Manley, Jr., gave a presentation on mapping community capacity and Ward Schrack reported on fund-raising efforts. First State Bank of Lodgepole will serve as depository.  The next meeting is schedule for Monday, Feb. 19 in Sidney.<BR>
<dd>Established in 1991, <a href="http://www.ded.state.ne.us/rdc/rdc.html">Community Builders</a> is a process that increases rural communities' capacities for job creation, business development and financial support by identifying and encouraging local emergent entrepreneurs and potential community leaders. The process, which incorporates features such as vision building, community tours, presentations, small group activities and networking, lets participants choose their own courses for learning about, and developing skills related to, specific economic development activities in their communities.<BR>
<dd>Participants get to know each other while attending a series of workshops. They tour one another's communities, identify key issues affecting their region, learn from each others' successful and not-so-successful projects, and build networks that help them make changes in their own communities. Graduates recruit new participants for each subsequent year's module. Currently the number of modules statewide is five, with two additional groups being formed. The expansion is being funded, in part, by a grant from the Omaha World-Herald Foundation. The changes in people's attitudes and creative problem-solving skills that result from this process, motivates participants to promote real change in their communities and regions. The result is sustainable, local economic development.<BR>

<H1><CENTER>Main Street Program adds design service</CENTER></H1>
<BODY>

<dd>LINCOLN (Jan. 31. 1996) -- Keith Dubas has been hired as a staff architect by the Nebraska Lied Main Street Program which provides selected communities with comprehensive technical assistance in leadership development, historic preservation and economic revitalization. Dubas will assist building owners with facade improvements which respect their historic character in the state's designated Main Street communities of Wakefield, Fremont, Red Cloud, Alliance, Ogallala, Minden and Gothenburg.<BR>
<dd>The design service helps owners and merchants identify potential improvements to their buildings.  The process will include an initial meeting with the building owner / merchant, a review of historical data, a walkthrough of the building and a discussion of budget and phasing.  This will result in a design proposal presented in a concept illustration. Alternate design schemes for building awnings, color schemes, signage and lighting also will be provided.  All of these are to be consistent with the communities' design guidelines.  Since the service is limited to conceptual proposals for improving the appearance of the building, owners requiring or requesting more extensive service will be directed to other professionals. The initial concept design will cost $75 with options for additional work priced at $25 each.<BR>
<dd>"This service is being offered to Main Street communities because it has been shown that every dollar invested in facade improvements generates, on average, $5 more in business income," Dubas said.  "Storefronts play a critical role in a merchant's advertising and merchandising campaign.  The image projected for the store by its facade attracts customers and increases business."<BR>
<dd>Building owners and merchants interested in this assistance can contact their local Main Street managers. Partners in the Nebraska Main Street effort are the College of Architecture, the Nebraska Department of Economic Development, the Nebraska Department of Roads, the Nebraska State Historical Society and the National Main Street Center.<BR>
<dd>A Nebraska native, Dubas received his architecture education at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.  He is a registered architect in Nebraska as well as in New York where he worked for eight years on a variety of historic preservation projects.  He returned to Lincoln in 1991 and consulted with several architectural firms and maintained a private practice.<BR>

<H1><CENTER>Top 10 and Outstanding 100 Rural Development <BR>Initiatives announced</CENTER></H1>
<BODY>


<dd>LINCOLN (Feb. 5, 1996) -- The Nebraska Rural Development Commission has released its 1995 report containing Nebraska's Top 10 and Outstanding 100 Rural Development Initiatives from nominations received statewide.  Award winners will be receiving plaques and certificates of recognition.<BR>
<dd>"Celebrating successes statewide is important in developing 'One Nebraska'," said Commission Director Don Macke. "This report celebrates and shares the diversity of development initiatives and projects occurring in the Cornhusker State."  The commission, which has honored Nebraska's Top 10 and Outstanding 100 Rural Development Initiatives since 1993, announced the following honorees:<BR>
<H3>Top 10 Rural Development Initiatives</H3><UL>
<li>The Cowboy Trail, Norfolk to Chadron -- The 250-mile hiking and biking recreation trail is located in the northern Sandhills between Norfolk to the east and Merriman to the west. The trail is being developed on an abandoned Northern Railroad Line and when completed, will be the longest rails-to-trails conversion in the U.S.</li>
<li>The Harold E. Edgerton Education Center, Aurora -- The $2.3 million center, named for Nebraska native Harold "Doc" Edgerton, was opened September 8, 1995. Edgerton was a world-renowned scientist and educator who opened up new vistas of scientific discovery with his hands-on approach to learning and experiments. Center staff hope to continue his tradition of sharing scientific discovery by offering visitors interactive displays and do-it-yourself exhibits. </li>
<li>The Kimball Renaissance Project, Kimball -- This action plan is the result of a 3-year effort among residents interested in Kimball's future. The plan targets community leadership development through personal enrichment, community enhancement and economic development. The overall goal is to improve the quality of life and ensure the survival of rural communities. </li>
<li>The Lady Vestey Festival, Superior -- The festival, created to celebrate the town's history, was named after Superior native Evelyn Broadstone who became famous in the 1920s for her success as the "world's highest-paid woman executive" and later, for her marriage to Great Britain's Lord William Vestey. Throughout her life, she sent gifts and money to her hometown, never forgetting her roots.</li>
<li>The Nebraska Community Foundation -- The foundation was created in 1993 to help Nebraska's communities put charitable giving to work in supporting community betterment through economic development. </li>
<li>The Partnership for Rural Nebraska -- The Partnership is a cooperative commitment of the State of Nebraska, the University of Nebraska, the federal government and other entities to address rural opportunities and challenges identified by Nebraska's rural citizens. Together, the Partnership has the potential to leverage additional funds and more effectively use existing resources for the benefit of rural Nebraska.</li>
<li>School at the Center -- This initiative helps rural communities and schools work together to revitalize and maintain communities by teaching students about local issues, history and culture as well as other subjects.</li>
<li>The Stapleton Youth Center, Stapleton -- This one-of-a-kind center is owned and operated by Stapleton's youth. The youth purchased a vacant bowling lanes business and renovated it into a center with dance floor, game room, snack bar and television viewing area. The center, which also serves as a recycling center, is rented out for receptions and reunions.</li>
<li>The Turfgrass Producers International Convention, Mead -- A 1995 convention and field days at Todd Valley Farms in Mead was the result of four days of planning by community and business leaders, local service organization representatives and students. A record 850 individuals from 16 countries attended the conference.</li>
<li>WILDFLOWER '95 -- A partnership between the Nebraska Department of Roads, Highway 20 Association, Nebraska Wildflower Society, Nebraska Division of Travel and Tourism, Panhandle RC&D, North Central RC&D, Nebraska Loess Hills RC&D, Northeast Nebraska RC&D, private sponsors and local volunteers, led to the production of a book and map which highlight specific wildflower locations along Highway 20. The project has helped create a new awareness about Nebraska's native wildflowers.</UL>

<H1><CENTER>National Dynamics divisions achieve ISO 9001 certification</CENTER></H1>
<BODY>

<dd>LINCOLN (Feb. 7, 1996) -- Nebraska Boiler and Energy Recovery International, two divisions of Lincoln's National Dynamics Corp., have been awarded the International Standard Organization (ISO) 9001 certification, an internationally-recognized standard for quality management systems. The certification will be awarded Feb. 9 at 8:30 am at the divisions' offices, 7000 Cornhusker Highway. Bill Wolfe, vice president, Hartford Engineering Services will make the presentation. ISO 9001 certification essentially guarantees global recognition of the world-class quality business program of these two divisions. Nebraska Boiler, in operation since 1921, manufactures water tube boilers and related equipment. Energy Recovery International produces waste heat recovery units. The two divisions,  employ 225 people.<BR>
<dd> "We are pleased to have achieved this worldwide recognition of our commitment to quality," said Roger Swanson, company president. "This certification covers business processes, such as design, manufacturing, testing and customer service which are key to providing our customers with quality products manufactured through consistent processes."<BR>
<dd>The certification process requires an independent, accredited registrar to conduct an indepth audit of a candidate's quality program, verifying successful implementation to the selected ISO 9000 requirements. The certification was performed by HSB Registration Services, a division of the Engineering Department of the Hartford Steam Boiler and Inspection Company, headquartered in Hartford, Conn. The ISO 9000 series of standards for quality management and quality assurance, published by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in Geneva, Switzerland, have been adopted by more than 100 countries. These standards are recognized throughout the world as a benchmark of companies possessing the best in quality business practices.<BR>
<dd>"We're happy that Nebraska Boiler and Energy Recovery International have joined the growing number of Nebraska manufacturers becoming ISO certified," said Steve Duvall of DED's Existing Business Division., who helped connect the divisions with an ISO certification information group. "The numbers clearly show that Nebraska firms recognize certification is the ticket to gaining worldwide acceptance for their quality products and services. It also demonstrates that Nebraska firms are world-class competitors." <BR><center>

<H1><CENTER>Nebraska RAMBO program picked as national model</CENTER></H1>
<B><BODY>
<dd>LINCOLN (Feb. 7,1996) -- After an extremely competitive selection process, Nebraska's Rural Allied Medical Business Occupations (RAMBO) program has been selected by Structured Employment Economic Development Corporation (Seedco) as one of five national models for training low-income people for health care careers.  Other similar programs are located in Philadelphia, Pittsburgh and two in New York City's Bronx area.<br>
<dd>Seedco, a national nonprofit organization which supports community-based efforts to revitalize low-income neighborhoods, will use the Nebraska program's experience to shape its own efforts to support cornmunity-based employment and economic development efforts.<br>
<dd>RAMBO was started in Grand Island as a collaborative effort of the Department of Labor's Nebraska Job Training program, Central Community College, St. Francis Medical Center, and the Nebraska departments of Social Services and Education.<br>
<dd>In 1991, the program was expanded to provide training to low-income people throughout Nebraska.  Program sponsorship was expanded to include the Department of Health, community action agencies and the Nebraska Community College system, with staffing provided by the Nebraska Department of Economic Development (DED).<br>
<dd>"More than 120 people have been trained and several more are currently in training.  The typical participant was earning $5,200 prior to training, and earning $17,000 the first year after training," said DED Director Maxine B. Moul.  "Moreover, the improvements in the participants' self-esteem were impressive.  The results for the program participants and their families have been positive and dramatic."<br>
<dd>Seedco provides technical assistance, operational grants and loan financing.  It also fosters partnerships between community-based organizations and institutions such as hospitals and colleges.  These partnerships are intended to stimulate housing and commercial development, small business and employment creation, and community leadership development.<br>
<dd>Research on RAMBO and similar programs was conducted under a grant from the national Annie E. Casey Foundation as part of its growing interest in the field of "Income, Work, and Opportunity."<br>
<dd>The report documents innovative programs in the health care sector that serve low-income, hard-to-employ adults and which provide decent jobs, career advancement, job mobility, job security or growth opportunities for small businesses.<br>
<dd>Also discussed in the report are major issues confronted by programs such as RAMBO as well as opportunities for foundations and other funders to provide support.<BR>

<H1><CENTER>Future growth tied to technology, regional cooperation</CENTER></H1>
<BODY>

     
<dd>CARROLL (Feb. 12, 1996) -- Technology already is in place that can accomplish greater economic and community development in Northeast Nebraska, said Ted Teiman, guest speaker at the Jan. 22 Northeast Community Builders meeting in Carroll.  But for sustainable development to occur, he added, there must be a strong network of regional cooperation in place. Teiman is the retired founder of the Petersberg Telephone Co., and a member of the Cornhusker Community Builders. He spoke to a group of 30 teachers, Realtors, bankers, chamber of commerce officials and others who make up the Northeast Nebraska Community Builders. The participants reside in Allen, Carroll, Concord, Dixon, Laurel, Pilger, Wakefield, Wayne, Winside and Wisner.<BR>
<dd>"Individually, our communities possess the financial, environmental, human and social capital assets necessary to be successful. But in working together with tools, such as Internet, we have the potential for phenomenal global growth," Teiman said. "For example, 388 people reside in and around Petersberg, but 144 work outside the area. Petersberg is actually a suburb or neighborhood of Albion. If Albion prospers, Petersberg prospers. If Albion creates jobs, Petersberg's economy also benefits. Our role is to create jobs and understand that we are part of a much larger community."<BR>
<dd>Following Teiman's presentation, builders met in small groups to discuss ways to forge partnerships in the use of technology. They examined how area high schools with Internet capabilities could be linked; how Internet training could be offered to businesses regionally; and how communities could take advantage of Wayne's new Internet node where residents can now dial up the Internet locally from their home and business computers.<BR>
<dd>Before the meeting, the group toured TWJ farms, an operation that raises and currently maintains about 360,000 laying hens, and packages more than 7.5 million dozens of eggs, primarily for distribution at Waldbaum's in nearby Wakefield. TWJ, which employs more than 20 people, also grinds its own chicken feed from local corn, mixing it with marigold meal. The meal deepens the color of egg yolks, which especially appeals to customers in Germany. The next Community Builders meeting is scheduled for Feb. 26 in Dixon.<BR>
<dd>Established in 1991, Community Builders is a process that increases rural communities' capacities for job creation, business development and financial support by identifying and encouraging local emergent entrepreneurs and potential community leaders. The process, which incorporates features such as vision building, community tours, presentations, small group activities and networking, lets participants choose their own course for learning about, and developing skills related to, specific economic development activities in their communities.<BR>
<dd>Participants get to know each other while attending a series of workshops. They tour one another's communities, identify key issues affecting their region, learn from each others' successful and not-so-successful projects, and build networks that help them make changes in their own communities. Graduates recruit new participants for each subsequent year's module. Currently the number of modules statewide is five, with two additional groups being formed. The expansion is being funded, in part, by a grant from the Omaha World-Herald Foundation. The changes in people's attitudes and creative problem-solving skills that result from this process, motivates participants to promote real change in their communities and regions. The result is sustainable, local economic development. For more information about the World-Herald Foundation, contact John Farnan at (402) 375-2240.

<H1><CENTER>Nebraska School-to-Work director named</CENTER></H1>
<BODY>
     
          
     
<dd>LINCOLN (Feb. 14, 1996) -- Darl A. Naumann, Ph.D., has been hired as director of Nebraska's School-to-Work (STW) Initiative. Naumann joined the Nebraska Department of Economic Development (DED) in September 1993 as state coordinator of <A HREF="http://www.ded.state.ne.us/assist/programs.html">Nebraska's Enterprise Zone Initiative</a> and will also continue in that position.
<dd>Nebraska's system will provide opportunities for young people to progress smoothly to the workforce by making connections between their education and careers. The partnerships are designed to help students gain the knowledge and experience they need to make career choices that match their interests, aptitudes and aspirations, and help them align with today's labor market trends.
<dd>The Nebraska STW Initiative was established through a $200,000 grant to develop components of the School-to-Work Opportunities Act, signed into law by President Clinton in May 1994. Governed by the <A HREF="http://www.ded.state.ne.us/nics/nics1.html">Nebraska Industrial Competiveness Alliance (NICA)</a> Board, Nebraska's STW Initiative builds partnerships between business, industry and schools, helping students gain knowledge and experience in the career areas of their choice. Naumann's duties include:<ul>
<LI>Conducting STW Advisory Council and committee meetings; </LI>
<LI>Presiding over local STW Task Forces on work- and school-based learning and connecting activities </LI>
<LI>Working with state and federal governmental agencies, professional societies, management representatives from organized labor and private businesses in implementing the grant budget, narrative and state plan</LI>
<LI>Implementing one- and five-year strategic plans for Nebraska's STW Initiative</LI>
<LI>Preparing grants</LI></ul>
<dd>"Of 39 states competing, Nebraska was one of only 19 to receive implementation funding and as of last Oct. 1, we received $2.5 million to invest in our local partnerships statewide," Naumann said. "We are just four months into the program and already seeing remarkable results--exciting partnerships developing among small and large employers, labor, schools at all levels, students, parents and community groups."  <BR>
<dd>"The NICA board has been extremely impressed with Nebraska's School-to-Work Initiative under Darl's leadership, and particularly in his work with STW Selection Committee members from Washington, D.C.," said A.F. "Tony" Raimondo, NICA board chair and president and CEO of Behlen Manufacturing in Columbus, Neb. "The board is sure that Darl's extensive background, experience and presentation skills were instrumental in the committee's decision to extend funding for Nebraska."  <BR> 
<dd>Before joining DED, Naumann served as assistant professor of political science at the University of Nebraska-Kearney from August 1992 to August 1993. His experience also includes 15 years in private business in Holdrege. He also has been active in politics and government since 1976, including serving four years as supervisor on the Phelps County Board in central Nebraska. 
<dd>Naumann holds a Ph.D. from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln in Political Science.<BR>

<H1><CENTER>$1.15 million grants awarded to homeless programs</CENTER></H1>
<BODY>
     
          

<dd>LINCOLN (Feb. 19, 1996) -- Grants totaling $1.15 million have been awarded through the 1996 Nebraska Homeless Assistance Program to 55 non-profit agencies statewide. Administered by the Nebraska Department of Economic Development (DED), monies from the fund are directed at programs and services that provide shelter and assistance, as well as services designed to prevent homelessness.<BR>
<dd>"Given the startling figures released in last October's study of Nebraska's homeless and near-homeless, this funding couldn't come at a more opportune time," said Gov. Ben Nelson. "These monies will let us keep working toward the goal of offering all Nebraskans safe, quality housing and comprehensive support services." <BR>
<dd>Nelson was referring to a study which identified nearly 320,000 people as near-homeless because they were at risk of becoming homeless within the year. The study was co-sponsored by DED and Nebraska Department of Social Services, and conducted by Hanna:Keelan Associates, a Lincoln planning firm. The Nebraska Homeless Assistance Program is made up of the Homeless Shelter Assistance Trust Fund, and the Emergency Shelter Grant Program. Because of the recent budget situation in Washington, D.C., Nebraska has not received its Emergency Shelter Grant allocation, but it will be allocated when it is received.<BR>
<dd>In 1992, the Legislature created the Homeless Shelter Assistance Trust Fund by passing LB1192, which increased the transfer tax to the seller of real estate from $1.50 to $1.75 on each $1,000 of value. The revenue is collected by county registers of deeds, remitted to the Nebraska Revenue Department and deposited into the Homeless Shelter Assistance Trust Fund. The following agencies received 1996 Nebraska Homeless Assistance Program grants:

<BODY>
<dd>LINCOLN (March 1, 1996) -- The Nebraska Affordable Housing Commission (NAHC) will kick off the first in a series of statewide meetings in Omaha, March 15, at the United Way of the Midlands, 1805 Harney St. As part of the meeting, commissioners will be given a guided bus tour of housing developments in North and South Omaha. Other meetings are tentatively planned for Gordon in June, Kearney in September and McCook in December. The meetings--the first to be held outside of Lincoln--are intended to help the commissioners become familiar with housing issues statewide. <BR>
<dd>"The commission's goal is to develop ongoing, specific, affordable housing policies and program recommendations for the governor on progressive housing policies; to plan courses of action; and to monitor the implementation of those recommendations," said Julie Jordan Hendricks, NAHC coordinator, and housing coordinator at the Nebraska Department of Economic Development. Established in 1992, the NAHC is appointed by the governor.<br><BR>

<H1><CENTER>Outstanding individual, group recognized at Network banquet</CENTER></H1>
<BODY>

<Dd>LINCOLN (March 5, 1996) -- State Sen. Floyd Vrtiska, Table Rock, and members of the Nebraska Development Network-Northeast Region were honored for their efforts in developing Nebraska's communities and counties before about 165 people attending the Nebraska Development Network Inc.'s annual banquet Tuesday evening. Vrtiska's colleagues--33 state senators--and Lt. Gov. Kim Robak were among those attending the event at the Cornhusker Hotel.<BR>
<Dd>Vrtiska received the Network's Public Service Award in recognition of his commitment to developing LB 144, the Partnerships for Economic Development Act. LB 144, passed by the Legislature last June under Vrtiska's leadership, authorized $250,000 a year through fiscal year 1996-1997 for economic development grants. During the first funding cycle, 12 projects involving 73 counties and 170 partners were awarded $249,810 in grants. The projects encompassed a wide range of economic development needs_from business recruitment, housing, loan programs and business retention to agriculture, telecommunications and tourism.<BR>
<Dd>"Sen. Vrtiska's efforts are very much in keeping with the Network's goals to 'assist communities to succeed in the global economy,'" said Don Reynolds, 1995-1996 Network president. <BR>
<Dd>The Nebraska Development Network-Northeast Region received the Connecting Nebraskans Award. Accepting the award were 20 of the 200 members who make up the group. Established in 1987, the Northeast Region was the first regional network of its kind in Nebraska. Since its beginning, the group has been actively involved in linking and serving communities regionwide, as well as in supporting the creation and work of the Nebraska Development Network and other regional groups throughout the state. <BR>  
<Dd>"The Northeast Region symbolizes the same kind of community-building spirit found among Nebraska's pioneers," Reynolds said. "The group's continuing hard work and efforts are helping secure a solid place for Nebraska among its global competitors."<BR>
<Dd>The Nebraska Development Network was established by Gov. Nelson through an Executive Order in January 1992, and organized as a not-for-profit corporation in May 1993. The Network is composed of more than 400 organizational and individual members working together to help citizens, communities and businesses continue on the path of successful economic development for the state.

<H1><CENTER>$38,000 in project grants go to Alliance, Fremont , Red Cloud</CENTER></H1>
<BODY>

<dd>FREMONT (March 8,1996) --The Nebraska Lied Main Street Program announced today that $38,000 in project grants will provide the communities of Alliance, Fremont and Red Cloud with the opportunity to develop and revitalize their downtown districts.
 The announcement was made on behalf of the state agencies which sponsor the Nebraska Lied Main Street Program -- the University of Nebraska-Lincoln College of Architecture, the Nebraska Department of Economic Development, the Nebraska State Historical Society and the Nebraska Department of Roads.<br>
<dd>Sponsoring agencies judged the grant proposals on evidence of community sustainability, citizen input in the planning process and the potential impact on the local business district.<br>
<dd>"We were overwhelmed with each community's participation in the first year of their local Main Street programs," said Lawrence Sommer, director of the Nebraska State Historical Society. "The degree of these proposals reflect important issues and priority needs identified by each community."<br>
<dd>Alliance, Fremont and Red Cloud were awarded grants for projects concentrating in the downtown area.<br>
<dd>Main Street Alliance will complete a historic building survey and contract for a study on uses for upper floors of main street buildings. The grant also will cover promotional events and design.<br>
<dd>Main Street Fremont, Inc. will compile a comprehensive master plan for its downtown that will address current and future economic and physical components which are important to the city's continued vitality.<br>
<dd>Red Cloud Main Street will complete a second phase of historic lighting in the downtown area.<br>
<dd>Anne Johnson, Nebraska Lied Main Street Program director, noted that communities that have completed one year of participation are starting to address critical community issues and economic development needs through Main Street. "We hope these projects can serve as models of positive community revitalization tools for other communities in the state," she said.<br>
<dd>The Nebraska Lied Main Street Program was established in 1994 through a grant from the Lied Foundation Trust. Its purpose is to provide communities of 50,000 or less the opportunity to revitalize main street districts. Each year, a maximum of four communities are selected based on a competitive application and presentation process. There currently are seven Main Street communities in Nebraska: Alliance, Fremont, Red Cloud, Wakefield, Gothenburg, Minden and Ogallala.<br>
<dd>The program is a unique partnership between four sponsoring state agencies that have committed technical assistance, staff and resources to provide non-duplicating, community-specific services to each Main Street community.<br>
<dd>The National Main Street Center is a program of the National Trust for Historic Preservation. Created by a Congressional Charter in 1949, the National Trust is a leading advocate of historic preservation in the United States. The preservation movement involves more than saving historic buildings. Economic growth, urban revitalization and the creation of new jobs are all issues the National Trust addresses through the rehabilitation of historic structures.<br>
<dd>Established by the National Trust in 1980, the National Main Street Center has worked in 40 states and Puerto Rico, with more than 1,200 communities participating in the revitalization of traditional and neighborhood commercial areas. Through these efforts, 101,505 net new jobs have been created, $5.02 billion has been reinvested in Main Street commercial districts, and communities have built strong organizations to revitalize their commercial districts.<br>

<H1><CENTER>Over $2 million to fund 12 School-to-Work partnerships</CENTER></H1>
<BODY>

<Dd>LINCOLN (March 11, 1996) -- Gov. Ben Nelson today announced that 12 Nebraska School-to-Work (STW) partnerships will receive a total of $2,054,496 in grants. The one-year funding will support each partnership's efforts to unite businesses, industries and schools in helping students gain the knowledge and skills necessary for successful careers. Joining Gov. Nelson during his weekly telephone conference were A. F. "Tony" Raimondo, Nebraska Industrial Competitiveness Alliance (NICA) board chair and president and CEO of Behlen Manufacturing in Columbus, Neb.; Maxine Moul, director of the Nebraska Department of Economic Development (DED); and Darl Naumann, School-to-Work director of DED's Nebraska Alliance for Learning.<BR>  
<Dd>"We're committed to assisting these partnerships with creating a statewide system of education and employment opportunities that help our youth become tomorrow's highly-knowledgeable and productive employees," Nelson said. "There's no doubt that Nebraska's future workforce will have to be armed with the right kind of information and know-how to successfully compete in our fast-paced and ever-changing global economy."<BR>
<Dd>Nebraska was one of 19 states (out of 39 applicants) to receive the implementation grant last October from the U.S. Departments of Labor and Education under the 1994 School-to-Work Opportunities Act. To insure business support, the governor appointed NICA in 1995 to govern Nebraska's STW System. The Alliance is composed of business and industrial leaders with experience and significant responsibility in business and manufacturing, plus key public administrators and labor leaders with significant responsibility in providing education and workforce training. Administrative support for the initiative is provided by DED.
A total of 27 applications were considered for the Nebraska grants. Of the $2.5 million in funds Nebraska received, 80 percent will be allocated directly to the 12 partnerships as follows:<ul>
<LI>$219,828 -- East-Central Regional Pathways & Partnership Council, which includes participating partners in Boone, Butler, Colfax, Greeley, Merrick, Nance, Platte, Polk and Valley counties.</LI>
<LI>$154,690 -- Cooperation BEST (Better Educating Students for Tomorrow), which includes participating partners in educational institutions, businesses and the communities of Papillion-LaVista.</LI>
<LI>$79,971 -- Southern Panhandle STW, which includes participating partners in Cheyenne and Kimball counties.</LI>
<LI>$125,355 -- Empowering Buffalo County Area STW, which includes participating partners in educational institutions, businesses and human service agencies in Buffalo County.</LI>
<LI>$380,000 -- South Platte Regional STW, which includes participating partners in Adams, Chase, Clay, Dundy, Fillmore, Franklin, Frontier, Furnas, Gosper, Hamilton, Harlan, Hayes, Hitchcock, Kearney, Lincoln, Nuckolls, Perkins, Phelps, Red Willow, Thayer and Webster counties.  </LI>
<LI>$125,000 -- Southeast Nebraska STW, which includes participating partners in Johnson, Nemaha, Otoe, Pawnee and Richardson counties.</LI>
$<LI>170,000 -- McConaughy Business & Education Regional STW, which includes participating partners in Arthur, Deuel, Garden, Keith and Perkins counties.</LI>
<LI>$248,840 -- Northeast Business & Education for the Future, which includes participating partners in Antelope, Brown, Cuming, Holt, Knox, Madison and Wayne counties.</LI>
<LI>$134,995 -- Foundation & Affective Skills for Today & the Future, which includes participating partners in businesses, industries, government, educational institutions and the city of Beatrice in Gage County.</LI>
<LI>$70,387 -- Crete Community STW, which includes participating partners in educational institutions, businesses and the chamber of commerce in Crete.</LI>
<LI>$190,930 -- Sugar Valley Careers Coalition, which includes participating partners in Banner, Morrill and Scotts Bluff counties.</LI>          
<LI>$153,500 -- Career Pathways of Greater Omaha, which includes participating partners in major corporations, educational institutions, consortiums and initiatives, and community organizations in Omaha.</LI></ul>
<Dd>Since no single, local STW system model exists, partnerships can design systems that address the specific needs and challenges of the area they serve. However, each partnership must commit to developing a system that combines school-based and work-based learning, which leads to building and strengthening the ties between business, industries and schools, Naumann explained.
All partnerships include strategies for sustaining the local partnership as the system matures. For example, all proposals were required to match the School-to-Work grant fund request with at least 50 percent local funds. When the amounts were tallied, STW requests totaled $2,054,496 and local matching funds totaled $4,648,286.<BR>

<H1><CENTER>Nebraska Mormon Trails Association organizes</CENTER></H1>
<BODY>

<Dd>LINCOLN (March 15, 1996) -- A new Nebraska organization, the Nebraska Mormon Trails Association was established in January to educate citizens about the trail's place in Nebraska history. 1997 marks the 150th anniversary of the trek and between 250,000 and 750,000 visitors are expected to retrace the route and visit many points of interest along the trail in 1997. 
According to Association President Brian Hill of Kearney, the group wants to identify, protect and interpret the historic Mormon Trail which winds through the length of Nebraska. <BR>
<Dd>"We want to encourage and sponsor research that relates to Nebraska's connection with the Mormon Trail," Hill said. "We also plan to develop materials, create museum displays, and place markers along the trail, as well as re-enact trail happenings and celebrate special events in Nebraska communities."<BR>
<Dd>Joining Hill on the board are: Nancy Johnson, vice president, Central City; Ronnie O'Brien, secretary, Grand Island; and Leonard Gregory, treasurer, Kearney. The board's technical representatives include: Amy Holmquist, <A HREF="http://www.ded.state.ne.us/tourism.html">Nebraska Department of Travel & Tourism</A>; Hill, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints; Gene Hunt, <A HREF="http://ngp.ngpc.state.ne.us/gp.html">Nebraska Game and Parks Commission</a>; and a representative from the Nebraska State Historic Preservation Office.<BR>   
<Dd>Each Nebraska county maintaining the trail within its borders, will serve as a voting member of the association board. The board also will include three members-at-large. The public is invited to attend the association's next meeting in Genoa, March 30. The following article explains the importance of the Mormon Trail.
     
<h2><center>Mormon Trail Sesquicentennial  1996-1997</h2>
<H3> By Brian Hill</H3></center>
<Dd>American West historians have called the Latter-Day Saints migration one of history's best-organized mass movements. An estimated 70,000 people traveled the trail from 1846-1869. Starting in Nauvoo--a western Illinois city founded by the prophet, Joseph Smith--the trail snakes through Iowa, Nebraska and Wyoming, finally descending into the Valley of the Great Salt Lake.<BR>
<Dd>Though it bears their name, Mormons did not blaze the trail, which follows territorial roads, Indian trails and segments of the Oregon Trail. Rather, they found a trail and turned it into a road. Unique in Western history, the trail represented a journey to religious freedom for the pioneers traveling it. They were villages on wheels, moving as a whole society and a whole culture. They profoundly impacted history, building more than 50 communities with town and county governments, courts of law and post offices. They built roads, bridges, ferries, schools, churches, mills, businesses and a Tabernacle; published five newspapers; operated hotels and supply houses; and provided a score of other community services. <BR>
<Dd>Along with their observations about climate, latitude, longitude, atmospheric conditions, flora and fauna, they devised an odometer to track mileage. They hunted game and harvested trees sparingly. Their unique understanding of the American Indian led them to treat the Indians fairly, resulting in little trouble between the two cultures.<BR>
<Dd>From 1856-1860, 10 companies of pioneers made the trip west pushing or pulling two-wheeled carts. These carts offered a cheaper, quicker alternative to covered wagons. A cart measured six to seven feet in length, spanned a wagon track in width and carried about 500 pounds. <BR>
<Dd>The trek from Nauvoo to the Missouri River was 265 miles. After 1846, staging grounds for the trail were located in western Iowa and eastern Nebraska--a distance of 1,032 miles from the Great Salt Lake. The vanguard company arrived in the Great Salt Lake Valley on July 24, 1847. Many letters, journals and diaries relate the personal tragedies, hardships and triumphs of these dedicated pioneers. <BR>

<H1><CENTER>  National Main Street Center to train three communities</CENTER></H1>
<BODY>

<dd>GOTHENBURG (March 29,1996) — Representatives from Gothenburg, Minden and Ogallala will meet here April 11-12 to train each community's Main Street board and committee members in the roles they play in the local, state and National Main Street program.<BR>
     <dd>Training will parallel the Four-Point Approach of the National Main Street Center: Promotion, organization, economic restructuring and design. The two-day training session will be conducted by Lauren Adkins, senior program associate, and P. H. “Cuffy” Sullivan, program associate, with the National Main Street Center in Washington, D.C.<BR>
   <dd>The Main Street program is an economic development effort aimed at helping communities revitalize their central commercial districts.  The program's approach to economic revitalization is comprehensive by incorporating historic preservation, promotion/marketing and organizational structure into the revitalization equation.<BR>
     <dd>The National Main Street Center is a program of the National Trust for Historic Preservation. Created by a Congressional Charter in 1949, the National Trust is a leading advocate of historic preservation in the United States. The preservation movement involves more than saving historic buildings.  Economic growth, urban revitalization and the creation of new jobs are all issues the National Trust addresses through the rehabilitation of historic structures.<BR>
     <dd>Established by the National Trust in 1980, the National Main Street Center has worked in 40 states and Puerto Rico, with more than 1,200 communities participating in the revitalization of traditional downtown and neighborhood commercial areas. Through these efforts, 101,505 net new jobs have been created, $5.02 billion has been reinvested in Main Street commercial districts, and communities have built strong organizations to revitalize their commercial districts.<BR>
     <dd>The Nebraska Lied Main Street program (NLMSP) was established in 1994 through a grant from the Lied Foundation Trust to provide communities with a population of 50,000 or less with the opportunity to revitalize their main street districts.  Each year, a maximum of four communities are selected based on a competitive application and presentation process.  In total, 16 communities will be designated as Main Street communities in Nebraska.  Currently, the state has seven Main Street communities: Alliance, Fremont, Gothenburg, Minden, Ogallala, Red Cloud and Wakefield.<BR>
    <dd>NLMSP is a unique partnership between four sponsoring state agencies-the University of Nebraska-Lincoln College of Architecture, the Nebraska Department of Economic Development, the Nebraska State Historical Society, and the Nebraska Department of Roads.  Sponsoring state agencies have committed technical assistance, staff and resources to provide non-duplicating, community-specific services to each Main Street community.<BR>

<H1><CENTER> Nebraska Rural Development Commission awarded "overall excellence"</CENTER></H1>
<BODY>
     
     <dd>LINCOLN (April 15, 1996)-The Nebraska Rural Development Commission (RDC), has received the 1996 Arthur
 D. Little Award for Overall Excellence for its work in revitalizing rural Nebraska's communities.  Accepting the award
 at the annual conference in Colorado Springs, Colo., was Don Macke, Nebraska RDC executive director.
   <dd> According to past recipients, the Arthur D. Little Awards for Excellence in Economic Development are hailed as
 among the highest honors an economic development organization can receive.  Other programs across the country
 received awards for excellence in management, technology and human resources.  Each winning program is highlighted in the American Economic Development Council's (AEDC) Economic Development Review.
   <dd>"The fact that Nebraska has won top awards in this competition for three straight years confirms that our state is
 a national leader in offering quality, innovative economic development programs and services," said Maxine Moul,
 director of the Nebraska Department of Economic Development (DED).
    <dd>In 1994, The Nebraska Development Network received the award for Overall Excellence for its efforts in helping
 citizens, communities and businesses succeed in the global community.  In 1995, DED and the University of
 Nebraska-Lincoln's (UNL) Institute of Agriculture and Natural Resources (IANR), received the award for Technological Excellence for Nebraska's Community Internet Navigator Program.
    <dd>Gov. Ben Nelson praised the Nebraska RDC for its work since its formation by his executive order in January
 1991.
    <dd>"We envisioned an organization which created sustainable community and economic development initiatives to
 help Nebraska's communities achieve specific goals, ultimately contributing to the state's growth and well-being,"
 Nelson said.  "The Rural Development Commission has gone far beyond our initial expectations, helping communities map out strategies to meet economic challenges well into the 21st Century."
    <dd>The Nebraska RDC was created to address a rural situation that included a large number of families leaving the
 state and a dwindling number of family farms.  The commission employed a unique approach to addressing rural
 issues, calling on rural citizens rather than economic and community development professionals to identify needs
 and develop solutions. Throughout the years, commissioners, selected from a wide-range of geographic areas,
 ages, ethnic groups, occupations and genders, have advocated and helped initiate many successful rural development projects including:<UL>
<LI>The Nebraska Development Network, a set of regional networks of local and regional service providers from
 private and public sources;</LI>
<LI>Partnership for Rural Nebraska, which coordinates resources, programs and policies among the State of
 Nebraska, University of Nebraska and U.S. Department of Agriculture;</LI>
<LI>Nebraska Mandate Initiative, which allows communities to prioritize their most serious environmental threats
 first and delay compliance with lesser threat issues.  The process gives communities an opportunity to better
 balance and manage fiscal and human resources;</LI>
<LI>Nebraska Lied Main Street Program, a partnership of DED, the University of Nebraska-Lincoln College of Architecture, the Nebraska State Historical Society and the Nebraska Department of Roads, which promotes and funds improvements to the business core of Nebraska communities.</LI>
<LI>Community Builders, a grass roots citizens process enabling people to create economic opportunities through community awareness and involvement in multi-community and regional collaboration.</LI>
<LI>Nebraska Community Foundation, which has helped 150 communities raise $4 million to date to meet specific needs.</LI></UL>
<dd>Through these and other initiatives, the Nebraska RDC has helped rural Nebraskans significantly reverse outmigration in nearly 50 counties, as well as create new jobs.
<dd>Stan Foster, state director of Rural Economic and Community Development for the U.S.Department of Agriculture, serves as chair of the commission.  Lyons businesswoman and city council member Mary Piper is its vice chair.

<B><h1><center>$41,000 emergency funds to help house Grand Island families</CENTER></H1>
<BODY>
     

<dd>LINCOLN (April 22, 1996) -- Gov. Ben Nelson today announced that the Central Nebraska Community Services (CNCS) in Grand Island will receive $41,000 from the Homeless Shelter Assistance Trust Fund to help 30 families  in Oak Ridge Trailer Park relocate and move to other area trailer parks. A total of 25 families who own, and five families who rent trailers must move by April 30_the day the park will close permanently because of unresolved health violations.<BR>
<dd>"These funds represent an important new beginning for all concerned_safer, cleaner homes and neighborhoods and renewed independence and pride for individuals who, like the rest of us, want to secure better futures for their families," Nelson said. <dd><dd>"Nebraska has always been a place that fosters new beginnings and we're glad that we can help." <BR>   
Administered by the Nebraska Department of Economic Development (DED), monies from the fund are directed at programs and services that provide shelter and assistance, as well as services designed to prevent homelessness. Specifically the funds will be used to help the 163 residents (73 adults and 90 children) locate available trailer lots; cover moving and hook-up expenses, and renter's security and utility deposits; and bring trailers up to code. In some cases, residents will move into temporary quarters until permanent housing is secured. The move, which will begin immediately, should be completed by the end of May.<BR>  
<dd>"We're glad to work with DED, the city of Grand Island and many other agencies to generate these resources which will provide assistance for the displaced Oak Ridge families," said Jim Crosland, CNCS executive director. "This is truly a collaborative effort in response to a critical situation and I know the individuals involved are grateful for the state's assistance."<BR>
<dd>CNCS also will help the families with other issues related to the transition. For example, some families may need to enroll their children in new schools. However the relocations aren't expected to impact the distance traveled by those employed in the area, said Crosland.  <BR>
<dd>In 1992, the Legislature created the Homeless Shelter Assistance Trust Fund by passing LB1192, which increased the transfer tax to the seller of real estate from $1.50 to $1.75 on each $1,000 of value. The revenue is collected by county registers of deeds, remitted to the Nebraska Revenue Department and deposited into the Homeless Shelter Assistance Trust Fund.

<H1><CENTER>Tourism Week celebrates $2 billion industry</CENTER></H1>
<BODY>

<Dd>LINCOLN (May 1, 1996) -- Nebraska Tourism Week May 5-11 will recognize the contribution of the state's third leading industry.
During the past three decades, tourism has become increasingly important to Nebraska's economic growth. For example, in the mid-1960s, tourism generated about $100 million in industry revenues per year. Peggy Briggs, director of the Nebraska Department of Economic Development's (DED) Travel and Tourism Division, said tourism generated a new all-time $2 billion high in 1995 and tourism revenues have increased steadily for nine consecutive years.  Nebraska's tourism industry is growing for many reasons, said Briggs. One important reason is that citizens are becoming more aware of tourism as an economic development tool.<BR> 
<Dd>"When I first joined the Travel and Tourism Division 12 years ago, there were a handful of bed and breakfasts. Now there are dozens statewide," Briggs said. "There also were no guest ranches and now there are several. Urban and rural Nebraskans alike understand the importance of attracting visitors, and the marketing strategies they need to use in attracting visitors who have hundreds of vacation sites to choose from."<BR>
<Dd>Another reason for the increase is the growing number of partnerships among communities and counties working with the state to promote sites and attractions.<BR>
<Dd>"The Travel and Tourism Division works very closely with local groups to promote the common goal of providing quality experiences for visitors," Briggs said. "By working together, our budgets can create an overall greater impact than that of towns and counties working independently." <BR>   
<Dd>Another factor leading to increased tourism is the cooperative efforts of state agencies to develop and promote products or attractions. The Travel and Tourism Division and the Nebraska State Department of Roads share the production costs of the Nebraska state map. The Travel and Tourism Division also works with the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission, the Nebraska Historical Society and the Nebraska Department of Agriculture to promote the state.<BR>
<Dd>According to Briggs, Nebraska's tourism industry can expect continued growth. For example, the 150th Mormon Trail Anniversary celebration in 1996 and 1997 is expected to draw thousands of visitors to Nebraska. <BR>
<Dd>"Nebraska offers tourists (residents and non-residents) a wide range of activities, such as history, culture and outdoor recreation, as well as both rural and urban experiences at prices considerably lower than many other travel destinations," Briggs said

<dd>LINCOLN (May 21, 1996) -- Small- and medium-sized Nebraska manufacturers looking for help with technical and business problems now have improved access to the Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP), a program of the U.S. Commerce Department's National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).<BR>
<dd>An 800 telephone number and revised MEP home page on Internet directly link manufacturers to the nearest MEP affiliate or the MEP headquarters office at NIST in Gaithersburg, Md. This new service will strengthen the information network available to Nebraska manufacturers, said Tommy Thorne, director of the Nebraska Industrial Competitiveness Service (NICS).<BR>
<dd>"These sources, integrated with our existing sources statewide, make it more convenient for manufacturers to solve problems, clearing the way for improved quality and greater competition in our global economy," Thorne said. <BR>
<dd>For example, dialing 1(800) MEP-4MFG will directly link a smaller manufacturer with the nearest MEP affiliate or the MEP headquarters office. <BR>
<dd>The MEP is a national network of locally-managed centers in 42 states and Puerto Rico offering technical assistance and the newest business practices to smaller manufacturers. Typical MEP services include helping manufacturers access information on new equipment such as automation systems; find high-quality advice on optimizing manufacturing systems; reduce costs by lowering waste; improve quality; expand markets for products; and find financing for modernization efforts.<BR>
<dd>Individuals with access to the World Wide Web also can find information on the MEP and its affiliate centers and services through the newly-revised <a href="http://www.mep.nist.gov">MEP home page</a> at http://www.mep.nist.gov<BR>
<dd>Called the "MEP Source," it features a map with center and field office locations. The source includes information both for smaller manufacturers and for center operators. <BR>
<dd>News and general information on the <a href="http://www.nist.gov">National Institute of Standards and Technology</a> is available on the World Wide Web via Internet at http://www.nist.gov Nebraska manufacturers also can directly contact the following NICS staff:<UL>

<H1><CENTER>Rural Development Commission endorses <BR>key projects impacting rural development </CENTER></H1>
<BODY>

<Dd>O'NEILL (May 21, 1996) -- The Nebraska Rural Development Commission (RDC) has endorsed action plans dealing with federal and state mandates and for helping Indian tribes with development issues, it was announced today.<BR>
<Dd>The Nebraska Mandate Management Initiative offers rural communities help in managing federal and state mandates. Created in 1994, the initiative is designed to build state and local partnerships devoted to solving serious public health and environmental problems.  <BR>
<Dd>The second plan supports goals set out at the Second Annual Tribal Summit held in South Sioux City in July 1995. The goals were drafted by the Omaha, Ponca, Santee Sioux and Winnebago Tribes, the Governor's Policy Research Office, the Nebraska Commission on Indian Affairs, the Nebraska Department of Economic Development (DED), the Bureau of Indian Affairs-Winnebago Agency and the Nebraska RDC.  A summit report outlines ways for Nebraska's four tribes and state government, and federal government to work toward increasing community and economic development in communities, such as Winnebago and Santee. <BR>
<Dd>  Another key issue discussed was the <A HREF="http://www.ded.state.ne.us/crd/crd.html">Community Development Block Grant (CDBG)</a> program's  Business Development category. A three-year project of DED, the business development category is designed to increase economic development opportunities in rural areas through entrepreneurship and self-employment opportunities. The commission voted to take a more active role in the development of the CDBG program, which is federally-funded through the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and administered through DED.<BR>
<Dd>The commission continues to work on other priority issues, such as transportation initiatives on public transit, rail and essential air services; affordable telecommunications services for Nebraska's rural communities; and LB 1044, the Nebraska Partnership, which merges the Nebraska Departments of Social Services, Health, Aging and Public Institutions, and the Office of Juvenile Justice, currently housed in the Nebraska Department of Corrections.<BR>
<Dd>The Nebraska RDC was created in 1991 to promote rural development interests statewide. Commission members are: Stan Foster, chair, of Friend, Mary Piper, vice chair, of Lyons, Lisa Sock of Norfolk, John Quirk of Hastings, Howard McNiff of Cook, Alan Emshoff of Schuyler, Hilton Rogers of Alvo, Jim Naeve of Cambridge, JoAnn Mueller of Kimball, Warren Hill of O'Neill, and Rev. Mark Schutt of Eustis;<BR>
<Dd>Monica Harvey of Stapleton, Glenn Price of Gordon, Carmen Schaffer of Randolph, Craig Schroeder of Holbrook, Sam Cordes of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln's Center for Rural Revitalization, Maxine Moul of the Nebraska Department of Economic Development, Pat Ptacek of the Nebraska Department of Agriculture,Daryl LaPointe Sr., of the Winnebago Tribe, State Sen. Roger Wehrbein of Plattsmouth and State Sen. Bob Wickersham of Harrison.<BR>
<Dd>The Nebraska RDC's next quarterly meeting will be held in August in North Platte and Stapleton.

<H1><CENTER>Sandoz earns quality jobs approval from panel</CENTER></H1>
<BODY>
     
<dd>LINCOLN (June 3, 1996) -- An application by Sandoz Pharmaceuticals Corp. to use benefits under LB 829 was approved today by the three-member board which oversees applications under provisions of the Quality Jobs Act. Members of the board include the Governor Ben Nelson, State Treasurer Dave Heineman, and Dennis Jorgensen, chair of the Nebraska Investment Council.<br>
<dd>Sandoz Vice President Thomas E. Berry, in charge of the Lincoln plant's technical operations, said the company plans to add $100 million in investment and 250 new jobs during the next 58 months.<br>
<dd>"While not totally identified at this point, the new jobs will include 120 new jobs created when our new solids manufacturing facility opens in 1997," he told the board.<br>
<dd>Construction began on the new facility after the company announced last summer that two-thirds of the products currently manufactured at its East Hanover, New Jersey, facility would be transferred to the Lincoln plant.<br>
<dd>Rick Bohner, senior vice president of technical operations and human resources, said Nebraska's favorable business climate made it advantageous for the company to consider the state in its expansion plans.<br>
<dd>Governor Ben Nelson, following approval of Sandoz's application, said the company is a valued member of the state's corporate family.<br>
<dd>"Sandoz has demonstrated its ability to be a world player in the highly competitive pharmaceuticals industry. Nebraska's business climate dovetails nicely with the company's international expansion plans," the governor said.<br>
<dd>Paul McCue, president of the Lincoln Partnership for Economic Development, said the approval of Sandoz's goals for new investment and jobs "is exciting news for Lincoln and the State of Nebraska. This is the kind of company and these are the kind of jobs every community would welcome. This further strengthens the region's economy and makes Lincoln and Nebraska a more credible location for continued growth of the industry."<br>
<dd>Lincoln Mayor Mike Johanns also welcomed Sandoz's commitment to creating new jobs.<br>
<dd>"More and more companies are discovering what Sandoz already knows: Lincoln is one of America's premier cities in terms of quality of life and quality of work force. Together, Lincoln's employers and citizens make a great team. On behalf of the entire community, I congratulate Sandoz for its present success and look forward to working with company officials in their new challenges," he said.<br>

<H1><CENTER>Partnerships Act awards grants to 15 projects</CENTER></H1>
<BODY>

<Dd>LINCOLN (June 5, 1996) -- Gov. Ben Nelson today announced that 15 projects have been awarded a total of $250,190 in grants in the second funding cycle of the Partnerships for Economic Development Act (LB 144). In all, 76 counties and 166 partners are involved in projects which encompass a wide range of economic development needs -- from business and employee recruitment, housing, and youth entrepreneurship to business assistance and expansion, tourism, agriculture and telecommunications. The second funding cycle process received 36 applications with requests totaling $780,736. In December 1995, 12 projects, involving 73 counties and 170 partners, received grants totaling $249,810 as part of the first funding cycle. <BR>
<Dd>"These 15 projects--combined with the previous 12 projects--reveal the true power of partnerships in making Nebraska a better place to live for all of us," Nelson said. "Our communities are experiencing an economic renaissance that will endure because of the large network of community and county leaders now working together to address common needs." <BR>
<Dd>LB 144, passed by the Legislature in June 1995 under the leadership of Sen. Floyd Vrtiska of Table Rock, authorized $250,000 a year through fiscal year 1996-1997 for economic development grants. With today's announcement, all authorized funding has been granted. Future funding cycles will hinge on Legislative approval of funding in upcoming fiscal years. 
<Dd>The maximum amount granted to any project is $25,000 and single projects cannot receive more than one grant. The projects and award amounts are:<UL>

<H1><CENTER>Loup City celebrates $700,000 grant award</CENTER></H1>
<BODY>
          

<Dd>LOUP CITY (June 8, 1996) -- Gov. Ben Nelson today announced that Loup City has been awarded $700,000 in Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) disaster relief funds to repair and replace damaged sanitary sewer lines and manholes. Funds also will be used to install systems that lower groundwater levels in wells, preventing infiltration into the city's sewer system. The governor made the announcement while attending the Annual Polish Days Parade.<BR>
<Dd>"Today we recognize those traditions which truly make Nebraska a special place to live, work and raise families," Nelson said. "We celebrate Loup City's rich heritage, left to us in the legacy of our pioneering fathers and mothers. We also celebrate our history as people known for pulling together when the going gets tough, as it did during the  1993 floods." <BR>
<Dd>"Rebuilding Nebraska's flood-ravaged infrastructure has been a long, painstaking process, but it has really taught us about working together to safeguard our communities," Nelson added. "Many lasting partnerships have been forged between state, county and local governments, all with the goal of preserving and ensuring Nebraska's future growth and development."<BR>
<Dd>Administered by the Nebraska Department of Economic Development (DED), these CDBG Disaster Relief Funds for Midwest flooding are made available to the state through the federal government's Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act. The award to Loup City represents the final grant made from $20.6 million allocated to Nebraska for 1993 flood recovery assistance.<BR>
<Dd>The community also is working with the Nebraska Department of Environmental Quality's (DEQ) State Revolving Loan Fund as a potential financial source to help cover remaining project costs estimated at $300,000.<BR>
<Dd>In June and July 1993, the city recorded more than 25 inches of rainfall, resulting in a submerged sewer system which overflowed and damaged more than 70 Loup City homes and businesses, and public infrastructure. Health and safety concerns heightened in July 1993 when petroleum fumes leaked into the damaged properties through the  flood drains.<BR>
<Dd>"Loup City, under the leadership of Mayor Jim Kuehl, has developed a proactive, long-term recovery approach that will maintain the community's infrastructure and help prevent future flooding problems," said Shari Garner Sterkel, CDBG disaster recovery coordinator.

<H1><CENTER>75 communities, 4 counties join NCIP in 1996 </CENTER></H1>
<BODY>
     

<Dd>LINCOLN (June 10, 1996) -- Seventy-five communities and four counties have signed up for the 1996 Nebraska Community Improvement Program (NCIP), which culminates in a statewide ceremony in November.<br>
<Dd>NCIP is the state's longest-running community betterment program. Since its beginning in 1963, NCIP has helped community leaders and volunteers with their improvement efforts by providing technical assistance and information on programs and resources, and recognizing outstanding community and economic development efforts. The program is offered in partnership between the Nebraska Department of Economic Development and the University of Nebraska and sponsored by 12 investor-owned natural gas and telephone companies.<br>
<Dd>In 1995, 630 volunteers from across Nebraska demonstrated their support of NCIP at the celebration banquet in Lincoln in November.<br>
<Dd>"The number of people we had attending the banquet tells me that this program is as relevant today as it was 33 years ago," said Pamela Mulder, NCIP coordinator. "This year's entries seem especially interested in the community visioning process as a way to set goals, prioritize community projects and plan for the future. NCIP encourages this process as a way to build consensus and momentum for projects, and to proactively encourage and manage growth."<br>
<Dd>This year's NCIP is emphasizing a "blueprint for success" for its communities, which involves volunteer and leadership development, a strategic planning process and project accomplishments. These  same criteria are used in judging communities' overall achievements for the Community Development Awards. <br>
<Dd>"NCIP volunteers have profoundly impacted Nebraska's economy," Mulder said. "In 1995, the projects submitted totaled 558,000 hours of inkind contributions toward community and economic improvement activities. When multiplied by $10 per hour, this equals nearly $5.6 million in community investment.<br>
<Dd>New to this year's program is a seventh judging category for multi-community entries, defined as a region, a group of counties or communities. According to Mulder, more communities are joining regional efforts due to shared benefits in areas, such as tourism, recycling and waste disposal.<br>
<Dd>"Even more impressive is that this competitive program has resulted in communities mentoring one another and counties working together to achieve regional growth," Mulder added. "This further supports our belief that NCIP helps communities achieve a high level of leadership which often moves them beyond competition to a greater good of partnering to develop a strong economic base statewide." <br>
<Dd>Signing up for the 1996 NCIP are Ainsworth, Alliance, Arapaho, Arnold, Ashland, Auburn, Aurora, Bassett, Beaver City, Bellwood, Big Springs, Bloomfield, Brady, Broken Bow, Butte, Callaway, Campbell, Cedar Rapids, Chadron, Chappell, Cheney, Clarks, Cody, Cook, Creighton, Culbertson, Custer County, Dannebrog, Davenport, Elba, Ewing, Exeter, Falls City, Farnam, Fillmore County, Franklin, Fullerton, Geneva, Genoa, Goehner, Gothenburg, Grant County, Guide Rock, Hartington, Henderson, HIldreth, Holdrege, Howells, Hubbell, Kimball, Lyons, Mason City, Mead, Minden, Newman Grove, Oakland, Odell, Pawnee County, Pender, Pierce, Potter, Rising City, Seward, Sidney, Smithfield, Spalding, Spencer, St. Paul, Stanton, Sterling, Strang, Stromsburg, Syracuse, Tryon/McPherson County, Upland, Wakefield, Wallace, Wauneta and Wymore.

<BODY>

<dd>Four new trailers about Nebraska tourism opportunities will soon run in theaters across the state. Trailers are short promotional pieces which are shown before the feature attraction. The 30-second trailers, respectively, are rated H for history, G for good Life, and R for relaxation. The fourth trailer uses Nebraska animals to admonish the audience not to talk during the movie. The trailers, which will be shown at 66 Douglas Theatre Group theaters statewide, are expected to reach more than three million people annually. The Douglas Theatre Group will run the trailers free of charge as a service to the state.<BR>
<dd>Gov. Ben Nelson thanked Russell Brehm, founder and CEO of the Douglas Theatre Co.; David Livingston, president of the Douglas Theatre Co.; and Debbie Brehm, vice president of the Douglas Theatre Co. for their help and generosity in promoting tourism in Nebraska. The trailers are a result of nine focus-group meetings across the state which revealed an interest in more in-state tourism marketing.<BR>

<H1><CENTER>Quality awards to be given to more Nebraska companies</CENTER></H1>
<BODY>

<Dd>LINCOLN (June 17, 1996) -- A newly-expanded 1996 Nebraska Edgerton Award for Quality program now offers companies more ways to distinguish themselves from other companies. <BR>  
<Dd>Nebraska companies can now apply for one of several awards: the Edgerton Award of Commitment, the Edgerton Award of Progress, or the Edgerton Award of Excellence in the categories of continuous improvement or adaptation of technology in the manufacturing and service sectors. The awards will be presented during Business and Industry Recognition Day in May 1997. 
Sponsored by the Nebraska Industrial Competitiveness Service and the Nebraska Chapter of the American Society of Quality Control, the program is administered by the Nebraska Department of Economic Development (DED).<BR>
<Dd>"We're pleased to see the changes made in the Edgerton Quality Award program," said Chris Reed, quality manager at Square D Company in Lincoln, a past Edgerton Award recipient. "The new award levels will give all Nebraska companies a chance to be recognized for their efforts in implementing quality programs, even if they are just at the beginning stage. Expanding this award program will make it more accessible and stir more interest and recognition throughout the state." <BR>  
<Dd>The first level, the Edgerton Award of Commitment, is designed for organizations that are beginning to adopt and apply quality principles. The second level, the Edgerton Award of Progress, recognizes organizations that demonstrate significant advancement in using quality principles. The top level, the Edgerton Award of Excellence, honors organizations demonstrating the highest degree of quality excellence in practices and achievements.<BR>
<Dd>"Moving from one award to a family of awards gives Nebraska companies an opportunity to grow with the program," said Jack Ruff, director of DED's Existing Business Assistance Division. "The program is based on promoting quality awareness at a series of levels, culminating in the highest achievement--the Edgerton Award of Excellence."<BR>
<Dd>Established in 1993, the award was modeled after the Malcolm Baldridge National Award for Qaulity and named after Aurora, Neb. native <a href="docedg.htm">Harold "Doc" Edgerton</a>, who developed the stroboscopic flash. Other past Edgerton award winners include Highland Park Care Center in Alliance; 3-M Valley Plant in Valley; and IAMS Company in Aurora.<BR>

<H1><CENTER>Nebraska's tourism director will retire July 12</CENTER></H1>
<BODY>

<Dd>LINCOLN (June 25, 1996) -- Peggy Briggs, 58, director of the Travel and Tourism Division of the Nebraska Department of Economic Development (DED) today announced she is retiring July 12 from the position she has held since 1984.<BR>
<Dd>"I think I've accomplished what I set out to do, namely to bring awareness to the general public that tourism is an industry that has growth potential and the ability to generate economic development and jobs," Briggs said. "We've used technology and training to help our tourism staff here in Lincoln stay essentially the same size over the past 13 years, while at the same time more than doubling the number of programs and services we offer the tourism industry."<BR>
<Dd>"Peggy has been the catalyst in developing what many people once considered a sideline into a $2 billion tourism industry," said Governor Ben Nelson. "That accomplishment has meant a great deal to economic development, but it did not come easily. It required Peggy to travel constantly, give hundreds of evening talks and attend even more meetings and community celebrations. She worked seven days a week to make sure Nebraskans succeeded in their tourism efforts."  The Travel and Tourism Division marked a number of "firsts" with Briggs as director:<UL> 
<LI>First state to cooperate with movie theaters to run tourism promotion clips. Douglas Theatre Co. now shows the tourism promotion clips prior to each feature film at 66 theaters. The clips should reach about three million moviegoers each year.</LI>
<LI>First tourism office to have a Home Page on the Internet (http://www.ded.state.ne.us/tourism.html).</LI>
<LI>First tourism division in the nation to produce audio cassettes for travelers on Interstate 80 explaining the sights and sounds of Nebraska.</LI>
<LI>First state to sell advertising on its state road map to offset the cost of printing the map in cooperation with the Nebraska Department of Roads.</LI></UL>
<Dd>Briggs said the tourism industry was generating about $1.2 billion annually when she became director.<BR>
<Dd>"Awareness, advertising and service to our travelers have helped the industry nearly double that figure today," she said. 
Briggs was named by her travel industry peers across the nation as state travel director of the year in 1992. She has served three terms on the board of directors of the Travel Industry Association of America, and two terms as chairman of the National Council of State Travel Officers. She was a member of the first Framework Task Force for the White House Conference on Tourism held last fall, and served on the Tourism Advisory Board for the U.S. Travel and Tourism Association.<BR>

<H1><CENTER>Community Builders discuss future at year-end meeting</CENTER></H1>
<BODY>

<dd>DALTON (June 20, 1996) -- The Southern Panhandle Community Builders reviewed its accomplishments and focused on future endeavors at a year-end meeting held on May 20 at the Dalton Fire Hall. The meeting featured presentations by Lucille Cooper, owner of the Dalton Market, and Gary Person, economic development director for Sidney/Cheyenne County. <BR>
<dd>Cooper talked about factors which led her and her husband to purchase the market, and described the products and services they offer to Dalton residents. Person reviewed Sidney's economic growth this past year, and shared information about financing economic development projects and marketing communities. He described Sidney's successful relationship with outlying communities in building economic growth, and emphasized that communities need to work together on strengthening economic development.<BR>
<dd><a href="mailto:sbrowne@ded2.ded.state.ne.us">Suzanne Browne</a>, Nebraska Department of Economic Development's field service representative for western Nebraska, updated attendees on LB 144 grant applications, a videoconference "Community and Infrastructure Development," which will be broadcast to satellite locations statewide on June 21, and the Rural Development Institute in Lincoln in July.  Community Builder participants also reviewed past meetings and shared ideas for improving next year's module. They discussed recruiting new participants, and effectively working with village boards and community groups in completing projects. <BR>
<dd>Before the meeting, the group toured downtown Gurley's post office and former "outdoor theater," where movies were projected on a wall of a downtown building for residents' entertainment. The group also toured Gurney's Egging Co., a manufacturer of steel parts, which contracts with Caterpillar Inc., headquartered in Peoria, Ill.; Dalton's new bean cooperative; and the Prairie Schooner Museum at Dalton which highlights the area's history. During the tour, Community Builders Pat Meick of Gurley and Ted Panas of Dalton offered historical sketches of the communities. The Southern Panhandle Community Builders module is funded in part by a grant from the Omaha World-Herald Foundation.<BR>
<H3>Community Builders History</H3>     
<dd>Established in 1991, Community Builders is a process that builds rural communities' capacities for job creation, business development and financial support by identifying and encouraging local emergent entrepreneurs and potential community leaders. The process, which incorporates features such as vision building, community tours, presentations, small group activities and networking, lets participants choose their own courses for learning about, and developing skills related to specific economic
endeavors.<br>
<dd>Participants in Community Builders get to know each other while attending a series of workshops. They tour one another's communities, identify key issues affecting their region, learn from each others' successful and not-so-successful projects, and build networks that help them make changes in their own communities. Graduates recruit new participants for each subsequent year's module. Currently the number of modules statewide is five and growing.<BR>
<dd>The changes in people's attitudes and creative problem-solving skills that result from this process, motivates participants to promote real change in their communities and regions. The result is sustainable, local economic development.

<H1><CENTER>$35,000 grant boosts work of School-at-the-Center </CENTER></H1>
<BODY>
<B>  
<dd>LINCOLN (June 26, 1996) -- Lynn Phares, president of the ConAgra Foundation in Omaha, today announced that The Nebraska Community Foundation and Nebraska's School-at-the-Center Project will receive a $35,000 gift from the foundation to continue creating a network of community-based rural education systems statewide.<BR>
<dd>"This project fits our overall emphasis in education and benefits rural Nebraska, which is very important to us at ConAgra," Phares said.<BR>
<dd>The ConAgra gift represents a significant linkage to the private sector in Nebraska, said Jerry Hoffman, coordinator for School-at-the-Center. He said it also demonstrates the company's strong commitment to helping develop a rural education agenda which is applicable to the needs of rural Nebraskans. <BR>
<dd>The project was one of 14 invited to become a "national founding partner" in the Annenberg Rural Challenge. The Challenge has committed $500 million to aid national education reform, of which $50 million is earmarked for rural education. 
<dd>"Walter Annenberg's private donation to the national rural education reform movement is reportedly the largest of its kind in U.S. history and really challenges other private and public corporations to follow suit," Hoffman said.
<dd>"We are pleased that our contribution will help School-at-the-Center obtain this significant grant from the Annenberg Foundation," Phares said. <BR>
<dd>The ConAgra Foundation gift will be divided equally among areas in Nebraska where the program is in operation. These include: central (Albion, Petersburg, Silver Creek, Schuyler, Henderson and Palmer), northeast (Walthill, Wakefield, Wayne and South Sioux City) and western (Ogallala, Maxwell, Wallace and Lewellen).<BR>
<dd>Schools in the program areas will be able to apply for mini-grants for joint school-community planning, curriculum development around community issues, administrator and teacher inservice training, and other issues identified by the school-community partnerships. <BR>
<dd>The School-at-the-Center Project was created by Dr. Paul Olson, professor of English, and Dr. Jim Walter, professor of Curriculum and Instruction at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, and further developed from a 1989 rural education study sponsored by the Center for Rural Affairs. In 1993, the <A HREF="http://www.ded.state.ne.us/rdc/rdc.html">Nebraska Rural Development Commission</a> sponsored the project as an initiative, which  invests in the future of Nebraska's rural youth. <BR>
<dd>The project currently is an initiative of the Nebraska Community Foundation, an organization which is receiving and managing all project funding, in addition to helping other  programs and communities mobilize charitable giving in support of community development.<BR>

<H1><CENTER>Communities, counties share $7.9 million in block grants</CENTER></H1>
<BODY>


<dd>LINCOLN (July 3, 1996) -- Gov. Ben Nelson today announced that more than $7.9 million in Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) have been awarded to 48 communities and two counties. Joining the governor for the announcement were Maxine Moul, director of the Nebraska Department of Economic Development (DED), and representatives from Allen, Grand Island and Superior, which all received CDBG funding in 1995.   <BR>
<dd>"These Nebraska communities and counties are taking a holistic approach to meeting the unique and shared needs for increased community and economic development," Nelson said. "Gone are the days when projects served only as a method for correcting a problem. Today's projects often involve advanced studies and planning, and offer prevention and intervention tools  
The local governments will use the awards -- ranging from $4,500 to $450,000 -- to help draft housing and comprehensive community plans, rehabilitate housing, make public works improvements, and other projects in communities ranging in size from Memphis (pop. 115) to Grand Island (pop. 37,695).<BR>
<dd>The 48 communities and two counties awarded this year's CDBG funds are: Ainsworth, Ashland, Atkinson, Bassett, Benedict, Bloomfield, Callaway, Cambridge, Clearwater, Columbus, Creighton, Crete, Curtis, Dannebrog, David City, Dixon County, Geneva, Grand Island, Greeley, Gresham, Guide Rock, Hebron, Henderson, Holdrege, Hooper, Kearney, Laurel, Leigh, Long Pine, Louisville, Marquette, Memphis, Nebraska City, Neligh, Newman Grove, Norfolk, North Platte, Oakdale, Oxford, Page, Pawnee City, Pilger, Polk, Randolph, Red Cloud, Rock County, Silver Creek, Springview, Taylor and Trumbull.<BR>
<dd>"The hard work and planning that has gone into these succesful projects is very evident," Moul said. "In every case, community and county leaders and volunteers have developed future plans which integrate housing, infrastructure, business creation and expansion and other factors. We're glad to be a part of this important process of building for Nebraska's future."
Nebraska receives an annual allocation of CDBG funds from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. The funds are available to local governments and counties in the state with populations less than 50,000. This year, Nebraska communities and counties submitted 56 funding requests totaling more than $15.4 million. In addition, DED's Community and Rural Development Division cooperated with other government agencies to consolidate efforts and provide financial backing for necessary community improvements.

<H1><CENTER> Main Street Program seeks four more communities</CENTER></H1>
<BODY>
<dd>LINCOLN (July 3, 1996) -- Up to four more communities will be selected this year to participate in the Nebraska Lied Main Street Program (NLMSP), a comprehensive community development program that focuses on the revitalization of downtown commercial districts.<BR>
<dd>Each year, a maximum of four communities are selected based on a competitive application and presentation process.  Current Main Street communities are Alliance, Fremont, Red Cloud, Wakefield, Gothenburg, Minden and Ogallala.<BR>
Application workshops on July 12 in Lincoln and July 26 in Alliance will give interested communities the chance to learn about the program, the application process and the selection criteria.  Representatives from NLMSP communities and staff from sponsoring state agencies will answer community-specific questions.<BR>
<dd>The NLMSP was established in 1994 through a grant from the Lied Foundation to allow communities with populations of 50,000 or less to revitalize their main street districts.  NLMSP partners include the University of Nebraska-Lincoln College of Architecture, the Nebraska State Historical Society, the Nebraska Department of Economic Development, and the Nebraska Department of Roads.<BR>
<dd>The state agencies have committed technical assistance, staff and resources to provide nonduplicating, community-specific services to each Main Street community.<BR>
<dd>The Nebraska Lied Main Street Program has built a foundation based on the National Main Street Center's four-point approach: Organization, Design, Promotion and Economic Restructuring,<BR>
<dd>Organization is key to Main Street's success.  Commercial revitalization requires the cooperation and commitment of volunteers, and a broad-based coalition of public and private groups, including businesses, property owners, civic organizations, local, county and state governments, financial institutions, neighborhood organizations and consumers.<BR>
<dd>A downtown area's involves how residents and others view a community.  Improved design quality includes building facades, signs, public areas, traffic patterns, parking, landscaping, roadways, alleys, advertising and image materials.<BR>
<dd>"Downtown revitalization means change, and one of the most visible and dramatic changes a downtown can experience is the rehabilitation of its historic buildings," said Lawrence Sommer, director of the Nebraska State Historical Society.  "When ladders and scaffolds appear on downtown buildings that haven't seen improvements for years, both residents and visitors recognize that positive change is occurring and that a new spirit is awakening on Main Street."<BR>
<dd>Promotion is used to create a positive district image that attracts customers and investors, and rekindles community pride.  Festivals, retail sales events with themes, and a united community -- in image and commitment -- help promote downtown improvements.<BR>
<dd>In the last two years, the Nebraska Lied Main Street Program has leveraged $6.86 in reinvestment per $1 of Lied Foundation giving.  Since 1980, the National Main Street Program has leveraged $5.8 billion in reinvestment in 40 states and 1,200 Main Street communities.  In addition, 115,000 net new jobs have been created, 33,000 net new businesses have been started, and 34,000 buildings have been rehabilitated.<BR>
     For information on the Nebraska Lied Main Street Program, contact Anne Best Johnson or Darice Cecil at Nebraska Lied Main Street, (402) 472-0718. <BR><H3><center>

<H1><CENTER> Housing commission heads West to discuss needs</CENTER></H1>
<BODY>
     

     <dd>LINCOLN (July 5, 1995) -- Members of the Nebraska Affordable Housing Commission traveled to Gordon
   and other communities recently to learn firsthand about the housing needs in western Nebraska and to
   discuss their work as commissioners with community leaders.<BR>
     <dd>Commissioner Rosann Chilton of Gordon, organized and hosted a meeting on June 20, which began with
   a tour of housing projects in Rushville and Chadron.  In Rushville, an 8-unit apartment complex for elderly
   persons will be built adjacent to an existing 12-unit elderly housing project.  The project was funded through
   a loan from the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Rural Development, HOME funds and financing from a local
   bank.<BR>
     <dd>"Late last year, the commission decided it could best accomplish its mission of assessing affordable
   housing needs and of recommending programs and policies to the governor, by traveling throughout Nebraska to meet with local leaders and hear about the housing needs and efforts of communities to meet
   those needs," said Ron Tillery, chair of the Nebraska Affordable Housing Commission.  "In turn, the commission wanted to increase people's awareness about the commission, its mission and plans for the upcoming
   year.  The meeting in Gordon and our tour of parts of northwest Nebraska was a success in both respects."<BR>
     <dd>Representatives from Chadron, the Chadron Housing Development Corp., the chamber of commerce and
   the housing authority also updated commissioners on their affordable housing development efforts.<BR>
     <dd>Marguerite Vey-Miller, executive director of the Chadron Housing Development Corp., led commissioners
   on a tour of several homes that were bought and rehabilitated using funds from HOPE 3, a local non-profit
   organization and HOME program, and modular homes constructed on lots acquired by HOPE 3. The non-
   profit corporation also is collaborating with the local Habitat for Humanity organization to build a home for a low-
   income family.  All homes on the tour will be sold to individuals with incomes at or below 80 percent of
   the median income for the county, said Vey-Miller.<BR>
     <dd>On June 21, the commission met with Vey-Miller and Rick Medema, city administrator in Valentine, to hear
   more about local housing needs and opportunities.  Following the meeting, commissioners toured Gordon's
   housing projects and viewed potential sites for future projects.<BR>
     <dd>On Sept. 17 and 18, the commission will host the Fifth Annual Housing Our Community conference at
   Kearney's Ramada Inn.  The conference targets individuals interested in learning more about affordable
   housing and in discussing issues related to providing affordable housing.  Tentative topics include board
   training for non-profit housing organizations, discussions of state and federal resources for affordable
   housing and highlights of successful housing projects statewide.<BR>

<H1><CENTER>Valmont Industries to expand operations to West Point</CENTER></H1>
<BODY>


<dd>LINCOLN (July 16, 1996) -- Gov. Ben Nelson today announced that West Point has received a $505,000 economic development loan to help Valmont Industries Inc. of Valley expand its operations. Valmont is the world's largest manufacturer of mechanized irrigation systems, and a global leader in designing and manufacturing poles, towers and structures for lighting, communication and utility applications. 
<dd>The expansion will involve construction of a new galvanizing facility in West Point and create a minimum 32 full-time jobs within 18 months of start-up. Groundbreaking for the facility took place on July 11.
<dd>"The partnership forged here between Valmont Industries and West Point has all the ingredients for long-term economic and community prosperity," Nelson said. "Valmont's tradition of quality products and outstanding corporate citizenry provides West Point with the kind of employer that every city hopes to attract. In return, West Point has fully demonstrated its long-term commitment to making its newest employer feel at home."  
<dd>The project is part of an ongoing program directed by the Nebraska Department of Economic Development which encourages and assists with the development and vitality of businesses and communities throughout the state. Federal funds are made available to the State of Nebraska from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program.
<dd>Of the grant, $500,000 will be used to purchase plant machinery and equipment, with $25,000 of this amount from the city's CDBG reuse program income fund. The remaining $5,000 will be available to West Point to cover administrative and audit costs.  West Point also will donate 57 acres valued at more than $250,000 for the plant location. 
<dd>"We are excited about becoming a part of the West Point business community," said Vincent T. Corso, Valmont's vice president for operations. "The new plant will provide Valmont with much needed additional capacity for galvanizing our irrigation and industrial products and for expanding our custom galvanizing business to include other manufacturers."
<dd>Corso added that Nebraska's excellent incentive package, containing the CDBG loan, job training funds, and LB775 (Nebraska's Employment and Growth Act of 1987), a performance-based tax incentive program offering income tax credits and sales and use tax refunds, made the project a win-win situation for everyone.
<dd>"The entire West Point facility project will cost more than $7 million and represents a major investment in the future . . . for Valmont Industries and West Point," said Terry J. McClain, vice president and chief financial officer for Valmont. "We are looking forward to becoming corporate partners with this fast-growing community."
<dd>"We are very pleased that Valmont has selected West Point as the site for their new plant," said Chris Rasmussen, mayor of West Point. "We hope this marks the beginnning of a long and prosperous future for Valmont's new galvanizing facility. It has taken a great deal of work and effort on the part of both the city and Valmont Industries to reach this point and everyone involved in the project is to be congratulated."
 <dd>"Valmont Industries' galvanizing facility is a welcome addition to West Point's south industrial park," said Mark Knobbe, president of the West Point Development Corp. "The new roads and utilities needed for this project, plus available land will give the city more opportunities to attract other companies looking to expand.  And Valmont will provide needed jobs for our community, which also will benefit other local businesses." 
<dd>Construction of the new plant in 1996 coincides with the 50th anniversary of the founding of Valmont Industries by Robert B. Daugherty. After serving in World War II as a Marine, Daugherty started a small farm equipment manufacturing company west of Omaha in Valley.  Through the years, the company added new products and developed innovative manufacturing techniques. The company's most revolutionary product was center pivot mechanized irrigation equipment for crops, which significantly impacted the agriculture industry. 
<dd>The company also manufactures the pipe needed for the irrigation equipment, which led to an expansion into the tapered pole business for use in lighting, traffic signals, electrical transmission and distribution, and wireless communication.
Today, Valmont operates from 18 manufacturing facilities located in eight countries in North America and worldwide. The company is headquartered in Valley and employs more than 4,100 personnel around the world, with about 1,400 employees located in Nebraska.

<H1><CENTER>$376,200 grants awarded to homeless programs</CENTER></H1>
<BODY>
     

<dd>LINCOLN (July 29, 1996) -- Gov. Ben Nelson today announced that the 1996 Nebraska Homeless Assistance Program has awarded its final round of grants totaling $376,200 to 22 non-profit agencies statewide. The funds were received through the Emergency Shelter Grant Program for fiscal year 1996.<br>
<dd>The Nebraska Homeless Assistance Program is made up of both the Homeless Shelter Assistance Trust Fund, and the Emergency Shelter Grant Program (ESGP). Due to an unresolved federal budget situation last February, Nebraska did not receive ESGP allocations until now. <BR>
<dd>Administered by the Nebraska Department of Economic Development, funds are channeled into programs and services that provide shelter and assistance for the homeless, as well as services designed to prevent homelessness.<BR> 
<dd>"The bulk of these funds are going to serve the needs of homeless and near homeless in rural Nebraska," Nelson said. "It's a sad, but cruel reality that homelessness affects Nebraska's urban and rural citizens alike. We expect that these funds will help us address some of these critical needs."<BR>
<dd>In February, the 1996 Nebraska Homeless Assistance Program awarded grants totaling $1.15 million to 55 non-profit agencies statewide from funds received through the Homeless Shelter Assistance Trust Fund. This latest ESGP allocation of $376,200, brings total grant funding to $1,526,200. The program is part of the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Act. The following agencies received grants through the Emergency Shelter Grant Program (ESGP):

<B><H3><dd>LINCOLN (Aug. 1, 1996) -- International financier Warren Buffett is featured in an upcoming Nebraska Department of Economic Development (DED) advertisement promoting Nebraska's pro-growth business climate, quality workforce and standard of living. Buffett is chief executive officer of Omaha-based Berkshire Hathaway.
<dd>“We're pleased Mr. Buffett has agreed to speak on the business qualities of our state.  Worldwide, he is one of our best known and respected business leaders,” said DED Director Maxine Moul.  “His endorsement of our state's business climate will help DED's efforts to attract businesses and new employees to the state.”
<dd>The four-color ad will run in several business recruitment trade publications over the next 12 months.  It contains Buffett’s comments on his personal business philosophy and the advantages of doing business in the state, something he calls a “no brainer.”
“I choose to stay in Nebraska because it has a great deal going for it,” he says in the ad.  “For one thing, Nebraska's pro-business climate makes real economic sense for any type of business.  And, of course, there are all those characteristics we are known for here in Nebraska: clean air, low crime rate, good schools and a Midwestern work ethic.”
<dd>Buffett’s association with DED’s business recruitment efforts was announced at an Omaha press conference last year.  At that time, Gov. Ben Nelson said “attracting highly qualified people to enhance our workforce, as well as attracting new business to the state, are similar challenges.  If I may be so bold as to paraphrase Warren, Nebraska has many ‘undervalued assets.’ We need to tell the world about those assets, and Warren's involvement will ensure that those messages are heeded and carefully considered.”

<BODY>    

<DD>ALLEN (Aug. 27, 1996) -- A shortage of affordable housing in this northeast Nebraska community has drawn city and state officials into a partnership that is reaping dividends in new and rehabilitated housing and economic growth.
<DD>Realizing they had a wealth of job opportunities, but nowhere for people to live, Allen officials applied for and received an $80,000 Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) in 1991 to help low- to moderate-income residents become home owners.  
The grant was made as part of an ongoing program directed by the Nebraska Department of Economic Development (DED) which encourages and assists with the development and vitality of businesses and communities throughout the state. The federal funds, made available to the State of Nebraska from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's CDBG program, are awarded to local governments and counties with populations of 50,000 or less.
<DD>In July, Rob Bock, president of the Allen Development Group, attended the governor's weekly news conference in Lincoln to share his city's success story and to hear the governor award $8,048,550 in 1996 CDBG funds to 48 communities and two counties.
<DD>"That initial CDBG grant really stimulated Allen's economy and challenged us to do more with less," Bock said.
The city formed the non-profit Allen Development Group to administer the CDBG funds, along with $367,000 in local funds for initial down payments.
<DD>During the next three years, 16 families purchased four new and 12 existing homes through the down payment assistance program, sparking a building boom that is still going strong. To date, five more homes have been built, 25 lots developed and a day care center established, said Bock, who added that when all lots are occupied, the city's tax base will increase by 25 percent.
<DD>"The 16 homeowners now are repaying portions of their down payments, which has helped us create a revolvng loan fund for others to achieve their dream of owning homes," Bock said. "We also better understand the need for broad-based strategic planning to continue this process and how building partnerships with DED and other state agencies will only enhance the quality of life for all Nebraska communities."<BR>

<H1><CENTER>Grand Island homes, streets reflect partnership at work</CENTER></H1>
<BODY>

<DD>GRAND ISLAND (Aug. 27, 1996) -- Thirty-six homes constructed along seven newly-paved streets tell the story of a flourishing partnership here between local and state entities--a partnership that is gaining widespread recognition for its commitment to economic growth and vitality.
<DD>With the goal of providing more affordable housing, city officials applied for and received Community Development Block Grants (CDBG) totaling $583,600 between 1992 and 1995. The grants were made as part of an ongoing program directed by the Nebraska Department of Economic Development (DED) which encourages and assists with the development and vitality of businesses and communities throughout the state. The federal funds, made available to the State of Nebraska from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's CDBG program, are awarded to local governments and counties with populations of 50,000 or less.
<DD>In July, Dale Iman, Grand Island's city administrator, attended the governor's  weekly news conference in Lincoln to share his city's success story and to hear the governor award $8,048,550 in 1996 CDBG funds to 48 communities and two counties.
<DD>"If it hadn't been for the CDBG funding, these homes very likely wouldn't have been built, or streets paved," said Dale Iman, Grand Island's city administrator. 
<DD>An additional $1,151,880 in local money raised the total funding to $1,735,480 for the city's Homeownership Opportunity Program (HOP) and related street paving connected to the city's affordable housing development area.
<DD>HOP provides down payment assistance of up to 35 percent of a home's total cost to first-time homebuyers who qualify as low- to middle-income wage earners, said Iman. Built according to HOP guidelines, the 36 single-family homes feature three bedrooms, full basements and attached garages, and are priced at a maximum $70,000 each (including closing costs). 
<DD>These two projects are the latest in a string of successful projects undertaken by the partnership during the past several years, added Iman. Other projects have involved job creation, homeowner and renter rehabilitation, acquisition and (when necessary) demolition of substandard dwellings and infrastructure.<BR>

<H1><CENTER>Superior achieves dual goals with CDBG funding assist</CENTER></H1>
<BODY>
     


<DD>SUPERIOR (Aug. 27, 1996) -- Through a unique local and state partnership, Superior officials effectively solved two of the town's greatest needs -- preserving a historic landmark and creating more elderly housing through the Vestey Center Project.  
<DD>At the heart of the project was the preservation and conversion of the 67-year-old Leslie Hotel into apartments and a community center for elderly residents. Closed in 1985, the three-story hotel needed  major renovation.  A 1993 housing market study revealed that Superior's growing elderly population would benefit from expanded downtown housing, a noon meals program and improved social, recreational and transportation services.  
<DD>Superior launched the Vestey project in 1993 with a $200,000 Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) and $357,730 in HOME funds. The grant was made as part of an ongoing program directed by the Nebraska Department of Economic Development (DED) which encourages and assists with the development and vitality of busineses and communities throughout the state. The federal funds, made available to the State of Nebraska from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's CDBG program, are awarded to local governments and counties with populations of 50,000 or less.
<DD>In July, Dave Autrey, Superior Community Corp. board member, attended the governor's weekly news conference in Lincoln to share his city's success story and to hear the governor award $8,048,550 in 1996 CDBG funds to 48 communities and two counties. The nonprofit Superior Community Corp., supports educational and civic projects and development of affordable housing for low- to middle-income individuals.
<DD>"The CDBG grant was instrumental in helping us preserve our grand old hotel with its rich historic past. This building really serves as the focal point for Superior's downtown revitalization and tourism development plans," Autrey said. 
<DD>Local monies, grants and loans from other programs, such as Rural Economic and Community Development,  Department of Energy and the Federal Home Loan Bank brought the total project to $1.4 million. In January 1994, the hotel was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as part of the Superior Downtown Historic District, which further inspired construction on the project.
<DD>Opened in June, the center features 14 one-bedroom apartments accessed by a full service elevator; a senior/community center with a recreational lobby, coffee and card lounge, public restrooms, kitchen and dining room. The rehabilitation included new electrical wiring, mechanical and plumbing work, sprinkler system, roof and windows.  
<DD>"We're excited and thrilled that we've been able to accomplish two goals that are integral to the growth and vitality of our community, "Autrey said.
<DD>The center is named after Superior native Lady Evelyn Vestey. During the early 1900s, she worked as a secretary for the Vestey Packing Company in Chicago, eventuallly working her way into a management position. She became known as the world's highest paid female executive. Later, she married Lord William  Vestey of England. She maintained close ties to Superior, donating money to various causes and eventually moved back after her husband's death. She is thought to be the only member of English nobility buried in Nebraska.

<dd>The Nebraska Diplomats is a volunteer organization of more than 400 business persons from across Nebraska who assist in recruiting new and expanding businesses for the state as well as encourage other economic development activities.

<H1><CENTER>CDBG funding aids affordable housing in Hastings</CENTER></H1>
<BODY>

<DD>LINCOLN (Sept. 12, 1996) -- The Nebraska Department of Economic Development (DED) has awarded the City of Hastings $233,700 in Community Development Block Grant funds to help construct 40 single-family affordable homes in the city's Southwood Addition. The grant was made as part of an ongoing program directed by DED which encourages and assists with the development and vitality of businesses and communities throughout the state. The federal funds, made available to the State of Nebraska from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's CDBG program, are awarded to local governments and counties with populations of 50,000 or less.
<DD>Of the CDBG funds, $199,700 will be used for street improvements, $15,000 for sanitary sewers and $14,000 for water distribution. The funds will be matched by Hastings through tax increment financing and inkind contributions. The project is part of Hastings/Adams County Housing Development Corporation's efforts to revitalize the available affordable housing in a low- and moderate-income area. Primary to this effort is the establishment of a homeowners association charged with achieving:<ul>
<LI>A sense of neighborhood and belonging on the part of homeowners;</LI>
<LI>Proper maintenance of the housing units and the surrounding commons area;</LI>
<LI>A proposal for reduced-cost daycare service;</LI>
<LI>Homeownership classes covering maintenance, budgeting, etc.</LI></ul>
<DD>In addition, the Hastings/Adams County Housing Development Corporation will work to form a public/private partnership with local employers. Under this innovative system, employers would provide $20 per employee over five years to help expand and maintain affordable housing for employees. The Southwood Addition project is a joint collaboration of DED, the City of Hastings, Hastings/Adams County Housing Development Corporation, Hastings Community Redevelopment Authority, Hastings utilities, local lending institutions and construction firms.

<H1><CENTER>Classic Dairy to expand operations, add jobs</CENTER></H1>
<BODY>

<DD>LINCOLN (Sept.12, 1996) -- Gov. Ben Nelson today announced that Jefferson County has been awarded $203,000 to help Classic Dairy Inc., a family-owned dairy operation, expand its facility and add 10 new full-time jobs. The operation will increase its dairy herd from 200 to 600. Of the amount, $200,000 will be used to purchase equipment. The remaining $3,000 will be available to Jefferson County to cover administrative and audit costs.
<DD>"Classic Dairy is synonymous with quality food products and modernization in the dairy industry and really exemplifies the spirit in which business is conducted throughout our state," Nelson said.  "We're pleased to help Classic Dairy and look forward to celebrating the Engelman's growth and success  into the next century."
Additional funding of $170,000 from National Bank of Commerce in Lincoln also will go toward new equipment. Brothers Dean and Gail Engelman, who co-own the operations will apply $30,000 in equity toward capital expenses, as well as enlist financial support from their individual farming operation, and a Small Business Administration 504 loan from the Nebraska Economic Development Corporation to increase the size of their dairy herd and construct new facilities. The total project is estimated to cost approximately $1.4 million.
<DD>This project is part of an ongoing program directed by the Nebraska Department of Economic Development (DED) which encourages and assists with the development and vitality of businesses and communities throughout the state. Federal funds are made available to the State of Nebraska from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program.
<DD>The operation has been in the Engelman family for four generations, starting up around the turn of the century.  In 1992, the Engelman brothers took up the tradition carried on by their parents, grandparents and great-grandparents. Since then, they have expanded the dairy and farming operation to include 127 cows, 135 heifers and 30 heifer calves and produce an average 70.5 pounds of milk per cow per day.

<BODY>

<DD>ATKINSON (Sept. 19, 1996) -- The public is invited to Alpha Galvanizing's new facilities here Saturday, Sept. 21, starting at 1 p.m.
<DD>Plant General Manager Chuck Blankenship said a dedication ceremony will be followed by guided tours every hour until 4 p.m.
Slated to speak at the dedication are Ted Olson Sr., Alpha CEO; Ted Olson Jr., Alpha president; State Sen. Merton "Cap" Dierks; Gerald Winings, representing the Atkinson Development Corp. and the City of Atkinson; Chuck Hamik, of the Atkinson Chamber of Commerce; Kathy Evert of the Northeast Nebraska Economic Development District; and Paul and Donna Christen of First Western Bancorp.
<DD>Connie Justis, northeast field service representative for the Nebraska Department of Economic Development (DED) will present the Olsons with a plaque in honor of the new facility.
Gov. Ben Nelson, who could not attend the ceremonies, sent a letter congratulating the city and people for their work in getting the plant open.
<DD>"Through the work of those in both the private and public sectors, today's opening was made a reality. This is an outstanding example of how Nebraskans, working together, can create positive business opportunities which make our state an even better place in which to live," Nelson said.
<DD>Alpha Galvanizing's "heart" is a 50-ton, 46-foot-long tank that holds a molten zinc mixture used to coat metal units such as irrigation pipe and farm implements to prevent rust.
<DD>The company's approximately $3.5 million investment includes facilities to employ 35-40 people working a six-day week with two shifts. DED contributed a $500,000 loan to help fund the overall project. The facility will serve a 10-state Midwest region, all within easy rail or semi truck range of Atkinson.

<H1><CENTER>Commission endorses UNO-UNL technology school</CENTER></H1>
<BODY>

<DD>LINCOLN (Sept. 23, 1996) -- The Nebraska Economic Development Commission has unanimously endorsed an Institute for Information Science, Technology and Engineering in Omaha.
<DD>The commission, meeting at the Cornhusker Hotel, agreed with Chairman A. F. "Tony" Raimondo's assessment that the institute will give Nebraska a needed edge in helping existing businesses improve their technological capabilities and in encouraging technology-based companies of all sizes to consider locating in Nebraska. The commission regularly advises the Nebraska Department of Economic Development (DED) on issues affecting the state's economic future.
<DD>"What I see for such an institute is a tremendous opportunity for Nebraska to have a world-class signature program in engineering, information science and technology," Raimondo said. "I think this proposal institute meets the state's needs from east to west and from north to south. It's appropriate for us to consider this project because the university will ask the Nebraska Legislature for funds next year to augment those being raised from the private sector."
<DD>The institute's budget includes $37 million for the building that will house the programs. The private sector has committed $14 million to supplement the $23 million requested from the state for construction. Last session, the Legislature provided $500,000 for project planning. An additional $30 million in private funds will be raised to support scholarships and faculty support, which will help the university recruit the" best and the brightest' students and faculty, according the J. B. Milliken, the university's vice president for external affairs and corporation secretary.
<DD>"We're very excited about this multi-campus, interdisciplinary approach," Milliken said. "We believe this partnership between the private sector and the university is a model program."
<DD>He said that both the UNO College of Information Science and Technology and the UNL College of Engineering and Technology will offer teaching, research and technical assistance through the new institute, which will have policy guidance from business and industry.
<DD>Milliken said the university is prepared to build on the UNO campus, but if the Ak-Sar-Ben site gains approval, that site will offer the advantage of a stronger higher education-business relationship. He noted that a study commissioned by the Greater Omaha Chamber of Commerce showed that the majority of engineers to be hired by Nebraska companies during the next several years will be in the fields of electronics, telecommunications and computing, he said, areas that will be targeted by the new institute.
<DD>In other business, the commissioners:    
<DD><LI>Voted to oppose ballot proposals in November that would alter the Nebraska Constitution by capping property taxes and the redefining of quality education with no upward control.</LI>
<DD><LI>Approved the following appointments to the Community Development Block Grant Advisory Committee: Lea Ann Strain, clerk of the Town of Lyman, Allen Schroder, chairman of the Leigh Town Board; Julie Everson, a Wymore city council member.</LI>
<DD><LI>Accepted a report from DED Director Maxine Moul on a preliminary list of legislative proposals for next session of the Legislature. Commissioner Bill Harris of Lincoln noted that DED's list parallels the needs expressed by business leaders at a recent Business Summit.</LI>

<H1><CENTER>Conference honors housing projects, activities, individuals</CENTER></H1>
<BODY>


<DD>LINCOLN (Sept. 24, 1996) -- Individuals representing a variety of affordable housing projects and activities have received awards from the Nebraska Affordable Housing Commission as part of this year's Housing Our Community Conference held in Kearney. The commission is affiliated with the Nebraska Department of Economic Development and its Community and Rural Development Division which are involved in the creation of affordable housing and the prevention of homelessness statewide.
"Housing Our Community" award winners are Cozad Mayor Catherine Walters, Dakota City, Cattle National Bank of Seward, Blue Valley Community Action Inc. in Fairbury, and Jim Caruso, former director of Urban Development for Lincoln.  
<DD>Under Mayor Walters' leadership, Cozad has completed many housing projects including development and passage of minimum rental housing standards; development of a down payment assistance program with Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) funds for first-time homebuyers; construction of six units specifically for first-time homebuyers with the Neb-Hi-Red program; development of a rental rehabilitation program; and support for the development of a Dawson County Community Housing Development Organization to promote housing.
<DD>From 1990 to 1994, Dakota City's population grew from 1,470 to 1,580. Since 1994, 30 new housing units have been built. The city's total assessed real estate value increased 9.3 percent in 1994-1995 and 8.57 percent in 1995-1996, compared to 7.01 percent for South Sioux City and 6.87 percent for Dakota County in 1995-1996.
Dakota City officials attribute the increasing numbers to the city's goal of creating more housing by focusing on infrastructure development and improvements.
<DD>For example, the city successfully implemented a first-time homebuyer's program and was a pilot community in the Neb-Hi-Red program which constructed and sold five starter homes. Because of the program's success,  the contractor is now working with the city on a private project to build homes for the moderate income market.
<DD>Cattle National Bank and vice president Donna Eicher were key in creating the Seward County Housing Corporation and constructing 16 homes in Seward County. HOME Funds were used to help low- and middle-income families in Seward County with down payments. CDBG funds were used to develop infrastructure for a Seward housing subdivision.  
<DD>Blue Valley Community Action (BVCA) in Fairbury has expanded its role during the past three years to include the development and construction of housing within its nine-county service area. BVCA was one of the first state-designated Community Housing Development Organizations (CHDO) to own, sponsor and develop affordable housing using HOME Investment Partnership Program funds, administered by the Nebraska Department of Economic Development.  The organization, which has helped create more than 50 affordable housing units in Nebraska, continually works to ensure that its communities' housing is safe and that housing development needs are met.
<DD>Under the leadership of Jim Caruso, former director of urban development, the city of Lincoln created the Lincoln Community Development Partnership, an intermediary organization that provides technical and financial assistance for increasing affordable housing; created a $1.5 million home improvement and energy conservation program; established the Housing Development Loan Program, a gap financing tool instrumental in developing new housing; and developed the HOME and CDBG programs, as well as eight tax credit projects totaling 292 affordable housing units. 
<DD>A member of the America Institute of Certified Planners, in April, Caruso received the Career Professional Award from the Nebraska Chapter of the American Society for Public Administration for "advancing excellence in public service."
He has more than 29 years experience in local government and private practice in the areas of housing and community development in Lincoln, Rochester, New York, Highland Park, Mich., and Warren, Ohio.
<DD>A special "Housing Our Community" award was presented to Gov. Ben Nelson for his pro-active stance on housing. During his administration, he has created the Nebraska Affordable Housing Commission, the Equity Fund of Nebraska and the Nebraska Affordable Housing Trust Fund.
<DD>The "Governor's Partnership" award was given to the Superior Community Corporation in recognition of its $1.4 million Vestey Center project which renovated the former Leslie Hotel into a senior activity area and elderly apartments. The project was funded through the CDBG program, Federal Home Loan Bank, U.S. Department of Agriculture's Rural Development, Nebraska Department of Roads' Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act, Affordable Housing program, Kiewit Foundation and Nebraska Department of Energy Weatherization, as well as cash contributions from local businesses and individuals and an estimated 2,300 volunteer hours.

<EM><FONTSIZE = "4">$722,500 to fund business development projects</FONTSIZE></EM><BR><H1>Revised CDBG program creates funding opportunity in 1996</H1>
<BODY>


<DD>LINCOLN (Sept. 25, 1996) —The Nebraska Department of Economic Development (DED) is accepting applications  for a total $722,500 in funding to be awarded to projects qualifying under the revised Community Development Block Grant program’s  (CDBG) Business Development Category. Grants of up to $100,000 each will be awarded to projects based on performance and the ability to produce a minimum 50 percent match of total activity costs. New and past grantees alike can apply for funding.
The process will remain open until all funds are committed. 
<DD>Eligible applicants are local Nebraska governments with populations of 50,000 or less, and all Nebraska counties. Applicants receiving the grants, in turn, pass funding onto subrecipients undertaking the activities or delivering services. Projects (or subrecipients) qualifying for funding include business incubators with or without walls;  microenterprise programs; manufacturing productivity enhancement; and information technology programs. All projects must meet one of two national objectives: benefit low- to moderate-income persons, or aid in preventing or eliminating slums and blight.
<DD>The program was revised when a statewide survey of past grantees, and a program assessment and evaluation conducted by DED’s Community and Rural Development Division, recommended changing the qualification guidelines. Grants previously were awarded to projects on a one-time basis. The program is directed by DED which encourages and assists with the development and vitality of businesses and communities throughout the state. Federal funds are made available to the State of Nebraska from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development’s CDBG program.

Huenefeld, 87, planted the first tree farm in thestate before spending a liftime preserving Nebraska heritage. His energy and foresight helped create the new Edgerton center, a "hands-on" discovery center named for internationally known scientist Harold E. "Doc" Edgerton, an Aurora native and inventor of the strobe light.

<BR><DD>LINCOLN (OCT. 9, 1996) — At a news conference at an Interstate 80 rest area and              
 visitors’ center north of Lincoln, Governor Ben Nelson unveiled                
 the 1996 Travel and Tourism Industry Development Plan for the                  
 State of Nebraska.  The plan is the culmination of more than 18                
 months of input from the public and private sectors on increasing              
 tourism development opportunities throughout the state.  Funded                
 by a $90,000 grant from the U.S. Department of Commerce, the plan              
 is the first comprehensive update in 20 years and contains more                
 than 250 recommendations.                                                      
<DD>“One can expect that Nebraska travel and tourism will not only                 
 continue to grow, but will increasingly become more varied,”                   
 Nelson said.  “That means businesses and communities will have                 
 many more options in choosing what to develop and market to                    
 tourists.  The underlying objectives of this plan are the                      
 realization that travel and tourism is an industry of                          
 considerable diversity and potential for growth throughout                     
 Nebraska, benefitting both large and small communities, and many               
 small as well as large businesses.”
                                                                                
 <DD>Tourism is the state's third largest income-producing industry                 
 behind agriculture and manufacturing.  It has grown from a $400                
 million industry in 1975 to a $2 billion industry in 1995.  More               
 than 36,000 Nebraskans are employed in the tourism sector.                     
                                                                                
<DD> “Nebraska is a state rich in natural history and natural beauty,”              
 Nelson said.  “Economic development opportunities abound from                  
 border to border that are linked to our past and to our future.                
 Our goal is to support local initiatives which will attract                    
 visitors to our state.  The public and private sectors must                    
 continue to work as partners to convince travelers to spend more               
 time and dollars visiting attractions all across Nebraska,                     
 creating jobs and boosting local and state economies as a                      
 result.”
                                                                                
<DD> Nelson said the 1996 Nebraska Tourism Industry Development Plan                
 is the result of an unprecedented amount of public, state agency               
 and private industry leadership.  The planning process included                
 16 public meetings held throughout Nebraska from March of 1995 to              
 January of 1996.  The planning staff also conducted more than 100              
 on-site attraction visits throughout the state.  The result is                 
 more than 250 recommendations including 34 regional benchmark                  
 projects, which have been identified as desirable for the long                 
 term and attainable in the short term.                                         
                                                                                
 <DD>“This plan is the result of an exhaustive 18 month effort                      
 statewide, with input coming from private industry, state and                  
 federal agencies and town hall meetings,” said Maxine Moul,                    
 director of the Nebraska Department of Economic Development.  “We              
 believe this plan will lead to more cooperative efforts in the                 
 development and enhancement of Nebraska's tourism product.”                   
                                                                                
<DD> The Department of Economic Development’s Travel and Tourism                    
 Division has estimated there were 16 million non-resident visits               
 in Nebraska in 1995.  One of the key assets to tourism                         
 development in the state is Interstate 80.  Ninety-two percent of              
 all visitors to Nebraska travel on Interstate 80 at some point                 
 during their time in Nebraska.  Fifty-seven percent of all                     
 visitors to Nebraska travel only on Interstate 80.  Since more                 
 than 95 percent of all visits to Nebraska are made via motor                   
 vehicle, Nelson said it is important for the industry to identify              
 ways to divert motorists from the interstate to spend more time                
 in Nebraska.                                                                   
                                                                                
<DD> “Stretching from the East Coast to the West Coast, Interstate 80               
 connects some of the nation's most populous metropolitan areas,”              
 Nelson said. “It is the most traveled transcontinental highway                
 in the United States, providing a large volume of visitors to                  
 Nebraska on a daily basis.  It is our state's single greatest                  
 tourism asset.  Our challenge is to convince those traveling the               
 Interstate to spend more time in Nebraska, to experience our                   
 'Good Life' on the less beaten path.”                                          
                                                                                
 <DD>Nelson said the tourism plan and its recommendations provide a                 
 framework for the future.                                                      
                                                                                
 <DD>“We recognize the importance of planning and partnerships between              
 the public and private sectors,” Nelson said.  “Working together               
 we can continue to 'grow' Nebraska through economic development                
 opportunities throughout our state.”

<H1><CENTER>Five communities invited to give Main Street presentations</CENTER></H1>
<BODY>

<dd>LINCOLN (Oct. 10, 1996) — Bassett, Beatrice, McCook, Scottsbluff and Wisner have been invited to make presentations to the Nebraska Lied Main Street Program selection subcommittee on Wednesday, Oct. 16, at the Museum of Nebraska History, 15th and P Streets, Lincoln, Nebraska.
<dd>The five were among 37 communities ranging in population from 300 to 25,000 that were interested in becoming a 1996-1997 Nebraska Lied Main Street Program community.
<dd>“We are pleased with the quality of applicants this year,” said Anne Best Johnson, program director. “The five communities selected have diverse opportunities to strengthen their economic futures through tourism, business recruitment and historic preservation.”
<dd>“Our past is part of our future,” said Maxine Moul, director of the Nebraska Department of Economic Development. “Main Street communities recognize the importance of preserving their heritage in a way that increases their potential to attract businesses to their downtown areas and, at the same time, welds a firm bond between volunteers and the business community.”
The first round of screening includes looking at applications submitted by interested communities. During the second round, the selection subcommittee looks for the following attributes:
<dd>• A clear understanding of how the Main Street Program can fit into the community.
<dd>• Potential to build broad-based community support.
<dd>• Potential to build financial and organizational support for an ongoing program.
<dd>• Cooperative attitude among community-based service and development organizations.
<dd>• Historically-significant buildings and open spaces.
<dd>• Market potential, community commitment and determination.
<dd>“The continued successes of local Main Street Programs is directly attributed to concerned citizens finding strengths and opportunities for development in their older and historic main street buildings,” said Lawrence Sommer, director of the Nebraska State Historical Society.
<dd>Moul noted that the present Main Street communities of Alliance, Fremont, Red Cloud, Wakefield, Gothenburg, Minden, and Ogallala already are experiencing progress in accomplishing their community goals.
<dd>“I’m pleased that Main Street has delivered on its promise to be a unifying force in the rebirth of our communities across the state. In 1995, the program generated nearly eight dollars for every one contributed by the Lied Foundation. We want to continue to build on that success,” said Moul.
<dd>Community presentations will be evaluated by sponsoring state agencies and Advisory Council representatives — the Nebraska State Historical Society, Nebraska Department of Economic Development, Nebraska Department of Roads, University of Nebraska College of Architecture, and EdwardJones[sic] Investment Company.

<BODY><FONT SIZE = 4>

<dd>LINCOLN (Jan. 7, 1997) — Gov. Ben Nelson today announced that $107,375 in Community Development Block Grants (CDBG) have been awarded to Crawford, Crete, Dorchester, Falls City, Louisville, Mullen, Norfolk, Spalding and Union for planning projects. In all, 19 applicants requested $267,568 as part of the second CDBG funding cycle for 1996.
<dd>“Communities across Nebraska are realizing how important careful planning is to laying the groundwork for economic growth and stability,” Nelson said. “With these funds, a community moves one step closer to achieving the goals unique to its own residents, as well as accomplishing greater good for all Nebraskans.”     
<dd>Nebraska receives an annual allocation of CDBG and HOME funds from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. The funds, which are available to local governments and counties in Nebraska with populations less than 50,000, are administered through the Nebraska Department of Economic Development (DED). In addition, DED’s Community and Rural Development Division cooperates with other government agencies to consolidate efforts and provide financial backing for necessary community improvements. The projects include:
<dd>• Crawford: $3,500 to prepare a comprehensive plan and zoning regulations.
<dd>• Crete: $6,000 to conduct studies on the need for housing and youth facilities and activities.
<dd>• Dorchester: $7,900 to prepare a comprehensive plan and update development procedures.
<dd>• Falls City: $19,475 to conduct a regional housing needs assessment.
<dd>• Louisville: $9,500 to evaluate the municipal water distribution system.
<dd>• Mullen: $20,000 to prepare a comprehensive plan and housing assessment.
<dd>•  Norfolk: $12,900 to assess potential public and private barriers to fair housing.
<dd>• Spalding: $15,500 to prepare a comprehensive plan and housing profile.
<dd>• Union: $12,600 to prepare a comprehensive plan that includes a zoning ordinance. 
<dd>More than $8 million has been awarded during the two CDBG funding cycles. Last July, 48 communities and two counties were awarded $7.9 million for housing, planning, comprehensive revitalization and public works projects as part of the first funding cycle.

<H2>A Multimedia Computer Based Training Introduction to Human
Factors </H2>

<P>
In all types of training the success of a course is largely determined
by the motivation of the participants and the relevance they see
in the matter taught, and one of the main problems faced by an
instructor is to overcome this first hurdle. This is especially
true in the case of human factors safety training where the mere
thought of the consequences of a serious error easily leads many
operators to refuse accepting the possibility of committing an
error, and hence to take a negative attitude towards receiving
human factors training, even before attending a course.
<P>
In the development of the JRC-CRM, a 3-day Crew Resource Management
seminar for airline pilots, this problem was tackled by using
multimedia computer based training (CBT) technology to give the
participants their first introduction to human factors.
<P>
The CBT developed for this purpose presents the participant with
case studies of human factors involved in real, well known and
recent accidents. The use of multimedia - especially video - provides
an efficient way to present critical situations in a way that
allows the participant to recognise the situation, the problems
encountered and the behaviour of the persons involved as realistic
and similar to his/her own working environment. From this recognition,
the participant is invited to reflect over the reasons of the
behaviour of the team and its individual members, and during that
process the participant may recognise traces in his/her own behaviour
that the participant him/herself believes may be improved.
<P>
Other media - especially text - may accompany the video to focus
on details that may be difficult to see on video, to provide some
explanation of particular actions or technical aspects unknown
to the participant and in general to give a guidance to the material.
<P>
Given that the purpose is to create a positive attitude towards
the human factors related problems, it is very important not to
focus only on negative examples of human error, but also to show
positive examples of accidents or critical situations where the
human operators have changed the outcome of a dangerous situation
in a positive direction through a productive behaviour
<P>
The use of multimedia has a tendency to leave the user watching
the events passing by, without reasoning deeply about the subjects
presented. To counteract this tendency, the system developed uses
short video presentations which the participant must select actively,
and the presentation is accompanied by a list of open questions
about the behaviour of the individuals and the team during the
accident sequence. The participant is invited to answer with his
or her personal impression, and can choose to answer with short,
simple answers or give longer, deeper answers if (s)he wishes.
<P>
As not all participants can be expected to have knowledge about
using a computer, the interface has been designed to provide a
straightforward interaction, using metaphors already known to
the participant. For the JRC-CBT a simple page turning/screen
changing architecture has been adopted since that is a widespread
architecture in computer based automation systems. Operators with
experience from automated control rooms will therefore feel relatively
at ease with the system, even if they do not have any particular
PC background. The input to the system from the participant is
also restricted to mouse clicks on buttons, a concept that by
experience is quickly understood by all users. The answers to
the questions mentioned above are given on paper, a system that
is easy to understand by everyone, leads to more elaborate answers,
and gives the participant an immediate feeling of anonymity towards
the Computer Based Training system.<HR>

<P>
<IMG SRC="kegfpps.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM">
<P>
A screen from the CBT showing the flight path of Boeing 737 crashed
due to a wrong engine shut down by the pilots. The video is showing
a re-construction of the scene in the cockpit during the decision
to shut down the engine. <HR>

<P>
The CBT leaves it to the participant to choose the pace in which
to go through the material, and he or she is supposed to use it
without the help of an instructor. It is not a traditional Computer
Based Training program, however, since it does not teach concise
knowledge, it does not contain a syllabus, nor does it pose questions
with right or wrong answers checked automatically by the computer.
Instead, it offers a presentation of event sequences during accidents
and leaves it open to the participant to search for information
to deepen the understanding of the problem. This loose structure
of the multimedia presentation is contrasted by the more precise
format of the questions, which gives an objective to the search
for information in the multimedia system. Users who do not want
to exploit the material freely can follow a linear structure by
turning pages and going through the events chronologically.
<P>
The JRC-CBT has been used by an Italian charter operator as the
preparatory training for a larger Crew Resource Management training
program. The experience has underlined the usefulness of multimedia
as introduction to human factors as well as a means to catch the
attention of the participants.

FEDERAZIONE MOTOCICLISTICA ITALIANA
<P>
MOTO CLUB D'ITALIA - ENTE MORALE
<P>
<P>
Si rinnova anche quest'anno uno dei piu' prestigiosi incontri del mondo motociclistico internazionale: quella Rosa d'inverno che appare veramente come un il fiore all'occhiello di uno dei più blasonati moto club italiani. Un incontro che da 34 anni regolarmente richiama migliaia di appassionati delle due ruote per un appuntamento che, senza dubbio di smentite, è unico e irripetibile. Vuoi per lo scenario in cui si svolge, vuoi per l'insolita data che presuppone - specie per i più lontani - un'impresa non solo sportiva ma in alcuni casi addirittura agonistica. Ed è proprio questo il fascino della Rosa: partecipare a dispetto delle distanze, a dispetto del maltempo (speriamo di no !), comunque a dispetto dell'inoltrato inverno.
<P>
E far fiorire una Rosa in pieno inverno è un'opera di alto giardinaggio che solo i benemeriti soci del Moto Club Milano sono riusciti a compiere per 34 anni, biennio dopo biennio, in concomitanza con quella prestigiosa ed unica manifestazione del Salone della Moto.
Per un giorno Milano sarà dei motociclisti che sfileranno compatti dal Centro Commerciale di Bonola sino all'ingresso principale del Salone.  La conclusione dei tre giorni previsti dagli organizzatori per chi vorrà usufruire di prenotazioni, sconti, intrattenimenti e cene.
<P>
Sono queste manifestazioni - anche se la Rosa è unica nel suo genere - a farci conoscere, a dimostrare che il motociclista e il motociclismo non sono quelli che sono descritti con cattiveria e disinformazione.- sono un piccolo popolo di appassionati, di sportivi puri, di gente che ama soprattutto la libertà, un modo di vivere, nel rispetto della natura e delprossimo.
<P>
Vogliamo ricordare alcune date. 1911 nasce il Moto Club Milano, lo stesso anno in cui la FMI comincia a muovere i primi passi.  E quasi ogni biennio si rinnova la Rosa d'inverno insieme a quella rassegna del motociclo che ha fatto di Milano la capitale delle dueruote.  Oggi, 35' edizione della Rosa e 54' Salone, 1 3appuntamento entusiasmante è ancora una volta con il Moto Club Milano e con la sua città.
Un appuntamento da non mancare.
<P>
La FMI vuole ringraziare il sodalizio lombardo per la sua opera, per la continuità della sua organizzazione. E, personalmente appare doveroso stringere con calore e affetto la mano di tutti coloro - dirigenti e soci - che con passione, amore e vero senso sportivo, sono stati in grado nel passato e sono ancora oggi in grado di offrirci una manifstazione unica.  In altre parole di far fiorire, a Milano una splendida Rosa d'inverno.

   
<P>
<P>
  
Il Presidente FMI

La Gazzetta dello Sport

<P>
La "Rosa d'inverno" nasconde, dietro un'espressione gentile e accattivante, una delle iniziative più antiche e popolari del mondo della moto.  La tradizione è un bene prezioso e il Moto Club Milano ha saputo ben custodirlo. Per noi della "Gazzetta", oltretutto, si tratta di un bene di famiglia.  La moto, in tutte le sue espressioni, appartiene infatti alla storia del nostro giornale, sulle orme di un indimenticabile personaggio, Alberto Bonacossa, che ne è stato fervente appassionato e prestigioso uomo-guida anche in campo internazionale.
<P>
Un raduno come "La Rosa d'invemo" dà, prima di tutto, un senso di libertà.  Tutto è affidato a una scelta, a un divertimento, al gusto di stare insieme, al desiderio di un giomo diverso: sullo sfondo dell'amore per la moto, sentimento che in Italia trova proseliti in ogni regione.  Anche l'aspetto turistico è importante.  Il turismo in moto, un viaggio in moto: ecco il sogno per i giovani che vedono in quelle due ruote il primo mezzo e la prima conquista di libertà personale.  E turismo, non dimentichiamolo, significa anche cultura.
<P>
Ma "La Rosa d'inverno', nota dovunque, conserva anche il suo antico e indelebile timbro lombardo, cioè di una regione che alla moto, in questo secolo, ha dato quasi novanta costruttori, piccoli e grandi, poi scremati dal tempo delle mode, dalle concorrenze intemazionali e dalle ricorrrenti crisi.
<P>
Bentornata, dunque, questa "Rosa d'inverno" in un momento felicissimo per il nostro motociclismo agonistico, fiero dei suoi grandi campioni.  Anche la "Gazzetta" è rosa: un rosa storico che si appresta ai suoi cento anni.
<P>
Dalle sue pagine, cari motociclisti, un abbraccio pieno di affetto.

<P>
Candido C.

<title>Introduction to the SIMPATICO model</title>

<H1>Introduction to the SIMPATICO model</H1>

<P>
The model allows the simulation of pilot cognitive activity when
performing the planning and the execution of the descent phase.
<P>
The impact of temporal stress and mental load is taken into account
since it determines the level of behaviour in which the model
takes its decisions and, most of all, evaluate the current situation.
<P>
The situation awareness (the big picture of what is going on)
and the decision making mechanisms are based on the notion of goal
<a href="publcns/csapc_al.ps">(cf. article in PostScript format)</A>. 
Indeed, the monitoring
of the situation is driven by the current goal and hypothesis
of what is going on. Conversely, the choice of the current goal
relies in the experience and the recognition of the current situation.
Most of the decisions are not taken analytically but intuitively.
Thus, the codification of the pilot's expertise is determinant
in such a model.
<P>
The SIMPATICO model has some links with the <A HREF="cosimo.htm">COSIMO</A>.
However, we are not focusing on the diagnostic but more on the
planning and the adaptation of the activity to the context.<HR>

<H3>LOCATION OF CONFERENCE </H3>

<P>Linkoping is situated in the southern part of Sweden, about 200 km south
of Stockholm. During the past fifty years Linkoping has grown from a small
town to one of the major cities in Sweden. It is at the forefront of industrial
research with many industries based on evolving technologies. Linkoping
University was founded 1969 and has since rapidly grown. It has a reputation
as the most dynamic university in Sweden. A science park close to the university
is one of the fastest growing in the world. Today, Linkoping is home to
about 130, 000 people. Many of them work in the health and welfare services,
in education, and in engineering. It is the aeronautic center of Sweden.
Saab Aircraft and Saab Military Aircraft are based in the city. Some of
the attractions in the area are: Old Linkoping, an old town center reconstructed
with preserved buildings from the 18th and 19th centuries, the Gota Canal
with all its locks, and Vadstena a small medieval town with a castle from
the 16th century and a monastery church from the 14th century as main attractions.
The Copenhagen-Stockholm railway line passes through the city, as does
the Euro-highway E4. The local airport has regULar flights connecting to
domestic and international destinations. There is also an airport in the
city of Norrkoping, 40 minutes north of Linkoping by car. Linkoping is
a two hour drive from Stockholm.</P>

It is generally agreed that dissemination channels for research results and practical experience are essential if modern safety 
practices are to be widely adopted. At present this directory only considers European and international mechanisms. 
Dissemination channels also exist at the Member State level (e.g. the Safety Critical Systems Club in the UK). If there were a 
demonstrable need (e.g. to promote informal European links) this could be expanded to include such dissemination channels. 
The ENCRESS initiative (see below) will investigate the possibilities of such european links.<P>

This section identifies some safety related programmes being pursued in member states. At present the only programmes 
included are from the UK and Germany. If this information is considered to have relevance at the European level (e.g. to 
inform other Member states of parallel or complementary activities), this section needs to be expanded to include the activities 
of all Member States.<P>

<ul>a) assistere mediante l'INFORMAZIONE e l'AGGIORNAMENTO le famiglie degli audiolesi e promuovere l'incontro fra le stesse;<br>
b) promuovere un'attiva partecipazione dei familiari dei bambini audiolesi alla conoscenza, allo studio e alla 
risoluzione dei problemi derivanti dalla minorazione uditiva;<br>
c) promuovere e sollecitare indagini e ricerche sulle cause dell'insufficienza uditiva e sui metodi di diagnosi e cura;<br>
d) sollecitare l'intervento degli enti, delle strutture sanitarie e dei servizi competenti, per la diagnosi precoce, 
per una corretta protesizzazione e assistenza nel tempo e per una adeguata riabilitazione degli audiolesi;<br> 
e) affermare il diritto allo studio degli audiolesi nella scuola pubblica mediante un corretto inserimento e 
i necessari supporti tecnici e strumentali;
f) favorire l'inserimento nel mondo del lavoro in condizione di parità con i normoudenti, nel rispetto delle 
esigenze specifiche degli audiolesi;<br>
g) sensibilizzare l'opinione pubblica sui problemi delle persone non udenti promuovendo conferenze, 
dibattiti e informando dell'esistenza di un cambiamento radicale nella potenzialità degli audiolesi;<br>
h) sollecitare, presso gli enti e i servizi competenti, gli interventi anche di carattere legislativo idonei 
a risolvere i problemi degli audiolesi e consentire il miglior inserimento nella scuola, nel lavoro e nella società;<br>
i) contribuire con iniziative di varia natura a favorire lo sviluppo culturale degli audiolesi;<br>
l) promuovere incontri, convegni e confronti con altre associazioni, con esperti e ricercatori in Italia ed all'estero 
per lo studio e la soluzione delle problematiche conseguenti alla sordità.<br>

EWICS TC7 PLC SUBGROUP BRIEFING PAPER</H2>

<H3>1. Introduction</H3>

<P>EWICS TC7 (European Workshop on Industrial Computer Systems, Technical
Committee 7, Safety, Reliability and Security) is an international workshop
of experts in the field of dependability of industrial computer systems
with respect to safety, reliability and security (for general details of
EWICS TC7 are elaborated in another leaflet).</P>

<P> The PLC Subgroup was set up at the beginning of 1992. Previously the
workshop had been concentrating on producing guidelines and pre-standards
in the field of safety critical industrial computer systems. These guidelines
have been published in three books 'Dependability of Critical Computer
Systems, Vol. 1-3'. Using this base of experience and inviting experts
involved in safety critical PLC applications the workshop started work
on PLCs . This work is being undertaken in co- operation with other EWICS
Subgroups, such as 'Systems Security'. </P>

<P>The PLC Subgroup is developing a guideline directly targeted to the
application of PLC's in safety critical systems with an intended audience
of users by users, procurers, developers and assessors / certifiers. The
intention is to take international and national standards as a base and
to extend those criteria / requirements applicable to PLC's . By this guidance
can be given how the parties involved in the PLC life-cycle can meet the
requirements.</P>

<P> </P>

<H3>2. Problem Statement</H3>

<P>PLCs are at present being increasingly used in a wide range of industrial
sequence control, interlocking and safety applications. The flexibility
of the PLC, coupled with the ease in which its transfer functions can be
defined, accounts for its increasing popularity. These aspects, and the
relatively low cost of a PLC, have resulted in traditional hard wired controllers
becoming less attractive resulting in their withdrawal from the market-place.
This creates further pressure for the use of PLCs.</P>

<P> The advantages gained from a PLC are accompanied by inevitable disadvantages.
PLCs are easy to access and to reprogram. Therefore security and integrity
are problem areas and awareness of the implications of change or access
must be increased. The user of a PLC may have no knowledge or guarantee
of the reliability and quality of the embedded software. The manufacturer
may change the design of the hardware and the software without the user
becoming aware. This means every application must be considered a new application.</P>

<P> The transfer function is defined in the application software. This
may be developed by persons with little or no knowledge of software development,
verification, validation and safety principles as they apply to software.</P>

<P> These safety related aspects of the design, manufacture, use and maintenance
of PLCs urgently need investigating guidelines provided for all the parties
involved in specification, procurement, supply, use and maintenance.</P>

<P> </P>

<H3>3. Progress to Date</H3>

<P>The subgroup has over twenty members from eight European countries and
the United States, being from industry, universities and assessment / licensing
bodies. The subgroup meets four times a year with an average attendance
of around fifteen members. </P>

<P>Work has been undertaken on review of papers elaborated in the former
EWICS PLC Subgroup. Based on this, additional information has been disseminated
in the subgroup concerning different life-cycle scenarios in safety related
PLC applications. The parties involved in these procedures have been identified
as users, procurers, developer and assessor / certifiers. Information about
their different roles has been collected that led to a guideline structure
including plant level aspects, PLC system requirements down to integration,
commissioning and assessment / certification. Some chapters of the guideline
have already been elaborated in detail, whereas others are being discussed
and fixed. A contents list of the PLC Guideline is contained in Annex A.
International and national standards are being taken into account, particularly
the work of IEC SC65A WG9 and 10 and the IEC 1131 standard.</P>

EWICS TC7 FORMAL METHODS SUBGROUP BRIEFING PAPER</H2>

<H3>1. Introduction</H3>

<P>EWICS TC7 (European Workshop on Industrial Computer Systems, Technical
Committee 7, Safety, Reliability and Security) is an international workshop
of experts in the field of dependability of industrial computer systems
with respect to safety, reliability and security. (The general details
of EWICS TC7 and the work of the other subgroups are elaborated in other
leaflets).</P>

<P> </P>

<H3>2. Problem Statement</H3>

<P>Formal methods, that is methods with a formal mathematical basis, are
being increasingly recommended where the requirements for safety and security
are very high. Emerging national and international standards mandate or
recommend the use of formal methods. Although formal methods have been
available within the research community for over a decade these methods
are still not used in many practical applications. There is a lack of timely,
realistic and independent information on the application of formal methods
to assist in the procurement, management, design, testing and certification
of critical systems </P>

<H3>3. Progress to Date</H3>

<P>The Formal Methods subgroup is currently working towards producing a
guideline on the use of Formal Methods in the analysis, design and construction
of safety related systems. The guideline is in two main parts. The first
is at an advanced stage of drafting, and should be available for general
review in early 1994. It has three main sections: </P>

<UL>
<LI>Introduction to Formal Methods </LI>

<LI>Impact on Software and Systems Engineering </LI>

<LI>Exploitation of Formal Methods </LI>
</UL>

<P>The intended audience for this part is experienced system engineers
and managers, who wish to develop their capabilities in the use of formal
methods, but have, as yet, little or no experience in the area. The guideline
is rooted firmly in practical experience of member companies, it does not
advocate any particular method, it addresses all aspect of the system lifecycle
(software and hardware), and includes extensive information to assist project
managers in decision making on the deployment of formal methods. The second
part is a techniques directory. This will be a broad survey of formal methods.
As well as being useful for the audience for the first part, it will also
be valuable for more experience users of formal methods. It adopts a classification
scheme which address issues such as: </P>

<UL>
<LI>maturity of the method </LI>

<LI>availability of tools </LI>

<LI>consultancy and case study material </LI>

<LI>application domains for the method </LI>

<LI>properties or approaches which the method addresses </LI>

<LI>skill level required </LI>
</UL>

<P>This directory should be published in late 1994. </P>

<H3>4. Contacts and membership</H3>

<P><IMG SRC="sccsgif/tel.gif" HEIGHT=32 WIDTH=28>The formal methods group
would welcome new members to participate in the development of the guidelines,
to review the work as it matures and to provide information on particular
methods and tools. For information about the Formal Methods subgroup or
EWICS TC7 in general please contact:</P>

EWICS TC7 BRIEFING PAPER PROJECT MANAGEMENT SUBGROUP</H2>

<H3>1. Introduction</H3>

<P>EWICS TC7 (European Workshop on Industrial Computer Systems, Technical
Committee 7, Safety, Reliability and Security) is an international workshop
of experts in the field of dependability of industrial computer systems
with respect to safety, reliability and security. (The general details
of EWICS TC7 and the work of the other subgroups are elaborated in other
leaflets).</P>

<P> </P>

<H3>2. Problem Statement</H3>

<P>EWICS TC 7, being well aware of the fact that adequate project management
may contribute more to the success of critical computer system development
projects than just technical know-how and skill, has been studying the
impact of project management on safety related projects. The Project Management
subgroup co-operates with the other subgroups of EWICS TC7, where project
management relevant issues have to be tackled.</P>

<P> The subgroup is gathering input of European and US experience from
customers, suppliers, assessors and users (e.g. railway interlocking, security
systems, chemical plant automation, telecommunications, nuclear power plants,
health safety etc., from standardisation (especially IEC, CEN/CENELEC and
the ISO-9000 community), universities, research institutes, test houses,
industry, from consultants and assessors, suppliers and users) through
its members and contacts to relevant standardisation and industrial bodies.
The guideline will utilise existing and developing practices, guidelines
and standards. The intended audience includes project managers, senior
managers and project teams.</P>

<P> The structure of the guideline will follow an extended life cycle scheme.
It takes into account that there may be a number of &quot;project managers&quot;
in such projects, for example representing the customer, supplier, assessor
with respect to technology, personnel and facilities.</P>

<P> The guideline is divided into two parts. The first sets the scene for
the reader, and explains the purpose and nature of the document. The second
consists of the project management guideline for customer, supplier and
assessor.</P>

<P> The purpose of the guideline is to provide guidance to customers, suppliers
as well as to assessors on project management throughout the project lifecycle
and to increase awareness of best practice. The guideline is not intended
to describe traditional project management methods. It concentrates more
specifically on the relationship between the criticality of a project and
its management.</P>

<P> </P>

<H3>3. Progress to Date</H3>

<P>The guideline is at the moment in draft, but already structured according
to the principles explained above. The full guideline, reviewed and tested
in trial use by the members and members contacts, is expected by mid 1995.</P>

<P> The following sections are defined for the guideline, Part II, following
the &quot;phases&quot; of a project lifecycle from the first ideas to decommissioning.
Those sections are: Preparation Phase, Initiation Phase, Specification
Phase, Design Phase, Build Phase, Verification Phase, Integration Phase,
System Validation Phase, Installation Phase, Project Review Phase, Handover
Phase, Operations and Maintenance Phase, Decommissioning Phase. During
a large project, these phases need not be sequential.</P>

<P> In each section (phase) the following issues are discussed:</P>

<P> </P>

<UL>
<LI>Introduction (general considerations for this phase) </LI>

<LI>Project Risks </LI>

<LI>Planning Activities </LI>

<LI>Economic Activities </LI>

<LI>Relationship Management Activities </LI>

<LI>People Management Activities </LI>

<LI>Technical Activities </LI>

<LI>Major Decisions for Product or System Criticality </LI>
</UL>

<P>Supporting Activities (based on ISO 9000-3, ISO 9001)</P>

<P> The subgroup has, at the moment, approximately thirty members from
twelve European countries and US, being from industry, universities, test-houses,
regulatory and assessment/licensing bodies. It meets four times a year
with an average attendance of about fifteen members. The subgroup establishes
the scope of its work, with schedules, milestones and evaluation of the
resources necessary to complete the task.</P>

<P> </P>

<H3>4. Contacts and Membership</H3>

<P><IMG SRC="sccsgif/tel.gif" HEIGHT=32 WIDTH=28>The Project Management
Subgroup would welcome new members to participate in the development of
the guideline, to review the work and to provide information on applicability
of the guideline in practice. For information about the Project Management

The overall objectives are to advance the state of the art of systematic design of complex heterogeneous systems, including 
both software and hardware; and in particular, to reduce the risk of error in the specification, design and implantation of 
embedded safety critical systems.<BR>
To approach this goal, PROCOS II will develop a theory, system and methodology to cover all of the following: (1) 
Requirements capture and analysis; (2) System specification and design; (3) Programming language processing and 
compilation; (4) A hardware machine, including a multiprogramming kernel; (5) An implantation in hardware down to gate 
level. Support for these will be sought from other projects. <P>

<H5>SUMMARY</H5>
How can a robot decide what motions to perform in order to achieve tasks in the physical world? This question is the theme of 
PROMOTION.  Today's industrial robot programming systems still have very limited motion planning capabilities. On the 
other hand, the field of robotics is growing: space exploration, undersea work, intervention in hazardous environments are but 
a few of the expanding applications. Motion planning appears as one of the components of the necessary autonomy of the 
robots in such real contexts.<P>

Mechanising Deduction in the Logics of Practical Reasoning <P>
<H5>REF. No.</H5>
6471<P>
<H5>SUMMARY</H5>
 Human reasoning may be distinguished from artificial reasoning in many aspects, including the rich variety of common sense 
reasoning methods - temporal, modal, probabilistic, relevant, etc - and the combining of these into one complex system: a 
practical reasoning agent. The original MEDLAR project (Action 3125) sought to characterise a class of logics capable of 
handling some central, problematic aspects of practical reasoning with time, action, belief, knowledge and intent, and to 
develop good techniques for mechanised deduction with the logics of practical reasoning. There has been considerable 
success, with a working general framework now established characterising the logics, and substantial expertise in good 
techniques for mechanised deduction with the logics. MEDLAR II builds on this by developing the concept of a practical 
reasoning agent, capable of acting autonomously and interacting flexibly with its real-world environment.<P>

Fail-Safe Semicustom Design <P>
<H5>REF. No.</H5>
6378<P>
<H5>SUMMARY</H5>
The objective of FASED is to study fail-safe circuits designed and fabricated using semicustom design methodology. This 
may lead to significantly lower design times and costs as compared to current full custom chips. To achieve higher circuit 
availability, the use of redundancy techniques in fail-safe circuits is also to be investigated. Topics of interest to the Group 
include: fault modelling in semicustom circuits, theory of self-checking and fail-safe circuits, CAD algorithms for the 
automatic generation of self-checking modules, self-testing techniques and built-in test, reliability and failure mechanisms, 
and redundancy techniques. The use of the semicustom design style could greatly enhance the applicability of fail-safe 
circuits to industrial electronics, and provide low-cost, high-reliability solutions in safety critical applications.<P>
<H5>ACTIVITIES</H5>
The Group's expertise ranges from semiconductor fabrication through the design of fail-safe circuits to redundancy 
techniques. While some topics will require participation of all partners, some specialised	 topics will be studied bilaterally. 
The Group will further its objectives by topical meetings in the area of semicustom design techniques, self-checking and fail-
safe circuit design, and reliability aspects. Yearly internal workshops will be held which facilitate direct information exchange 
between all participating scientists. The group may organise one or more international workshops in the field of fail-safe 
circuits, and will participate in workshops of other related ESPRIT consortia. <P>

A Comprehensive Algebraic Approach to System Specification and  Development <P>
<H5>REF. No.</H5>
6112<P>
<H5>SUMMARY</H5>
 An industry of interchangeable and widely marketable software components in Europe is only possible if the functionality of 
a component can be precisely specified and the implementation relied upon. It is highly desirable to be able to specify only the 
necessary properties of a component or system in a requirements specification. This is the interface seen by the user that 
serves as a guideline for the implementor. It should be as precise as necessary, but also as loose as possible, avoiding 
overspecification of details. The particular design remains hidden for proprietary reasons; an implementation can be replaced 
by another one for the same requirement specification. In this way a high level of abstraction from subsequently introduced 
design detail can be achieved. The COMPASS Working Group is investigating the stepwise development of more detailed 
and efficient versions, supported by semi-automatic tools, such that the overall correctness proof is broken down into the 
verification of correctness at each step. The development process itself could then be formalised as a basis for a library of 
generally applicable development methods. The Group aims to provide a comprehensive algebraic approach to the 
specification of systems and their components, provide a formal basis	 for their correct development, consolidate the 
theoretical background, lay the basis for an increase in the power of support tools, encompass new programming 
methodologies and application areas, and make progress towards the development of a uniform mathematical framework for 
logic and semantics within computer science.<P>
<H5>ACTIVITIES </H5>
Algebraic techniques, stimulated by COMPASS members, have already played a dominant role in several national and 
international research projects, among them a number of ESPRIT projects (including DRAGON, FOR-ME-TOO, 
GRASPIN, LOTOSPHERE, METEOR, PEACOCK, PROSPECTRA, RAISE, SEDOS). during the first three years of the 
COMPASS working group, over 300 research papers (including a survey and annotated bibliography volume) were 
published by group members. There have been numerous COMPASS workshops, including international workshops on 
abstract data types (ADT) jointly organised with the COMPASS Group. Over the next three years, three COMPASS and three 
ADT/COMPASS workshops are planned, in addition to several smaller meetings between partners.<P>

Materials, Methods and Microtechnologies for Selective Gas Sensing<P>
<H5>REF. No.</H5>
6374<P>
<H5>SUMMARY</H5>
Gas sensing is one of the most critical and rapidly growing areas in  modern sensor technology with applications in many 
fields, including the environment (e.g. car exhaust monitoring), safety in domestic and industrial environments, and process 
control. The main shortcomings of	 today's sensors are that, in general, they lack selectivity, often suffer from drift and 
poisoning effects, have insufficient lifetimes, and can be fairly large and expensive. The M3-GAS project will address these 
problems with particular attention to the sensing of hydrocarbons, carbon oxides, ammonia and toxic rocket propellants. The  
project brings together considerable expertise in various fields of technology in order to investigate and develop miniaturised 
versions of selective gas sensor systems.  M3-GAS consists of five major tasks. The first two aim at the development of gas 
sensors with greatly improved selectivity, based on semiconducting layers and catalysts. In the third task, electrochemical 
sensors will be developed, where the emphasis is on the investigation of IC-compatible and long-term stable electrolytes, 
based on hydrogels and polymers. The fourth task uses the inherent selectivity of non-dispersive infra-red absorption for the 
development of chemical sensing systems.  The main effort will be the development f III-V narrow-band photodiodes; as an 
alternative route, a broadband detector (bolometer) will be developed and integrated with an IR source on a single chip. 
Micromachining technology will be used in all these four tasks in order to obtain substantial reductions in size, cost, and 
power consumption. The prototypes developed will be extensively characterised to determine their cross-sensitivity to other 
gases and their dependence on humidity and temperature. In the fifth task, on signal processing, signal evaluation methods 
such as pattern recognition and neural network logic will be set to analyse the information provided by the sensor arrays and 
ultimately obtain a	 high selectivity. The three industrial partners will exploit the results in their particular application 
fields. MBB is developing facilities to mass-produce microsensors through its subsidiary MEGSTART	: 1992-06-

<H5>SUMMARY</H5>
The TRACS project addresses aims to develop a real-time computing system for monitoring and controlling vehicle motion 
in well-defined areas with high risk of collisions, such as a harbour or an airport. The system will have three basic 
components:<P>
<UL>
  <LI>a set of sensory devices for data acquisition from the environment and for monitoring vehicle motion;
  <LI>a parallel processing subsystem capable of handling the large amount of critical data coming from the sensors in 
real-time;
  <LI>a real-time user console that supports sophisticated prediction models for coordinating vehicle motion and 
handling critical situations.
</UL>
The project's main objective starting from a complete real-time development environment, is to design and implement the 
data processing subsystem and the general-purpose real-time user console and to support multisensor integration (including 
radar and video). The first prototype system will be targeted at vessel traffic control applications.<P>

Applying Formal Methods to Real-Size Object-Oriented Designs in Technical Environments <P>
<H5>REF. No</H5>
 6500<P>
<H5>SUMMARY</H5>
AFRODITE aims to apply formal specification to the development of software/hardware systems in a technical environment, 
using extended versions of development tools already available. The systems and applications will include safety critical and 
highly distributed systems and the design of a dedicated parallel real-time computer architecture. The project intends to 
extend the use of formal methods as a product and process modelling language towards the design and implementation of 
large real-time hardware/software systems and architectures. A mature specification language which focuses on functional 
behaviour will be enriched to allow it to specify object-oriented designs and real-time requirements. This will make it 
possible to reason about the behaviour of a design and show up deficiencies early on in the development  life-cycle. This in 
turn will dramatically increase the quality of the designs and their implementation. The partners are convinced that formal 
methods are mature enough to be used in industrial applications. They expect great benefits from the use of the object-
oriented approach in combination with formal specifications in order to increase the quality of software, to master complexity, 
and to meet extremely demanding reliability and correctness requirements. To achieve the wider use of these techniques, 
however, some important requirements have to be met within AFRODITE: incomplete specifications support, in order to 
allow more than one level of abstraction the specification language should provide easy to understand concepts for 
modularisation the specification language should support iterative development by specialisation.  AFRODITE's main result 
is expected to be a basis for embedding formal methods into products and internal software development methods.<P>

<H5>SUMMARY</H5>
The objective of ARCHIE is to develop workstation technology for use in the broad field of control. The ARCHIE project 
aims to provide three functions to make a workstation environment more suitable for high-workload, time-critical, safety 
critical operations: detection of operator errors and their circumvention by software means use of multiple channels and 
multiple media to avoid over-dependence on any particular interface medium-large-scale use of operator performance 
monitoring to detect overloads or inattention. OMI results will be used in two major interrelated user interface demonstrators, 
for which a common methodology will be employed. This will involve the integration of the GRADIENT (857) project's 
methodology for error detection, circumvention and rejection with the advances in multi-channel interaction and operator 
monitoring currently being developed in the UK SERC-funded ECHO project.  As a new concept in human-computer 
interaction, ARCHIE can be demonstrated in a variety of applications representative of major real-time installations. It opens 
an expanding market for fast-response, high processing-power application of microprocessor chips and support 
environments. The demonstrators are selected to use complex software-intensive safety critical environments to test the scope 
of OMI's software support tools.  Both demonstrators will be in safety critical environments, which are demanding of human 
cognitive capacities, and for which multi-channel human-computer interaction and real-time monitoring of operator actions 
will be essential. One demonstrator will be in the fixed safety critical environment of air traffic control; the other will be a 
mobile application adapting virtual cockpit techniques from the military sphere for the civil aviation flight-deck. <P>

safety of the model-building operation. These models will be connected to CAD and finite element analysis systems through 
the library.  The work aims at the complete integrated design of mechatronic systems, based on Bond Graph modelling and 
simulation. The library itself will rely on an object-oriented representation appropriate to the  classification and ordering of 
components.  The library will be evaluated by design engineers simulating applications in the automotive and machine tool 
industries. The results will be incorporated in software products to be marketed by one of the industrial partners.<P>

independent and function on low-cost workstations or high-end personal computers. The target technology is conventional 
analogue CMOS with state-of-the-art transistor line-widths.  The following three demonstrators will be used to test and 
validate the results: <P>
<UL>
  <LI>a single optical element for remote active fibre-optic colour measurements of physical parameters, such as 
measurements of blood oxygenation levels 
  <LI>a linear array of sensors for industrial process surveillance and control using a pocket spectrometer 
  <LI>a bi-dimensional array of sensors for use in an "intelligent" camera for industrial/environmental control and 
interactive video applications.

Joint Logic Project <P>
<H5>REF. No.</H5>

<H5>SUMMARY</H5>
The JESSI JLP project is one of four proposed in 1991 by the JESSI organisation for Community funding. The project has 
already been funded for the 18 month start-up-phase of JESSI during 1990-91 (project 5080).Now, for the main phase of 
JESSI, which starts in 1992, the consortia have proposed a three-year project which combines the resources of the eight 
major European semiconductor companies and two of the leading research institutes. According to Dataquest, these 
companies together took a 9.1% share of the world semiconductor market in 1991. This JESSI JLP project is one of a set of 
project clusters which together tackle not only the development of key process technologies but also the development of the 
manufacturing equipment and applications. <P>
The Joint Logic project occupies a central position in JESSI, being strongly connected and to a large extent driven by the 
user-defined and executed applications projects (known as "Europrojects"). The timetable of the project has been coordinated 
with the technology requirements of these key applications drivers, and in particular the "Mobile Radio", "Broadband 
Communications", "HDTV", "Digital Audio Broadcasting", and "Automotive Safety Electronics" activities. The partners in 
these latter projects are funded by their respective national governments in the context of the EUREKA programme.  The JLP 
project also guides the work undertaken by European R&amp D centres on next-generation 0.25 micron CMOS technology 
(project 7236). This project is a continuation of project 5080 (JLP), and as such also incorporates the activities of project 5048 
(ACCES). In its initial phase, the emphasis was on the development of a core 0.7 micron technology and on functional 
options (non-volatile memories,	 analogue) in a 1 micron technology.  In the period 1992-94, the JLP project will focus 
on the development and qualification of a state-of-the-art CMOS process with a feature size of 0.5 microns. This process is 
targeted on a very broad range of applications (including high-performance digital logic circuits as found in consumer and 
computer products, and low-power and low-voltage chips for use in portable equipment), as well as having the capability  to 
combine analogue functions typically used in the telecommunication and automotive sectors of the market.  The approach 
taken to achieve these goals will be to organise the project according to the following joint development activities: generating 
the basic 0.5 micron CMOS technology by the joint effort of the partners in a subproject dedicated to the development of the 
basic process steps: <P>
<UL>
  <LI>developing various functional options to be added to the core process (activities on analogue and low voltage will 
be organised in two separate subprojects) 
  <LI>integrating the core technologies into processes for specific exploitation areas 
  <LI>demonstrating and qualifying the technology by means of several company-specific demonstrators. 
</UL>
This project is a continuation of project 5080 (JLP), and incorporates the activities of project 5048 (ACCES). The objective of 
the project is to develop the powerful CMOS processes required to improve the ability of European electronic product 
manufacturers to bring competitive  products to market on a timely basis. In its initial phase, the emphasis was on the 
development of a core 0.7 micron technology and on	 functional options (non-volatile memories, analogue) in a 1 micron 
technology.  During 1992-94, the JLP project will focus on the development and qualification of a state-of-the-art CMOS 
process with a feature size of 0.5 micron. This process is targeted on a very broad range of applications, including high-
performance digital logic circuits (as found in consumer and computer products), and low-power, low-voltage chips for use 
in portable equipment. It also has the capacity to combine analogue functions typically used in the telecommunications and 
automotive sectors.  In the earlier project, the emphasis was on the development of a core 0.7 micron CMS technology and on 
functional options (non-volatile	 memories, analogue) in 1 micron technology. In addition, a first set of target design rules 
for a 0.5 micron technology was generated.  During 1992-94, the JLP project will be extended to more aggressive design 
rules, and more attention will be paid to the exploitation of the new processes. The main objectives are to: <P>
<UL>
  <LI>establish qualified 0.5 micron CMOS processing 
  <LI>incorporate selected functional options in submicron CMOS 
  <LI>exploit this technology.

Optimization of manpower in marine transport. Improvement of competitiveness in community transport through 
implementing advanced technology<P>
<H5>SUMMARY</H5>
The objective is to determine the optimum crew composition for different types of vessel and marine transport systems 
according to different circumstances, taking into account an increased use of advanced technology. <P>
 The ATOMOS (advanced technology to optimize manpower on board ships) project has as its main goal to improve the 
competitiveness of the EC commercial fleet, through the application of advanced technologies and their integration with 
suitable manning, optimum crew composition and operational strategies. The result is intended to be a reduction in overall 
cost via improved system integration and simultaneously to obtain improved operator overview and increased safety. The 
work proposed covers the total work programme as defined under Domaine 23 in the EURET workplan (Dec. 1990), 
building upon the basis of existing integrated ship control (ISC) systems, particularly the "Projekt Skib" and "Schiff der 
Zunkunft" projects, with which the partners have detailed experience, and combining together a number of distinct and 
important areas into a coherent whole. Given the wide scope of the workplan and the restricted funding available, the majority 
of the work aims at defining requirements to new systems, interfaces or training needs. However, a number of system 
prototypes will be produced as requested in the Workplan.<P>

Smart Inter-Modal European Transfer<P>
<H5>SUMMARY</H5>
The aims of this project are first the proposal of common standards and second the proposal of particular specifications for 
each type of yards: terminal (road, rail, maritime), inland waterway and shunting yards.<BR>
The final aim of this study is a global proposal for a common specification able to combine each yard in the Community by a 
network with the lowest costs of transhipment handling. And due to the limited sum allocated to the scale models, the study 
will concentrate only on the common specifications that integrate the new proposed concepts using existing scale models in 
the Community  (COMMUTOR, ECT, CARGO 2000 ...).<BR>
Last, it will provide the specification of the management system of a transhipment yard (microsystem), and the specification 
of the management system of all the network using telematics and an automatic identification of loading units and rolling 
stocks (macrosystem).<P>

European aeronautical telecommunication network<P>
<H5>SUMMARY</H5>
To contribute to the validation of the ATN concept and to the demonstration of its operability in the European context. To 
provide the experimental ATN which is required for the experiments planned by Eurocontrol (PHARE), the EC states 
administrations and research centers, and industry to precisely define and demonstrate the validity of the Air Traffic 
Management concept developed by the European aviation community to face the air traffic requirements of the 21st century. 
To fulfil the above mentioned objectives, the EURATN project consists in the following: <P>
<UL>
  <LI>the development and procurement of all the necessary components of the ATN with the exception of all 
subnetworks up to layer 4 of the ISO-OSI basic reference model (ISO 7498), with the exception of the real air-ground 
subnetworks but including the necessary interfaces for these three candidate subnetworks, that are VHF (AVPAC), 
satellite (SATCOM) and SSR Mode-S; this covers mainly the development of the Intermediate Systems (IS) usually 
called ATN routers or, in the case of commercial aircraft, Communication Management Unit, and of the end systems 
(ES) to be connected to an ATN demonstrator to validate the ATN concept; 
  <LI> the development and procurement of the software components, or the adaptation of the existing ones for the upper 
layers (session,	 presentation and application) and for the initial applications to be implemented in the end systems 
connected to the demonstrator and for the first experiments; 
  <LI>the application of a network management standard and development of related tools to manage the experimental 
ATN and their integration in the demonstrator; 
  <LI>the performance of specific studies to dimension and evaluate the performances of the EURATN system elements, 
to elaborate a performance measurement plan to validate the previous results; 
  <LI> the integration and the performance of validation tests of all the above components; these validation tests may 
include flight tests with an experimental aircraft (as an option). It is expected that the required airborne equipment may 
be bought and implemented in the frame of an other related RTD project (e.g. PHARE), as it is the case for the 
commercial software and hardware required by the project; 
  <LI>the definition of a plan of experiments to completely validate and experience the ATN capabilities, to be performed 
in a following phase of the EURATN project; 
  <LI>the development of an EURATN Operation Manual for the CEC to provide to any organization whishing to 
connect its experimental facilities to the EURATN experimental network; 
  <LI>during all the phases of the project, the participants will  coordinate their work to provide reports and 
recommendations to international bodies concerned in ATM such as EUROCONTROL, ICAO and noticeably its 
AMSS, SICAS panels and the FANS 2 committee, IATA and airlines industry standards organizations. Coordination 
will be ensured also with ongoing related RTD projects e.g. PHARE, EASIE of EUROCONTROL, and the ATN project 
led by MITRE Corporation in the United States.

ATM european group for improvement of scenarios<P>
<H5>SUMMARY</H5>
A global improvement and consolidation of the PHARE Scenario is necessary to ensure its consistency. Also consensus 
between the different participants involved must be reached, taking into account their respective needs. <BR>
 The AEGIS consortium is a multi-disciplinary group consisting of Academic and Industrial Institutions who have not 
contributed, until	 now, to PHARE Scenario elaboration and will bring their knowledge and expertise in specific methods and 
techniques (for example, HMI), as well as organizations well aware of ATM problems. Some of the latter have participated in 
PHARE programme elaboration and have been responsible for the complementarity of this programme and the consistency of 
the whole study. <BR>
 The objectives of the AEGIS study are: to explore new aspects of the problem, taking advantage of the multi-disciplinary 
origins of the group; to ensure that a common approach is adopted by all the participants, including Industries, Academics and 
Airlines. An outcome of this study could be the identification of additional research in areas not covered in PHARE, Such as 
interaction between airlines and ATC or ground movement problems.<P>

Tools to assess vessel traffic systems and to increase the efficiency  of VTS<P>
<H5>SUMMARY</H5>
The project will study: <P>
<UL>
  <LI> a variety of tools which can assist in the design of an efficient VTS; 
  <LI>determine the suitability for new external functions as shore based pilotage, resource management and contingency 
planning; 
  <LI>improve the operational benefits to be reaped by improving the procedures in VTSs; 
  <LI>improving and harmonize existing training schemes for VTS operators; 
  <LI> collect, improve and determine basic traffic and casualty information as the basis for marine safety and expediency 
decision making as well as towards the determination for the nuisances to the environment caused by vessels. 
</UL>
 The main objective of the project is to provide tools to assess the effects and the benefits of marine safety measures (notably 
VTS type measures) against the costs.<P>

<H5>TITLE</H5>
Regional traffic information service<P>
<H5>SUMMARY</H5>
The project will study the feasibility and if appropriate elaborate the specifications of an information service which would 
provide the actors of maritime traffic with information intended to make easier their own decision processes.  Special 
emphasis will be put on the use for shiphandling purposes of information made available in real time. The proposed service 
will take benefit of available information currently collected and/or processed by entities such as existing and planned VTS, 
search and rescue organisations, pilotage, shipping agents, meteorological services, ships' routing agencies, etc... The main 
objective of the project is to reduce maritime traffic costs. Costs will be considered in a broad sense. They will encompass: all 
costs resulting from the normal operation of means used for the performance of activities generating maritime traffic. Thus 
they will include in addition to the ship amortization and running costs, the costs of services provided at sea, in ports and 
fairways.  The cost of waiting times due to services unavailabilities is also included: <P>
<UL>
  <LI>costs of organisations or services responsible for preventing or maintaining at an acceptable level dysfunctionments 
of the traffic production systems; 
  <LI>losses and damages caused by anomalies and accidents of any kind; 
  <LI>costs of remedying or alleviating their consequences amongst which  the impact of pollutions may be catastrophic.
</UL>
The project will address the Mediterranean area. It will therefore offer a regional coverage. The project will be a pilot project. 
It intends to provide a basis for an experimental implementation. It is hoped that most of its features will be transposable to 
other maritime zones in Europe. To this end, close co-operation will be established with the other EURET 1.3 project which 
the EC has taken into consideration.<P>

European rail traffic management system<P>
<H5>SUMMARY</H5>
The ERTMS project is a unique opportunity to capitalize on the present progress of technology in areas ranging from data 
processing to wireless transmission to lay the foundation of a really innovative comprehensive system. <P>
 A definition of common standards will increasingly have a beneficial effect on the development of European competition and 
for meeting the needs of the networks. The evaluation of costs will be important in planning the implementation of the 
system.  The European system for the management of rail traffic which includes the system of command control of rail traffic 
constitutes an integrated project, in which the required results depend on the execution of the project as a whole. For 
budgetary reasons, only a first phase comprising the overall design of the system, the evaluation of the location and 
communication tools as well as the development of the principal software components necessary for the use of the system, 
could be carried out under EURET. But it is important that the remaining phases of the project, i.e., the development of the 
components, the implementation of the system and its prototyping could be started at a later date or in parallel according to 
the cases.  The Commission is now moving in this direction by developing the EUROCAB, EUROBALISE and 
EURORADIO projects.<P>

ESTRATTO DELLO STATUTO 
Art. 1 - DENOMINAZIONE E SCOPI È costituita l'associazione:
"A.L.F.A. ASSOCIAZIONE 
LOMBARDA FAMIGLIE AUDIOLESI", con sede in Milano, Viale Vittorio Veneto n. 30. 
Art. 2 - L'associazione è un organismo apartitico, aconfessio- nale, indipendente, 
non persegue finalità di lucro ma esclusiva- mente sociali e morali nell'interesse degli audiolesi. 
L'associazione si propone come obiettivo fondamentale quello di inserire l'audioleso in condizioni 
di parità nell'ambito sociale. A tal fine l'associazione dovrà: a) assistere mediante l'INFORMAZIONE e 
l'AGGIORNAMEN- TO le famiglie degli audiolesi e promuovere l'incontro fra le stesse; b) promuovere un'
attiva partecipazione dei familiari dei bam- bini audioles i al la conoscenza, all o studio e alla 
risoluzio ne dei problemi derivanti dalla minorazione uditiva; c) promuovere e sollecitare indagini 
e ricerche sulle cause dell'insufficienza uditiva e sui metodi di diagnosi e cura; d) sollecitare 
l'intervento degli enti, delle strutture sanitarie e dei servizi competenti, per la diagnosi precoce, 
per una corretta protesizz az i one e ass istenza nel te m po e per u na ad eguata riabilitazione degli audiolesi; 
e) affermare il diritto allo studio degli audiolesi nella scuola pubblica mediante un corretto inserimento e i necessari supporti tecnici e strumentali;
f) favorire l'inserimento nel mondo del lavoro in condizione di parità con i normoudenti, nel rispetto delle esigenze specifiche degli audiolesi;
9) sensibilizzare 1'opinione pubblica sui problemi delle persone non udenti promuovendo conferenze, dibattiti e informando dell'esistenza di un cambiamento radicale nella potenzialità degli audiolesi;
h) sollecitare, presso gli enti e i servizi competenti, gli interventi anche di carattere legislativo idonei a risolvere i problemi degli audiolesi e consentire il miglior inserimento nella scuola, nel lavoro e nella società;
i) contribuire con iniziative di varia natura a favorire lo sviluppo culturale degli audiolesi;
1) promuovere incontri, convegni e confronti con altre associazioni, con esperti e ricercatori in Italia ed all'estero per lo studio e la soluzione delle problematiche conseguenti alla sordità.

There are likely to be special interest groups at a Member State level. For example the UK British Computer Society and 
Institute of Electrical Engineers have such groups. Trade associations such as the Computer Services Association and 
engineering trade associations all have groups with an interest in this area. Consideration needs to be given to the extent to 
which member state based activities are included in this document.<P>

Special interest groups on safety are available on a number of public network. The main sources of information are: The 
<B>Internet</B>, <B>CompuServe</B>.<P>
<H3><IMG SRC = "sccsgif/r_hand.gif" >Internet</H3>
The Internet is a 'network of networks' which links many different networks world-wide. Computers linked to the Internet 
can have access to a number of global information services such as electronic mail and file transfer One facility on the Internet 
is the support of News Groups for special interest topics. Interested parties can subscribe to the news group by sending a 
special email 'SUBSCRIBE' message to the server for that particular interest group. Alternatively the user can make use of a 
specialist 'news server'. When connected to this news server, the client computer can be updated with fresh news (for a 
specified sub-set of the news groups).<P>
The main news group covering safety is <A HREF = "news:comp.risks">'<I>comp.risks</I>'</A>  which covers both safety 
and security topics. The following information is circulated with comp.risks news articles:<P>
"The RISKS Forum is a moderated digest.  Its USENET equivalent is <I>comp.risks</I>. Undigestifiers are available 
throughout the Internet, but not from RISKS. Contributions should be relevant, sound, in good taste, objective, cogent, 
coherent, concise, and non repetitious.  Diversity is welcome, but not personal attacks.  CONTRIBUTIONS to 
<I>risks@csl.sri.com</I>, with appropriate, substantive "Subject:" line; others may be ignored!  Contributions will not be 
ACKed; the load is too great.  **PLEASE** include your name and legitimate Internet FROM: address, especially UUCP 
folks.<BR>
If you cannot read RISKS locally as a news group (e.g., <I>comp.risks</I>), or you need help, send requests to <I>risks-
request@csl.sri.com</I> (not automated). BITNET users may subscribe via your favorite LISTSERV: "SUBSCRIBE

<H5>PROGRAMME TITLE</H5>
A multi-annual programme (EEC) to support the implementation of trans-European networks for the interchange of data 
between administrations (IDA), 1993-1998<P>
<H5>PROGRAMME OBJECTIVE</H5>
To support projects of common interest on data interchange between administrations in the Community relating to the 
information, data and documents needed for the functioning of the Community, and to ensure the interoperability of data 
communications networks and applications.<BR>
The IDA programme is intended to establish a framework for the contribution of the Community to implementing trans-
European data communications networks between administrations, where the objectives of the proposed measures cannot be 
adequately attained by the Member States and are therefore, by virtue of the scale and the implications of the measures in 
question, best carried out at Community level.<BR>
The programme consists of two closely linked parts covering Community support for projects of common interest and 
measures to ensure interoperability of data communications networks and applications, increase reliability and reduce 
costs.<P>

<H2><IMG SRC = "sccsgif/cordis1.gif" >Scope and Objectives </H2>
By underwriting the "Single European Act", the European Communities affirmed their determination to improve the economic and 
social situation of the Community Member States. In this context, one of the Community's aims is to strengthen the scientific and 
technological base of European industry and to encourage it to become more competitive at the international level. <P>
 <P>
To achieve these goals the Community adopted a multi-annual R&amp D Framework Programme, within which the programme 
VALUE was launched to implement the specific requirements of the Single European Act for dissemination and exploitation of the 
results obtained from Community Research and Technological Development (RTD) programmes. VALUE is coordinated by 
Directorate D within Directorate-General  XIII  (Telecommunications, Information Industries and Innovation) of the Commission of 
the European Communities. <P>
<P>
 Full information on CORDIS can be found <A HREF = "http://www.cordis.lu/">here</A> .<P>
<P>
As part of the VALUE programme the Commission initiated CORDIS, a "Community R&amp D Information Service", with the 
following objective : <P>
 <P>
<UL>
  <LI>"To   disseminate  public  information  on  and about  all  Community  RTD activities,  for  the  purpose  of 
enhancing awareness of these activities; assist  interactions  and cooperation among individual programmes and their  
participants; and help promote co-ordination with similar RTD activities in Member States." 
</UL>
 <P>
CORDIS  is an information service based on electronically accessible databases. By  making  key  information available in a consistent 
form from a single pool, CORDIS  provides  users  throughout  the  Community and EFTA countries with the means  to benefit more 
readily from Community RTD programmes and to make better use of the results generated by the individual activities within them. 
<P>
 <P>
The  databases  used  by  CORDIS as its medium of dissemination are intended to complement other traditional information and 
communication means. At present there are nine CORDIS databases: <P>
 <P>
<OL>
  <B><LI>RTD-NEWS Database</B>: Announcements  (e.g.  calls  for  proposals)  and  other  short  news items 
generated by the Commission Services involved in RTD activities. 
  <B><LI>RTD-ACRONYMS Database</B>: Explanations of the multitude of acronyms and abbreviations arising 
from or related to Community RTD activities. 
  <B><LI>RTD-COMDOCUMENTS Database</B>: Information  on  Commission  communications  to  the Council 
and Parliament related to RTD activities. 
  <B><LI>RTD-PROGRAMMES Database</B>: Description of all Community RTD Programmes. 
  <B><LI>RTD-PROJECTS Database</B>: Description  of  individual  activities,  contracts  and studies within the 
above programmes, and identification of the organizations involved. 
  <B><LI>RTD-PUBLICATIONS Database</B>: Bibliographic  information  on  publications, documents and 
reports arising from the projects above. 
  <B><LI>RTD-RESULTS Database</B>: Information on results and R &amp  D prototypes arising from 
Community projects (volunteered by external organizations). 
  <B><LI>RTD-PARTNERS Database</B>: Providing  a  mechanism to identify suitable partners for the submission 
of proposals for RTD projects. 
  <B><LI>RTD-National Contact Points Database </B>(formerly called RTD-INFOPOINTS): Organizations   in   
Member  States  providing  assistance,  nationally  or regionally, in relation to Community RTD activities. (This 
database will be launched in early 1994.) 
</OL>
 <P>
At  present  this information is presented primarily in English as the language which is the most widespread in the scientific R &amp  
D community.  The CORDIS databases can be found <A HREF = "http://www.cordis.lu/en/c_fact94">here</A> <P>

<P>The purpose of COMPASS is to bring together researchers, developers,
integrators, and evaluators interested in problems related to specifying,
building, and certifying high-assurance systems. What distinguishes COMPASS
from similar conferences is its emphasis on bridging the gap between theory
and practice. The theme of COMPASS '97, &quot;are we making any progress
toward computer assurance?&quot;, will focus discussion on whether the
approaches that have been developed and reported on during the past 25
years have any hope for solving today's assurance problems. In addition
to exposing technical weaknesses in the state-of-the-art and state-of-the-practice,
conference goals include: identifying barriers to applying existing assurance
technologies in industry, understanding the properties new technologies
must have to meet industrial needs, and identifying evidence where advanced
technologies are effective in attacking the key problem areas of safety,
security, fault-tolerance, and real-time.</P>

<P>For researchers, COMPASS '97 provides an opportunity to present new
theories, techniques, methods, or results of case studies to other researchers
and to practitioners who can put them to use. COMPASS '97 also provides
a unique opportunity to learn from practitioners about issues and problems
encountered in constructing practical systems. Practitioners have the opportunity
to present results and lessons learned to researchers as well as to learn
of new research targeted to problems in high-assurance systems. For practitioners,
COMPASS provides the unique opportunity to influence future research directions.</P>

<P>The conference will be held June 16-20, 1997, at the National Institute
of Standards and Technology (NIST) in Gaithersburg, Maryland, a suburb
of Washington, D.C. The proceedings will be published by the IEEE Computer
Society.</P>

<P>Papers should present advances in the theory, design, implementation,
evaluation, or application of high-assurance systems, or report on experiments,
case studies, evaluations, and problems in the application of computer
assurance technology. Special consideration will be given to presentations
that directly address the conference theme. Proposals for panels are also
sought, particularly panels that directly address the conference theme.</P>

<P>There will be a tools fair, and the conference will be preceded by one
or two days of tutorials. Papers, panel proposals, tutorial proposals,
and tools fair proposals are solicited in relevant areas including:</P>

respect to dependability requirements rather than functional 
requirements, and concentrates particularly on issues of software structuring that will 
aid the design for validation of real-time distributed systems.

Almost every project in the ESPRIT programme is relevant to safety to some degree. At the most basic level there are three 
main approaches to obtaining a system which can maintain an adequate level of reliability to meet its safety requirements:<P>
<UL>
  <LI>fault avoidance.
  <LI>fault detection
  <LI>fault tolerance and failure mitigation
</UL>
These approaches apply to all phases in the life of a system: specification, implementation, operation and maintenance. The 
analysis below only includes projects that are directly relevant to one or more of the objectives identified above. We have 
excluded more general interest topics such as artificial intelligence, networking, databases, etc.<P>
The sub-programmes of the most direct relevance are:<P>

<p align="center"><font size="5"><b>Riunione Progetto
Riconoscimento Vocale</b></font></p>

<p align="center"><b><i>Martedì 28 gennaio 1997, ore 19.15, sede
Alfa</i></b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Con piacere posso informarvi che il progetto è iniziato bene,
superando gli inevitabili ostacoli iniziali.</p>

<p>Le Associazioni dispongono di un collegamento Internet, il CCR
ha creato un sito Internet con le prime pagine relative al
progetto, la FBL (Paglino) ha realizzato un primo elemento previsto
per migliorare la visualizzazione dei sottotitoli ed ha
effettuato alcune prove per definire con maggiore precisione le
difficoltà della comunicazione via telefono.</p>

<p>Propongo quindi di incontrarci con il seguente ordine del
giorno:</p>

<TITLE>MCW - GIM Future Plans</TITLE>
<IMG SRC = /images/future.gif>
<HR>
The Division of General Internal Medicine at the Medical College of Wisconsin
plans to continue development of WWW resources in the future. Some of our
plans are listed below. If you have any suggestions of comments please send
them to Ron Kneusel.
<P>
We plan to develop a staff directory consisting of pictures and links
to various methods of contact.
<P>
We are currently developing a Faculty Research Database that will contain 
all information about past and current GIM faculty research activity.  We
are planing a forms based link to this data so any user can quickly find
any faculty member(s) and their current and past research activities and
the citations of the work itself.<P>
<P>
On the "TO DO" list is a direct FTP link to our local GIM 
network to facilitate the transfer of data between off-site colleagues 
and our faculty and staff. <P>

<H1>Suggested Recommendations and Guidelines for Surgical Prophylaxis</H1>
<P>
<HR>
<H2>Introduction</H2></CENTER>
<P>
Postoperative wound infections are the
major source of infectious morbidity in the surgical patient.
The use of perioperative antibiotics has become an essential component
of the standard of care in virtually all surgical procedures and
has resulted in a reduced risk of postoperative infection when
sound and appropriate principles of prophylaxis are applied.
<P>
<OL TYPE=I>
<LI> There is probable risk of infection in the absence of a prophylactic agent.
<P>
<LI> There is a knowledge of the probable contaminating flora associated with the operative wound or organ site.
<P>
<LI> The activity of the chosen prophylactic agent should encompass the majority of pathogens likely to contaminate the wound or operative site.
<P>
<LI> The prophylactic agent must be administered in a dose which provides an effective tissue concentration prior to intraoperative bacterial contamination. Administration must occur 30 minutes prior to incision (usually with the induction of anesthesia) and the effective dose governed by patient weight (i.e., 60 kg or less, 1 gram of cephalosporin usual effective initial dose; 80 kg or greater may require higher initial dose).
<P>
<LI> In procedures lasting 3 hour or less, a single prophylactic dose is usually sufficient. Procedures lasting greater than three hours requires an additional effective dose. Procedures in which there is rapid blood loss and/or fluid administration will dictate more frequent prophylactic dosing. Under no circumstance should any prophylactic agent be given on&#173;call because it often results in less than effective tissue levels at the time of incision. Postoperative prophylaxis is strongly discouraged except in the scenario of a bioprosthetic insertion in which case 2 or 3 additional prophylactic doses may be deemed sufficient (Warning: there are no standard rules on prophylaxis following prosthetic insertion and clinical experience strongly dictates practice).
<P>
<LI> While first&#173;line therapeutic agents should not be used under prophylactic conditions the choice of a perioperative prophylactic agent may be influenced by the level of intrinsic resistance expressed against standard regimens within the hospital environment.
<P>
<LI> An effective and thoughtful prophylactic regimen is no substitute for exquisite surgical technique and competent postsurgical management.
<P>
</OL>
<HR>
<H2> I. General Surgery</H2>
<P>
<H3>a. Clean Procedures</H3>
<P>
Under most circumstances antimicrobial prophylaxis is not required when performing a clean surgical procedure. However, prophylaxis should be employed under those conditions where there is a potential intrinsic risk of infections such as in:
<P>
<OL TYPE=I>
<LI> Insertion of a synthetic biomaterial device or prosthesis
<P>
<LI> Clean operations performed in a patients with impaired host defenses
<P>
</OL>
<B>Agents:</B> First&#173;generation cephalosporin (cefazolin).
<P>
<B>Route/Dosage/Timing:</B> 1 gram cefazolin IV 30 minutes before skin incision; second dose if procedure &gt;3 hours.
<P>
<B>Rationale:</B> Likely infecting organism are gram&#173;positive cocci (S. aureus or S. epidermidis) and aerobic coliforms (E. coli).
<P>
<BR>
<H3>b. Upper GI &amp; Elective Small Bowel</H3>
<P>
<B>Agents:</B> First&#173;generation cephalosporin (cefazolin) or second&#173;generation cephalosporin (ceftizoxime or cefotetan).
<P>
<B>Route/Dosage/Timing:</B> 1-2 grams cefazolin, ceftizoxime or cefotetan IV 30 minutes before skin incision; second dose if procedure &gt; 3 hours.
<P>
<B>Rationale:</B> Likely contaminating organisms: Coliforms &gt; Enterococcus &gt; streptococci &gt; anaerobic clostridia, peptostreptococci, Bacteroides, Prevotella or Porphyromonous (formerly oral Bacteroides).
<P>
<BR>
<H3>c. Biliary Tract</H3>
<P>
<B>Agents:</B> First&#173;generation cephalosporin (cefazolin) in cases of acute or chronic cholecystitis and for common bile duct disease in the absence of cholangitis. In the presence of cholangitis, where both fecal aerobes and anaerobes may be present, a broad&#173;spectrum agent, such as ampicillin&#173;sulbactam or ceftizoxime, is appropriate.
<P>
<B>Route/Dosage/Timing:</B> 1-2 grams cefazolin IV <U>OR</U> 3 grams ampicillin&#173;sulbactam IV (in presence of cholangitis) 30 minutes before skin incision; second dose if procedure &gt; 3 hours.
<P>
<B>Rationale:</B> In acute and chronic biliary tract disease the predominant microbial pathogens include the coliforms (E. coli) and enterococci. In septic complications of biliary tract disease Proteus and Clostridium sp. are often recovered. The risk of bactibilia is associated with age and other correlated risk factors.
<P>
<BR>
<H3>d. Large Bowel Resections</H3>
<P>
<B>Agents:</B> Mechanical Prep (Neomycin/Erythromycin) and parenteral Second&#173;generation cephalosporin (ceftizoxime or cefotetan).
<P>
<UL>
<B>Preoperative Day</B>
<P>
<LI>4 liters over 2 hours of polyethylene glycol electrolyte solution beginning at 10 AM (double the dosage in patients with chronic constipation or diverticular disease and begin at 8 AM.
<P>
<LI>A nasogastric tube may be required in some patients.
<P>
<LI>Clear liquid diet only.
<P>
<LI>Administer neomycin plus erythromycin base at 1 PM, 2 PM and 10 PM; keep NPO after midnight.
<P>
<B>Operative Day</B>  
<P>
<LI>Completely evacuate the bowel prior to operation  Parenteral drug administration 30 minutes prior to incision  First oral neomycin&#173;erythromycin dose should be scheduled 19&#173;20 hours prior to scheduled procedure.
<P>
</UL>
<B>Route/Dosage/Timing:</B> (1 gram each of oral neomycin and erythromycin at scheduled intervals on preoperative day);1&#173;2 grams ceftizoxime or cefotetan IV 30 minutes prior to incision; second dose if procedure lasts &gt; 3 hours.
<P>
<B>Rationale:</B> Likely flora includes coliforms, Enterococcus, Bacteroides, peptostreptococci and clostridia.
<P>
<BR>
<H3>e. Acute Appendectomy (Non&#173;perforated)</H3>
<P>
<B>Agents:</B> Single agent: Ceftizoxime or cefotetan.<BR>Combination therapy: Cefazolin plus metronidazole.
<P>
<B>Route/Dosage/Timing:</B> Single agent: 1&#173;2 grams ceftizoxime or cefotetan IV 30 minutes before skin incision; second dose if procedure &gt; 3 hours.<BR>
Combination therapy: 1&#173;2 grams cefazolin IV plus 500 mg metronidazole IV 30 minutes before skin incision; second dose if procedure &gt; 3 hours.
<P>
<B>Rationale:</B> Coliforms and anaerobic bacteria likely contaminants.
<P>
<UL>
<B>Note: In perforated or gangrenous cases, clinical situation becomes therapeutic and Rx is continued as clinically indicated</B>
</UL>
<BR>
<HR>
<H2>II. Trauma Surgery</H2>
<P>
<H3>a. Penetrating Abdominal Trauma</H3>
<P>
<B>Agents:</B> Second&#173;generation cephalosporin (ceftizoxime or cefotetan).
<P>
<B>Route/Dosage/Timing:</B> 2 grams ceftizoxime or cefotetan IV 30 minutes before skin incision; second dose if procedure &gt; 3 hours.
<P>
<B>Rationale:</B> Coliform and anaerobic bacteria (gram&#173;positive &amp; gram&#173;negative) present in peritoneal cavity follow bowel injury.
<P>
<UL>
<B>Note: In cases of documented bowel injury, antibiotic prophylaxis should be continued for 12 to 24 hours. While most clinical studies suggest that short duration prophylaxis (12 hr) is as effective as prolonged coverage (24 hr or &gt;), recent evidence suggests that patients exhibiting multiple risk factors (i.e., age, blood replacement, ostomy, and number of organ injuries) are at greatest risk for infection and may likely benefit from prolonged coverage (2&#173;5 days).</B>

</CENTER>
This guide is intended to serve as a <A HREF="http://www.intmed.mcw.edu/drug.html">drug formulary</A> specific educational tool for antibiotic use at <A HREF="http:/images/FMLH.html">Froedtert Hospital</A>, the major teaching affiliate of the <A HREF="http://www.mcw.edu/">Medical College of Wisconsin</A>. It is intended to promote selective, cost effective use of antimicrobials, and to serve as Drug Use Evaluation criteria for antibiotic audits.<P>

This guide is not intended to be a definitive treatise. Not every patient will fit these guidelines. When faced with a therapeutic dilemma, an Infectious Disease specialist should be consulted.<P>
There exists a wide spectrum of antimicrobial agents available for therapy. One must consider not only likely microbiologic causes, but toxicity and cost as well. This guide offers therapeutic options based on likely pathogens and local sensitivity patterns.<HR>

<H2>Travel Risk Overview</H2>
<HR>
International travelers face increased health risks abroad, especially in developing countries.  At a recent travel medicine conference, Dr. Robert Steffen of the University of Zurich presented estimates of the number of infections that would occur in unprotected travelers. Overall, the greatest risk is for travelers' diarrhea which occurs in 40-50 % of tourists. Most deaths abroad are due to traffic and swimming accidents often associated with alcohol intoxication. For every one million people traveling to developing countries for a one month stay, about 24,000 would develop malaria if visiting West Africa, while  500 would if visiting South America.  About 3,000 travelers would develop Hepatitis A and 3,000 would contract a sexually transmitted disease such as gonorrhea or AIDS. Around 300 visitors to Africa or India and about 30 visiting other countries would get typhoid fever. Cholera would only occur in 3 travelers and only 1 would get polio. Meningitis is another infection that occurs mainly in Africa but the exact numerical risk to travelers is unknown. Yellow fever is another risk present in the Amazon basin and Sub-Saharan Africa.<P>

Preventive measures are available to protect yourself from all of the above mentioned health risks. Standard food and water precautions can reduce the risk of diarrhea and antibiotics can rapidly cure it if it occurs. Use of seat belts and avoiding alcohol can reduce your chance of death from accidents. Malaria can be prevented by taking malaria medications and using insect repellents to avoid mosquito bites during your trip. The chance of getting Hepatitis A can be reduced by vaccination or an injection of immune [serum] globulin (ISG) prior to departure.  Using condoms or avoiding sexual contact can reduce your chance of acquiring sexually transmitted diseases. An oral typhoid vaccine is now available for protection against this illness. The risk for cholera is so low in travelers that vaccination is not recommended unless required by the country to be visited. Vaccinations against polio, meningitis, and yellow fever are also available.<P>

Your actual risk of acquiring any of these diseases depends upon your specific itinerary and the type of trip you are planning.  For personalized recommendations you should consult with your own physician, health department, or a travel medicine clinic at least four to six weeks before departure.<P>

<H1>Travel Medicine Kit</H1>
<H2>Be  prepared when traveling</H2>
<HR>
No matter where you plan to travel, it is always wise to pack a small medical kit with certain essentials that may be required during your trip.  If you are currently taking any medications, you should be sure to bring enough with you to last your entire stay. Frequently, medications that are common in the U.S. may not be readily available abroad, and foreign substitutes may not be manufactured under the same quality standards. Also be sure to pack an extra pair of eyeglasses or contact lenses along with any needed cleaning and disinfectant solutions.<P>

First aid supplies should include bandages, gauze, tape, scissors, and tweezers to remove stingers or foreign bodies.  A topical antibiotic ointment is also useful to prevent infection of minor wounds and abrasions. An elastic bandage can be helpful for strains or sprains along with an anti-inflammatory drug such as aspirin or ibuprofen. A decongestant is useful for colds or sinus congestion especially during airplane travel where cabin pressurization can cause ear pain if the eustachian tubes that equalize the air pressure in the ears are swollen shut.  If you are prone to motion sickness you also should carry along some Dramamine tablets. An antihistamine such as Benadryl can be used to treat allergic reactions and relive itching from insect bites. A topical steroid cream such as hydrocortisone 1% may be helpful for treating skin rashes or relieving sunburn.  You also should be sure to pack a sunscreen with a SPF of at least 15 since most travelers will be visiting areas closer to the equator where the sun's rays are stronger and it takes less time for skin to burn. Insect repellents containing at least 30% DEET (such as Deep Woods Off or Repel) or a newer long lasting non-absorbed formulation (Ultrathon by 3M, now marketed as HourGuard by Amway) should be used when traveling in areas where mosquitoes are present.<P>

Traveler's diarrhea occurs frequently and if you are not prescribed an antibiotic by your physician, you can take along some Pepto-Bismol liquid or tablets along with Imodium AD to slow down the bowel movements. It also would be a good idea to bring along tablets for water purification (such as Potable Aqua) in case no safe drinking water is available. These are usually available in camping and sporting goods stores.<P>

<H1>Traveling While Pregnant</H1>
<H2>Special precautions are necessary</H2>
<HR>
When you are pregnant you must take special precautions to protect both yourself and your unborn child from illness when traveling to underdeveloped countries.  However, many immunizations and medications routinely recommended for travelers are either unsafe or have not been adequately studied in pregnant women.  Live viral vaccines should be avoided during pregnancy because of the theoretical risk to the developing fetus.  These would include mumps, measles, and rubella (MMR) vaccines. Yellow fever and oral polio vaccine can be used if there is a substantial risk of infection but should be delayed until after the first trimester if possible.  If the risk of yellow fever is low, but a vaccination certificate is required for entrance into a country, a physician can issue you a waiver letter to excuse you from this requirement. Live bacterial vaccines including oral typhoid fever vaccine have not been studied in pregnant women and their safety is unknown. Tetanus-diphtheria (Td) boosters are generally considered to be safe if needed. Immune [serum] globulin (ISG) can also be safely administered during pregnancy for the prevention of hepatitis A infection.<P>
	Malaria infection poses a special risk for the pregnant traveler and may result in a more severe infection and increases the risk of abortion, stillbirth, and prematurity.  Chloraquine is a malaria medication that can be safely taken during pregnancy. This medication can protect you against the type of malaria which is found in Central America, China, and the Middle East. However, resistant malaria found in Africa, Asia, and South America, requires the use of mefloquine (Lariam) or doxycycline. Doxycycline should not be taken during pregnancy but the CDC now states that mefloquine can be safely taken during pregnancy. If you plan to take chloraquine in areas with resistant malaria, some physicians recommend the addition of proguanil (Paludrine), which is not available in the US, for some added protection.<P>
	Antibiotics such as trimethoprim-sulfa (Bactrim) or ciprofloxacin (Cipro) that are recommended for treatment of travelers diarrhea can also be hazardous to pregnant women and should not be used. Care should also be taken in using any over the counter medication, especially those obtained overseas that you may not be familiar with.<P>
	Travel during the last six weeks of pregnancy is not recommended and may precipitate labor. Airlines often restrict the boarding privileges of such individuals. Prior to planning a trip abroad,  pregnant travelers should first check with their obstetrician to assess their individual risks and determine whether they can travel safely.<P>

<H1>Cholera Vaccination</H1>
<H2>No Longer Officially Required</H2>
<HR>
A severe outbreak of cholera which started in Peru several years ago has spread through South America to Central America and Mexico.  Also, separate outbreaks are now spreading through parts of Africa and India. More than 40 countries throughout the world report active cholera infection within their borders.  Even where the disease is rampant, vaccination against cholera is of limited effectiveness and is not recommended for travelers.   Following standard food and water precautions and avoiding high risk foods such as uncooked seafood and shellfish should be adequate to prevent you from getting the illness.<P>
Both the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control now report that no country officially requires cholera vaccination for arriving travelers under International Health Regulations.  Travelers need to be aware, however, that border officials in some countries may not always follow their official government policies and may occasionally ask for proof of vaccination if arriving from infected areas.  Such countries reported to have unofficial policies include Egypt, Ghana, Kenya, Madagascar, Rwanda, and Tanzania.  Prospective tourists to these countries may want to carry proof of vaccination (even if they did not actually receive the vaccine), or a formal letter from their physician stating that the vaccine is medically contraindicated.  All travelers should avoid being vaccinated once they arrive in these countries since vaccines may be administered with contaminated equipment increasing the risk for acquiring AIDS or Hepatitis B.<P>
For the most reliable information on current vaccination policies abroad, travelers can check with the US State Department or contact the American Embassy in the country they plan to visit. Travel Medicine clinics may also provide you with this information.<P>

<H2>Imported Dengue - United States, 1992</H2>
<HR>
<CITE>Morbidity and
Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR), vol. 43, no. 6, Feb 18,
1994.</CITE><P>

Dengue is a mosquito-transmitted acute disease caused by any of four virus serotypes (DEN-1, DEN-2, DEN-3, and DEN-4) and characterized by the sudden onset of fever, headache, myalgia, rash, nausea, and vomiting. The disease is endemic in most tropical areas of the world and can occur in U.S. residents returning from international travel. Serum samples from 68 persons with suspected imported dengue with onset in 1992 (1) were submitted to CDC from 23 states (Table 1). Of these, 17 (25%) cases (from 10 states) were serologically or virologically diagnosed as dengue. This report summarizes information about these 17 cases.<P>

Nine of the 17 persons with laboratory-diagnosed dengue were females. Age was reported for 15 and ranged from 9-54 years (median: 34 years). Dengue serotype was identified by virus isolation for only one of the 17 cases as DEN-1. Travel histories were available for 14 persons with laboratory-diagnosed dengue (Table 1); infections were acquired in Asia (seven cases), the Caribbean Islands (five cases), Honduras (one), andColombia (one).<P>

The most commonly reported symptoms were consistent with classic dengue fever (e.g., fever, headache, myalgia, and rash). At least two persons required hospitalization; four patients developed a petechial rash; five had low white blood cell counts (1100-2500 per cubic millimeter [normal: 3200-9800 per cubic millimeter]); five had low platelet counts (42,000-77,000 per cubic millimeter [normal: 150,000-450,000 per cubic millimeter]); four developed elevated liver function test results, and one patient showed hemoconcentration (hematocrit: 51%).<P>

<CITE>Reported by: State and territorial health depts. Dengue Br, Div of Vector-Borne Infectious Diseases, National Center for Infectious Diseases, CDC.</CITE><P>

<B>Editorial Note:</B> Although dengue fever is not endemic in the United States, U.S. residents who become infected during travel to tropical areas may have onsets of illness at home following an incubation period of 7-10 days (2). Most persons infected with dengue virus experience mild illness; however, infection in some persons may result in a severe form of the disease--dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF)--characterized by fever, low platelet count (less than or equal to 100,000 per cubic millimeter), hemorrhagic manifestations, and a leaky capillary syndrome evidenced by hemoconcentration, hypoalbuminemia, or pleural or abdominal effusions (3).<P>

The incidence of DHF is increasing in the Americas: since 1984, dengue epidemics with associated cases of DHF have occurred in Aruba, Brazil, Colombia, El Salvador, French Guiana, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Puerto Rico, St. Lucia, Suriname, and Venezuela. In addition, dengue is endemic in many islands in the Caribbean, Mexico, and most countries in Central and South America. In the Americas, dengue is transmitted by the Aedes aegypti mosquito. Although nearly eradicated from the region in the 1960s, this species is now present in most tropical countries of the region and is present year-round in the southernmost areas of Texas and Florida. Endemic transmission of dengue has not occurred in the United States since 1986 (south Texas); however, introduction of the virus by persons who have acquired infections in other countries could result in local transmission.<P>

The 68 cases referred for serologic confirmation in 1992 represent the lowest number of reported cases since 1984 (63 cases) and a 17% decrease from 1991 (82 cases reported). However, they do not include cases of dengue that may have been reported to state health departments without accompanying specimens for testing.<P>

The prevention of dengue in tourists and other persons in tropical locations relies on avoidance of exposure to mosquitoes. The Aedes species that transmit dengue may bite at any time during the day, although the peakactivity occurs during the early morning and late afternoon. The use of mosquito repellent and protective clothing at all times is recommended. Ae. aegypti usually is present in peridomestic settings and is found most often in dark areas such as closets, bathrooms, behind curtains, and under beds. The risk for exposure may be lower for tourists in some settings, including beaches, hotels with well-kept grounds, and heavily forested areas and jungles.<P>

Physicians should consider dengue in the differential diagnosis for all patients who have compatible manifestations and a history of travel to tropical areas. Because of the anticoagulant properties of acetylsalicylic acid (i.e., aspirin), acetaminophen products are recommended for management of fever. Acute and convalescent (30 or fewer days after onset of symptoms) serum samples should be obtained for viral isolation or serodiagnosis and sent for confirmation through the state health department laboratory to CDC's Dengue Branch, Division of Vector-Borne Infectious Diseases, National Center for Infectious Diseases, 2 Calle Casia, San Juan, PR 00921-3200; telephone (809) 766-5181; fax (809) 766-6596. Serum specimens should be accompanied by a summary of clinical and epidemiologic information, including a detailed travel history with dates and location of travel and dates of onset of illness and blood collection.<P>

The geographic range and incidence of dengue virus activity in the Americas substantially increased from 1980 to 1994. During this period, all dengue activity in the Americas was associated with dengue serotypes 1, 2, and 4 (DEN-1, DEN-2, and DEN-4). On November 25, 1994, the Ministry of Health of Nicaragua announced the isolation of dengue type 3 (DEN-3) from two children hospitalized with minor hemorrhagic manifestations in Managua. Subsequently, DEN-3 virus was isolated from two persons with dengue fever in Panama. These cases represent the first isolation of DEN-3 from autochthonous cases in the Americas since 1977.<P>

<B>Editorial Note:</B> Dengue fever is an acute, mosquito-transmitted viral disease characterized by fever, headache, arthralgia, myalgia, rash, nausea, and vomiting. Infections are caused by any of the four virus serotypes. Although most dengue infections result in relatively mild illness, some can produce DHF. Based on the World Health Organization case definition (1), a case of DHF must meet the following criteria: 1) fever, 2) minor or major hemorrhagic manifestations, 3) thrombocytopenia (less than or equal to 100,000/mm3), and 4) objective evidence of increased capillary permeability (e.g., hemoconcentration [hematocrit increased by greater than or equal to 20%], pleural effusions [evidenced by chest radiography or other imaging method], or hypoproteinemia). A case of dengue shock syndrome (DSS) must meet all the criteria for DHF plus hypotension or narrow pulse pressure (less than or equal to 20 mm Hg); the fatality rate for patients with DSS can be as high as 44% (2).<P>

In 1994, outbreaks of dengue were reported from Brazil, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Haiti, Mexico, Puerto Rico, and Venezuela. In Nicaragua, an outbreak in 1992 was localized in Leon province and associated with DEN-2 and DEN-4 viruses; an outbreak in June and July 1993 was focused in Leon and adjacent Chinandega province, but no virus was isolated. A limited outbreak of DEN-2 (14 laboratory-confirmed cases) occurred in Panama City in 1993 and was the first recorded outbreak of dengue in Panama since 1942.<P>

DEN-3 was first isolated in the Americas (in Puerto Rico) in 1963 (3) and subsequently caused epidemics in Jamaica and the eastern Caribbean during that year (4). Although DEN-3 has been isolated from international travelers returning to the Americas from other geographic regions (5), this serotype was last isolated in the region (in Puerto Rico) in 1977 (6). The identification of autochthonous transmission of DEN-3 in two countries in the Americas (Nicaragua and Panama) in 1994 has important implications for public health because most residents of urban areas in the American tropics are susceptible to this serotype. In particular, all persons in the American tropics who are aged less than 16 years (approximately one third of the population of Latin America) and all persons living in Ae. aegypti-infested areas who were not infected with DEN-3 during 1963-1978 are at risk for infection with this virus. The appearance of DEN-3 also may increase the risk for DHF resulting from secondary, heterotypic infection (7) or from the introduction of a particularly virulent genotype of DEN-3 (8).<P>

The international response to the outbreak in Nicaragua was specified by a contingency plan developed by health agencies in 1993 to address the potential for reintroduction of DEN-3 into the Americas. This plan highlighted the importance of effective, laboratory-based surveillance programs for dengue and DHF in the Americas. Because of increased DEN-3 activity in other regions and repeated detection of DEN-3 in travelers returning to the Americas, PAHO alerted member countries of these events during April-May 1994 and recommended actions to follow after the identification of an autochthonous case of DEN-3. These actions include prompt investigation to define the magnitude and distribution of the DEN-3 virus in the country and, if the distribution is determined to be limited and circumscribed, efforts to eradicate mosquitoes in the affected area.<P>

PAHO recently published a document for the prevention and control of dengue in the Americas (9), which includes a detailed emergency plan for the control of epidemic dengue and DHF. During 1992-1994, these guidelines were presented by PAHO to national representatives of Ae. aegypti-infested countries in the Americas. In addition, during 1994, PAHO teams reviewed national dengue-control programs in selected countries and assisted national authorities in preparing or updating contingency plans for outbreaks.<P>

Health-care providers should consider dengue in the differential diagnosis of all patients who have symptoms compatible with dengue and who reside in or have visited any tropical areas. When dengue is suspected, the patient's blood pressure, hematocrit, and platelet count should be monitored for evidence of hypotension, hemoconcentration, and thrombocytopenia. Acetaminophen products are recommended for management of fever because of the anticoagulant properties of acetylsalicylic acid (i.e., aspirin). Acute- and convalescent-phase serum samples should be obtained for viral isolation and serodiagnosis.<P>

Suspected dengue cases should be reported to the state or territorial health department; the report should include a clinical summary, dates of onset of illness and blood collection, and other epidemiologic information (e.g., a detailed travel history with dates and location of travel). Serum samples should be sent for confirmation through state health department laboratories to CDC's Dengue Branch, Division of Vector-Borne Infectious Diseases, National Center for Infectious Diseases, 2 Calle Casia, San Juan, PR 00921-3200; telephone (809) 766-5181; fax (809) 766-6596.<P>

<H2>Information for Travelers</H2>
<HR>
Diptheria is caused by a bacteria and is spread person to person. It effects the respiratory system, initially causing fever and sore throat. However,  toxins are also produced that can result in serious damage to the heart, nervous system, and kidneys.  Immunization works by producing antibodies against this toxin, thereby protecting the recipient from these complications.<P>
Recent outbreaks of diptheria have been reported in <A HREF="/ITC/DiptheriaRussia.html">Russia</A>. While immunization is not required for travel, it is strongly recommended.  Most adults have received diphtheria immunization as a part of their routine childhood vaccinations in the form of the DTP (Diphtheria, Tetanus, and Pertussis) vaccine. If you have never been vaccinated, it will be necessary to receive a primary series consisting of three doses given over a six to twelve month period.  Routine booster doses are required every ten years as an adult and are usually administered along with tetanus toxoid. This combination vaccine is called a Td booster and can be obtained from your own physician or local health department.  If you have received this booster within the past ten years you should be fully protected against diphtheria and no further immunizations would be required for your trip.<P>

<H2>Diphtheria Outbreak -- Russian Federation, 1990-1993</H2>
<HR>
<CITE>Morbidity and
Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR), vol. 42, no. 43, November 5,
1993.</CITE><P>

Despite high levels of vaccination coverage against diphtheria, an
ongoing outbreak of diphtheria has affected parts of the Russian Federation
since 1990 (1); as of August 31, 1993, 12,865 cases had been reported. This
report summarizes epidemiologic information about this outbreak for January
1990-August 1993, and is based on reports from public health officials in
the Russian Federation.<P>
     In the Russian Federation, diphtheria surveillance data are reported
by physicians to the local reporting center of the Sanitary Epidemiologic
Service (SES). Tabulated cases are reported to regional SESs, then
forwarded to the Russian Republican Information and Analytic Center for
compilation of national morbidity statistics, which are published monthly
in The Health of the Population and the Environment. Diphtheria cases are
investigated by local epidemiologists; case investigation forms are
forwarded to the Gabrichevsky Research Institute of Epidemiology and
Microbiology in Moscow for further analysis.<P>
     Reported cases of diphtheria in the Russian Federation increased from
1211 (0.8 cases per 100,000 population) in 1990 to 3897 (2.6) in 1992
(Figure 1). In 1992, reported cases increased twofold over those reported
in 1991; in comparison, during January-August 1993, reported cases (5888)
increased threefold over those reported during the same period in 1992.<P>
     In 1992, 2798 (72%) of the 3897 reported cases were among persons aged
greater than 14 years; the case-fatality ratio was less than 5%.
Approximately 98% of reported cases were bacteriologically confirmed.<P>
     An estimated 80% of children in the Russian Federation had started
their primary diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP) vaccination series* before
their first birthday. However, a substantial proportion of these children
received fewer than three doses by that age: during 1991, 69% of children
in Moscow received one or more doses of diphtheria toxoid-containing
vaccine by their first birthday; 43%, two or more doses; and 23%, three
doses. However, an estimated 90% of children were fully vaccinated with
four or more doses of diphtheria toxoid by the time they entered school.<P>
     In 1983, the State Committee on Sanitary Epidemiologic Surveillance
(SCSES) initiated a policy requiring vaccination of adults with one dose
of diphtheria toxoid; however, coverage with booster doses remains low.
Current efforts to control the outbreak have focused on increasing
vaccination coverage among all age groups; preliminary assessment suggests
that vaccine efficacy is high (Moscow SES; SCSES; CDC, unpublished data,
1993).<P>

<B>Editorial Note:</B> The outbreak of diphtheria in the Russian Federation is the
largest diphtheria outbreak in the developed world since the 1960s; similar
levels have not been reported in the United States since the early 1950s.
In addition, an outbreak of diphtheria has been reported from Ukraine, and
increased diphtheria activity has been reported from many of the other New
Independent States that had been members of the Soviet Union (2).<P>
     The outbreak described in this report illustrates that, despite a high
vaccination coverage rate among school-aged children, diphtheria can cause
epidemic disease in developed countries. Strategies to control outbreaks
and prevent further transmission of diphtheria include maintenance of high
levels (greater than 80%) of diphtheria vaccination coverage, ongoing
surveillance, and intensive follow-up case investigation.<P>
     The findings in this and previous reports underscore three important
points about the epidemiology of diphtheria. First, seroprevalence studies
in the United States, the Russian Federation, and other developed countries
indicate that large numbers of adults remain susceptible to diphtheria (3-
8). Although factors related to the occurrence of the outbreaks in the
Russian Federation and Ukraine are under investigation, high levels of
susceptibility to diphtheria--particularly among adults--have probably
played an important role in sustaining transmission of infection. Second,
because diphtheria remains endemic in many developing countries, these
countries are a potential source for introduction of infection into
developed countries. Third, the outbreak in the Russian Federation
demonstrates that widespread transmission can occur in developed countries,
particularly in urban areas. However, the importance of other factors
(e.g., migration and crowding) also requires clarification.<P>
     The risk for exposure to diphtheria cannot be readily quantified for
persons who may travel to areas with endemic activity or outbreaks.
Diphtheria has been reported in a visitor to the Russian Federation (9).
To minimize the risk for diphtheria, the Advisory Committee on Immunization
Practices recommends the following measures for all U.S. residents,
especially those traveling to countries with endemic diphtheria: 1)
completion of a primary series with diphtheria toxoid-containing vaccine
(persons aged greater than or equal to 7 years: three doses of adult
formulation tetanus-diphtheria toxoid; children aged less than 7 years:
four doses of DTP vaccine [for children aged less than 7 years with a
contraindication to pertussis vaccine: infant formulation
diphtheria-tetanus toxoid]) and 2) receipt of the most recent dose of this
vaccine (either primary series or booster dose) within the previous 10
years (10).<P>

<H1>Giardiasis</H1>
<H2>Can cause both acute and chronic illness</H2>
<HR>
Giardiasis can cause both and acute diarrhea as well as chronic abdominal symptoms such as diarrhea, cramps, fatigue, nausea, poor appetite, and weight loss.  This infection is caused by the parasite called Giardia lamblia which can be found worldwide and is usually acquired by drinking contaminated water.  Campers who drink unpurified stream water or travelers to foreign cities (such as St. Petersburg, Russia) with inadequate water filtration are most susceptible. <P> 

Diagnosing this illness may often be difficult since the parasite is not always detectable in the stool.  It may be necessary for a gastrointestinal specialist to perform an aspiration or biopsy of the stomach or small bowel to confirm the diagnosis.  However, in some instances it is not necessary to make a definite diagnosis.  Instead, the patient may be given a trial of medication to eliminate a possible infection.  Treatment with the medication Flagyl (metronidazole) taken for ten days is usually very successful in curing the infection.<P>

<H1>Hepatitis A</H1>
<H2>Preventing Infection While Traveling</H2>
<HR>
Although the risk of Hepatitis A is minimal in the U.S., Canada, Western Europe, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand, it is much greater in the developing world. The risk of infection increases with length of stay, visits to rural areas, and eating in places with poor sanitation such as food stands and vendors. However, even the most cautious tourist may be unavoidably exposed. Most episodes of infection are spread by infected food handlers that may not yet have any sign of illness. By failing to wash their hands adequately after a bowel movement, such disease carriers can spread the virus to food in the preparation and serving process. Spread can also occur by drinking sewage contaminated water, or by eating contaminated raw shellfish.<P>

For protection, travelers should receive either the new hepatitis A vaccine (Havrix) or an injection of immune globulin (previously called gamma globulin) which contains antibodies against the hepatitis A virus.  The vaccine has been available in the U.S. since March, 1995. This vaccine is given as a single dose at least four weeks prior to departure and can be followed by a booster dose in 6-12 months with protection estimated to last at least 10 years. Side effects have been reported to be minimal.<P>

Since immune globulin is not a true vaccine, antibody levels will decline with time. For the greatest protection, this injection should be given close to the time of departure, ideally within 3-5 days. Depending on the dose given, this protection can last from three to five months. Immune globulin shots are given in the buttock and usually are associated with minimal side effects, such as soreness at the injection site. There is no evidence that immune globulin can transmit any disease, such as AIDS, and it can be safely given to pregnant women. Recently immune globulin has been difficult to obtain due to manufacturing shortages and newly implemented testing for the hepatitis C virus.<P>

Persons who are known to have had hepatitis A in the past already have antibodies to the disease and do not need further protection. A blood test is available to confirm this immunity if uncertainty exists. Frequent or long term travelers should consider receiving the hepatitis A vaccine. For infrequent travelers with stays less than 5 months, immune globulin may still be the more cost-effective option.<P>

<TITLE>Relapsing Malaria</TITLE>

<H1>Relapsing Malaria</H1>
<H2>Symptoms may develop many months after travel</H2>
<HR>
Although uncommon, it is possible to develop a relapsing type of malaria months to even years after traveling to a malaria infected country, even if you were taking the appropriate malaria medications to prevent the illness. Any returning traveler who develops a fever that lasts more than a few days requires prompt medical attention to screen for a malaria infection.<P>
While malaria medications such as chloroquine, doxycycline, or mefloquine (Lariam) can prevent symptoms of acute malaria from developing by suppressing the infection in the bloodstream, they do not prevent relapses of infection caused by certain strains of the parasite that have a persistent liver phase. Fortunately, the most common type of malaria is the <I>P.falciparum</I>  strain that has no relapsing phase, so malaria medications will prevent any symptoms of this infection. However, it is necessary to continue such medications for four weeks after a possible exposure to ensure that the infection has run its course before the medication can be safely stopped. Other strains of malaria such as <I>P. vivax, ovale, or malariae</I>  can infect the liver and persist in a dormant state for months, or even up to several years, after exposure. Because of this risk of relapse, travelers to malarious areas are not allowed to donate blood for up to three years after returning.<P> 
	 In the unfortunate event that you do develop a relapsing case of malaria, it can be easily treated by suppressing the acute symptoms with chloroquine and then erraticating the liver infection with a medication called primaquine. This medication is more toxic and has more adverse effects than chloroquine, especially in individuals with an inherited deficiency in the blood enzyme G6PD that can be easily screened for with a simple blood test prior to treatment.<P>	
	The best way to prevent relapsing malaria is to prevent getting infected in the first place. This is why it is very important to avoid mosquito bites by using insect repellents and mosquito netting in addition to taking malaria medications. If you do develop a fever and flu-like symptoms after returning from a malarious region, you need to be aware of the possibility of a malaria infection and should see a physician as soon as possible for further evaluation.<P>

<H1>Meningitis Vaccination</H1>
<H2>Recommended for Sub-Saharan Africa, Nepal, Dehli, Mecca</H2>
<HR>
Epidemics of meningococcal meningitis occur frequently during the dry season (December through June) across sub-Saharan Africa. This has always been a concern when traveling across the savannah areas which extend from Mali eastward to Ethiopia. In addition, large outbreaks of disease (over 100,000 cases) have been recently reported in Tanzania extending into parts of southern Kenya.  Cases have also occurred in trekkers in Nepal and visitors to the old market areas of Dehli, India.  Vaccination is required by Saudi Arabia for those embarking on the Haj pilgrimage to Mecca.<P>

Meningococcal meningitis is an infection of the covering of the brain and spinal cord. Common symptoms include fever and a stiff neck but the infection can lead to seizures, coma, or shock and can be fatal if treatment is delayed. Meningococcal meningitis is spread person to person, mainly by coughing and sneezing. The risk of contracting the disease increases if you will be spending time in close contact with the local population such as visiting crowded market areas. The disease is caused by the meningococcal bacteria, most commonly by serogroup A, but can also be caused by type C, or rarely type B. The vaccine that is available will protect against four strains of bacteria including type A,C,Y, and W, but will not protect against type B. A single dose of vaccine should offer protection for at least three years. The vaccine is both safe and effective and has been associated with minimal side-effects.<P>

<H1>Poliomyelitis</H1>
<H2>Progress Toward Global Eradication of Poliomyelitis, 1985-1994</H2>
<HR>
<CITE>Morbidity and
Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR), vol. 44, no. 14, April 14,
1995.</CITE><P>
In 1985, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) established as
a goal the elimination of poliomyelitis from the Western Hemisphere by
1990; the last confirmed case of paralytic polio caused by wild poliovirus
occurred in 1991 in Peru (1). In 1988, the World Health Assembly
established the objective of global polio eradication by the year 2000 (2).
Substantial progress toward this goal has resulted from the use of four
strategies recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO): 1)
maintenance of high vaccination coverage levels among children with at
least three doses of oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV); 2) development of
sensitive systems of epidemiologic and laboratory surveillance, including
use of the standard WHO case definition*; 3) administration of
supplementary doses of OPV to all young children (usually those aged less
than 5 years) during National Immunization Days (NIDs)** to rapidly
interrupt poliovirus transmission; and 4) "mopping-up" vaccination
campaigns--localized campaigns targeted at high-risk areas where wild
poliovirus transmission is most likely to persist at low levels (3). This
report summarizes progress toward global polio eradication from 1985
through 1994 based on data submitted to WHO as of March 20, 1995.<P>

<B>Worldwide:</B> From 1985 through 1990, routine vaccination coverage levels
increased from 47% to 85% and stabilized at 80%-81% during 1991-1994
(Figure 1). From 1985 through 1994, the number of cases reported annually
decreased 84%, from 39,361 to 6241. The number of countries
reporting polio cases decreased steadily, from 1985 (99 [51%] of 196) to
1988 (88 [45%] of 196) and 1994 (51 [24%] of 214). In addition,
the number of countries reporting zero polio cases increased from 1985 (84
[43%]) to 1988 (104 [53%]) and 1994 (145 [68%])***. The number of countries
with endemic polio that conducted NIDs each year increased from 15 in 1988
to 37 as of April 14, 1995; 24 additional countries have scheduled their
first NIDs for later in 1995.<P>

A total of 94 countries have implemented surveillance for acute
flaccid paralysis (AFP) to detect all cases of polio that meet the standard
WHO case definition and to monitor the circulation of wild polioviruses.
WHO has certified 12 regional reference laboratories and 60 national
laboratories as members of the Global Polio Laboratory Network and has
designated six geographic areas as emerging polio-free zones****: the
Western Hemisphere, Western and Central Europe, North Africa, Southern and
Eastern Africa, the Middle East, and the Western Pacific.<P>

<B>African Region:</B> Polio remains endemic in most countries of West and
Central Africa. In 1994, a total of 448 cases were provisionally reported
from 20 countries, a decrease of 73% from 1993 (1636 cases) and 98% from
1988 (4564 cases); 12 countries have not yet reported to WHO for 1994;
seven countries did not report in 1993. The number of countries reporting
zero polio cases increased from eight in 1988 to 16 in 1994; most are
island nations or located in southern Africa.<P>

<B>Region of the Americas:</B> The last case of indigenous polio in the
Americas was reported from Peru in 1991. In September 1994, an
international commission convened by PAHO certified that indigenous
transmission of wild poliovirus had been interrupted in the Americas (1).<P>

<B>Eastern Mediterranean Region:</B> From 1988 through 1994, reported cases
of polio decreased 58%, from 2342 to 973. In 1994, the 520 cases reported
in Pakistan accounted for 53% of the regional total, although the number
of cases within Pakistan declined 71% from 1993 (1803 cases). Pakistan
conducted its first NIDs in April and May 1994. Coordinated NIDs are
scheduled to be held during March-May 1995 in seven countries (Afghanistan,
Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, Pakistan, and Syria) and in Gaza, Jericho, and
the West Bank (4). These countries reported 669 (69%) of the 973 cases
reported in the region during 1994 (4).<P>

<B>European Region:</B> The number of reported polio cases in the region has
been stable during the 1990s: during 1994, a total of 211 cases were
reported, compared with 202 cases in 1993 and 204 cases in 1988. NIDs are
scheduled to be held during March-May 1995 in 10 countries (Armenia,
Azerbaijan, Bulgaria, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkey,
Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan) (4). These countries accounted for 200 (95%)
of the 211 cases reported in the region during 1994.<P>

<B>Southeast Asia Region:</B> From 1988 through 1994, the number of reported
cases of polio decreased 84%, from 25,711 to 4184. The number of cases
reported in India in 1994 (3867 cases) accounted for 93% of the regional
total and 62% of the global total.<P>

<B>Western Pacific Region:</B>  From 1988 through 1994, the number of reported
polio cases decreased 80%, from 2126 to 425. In 1994, polio was reported
by five of 35 countries in the region (Cambodia, People's Republic of
China, the Lao People's Democratic Republic, Philippines, and Vietnam). The
number of cases reported by China (158 cases) was a 71% decrease from 1993
(538 cases) and a 97% decrease from 1990 (5065 cases); WHO-recommended
strategies for polio eradication were implemented in China in 1991.<P>

and Immunization, World Health Organization, Geneva. International Health Program Office; Div of Viral and Rickettsial Diseases, National Center for
Infectious Diseases; Polio Eradication Activity, National Immunization
Program, CDC.</CITE><P>

<B>Editorial Note:</B> Major achievements in the coordinated global campaign to
eradicate polio include the substantial reduction in the global incidence
of paralytic polio, the complete elimination of polio from the Region of
the Americas, and the widespread implementation of NIDs and other
WHO-recommended strategies. In particular, the number of reported cases
declined dramatically in countries that conducted NIDs in late 1993 or the
first half of 1994 (including China, Pakistan, Sudan, and Vietnam). In
addition, during March-May 1995, coordinated NIDs targeting 56 million
children aged less than 5 years will be conducted in 18 contiguous
countries in Europe, Central and South Asia, and the Middle East (4).<P>

 The implementation of AFP surveillance is a critical element of WHO's
eradication strategies. Eradication of disease requires a surveillance
system that can detect a single case. Polio-endemic countries have
implemented a system in which any AFP case in a person aged less than 15
years is reported as a suspected polio case. Two stool specimens are
collected from each suspected case-patient at an interval of 24-48 hours
to determine the presence of poliovirus; however, the standard WHO case
definition permits an AFP case to be confirmed as polio if it meets any of
four criteria, including the isolation of poliovirus from a stool specimen.
Accurate and timely surveillance information about wild poliovirus
transmission enables the targeting of supplementary vaccination activities
toward remaining known reservoirs of poliovirus through intensive,
localized vaccination campaigns (i.e., mopping-up vaccination). AFP
surveillance also is being used to certify eradication at the national,
regional, and global levels.<P>

In 1994, the contiguous countries of Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan
accounted for 73% of the global total of polio cases. Since 1988,
importation of wild poliovirus from these polio-endemic countries of
Southeast Asia has accounted for many of the outbreaks or sporadic cases
of polio in previously polio-free countries of Europe, the Middle East, and
North America. Because Southeast Asia remains a major global reservoir of
polioviruses, full implementation of the WHO-recommended polio eradication
strategies in these countries is a high priority.<P>

The global eradication of polio by the year 2000 will require that all
polio-endemic countries implement NIDs and other WHO-recommended strategies
by 1997. Implementation of these strategies is especially important in the
African Region, which has the largest number of countries not reporting
polio surveillance data; the African Regional Office of WHO is assisting
countries in strengthening polio surveillance and planning for NIDs.
Although global routine vaccination coverage levels remained stable during
1990-1994, reported polio cases declined substantially, largely because of
an increase in the number of countries conducting NIDs.<P>

Despite substantial progress toward global eradication of polio,
several challenges remain, including 1) increasing vaccination levels in
unvaccinated subpopulations; 2) preventing the reintroduction of wild
poliovirus into polio-free areas by eliminating reservoirs in polio-endemic
countries (particularly in the Indian subcontinent); 3) increasing the
awareness of donor agencies and governments in industrialized countries of
the substantial financial and humanitarian benefits of global eradication
of polio, thus engendering support from unaffected countries beyond that
already provided by organizations such as Rotary International; 4)
encouraging all countries that remain polio-endemic to make polio
eradication a priority activity, including the implementation of NIDs and
the initiation of AFP surveillance; and 5) providing support to vaccination
program managers for training to develop managerial skills for implementing
and maintaining effective vaccination and surveillance programs in all
countries. The success of the polio eradication initiative will depend on
finding solutions to these financial, managerial, political, and technical
challenges.<P>

<H1>Rabies Vaccine</H1>
<H2>High Risk Countries and Pre-Travel Vaccination</H2>
<HR>
Rabies remains a major public health problem in Asia, Africa, Central and South America. The highest risk countries for travelers include Colombia, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, India, Mexico, Nepal, Philippines, Sri Lanka, Thailand, and Viet Nam.  In Thailand, between 200-300 human rabies deaths are reported annually with 95% due to dog bites.  A recent survey of 1,882 foreign travelers in Thailand determined that 1.2% had a history of dog bite and 8.7% experienced a dog lick during their stay.<P> 
It is recommended that all individuals with dog bites receive immediate treatment with rabies immune globulin followed by five doses of intramuscular rabies vaccine over a one month period.  While this treatment should be adequate to prevent the development of rabies, treatment can be simplified if rabies vaccine is given prior to exposure.  Prior vaccination may also offer some degree of protection in cases when treatment after a dog bite may be unavoidably delayed.  Pre-travel vaccination would consist of three low dose injections into the skin (intradermal) given over a one month time period .  This method is safe and effective but less costly than the higher dose intramuscular vaccine.  Once vaccinated, if you do experience a dog bite, treatment would then consist of only two booster doses of vaccine three days apart.<P>
While traveling, care should be taken to prevent dog bites, and any bite or scratch should be immediately cleansed with soap and water.  You should then contact the local health authorities for advice on further treatment and also inform your own physician once you return home.<P>

<H1>Typhoid Vaccine</H1>
<H2>Now Available as an Oral Series or a Single Dose Injection</H2>
<HR>
Typhoid fever immunization is recommended for all travelers to lessor developed countries especially those in Central and South America, Africa, Southeast Asia, and The Indian Subcontinent.  The highest risk countries are Peru, India, Pakistan, and Chile.   However, about half of all cases of typhoid fever reported in American tourists are acquired from travel to Mexico even though the risk of disease is lower there. Typhoid fever is generally spread person to person especially by food handlers who do not wash their hands adequately after bowel movements. Visitors who stray off the beaten path and eat meals prepared at foodstands or by street vendors are at highest risk.  Carefully selecting restaurants with close attention to their sanitation standards can reduce the risk.<P>

There now is an oral typhoid vaccine and a new single dose injectable vaccine that  produces fewer side effects that the older two dose injectable vaccine.  Both vaccines are equally effective and offer 65-75% protection against the disease.<P>

The oral vaccine (Vivotif) contains a live but weakened strain of the Salmonella bacteria that causes typhoid fever.  The vaccine consists of four capsules that are taken every other day over a one week period.  The capsule protects the vaccine against stomach acid so it remains active when it reaches the intestine where the immunity develops. The oral vaccine can be given either as a first time dose or as a booster dose.  The protection should last about 5 years at which time another booster dose would be needed if traveling again.  The oral vaccine is not recommended for children under 6 years old.  The oral typhoid vaccine is available at pharmacies by prescription only and has a retail price around $30.<P>

The new single dose injectable vaccine (Typhim Vi) containing capsular polysaccharide antigen became available in February, 1995. The protection offerred by this vaccine is effective starting 2 weeks after injection and should last for 2 years. Subsequent booster doses are recommended at 2 year intervals. This vaccine can be used in children as young as 2 years old.  Side-effects, while greater than those of the oral vaccine, are much less than those experienced with the old 2 dose injectable vaccine.<P>

Those travelers at risk for typhoid fever should also worry about possible exposure to Hepatitis A which is acquired in a similar manner. You should obtain an injection of Immune Globulin (ISG) just prior to departure to offer protection for 2-5 months.<P>

<H1>Altitude Sickness</H1>
<H2>Preventing Acute Mountain Sickness</H2>
<HR>
Acute mountain sickness is caused by a lack of oxygen when traveling to higher elevations.  This usually occurs in individuals exposed to an altitude over 7,000 feet who have not had a chance to acclimate to the altitude before engaging in physical activities.  Mountain climbers, trekkers, skiers, and travelers to the Andes or Himalayas are at greatest risk. While individual tolerance varies, symptoms usually appear in several hours, with those in poor physical condition being most susceptible.   Headache, fatigue, shortness of breath, nausea, and poor appetite occur initially. Inability to sleep is also frequently reported.  In more severe cases thinking and judgement may become impaired.  An uncommon but potentially fatal complication called high altitude pulmonary edema, caused by fluid build-up in the lungs, can also occur.<P>
The symptoms of acute mountain sickness can be prevented or minimized by gradually ascending over several days to give your body a chance to acclimate to the higher altitude.  The prescription medication Diamox (acetazolamide) has been shown to speed up the acclimatization process and can be taken shortly before and during the ascent.  This medication is a mild diuretic and may work by changing the body's acid-base balance and stimulating breathing.  Once symptoms occur, they usually improve over several days without treatment.  However, if they become severe, they can be relieved with the administration of oxygen or descent to a lower altitude.<P>

<H1>Auto Accidents</H1>
<H2>Driving Safely Abroad</H2>
<HR>
Motor vehicle accidents are one of the leading causes of death and serious injury for the international traveler.  The rate of motor vehicle fatalities can be very high in some developing countries. Traffic patterns, driver variability, poor road conditions, and vehicle condition may all contribute to differences in death and accident rates between countries.  In Guatemala, there are more than fifty deaths reported annually per 10,000 vehicles compared to less than three in the U.S. and less than ten in most Western European countries.  Other known high risk countries include Peru (over 40 deaths), Mexico and Panama (over 25 deaths), and Venezuela (over 20 deaths). Data is not readily available for other potentially high risk countries in Africa or Asia.<P>
	To reduce the risk, travelers who intend to drive in foreign countries should rent cars fully equipped with safety devices such as seat belts and airbags. Cars should be carefully inspected to assure that tires and brakes are in good condition and that all lights are in working order. Night time travel may be particularly hazardous and should be avoided if possible. Travelers should not drive after consuming alcoholic beverages and should instead rely on taxis or other forms of public transportation.<P> 
	Dr. Stephen Hargarten of the Department of Emergency Medicine at the Medical College of Wisconsin conducted a survey in 1990 of safety devices available in rental cars within foreign countries. He found that while most rental cars had front seat belts, there were fewer with rear seat belts and less than 10% were equipped with airbags. Infant and child car seats were readily available in Western Europe but were available through less than 20% of rental agencies in lesser developed countries. These deficiencies could be minimized if international car rental agencies would adopt uniform automobile safety standards.<P>
	I would recommend that you or your travel agent contact several car rental agencies prior to departure to inquire specifically about the safety features available on their cars.  While cars offering safety equipment may be more expensive to rent, they are well worth the cost if lives can be saved. If child safety seats are not offered, you should plan on bringing one along yourself. <P>

<H1>Motion Sickness</H1>
<H2>Preventing and Treatment</H2>
<HR>
Motion sickness occurrs when the body is subjected to accelerations of movement in different directions or under conditions where visual contact with the actual outside horizon is lost.  The balance center of the inner ear then sends information to the brain that conflicts with the visual clues of apparently standing still in the interior cabin of a ship or airplane.  From one third to one half of airline passengers will experience some degree of motion sickness when encountering heavy turbulance.  It has been found that fear or anxiety can lower the threshold for experiencing symptoms, however some individuals seem to be naturally prone to motion sickness since childhood.  Symptoms generally consist of dizziness, fatigue, and nausea which may progress to vomiting.<P> 

Prevention is best acomplished by seeking areas of lesser movement in an interior location of a large ship or by facing forward and looking outside a ship or plane. Several medications are now available both by prescription and over the counter that may prevent or limit the symptoms of motion sickness. If medications are necessary, they are best taken at least one hour before embarking.  The over the counter medications Dramamine or Bonine can be very effective for short trips or when symptoms occurr intermittently.  For longer trips, a prescription medication called Transderm-Scop (not currently available) comes in the form of a patch can be worn behind the ear for up to three days at a time.  Side-effects of these medications usually consist of sedation and dry mouth and they should not be taken by people who have glaucoma or urinary obstruction. Recent studies have shown that Ginger root may be as effective as the other drug treatments but is associated with fewer side effects.<P>

<blockquote><br><i>&#34Student and housestaff education is a high priority for the Department of Medicine. Our faculty are committed to excellence in teaching and patient care.&#34</i><br><font size=2><b>Theodore A. Kotchen, MD<br>Chairman, Department of Medicine</font></b></blockquote>
<p>
<br clear=right><br>The Internal Medicine Residency  of the Medical College of Wisconsin (MCW) is a multi-hospital university program, located on a suburban campus serving the metropolitan area of Milwaukee, Wisconsin.  In existence since 1925, the MCW Internal Medicine Residency prides itself on a long history of training high-quality general internists. Currently the Department of Internal Medicine is comprised of 100 residents, 60 fellows, and 150 faculty members. Our mission is to provide a comprehensive three-year curriculum in general internal medicine training that enables high quality medical school graduates to learn tertiary , secondary, and primary General Internal Medicine skills in both in-patient and ambulatory settings.  
<p>

<br>
A resident's time is primarily spent at the major university teaching hospital, Froedtert Memorial Lutheran Hospital, which is located on the campus of the Milwaukee Regional Medical Center (MRMC).
<p>
<image src="/images/froedtert.gif"><br>
<font size=2><b>Froedtert Memorial Lutheran Hospital</b></font>
<p><br>
Froedtert Memorial Lutheran Hospital is a component of a large medical center including the MCW Clinics, Children's Hospital of Wisconsin, the MCW Eye Institute, the Curative Rehabilitation Hospital, the Southeastern Wisconsin Blood Center, and the Milwaukee County Mental Health Complex. The Medical College of Wisconsin, a private medical college with 800 undergraduate medical students, is located on the campus of the MRMC.  Throughout the three-year residency, approximately 60% of the an individual resident's time is spent on the main medical center campus.  About 30% of a resident's clinical and ambulatory training occurs at the Zablocki Veterans' Administration Medical Center, a major tertiary referral VA hospital within the national VA hospital network.  
<p>

<font size=2><b>Zablocki VA Medical Center</b></font>
<p><br>
To further balance our program, 10% of a resident's training occurs at St. Joseph's Hospital, a large active community hospital in Milwaukee.  Each of these training sites are in close proximity to the MRMC.<p>
<image src="/images/stjoe.gif"><br>
<font size=2><b>St. Joseph's Hospital</b></font>
<p><br>
The faculty of the Department of Medicine have created a curriculum for our residents which emphasizes graded responsibility while maintaining close faculty interaction. Education is emphasized over patient service needs in a collaborative collegial relationship between faculty and residents. We are justifiably proud of our training program. We welcome your interest, and look forward to the opportunity to tell you more about our residency program.  <p>

<h1><font color=#002204>Curriculum Overview</font></h1>
<center><image src="/images/bedside.gif"></center><blockquote><i>&#34What attracted me to the Internal Medicine Program as an applicant - and what I still appreciate as a third year resident - is the collegial atmosphere. We form lasting friendships with our coworkers, which is so important during residency training.&#34</i><br><font size=2><b>Rob Hegeman, MD, Third Year Resident</font></b></blockquote>
<p><br>
The Internal Medicine residency at the Medical College of Wisconsin offers training programs in the following areas:<br>
<dl>
<li><b>Traditional/Categorical</b> 3-year program: 16 positions per year
<li><b>Primary Care</b> 3-year program: 6 positions per year
<li><b>Medicine-Pediatrics Combined</b> 4-year program: 4 positions per year
<li><b>Preliminary Medicine</b> 1-year program: 6 positions per year
<li><b>Clinician Investigator MD-PhD</b> 4-year program: 1-2 positions per year
</dl><p>
Each of the training tracks utilize components from a general curriculum structure. The curriculum includes clinical and educational programs in the following:
<p>
<hr>
<h2>General Internal Medicine</h2>
A major focus of the residency curriculum is General Internal Medicine (GIM).  Activities include:<br>
<ul> 
<li>Inpatient units with direct patient care and GIM consultation 
<li>Urgent Care general medicine
<li>General medicine care of the geriatric  patient
<li>Continuity Care Clinic with faculty / resident group practice model.
</ul><p>
Residents and patients are assigned to one of four group practices. Patient care, continuity,  and resident education are optimized by a single faculty member acting  as the sole  clinic attending physician for their resident group practice.     
<p>
<hr>
<h2>Sub-specialty Inpatient Rotations</h2>
The proper balance between inpatient general medicine and sub-specialty rotations has been emphasized in our residency program. Residents need focused time on a select number of sub-specialty inpatient rotations to learn about the care of acutely ill patients with major organ disease.  
<p>
Our curriculum provides sub-specialty inpatient rotations in:<br>
<ul>
<li>Cardiology: CCU, telemetry units 
<li>Medical Intensive Care
<li>Nephrology
<li>Hematology/Oncology and Bone Marrow Transplant
<li>Neurology
</ul>
<p>
<hr>
<h2>Consultative and Ambulatory Sub-specialty Medicine</h2>
A comprehensive program in the medical sub-specialties is offered to all medical residents.  Each sub-specialty offers a structured block rotation utilizing in-patient and out-patient consultative activities, ambulatory clinics, and educational conferences to provide an intensive introduction to the sub-specialty area.  
<p>
Rotations include:<br>
<ul>
<li> Endocrinology
<li>Gastroenterology
<li>Infectious Disease
<li>Pulmonary Medicine.
</ul>
<p>
<hr>
<h2>Emergency Medicine and Urgent Care</h2>
Throughout their education, each medical resident rotates through the Level I Trauma Center and the Urgent Care Unit of the MRMC and the Emergency Room at the Zablocki  Veterans' Administration Medical Center .
<p>
<hr>
<h2>Primary Care Ambulatory Blocks</h2>
Recognizing the importance of a broad training in primary care, we have developed a wide array of primary care rotations. These rotations, available to all medical residents, have been developed into thematically-organized, multi-disciplinary block rotations.  Each block includes a combination of clinical activities, special conferences, specifically designed curriculum and study materials.  Each is under the direction of a coordinating faculty from the Division of General Internal Medicine.  
<p>
These block rotations include:<br>
<ul>
<li>Behavioral Medicine
<li>Musculoskeletal and Rheumatological Diseases
<li>Dermatology-Allergy-ENT
<li>Neurosciences
<li>Vascular Medicine
<li>Women's Health
<li>Private Practice Preceptorship
</ul>
<p>
<hr>
<h2>Special Rotations-Research</h2>
Individual educational needs of residents are carefully considered.  Unique educational opportunities can be developed that suit the special career goals of an individual resident. Research opportunities are available for all housestaff, though not required.

<h1><font color=#002204>Call schedules</font></h1>
<p>
Call schedules will vary depending upon the rotation.  On average, PG-1 residents will have nine months of overnight call responsibilities, PG-2's 6-8 months, and PG-3's, 6-7 months.  Patient care on the general medicine inpatient services is performed by a "super team" system which consists of one attending, two residents, two interns, and three-four medical students. This systems permits shared resident responsibility for one inpatient medicine team and a quite acceptable overnight call schedule.  At this time, the call responsibilities include the following:<br>
<ul>
<li><b>FMLH GIM Service</b> - every 8th night
<li><b>VAMC GIM Service</b> - every 6th night
<li><b>Cardiology</b> - every 4th night
<li><b>Hematology/Oncology-BMT</b> - every 4th night
<li><b>Medical ICU</b> - every 4th night
<li><b>Nephrology</b> - no overnight call
</ul>
<p>
Residents do not have any call responsibilities during their sub-specialty consultation, primary care blocks, elective or research rotations.

<h1><font color=#002204>Special Tracks</font></h1>
<p>
<hr>
<h2>Primary Care Track</h2>
 The focus of the primary care track is to provide comprehensive general internal medicine training with an emphasis on preparing individuals for careers in community-based general internal medicine. The Primary Care Track at MCW has evolved considerably over its 11-year existence. Initiated in 1985, and supported through Federal Training Grants for many years, the primary care track has been the originating foundation for many of our innovative curricular programs.
<p>
The focus of the primary care training program of the resident activities is their continuity practice which is based at the Rainbow Community Health Center, a multi-specialty, comprehensive, urban health care center located in a medically-underserved area of Milwaukee. The Rainbow Health Center is a high volume, full-service, community health center where residents and faculty work in a group practice setting utilizing nurse-practitioners, social workers, and a full technical staff. Residents work consistently with a mentoring primary care track faculty, and  evolve their own patient panel which they follow throughout their entire residency program. Primary care track residents spend 10% of their first year in their continuity practice, 20% in their 2nd & 3rd years. 
<p>
To maintain an emphasis on primary care, residents choosing this educational track rotate through more ambulatory block rotations than a traditional track resident throughout their residency. Additional time can be elected to be spent in block rotations at Rainbow Center.  
<p>
<hr>
<h2>Clinical Investigator Track</h2>
A clinician-investigator track is available for selected applicants.  Most candidates have graduated with a Ph.D.from medical school.  The program is designed in accordance with the recommendations of the American Board of Internal Medicine, and provides a trainee with two years of basic biomedical research intermixed with two years of clinical rotations.  Reasearch activities can be done under the auspices of the Basic Science Departments, or one of the subspecialties clinical services.  Upon completion, this special four-year program the resident is eligible for certification by the American Board of Internal Medicine.
<p>
<hr>
<h2>Medicine-Pediatrics Combined Residency</h2>
The Medical College of Wisconsin offers a four-year combined internal medicine-pediatrics residency program.  Four positions are available each year.  At the completion of the four years of training, graduates are Board eligible in both medicine and pediatrics.
<p>
The training consists of alternating internal medicine and pediatric four-month blocks.  Integrated rotations are offered in a number of subspecialties.  Continuity clinics occur weekly in both medicine and pediatrics.  An integrated medicine-pediatrics educational conference is held monthly.

<a name="all"><hr></a><h2>Allergy/Immunology</h2>
Clinical experience in allergic and immunologic disease is provided in ten half-day clinics at the Children's Hospital Office Building or VAMC where more than 9,000 patient visits occur each year. Along with the outpatient service, an inpatient consultation service is available at all affiliated hospitals.  Housestaff and fellows are provided an educational  experience with adult and pediatric patients with immunologic respiratory disease, including asthma, occupational asthma, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, allergic aspergillosis and rhinitis, as well as other diseases of immune mechanisms, such as urticaria, serum sickness and drug reactions. 
<p>
Trainees in pediatrics, otolaryngology and family medicine may rotate through the Division of Allergy-Immunology, permitting ample opportunity to interact with other specialists. Weekly seminars are held for faculty, staff, and trainees and encompass topics of interest in immunology.
<p>
Two fellowships are available for postdoctoral MDs interested in the subspecialty.
<p>
The research laboratories of the division are located at VAMC where investigative studies into immunologic aspects of disease and basic immune mechanisms are carried out. The efforts in research are directed at the investigation of the lung as an immune organ, animal models of immunologic lung disease and purification of antigens involved in such disease.
<p>
<br>
<a name="car"><hr></a><h2>Cardiovascular Medicine</h2>
The Division of Cardiovascular Medicine consists of 18 full-time clinical faculty, 5 associate and part-time clinical faculty and 3 research faculty.  The division spans several hospitals and centers including the Milwaukee Regional Medical Center's Froedtert Memorial Lutheran Hospital, the Zablocki VA Medical Center, Waukesha Memorial Hospital, the Cardiovascular Research Center and the Blood Research Institute.  There is a high volume of clinical activity which annually includes over 2,600 hospital admissions, 2,400 consults, 2,200 interventional and invasive procedures, 7,300 echocardiographic studies, 4,000 exercise studies, and 9,800 cardiac rehabilitation visits.  
<p>
The medical residents assigned to the various cardiology services play an integral and active part in these diagnostic and therapeutic services. They participate in a wide variety of difficult diagnostic and management problems. Experience is both obtained in the ambulatory performance and interpretation of resting and exercise ECGs and bedside right pulmonary artery heart balloon catheter flotation and pacemaker insertion procedures in our coronary care units.  Resident rotations consist of inpatient cardiology and consultation assignments at both Froedtert and the VA and the Vascular Medicine multi-disciplinary rotation.  This rotation consists of experiences in ambulatory cardiology, lipids, coagulation, hypertension and cardiac stress testing.
<p>
<image align=right src="/images/est.gif">
<blockquote><br><i>&#34Acquiring the skill of performing and interpreting excercise stress tests during my vascular medicine rotation greatly complemented the clinical experience gained during the cardiology inpatient rotation.&#34</i><br><font size=2><b>Kate Slattery, MD<br>Third Year Resident</font></b></blockquote>
<br clear=right>
<p><br>
Fellowship training, beginning its 40th year in 1996, is available in two tracks:
<p>
<b><i>Traditional Clinical Cardiology Fellowship Training Track</b></i><p>
The first two years of this three-year program are dedicated to rotations through all of the clinical cardiology rotations (see below). The final year is a focused clinical year in one of several areas including non invasive-nuclear, invasive, arrhythmia management, heart failure/transplantation, and vascular diseases. A dedicated block of time in the second year is available for clinical research activities, which then are continued throughout the remainder of the three years.
<p>
<b><i>Clinical/Cardiovascular Research Training Track</b></i><p>
This is a four-year program with the first year being dedicated to general cardiology. The middle two years involve basic cardiovascular research and the final year is either a general or specialized cardiology training year.
<p>
The Division of Cardiovascular Medicine sponsors a number of conferences either primarily or in the context of the Cardiovascular Research Center. These include the following:
1) Graphics Conference  2) Echo Conference  3) EP Conference  4) Multimedia Conference  5) CVRC Research Seminar  6) Cath Conference  7) Core Cardiology Curriculum  8) Journal Club. 
<p>
This broad, interactive educational experience is designed for both residents and fellows in cardiovascular disease.
<p>
Research activities in the Division of Cardiovascular Medicine span a broad range of topics encompassing both clinical and basic research. Areas of basic research include genetic manipulation of thrombosis and hemostasis, myocardial reperfusion injury and calcium homeostasis, vasoactive prostanoids in ischemia, allogeneic responses to vascular endothelium and inhibition of smooth muscle proliferation by cold laser. 
<p.
Areas of clinical research include women and cardiovascular disease, novel agents in congestive heart failure, myocardial stress imaging, optimal treatment of ventricular arrhythmias, ablation of atrial arrhythmias and cardiovascular disease in the elderly. The majority of the research activities of the division have some level of independent funding. 
<p>
In summary, MCW cardiovascular medicine is an active clinical program with a primary commitment to quality patient care, education and research. Its broad ranging activities insure that its training experiences will continue to be on the cutting edge of the field.
<p>
<br>
<a name="end"><hr></a><h2>Endocrinology/Metabolism</h2>
<image align=right src="/images/exam.gif">
Residents rotate through endocrinology-metabolism for one to two months during their residency.  During this period, they participate in four to five weekly endocrine clinics where they are exposed to a wide variety of endocrine disorders. Additionally, housestaff are involved in the consultation service in endocrinology throughout the hospital, presenting cases on rounds and preparing material for a monthly teaching conference. A weekly general endocrinology seminar series is presented by the faculty to the housestaff. 
<p>
The endocrinology fellowship is a two to three year training program consisting of clinical and didactic training as well as the opportunity to do laboratory and clinical investigation with a faculty mentor. Fellows receive comprehensive clinical training in general endocrinology, diabetes and lipid metabolism with inpatient consultation and outpatient clinic assignments at FMLH, VAMC and St. Luke's Medical Center. This allows broad exposure to all faculty in the division and also includes exposure to pediatric and gynecologic endocrinology through collaborative arrangements with other departments.
<p>
Fellows also regularly participate in all metabolic and case conferences as well as basic science and research seminars. Additional sessions are planned to acquaint fellows with state-of-the-art procedures in the endocrine-metabolic diagnostic unit as well as relevant procedures carried out in radiology and nuclear medicine.
<p>
Research conducted includes both clinical investigation through our Clinical Research Center and basic science. Special emphasis is on basic neuro-endocrine control of pituitary function and its relevance to a variety of clinical disorders.
