<B>STUDY GOALS AND OBJECTIVES</B>

<P>Animal feed additives are an important factor in the U.S. and world food
business and markets.  Without feed additives, the U.S feed animal grower would
be unable to grow economically the food-producing animals which supply a
large percentage of the protein consumed in this country.  Thus, this study is
basically one about nutrition, well being, and rapid, healthy, and economic
growth of farm livestock mammals. Specifically, it is concerned with feed
additives, that is, chemical materials that are added to animal feeds.</P>

<P>In this study BCC presents the technical and business background for the
manufacture, formulation, and sale of feed additives for the three most
important classes of farm animals (cattle, poultry, and swine.) Primary emphasis
is on markets in the U.S., but we also note and discuss some important
international aspects of feed additives supply, especially as it affects suppliers
and markets in the U.S.</P> 


<B>REASONS FOR DOING THE STUDY</B>

<P>The business and markets for animal feed additives are large and diverse.  The
technology of animal feed additives is constantly changing, as both supplier
companies and those who grow food-producing animals strive to make
production more efficient.  The market is dynamic, as the search goes on for
new products to substitute for some which cause concern among people both
in government and the general public.</P>

<P>BCC performed this study to provide a comprehensive reference for those
interested and/or involved in these products. This comprises wide and varied
group of chemical and other companies which make and supply feed
additives, farmers and farm business groups, process technology and
equipment designers and marketers, politicians of all stripes, and the general
public. We have sorted through and condensed information from a large
amount of literature and other reference materials to compile this report.</P>



<B>CONTRIBUTION OF THE STUDY AND FOR WHOM</B>

<P>This report is intended to assist those involved in several different segments of the
animal feed additives industry.  These organizations and people include those
who are involved in the development, formulation, manufacture, sale, and use
of these products.  These include agricultural research personnel, product
development experts, animal husbandry experts, process and product
designers, purchasing agents, construction and operating personnel, market
staff, and top management. BCC feels that this report will be of great value to
technical and business personnel in the following areas, among others:</P>

<UL>
<LI>Farmers and farm nutrition groups.

<LI>Companies involved in the design and construction of plants to
    manufacture feed additives and components.

<LI>Organizations involved in basic and applied  animal husbandry and
    feeding.

<LI>Financial institutions that supply money for these facilities.

<LI>Personnel in  government at many levels, from the country animal
    control and feed agent/expert, to the state agricultural department,
    to the USDA and other federal agencies, the politicians who must pass
    the legislation which regulates and controls food and feed additives,
    and finally the environmental and other regulators who must
    implement and enforce the laws.
</UL>

<B>SCOPE AND FORMAT</B>

<P>This study covers the technological, economic, political, and environmental
considerations in the U.S. feed additives industry.  It is primarily a study of U.S.
markets, but because of the global nature of agriculture it touches on some
noteworthy international activities; these are primarily those which can have an
impact on the U.S. market.</P>  

<P>All market forecasts are given in constant 1994 dollars and growth rates are all
compounded. All market values are rounded to the nearest million dollars.
Because of rounding, some growth rates may not agree exactly with figures in
the market tables.</P>

<P>This report in segmented into twelve sections, of which this is the first.  Our 
definitions and organization of feed additives roughly parallel those of the
Animal Health Institute (AHI), the leading U.S. trade group in this field. We devote
separate sections to the three principal types of animal feed additives. The
other sections in this report are summarized below.</P>

<P>Section II, the Summary, encapsulates our findings and conclusions, and
includes the summary major market table.  It is the place where the busy
executive can find the major findings of the study in summary format.</P>

<P>Section III is an overview to animal husbandry in the U.S., with some trends and
statistics regarding the production of the three main types of farm livestock:
cattle, poultry, and swine. Animal nutrition and nutritional requirements are
discussed.</P>

<P>Section IV is an introduction to feed additives and a discussion of classification
systems and the three primary classes of feed additives covered in this study.</P>

<P>Section V is the first of our three sections which discuss and analyze the markets
for feed additives.  Section V is devoted to feed additives for disease prevention
and control. These are true medicinal chemicals, and include anticoccidials,
anthelmintics (worm treatments), and other additives that prevent diseases and
conditions which harm the animal or hinder its growth.</P> 

<P>Section VI is devoted to growth promoters, those feed additives which make the
animal grow faster and healthier; they are also often called "performance feed
additives."  They are primarily antibiotics, which are added to animal feeds at
subtherapeutic levels to promote growth rather than to prevent or treat disease.
We discuss both hormones and nonhormonal growth promoters.</P>

<P>Section VII covers the other, and largest, major feed additive category, that of
nutritional feed additives.  These include amino acids, macrominerals, trace
elements, vitamins, and some others.</P>

<P>Section VIII briefly discusses some important international aspects of animal feed
additives. These include noting some key foreign suppliers and the import and
export of feed additives and components into and out of the U.S.</P>

<P>Section IX is devoted to the structure of the feed additives industry, along with
some important marketing, technological, and competitive aspects of the
business.</P> 

<P>Section X covers important environmental, public policy, and government
regulatory considerations, including federal and state regulations and public
perceptions and opinions of feed additives.</P>


<P>Section XI consists of profiles of many of the companies which are leading the
way in the manufacture of animal feed additives.  These include several major
pharmaceutical and chemical companies as well as a number of smaller, often
private firms which supply smaller, often single-product, segments of the total
market.</P>

<P>Section XII is an appendix which lists and defines some of the more important
terms, abbreviations, and acronyms used in the animal husbandry and feed
additives industry.</P> 

<P>Beyond the scope of this study are many products which are sometimes added
to animal feeds, but which are not considered feed additives in the sense
ordinarily understood and used in the industry. These include:</P>

<UL>
    <LI>Animal feeds and feedstuffs themselves, basically feed
        grains.  These are products of a large U.S. market (over $30
        billion) which supplies bulk feeds for farm animals.

    <LI>Agents which are used therapeutically to cure disease
        which has already infected the animal.  The only exceptions
        are the disease-preventing additives in Section V, which
        prevent infection by parasites such as Coddicia.  Thus we
        exclude an antibiotic injected to cure bovine mastitis as well
        as all injectable vaccines.

    <LI>Animal insecticides, some of which are administered in feeds
        to kill larvae in animal feces.

    <LI>Growth-promoting hormones which are not added directly
        to feeds but are instead injected, implanted, or otherwise
        administered.

    <LI>So-called "energy" feed additives.  These are usually
        non\protein nitrogen sources such as urea and ammonium
        nitrate, and are more feedstuffs themselves than are feed
        additives.

    <LI>Auxiliary compounds which are added to feedstuffs to make
        them last longer, handle better, or taste better. These
        include antioxidants and other preservatives, flavors,
        formulation aids such as free-flow agents and emulsifiers,
        and pelletizing agents. Many of them are the same
        additives used in human foods, and are regulated similarly. 
</UL>
<P>Our scope is further narrowed to farm food-producing animals raised in large
numbers in the U.S. There are only three such large classes grown in this country:
beef (both dairy cattle and beef cattle raised for slaughter), poultry (chickens
and turkeys), and swine.  Other farm animals which are major food sources in
other countries, such as goats and sheep, are not as important in the United
States.</P>

<P>BCC's focus on farm animals raised for food production thus also excludes
aquaculture, all pets, horses, and other exotics such as zoo animals. These are
large and separate markets of their own, such as the $5 billion-plus U.S. market
for pet foods.</P> 

<B>METHODOLOGY AND INFORMATION SOURCES</B>

<P>Searches were made of the literature, including many of the leading trade
publications, and well as technical compendia and government publications. 
Product and market information was obtained whenever possible from the
companies involved.  The information for our corporate profiles was obtained
primarily from the companies themselves, especially the larger publicly owned
firms.  Other sources included directories and articles.</P>

<B>STUDY GOALS AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>

The flavor industry is seeing increasing demand from processors of
three types of products: beverages, ethnic prepared foods and fat-
reduced prepared foods. These products satisfy growing consumer
demand for new and different taste experiences, and for healthful
products that minimize health risks associated with major disorders
or even provide health benefits.<P>  

In addition to these products growing in sales, the importance of
flavors is mounting as processors use them as key marketing tools
to out-pace the competition.  In some cases, flavors have been
responsible for breathing new life into beverage categories that
were lagging in consumer interest and sales, such as milk which has
evolved into a new type of beverage - the flavored milk.<P>  

Flavors give taste and can be functional. Some flavors impart only
their special flavors when used individually or in some type of
blend, combination or system.  However, suppliers have been
actively developing other types of flavors that satisfy various
processor needs as well. Flavors may now provide mouthfeel and
texture; give the flavor of fats, oils, sauteed and fried fats;
reduce the amount and type of ingredient used so that cost and fat
content can be lowered; and provide choices by making the flavors
in both natural and synthetic forms.<P> 

With these technological advances in flavors as well as in flavor
delivery systems, flavor houses have been able to help processors
use new flavors in new types of products as consumer interests and
preferences change.  Moreover, new types of products are being
marketed more readily because major food companies are acquiring
niche beverage, ethnic and fat-reduced food makers, thereby making
possible national distribution to large supermarkets for greater
consumer exposure.<P> 

Flavors for beverages, for example, are changing because consumers
are moving away from sweet flavors to more cool, refreshing flavors
in all types of beverages.  The flavors once found only in a soft
drink may now be found in a hot or iced drink. Flavor suppliers
have a range and diversity of flavors for beverages that rival
other types of products such as frozen desserts.<P>   

In addition to new flavors being continually developed, there are
new beverages being developed that need flavors as well as flavors
being used for the first time in long-standing. existing beverages.
At one time the special domain of niche beverage makers, the giant
processors have begun to use flavor as a main attraction. Beverages
using flavors include various new age, fruit juice, hot, iced,
dairy-based, soft and sports drinks.<P>

Flavors for ethnic prepared foods are seeing a growing market
because different types of products are no longer considered
specialty items, but mass market items. Flavors can be  the same
flavor used in any type of product or especially adapted for a
specific ethnic product, and/or Western tastes.<P> 

Like beverages, there are new types of ethnic groups offering their
products to nonethnic consumers through niche marketers.  As
consumer demand grows for the newer food types, processors
interested in entering the market rely more heavily on flavor
suppliers to help them develop unfamiliar ethnic tastes. Examples
of ethnic products include Italian, Mexican, and various Asian
ethnic groups.<P>

Flavors for fat-reduced foods are often required to do more than
give flavor to products, and supply some of the properties of fat
that provide both flavor and mouthfeel. With many processors
anxious to make fat-reduced versions of full-fat products, and in
the same range of flavors, flavor suppliers try to develop flavors
that work in any type of fat-reduced product.  Moreover, the
flavors have to work with other types of ingredients, such as fat
replacers.<P> 

The aim of flavor and product development is to provide consumers
with equal choices for full-fat and fat-reduced foods. Without the
choices, health-minded consumers may leave the food category, or
those who have left may never return.  Some examples of fat-reduced
products are dairy and baked goods, snacks, condiments,
meat/poultry products, candy/confections, granola cereals, and
nutrition bars.<P>


<b>REASONS FOR DOING THE STUDY</B><P>

This report is designed to achieve the following objectives:
To discuss the trends and developments among flavor types that are
enabling food and beverage makers to flavor key marketing tools to
attract consumers.<P>

To describe the trends and developments within each product type
that are spurring demand for flavors.<P>

To suggest the market size for each flavor type as influenced by
the types of applications in which each is used.<P>

To analyze the structure of the flavor industry, the market
influences and driving forces affecting flavor development, and how
flavor houses are responding to manufacturers' needs for flavors.<P>


<b>CONTRIBUTION OF THE STUDY</B><P>

BCC seeks to provide insight into one key question:  With which
types of flavors can suppliers best satisfy the needs of food and
beverage makers so that they can satisfy myriad consumer demands?<P>

The report examines each product type in terms of existing and
newer versions in order to demonstrate the changing flavor needs of
food and beverage makers.<P>

The report presents each type of flavor in order to show how it is
being used, or not being used,  in each type of product.<P>

The report discusses the interests and needs of consumers and how
they shape choices in flavors demanded in their foods and
beverages.<P>

The report analyzes why certain types of flavors may be having fast
sales growth as they respond to varying processor needs, and why
other types of flavors may be having slower growth.<P>    


<b>SCOPE AND FORMAT</B><P>

Each product type is described, and then how each type of flavor is
used in those products. Trends in niche marketing, the use of
natural and synthetic flavors, and various other consumer and
manufacturing trends are discussed in terms of their impact on the
choice of flavors made by food and beverage processors.<P>


<b>METHODOLOGIES</B><P>

Sales estimates and projections for each type of flavor as they are
used in each of the three product groups are presented. Estimates
and projections were developed from such factors as width of the
range of applicability, sales growth of each product type,
perceived health and safety concerns by consumers for each product
type,  and various technological and manufacturing trends that
facilitate flavor development and usage for the different products.<P>



<b>INFORMATION SOURCES</B><P>

BCC first conducted an extensive review of the secondary
literature, consisting of materials gathered from trade journals
and magazines, company materials, trade and professional
associations and government and industry sources. Following that,
some one hundred telephone interviews were conducted with personnel
in technical, marketing and sales departments of large and small
flavor houses.<P>

</CENTER>

<B>STUDY GOALS AND OBJECTIVES</B>

<P>Consumers want fresh, quality processed foods and beverages.
Processors want their products to maintain the same quality
during transport and storage as when they left the plant. With
this extended shelf life, processors can have longer production
runs, more shipping time, and less wastage. </P> 

<P>These twin desires were traditionally met with chemical
preservatives that fought against oxidation, degradation and
contamination.  However, in recent years consumers have been
demanding a reduction in the use of chemicals in their foods and
beverages because they fear that they can pose health risks.</P>  

<P>In response, processors have been looking at alternative
technologies that will preserve the freshness, flavor, texture
and nutrient value of their products from the time they leave the
plant until cooking and consumption in the home by the consumer.</P> 

<P>Adding to the importance of extending shelf life is the range of
new types of products that are being developed in response to
consumer interests and preferences. There are reduced fat,
calorie, sugar and salt products that can have shorter shelf
lives through reduction of certain ingredients. There are
fortified foods and drinks that meet the needs of health-minded
consumers and use nutrients which can be lost during processing
and/or pose flavor problems.  Then there are the plethora of
microwaveable products that fit the hectic work-play lifestyles
of many consumers but have short cooking cycles that can affect
product quality.</P>

<P>The alternative technologies being considered by processors are
different types of preservatives, modified atmosphere packaging
(MAP) that could provide barrier properties and therefore
eliminate the use of preservatives, and encapsulation which
protects ingredients through their shelf life so that there is no
loss in functionality.</P>

<P>Preservatives include antioxidants which prevent foods from
becoming rancid, and antimicrobials which protect foods against
microrganisms. Antioxidants work in foods containing fats and
oils and prevent the oxidation that produces rancidity that
causes loss of flavor, color, nutrient value and texture. 
Antioxidants include BHA, BHT, TBHQ, PG, sulfites, tocopherols,
ascorbic acid/salts, erythorbic acid/salts, and substances with
preservative properties such as spices/herbs, essential oils,
citric acid and phosphoric acid.</P>
 
<P>Antimicrobials ensure food safety by inhibiting the growth of
mold, yeast or bacteria which not only cause deterioration of
products but also can cause health problems for consumers.
Antimicrobials include sulfites, sorbates, propionates,
benzoates, parabens, nitrites, natamycin, nisin, and those with
antimicrobial properties such as BHA, BHT, spices/herbs,
essential oils, citric acid, lactic acid, acetic acid, phosphates
and medium chain fatty acids.</P>

<P>MAP is a type of packaging, created with special equipment and
materials, that can protect foods by controlling oxygen and
keeping them safe without the use of preservatives. 
Encapsulation is a method that creates a coating or shell around
an ingredient that, if left unprotected, would jeopardize the
product's quality. The encapsulated ingredient maintains its
integrity throughout its shelf life, and until consumption by the
consumer. The types of problems that encapsulation prevents are
degradation of ingredients, interaction of ingredients, premature
flavor release, and unpleasant flavors spoiling product flavor.</P>

<B>REASONS FOR DOING THE STUDY</B>

<P>This report is designed to achieve the following objectives:</P>

<P>To discuss the trends and developments among the various shelf
life technologies that are helping food and beverage makers
deliver non-rancid, safe foods to consumers.</P>

<P>To describe the trends and developments within each type of shelf
life technology that seeks to respond to the needs of processors as they, in
turn, seek to satisfy the interests and needs of consumers.</P>


<P>To suggest the market size for each shelf life technology as
influenced by its level of functionality, price, and range of
applicability. </P>

<P>To analyze the structure of the shelf life technology industry,
the market influences and driving forces that affect usage of
specific methods, and how suppliers are responding to processors'
needs to find new ways to extend shelf life.</P>

<B>CONTRIBUTION OF THE STUDY</B>

<P>BCC seeks to provide insight into one key question:  With which
technologies can suppliers best help processors extend shelf life
as they seek to meet consumer demands for healthful and varied
processed products?</P>

<P>The report examines each shelf life technology and the various
types that make up each category in terms of current and future
trends and developments.</P>

<P>The report presents each type of shelf life technology in order
to show how it is or isn't being used, and in what types of
applications, possible motivators or limiting factors on usage.</P>

<P>The report discusses the market influences that shape consumer
attitudes toward certain shelf life technologies, and how these
attitudes then create certain demands from processors as to what
should or shouldn't be done to extend shelf life or their
products.</P>

<P>The report analyzes why certain shelf life technologies are
enjoying good growth  while others are experiencing slower
growth, taking into account such factors as functionality and
price differentials.</P>

<B>SCOPE AND FORMAT</B>

<P>Each shelf life technology is described, and then the various
types of additives, materials, equipment or ingredients that are
included in each technology. The various types of preservatives
are discussed, as are the materials and equipment needed to
create MAPs, and the various types of ingredients that can be
encapsulated.</P>


<B>METHODOLOGIES</B>

<P>Sales estimates and projections for each type of shelf life
technology are presented. Estimates and projections were
developed from such factors as the range of applicability,
functionality, price, health and safety concerns on the part of
consumers and processors, and market, technological and
regulatory factors affecting each technology.</P>

<B>INFORMATION SOURCES</B>

<P>BCC first conducted an extensive review of the secondary
literature, consisting of materials gathered from trade journals
and magazines, company and product literature, trade and
professional associations and government and industry sources.
Subsequently, some 100 telephone interviews were conducted with
personnel in technical, marketing and sales departments of the
various types of suppliers involved in shelf life technologies.</P>

This report sets out to assess the present market for protein ingredients in the 17 Western
European 
countries and to analyze potential progress over the course of the next five years.  The countries
for which 
statistical data is provided are:<P>

<UL>
  <LI>The United Kingdom
 
  <LI>Germany
 
  <LI>France
 
  <LI>Italy
 
  <LI>The Benelux countries (Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg)
 
  <LI>The Iberian Peninsula (Spain and Portugal)
 
  <LI>Other Western European countries (Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Finland, 
Switzerland, Austria, Greece and the Republic of Ireland.
</UL>



The base year for statistics shown in this report is 1995 and estimates are provided for 1996 and
forecasts 
for 1998 and 2000.<P>

In the context of this report, protein ingredients are defined as products obtained from plant or
vegetable, 
animal and microbial sources, used to impart nutritional value to a wide range of foods.  They are
the 
sources of all the amino acids, required as a basis for healthy diets.  They also have functional 
characteristics that influence the texture and taste of many different types of foodstuffs.  The main
protein 
ingredients used in food applications in Western Europe comprise the following:<P>

<UL>
  <LI>Soy flour
  <LI>Soy concentrates
  <LI>Soy isolates
  <LI>Textured soy protein
  <LI>Wheat gluten
  <LI>Pea
  <LI>Faba bean
  <LI>Casein
  <LI>Caseinates
  <LI>Whey
  <LI>Egg whites
  <LI>Egg yolks
  <LI>Fish proteins
  <LI>Yeasts
</UL>


<B>SCOPE</B><P>

In this report, the economics, technological advances, legislative controls and end-use
requirements 
relating to the various types of protein ingredients will be analyzed in the light of positive and
negative 
influences.<P>

This report examines the usage of protein ingredients in five major sectors of the retail food
industry in 
Western Europe, namely:<P>




<UL>
  <LI>Bakery products
  <LI>Meat and meat products
  <LI>Dairy products and desserts
  <LI>Specialty foods
  <LI>Pet foods
  <LI>Other foods (sauces, dressings, soups, etc.)
</UL>

Developments in these sectors will be analyzed and potential growth or otherwise assessed over
the next 
half decade.  The effects of any movement in these sectors on protein ingredient consumption will
be 
calculated as will changing demands brought about by European legislation or variations in
national 
requirements.<P>


<B>METHODOLOGY</B><P>

The views, opinions and expertise of a representative selection of producers and end-users have
been 
analyzed in the compilation of this report in order to help project the future development of
protein 
ingredients in Western Europe.  Technical books, trade magazines and journals have been studied,
as have 
projections by economic, political and financial organizations, relating to the industrial growth and 
stability of the individual European countries during the course of the next five years.<P>  

Financial data contained in this report is, where relevant, shown in the local currency of the
individual 
countries as well as in U.S. dollars.  Exchange rates used for currency conversion are shown in
Appendix 
1 at the end of this report.<P>

The findings and projections expressed herein represent our best assessment of future trends in the
light of 
current developments.<P>

During the course of this report, certain words, phrases or abbreviations may occur that, in some
respects, 
are peculiar to the food and protein ingredients industries.  Appendix 2 at the end of this report
provides 
an explanation for some of the words or terms utilized.<P>

Note:     This report measures the weights in tonnes, not tons.  A tonne is a metric ton
          or 1,000 kg (2,240 lbs.).<P>

</CENTER>

<B>STUDY GOAL AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>

This study, Viewpoints Of The U.S. Health Care System In The Year
2000uOpportunities For Supplies, Goods and Services, was undertaken
to provide the reader with a definitive review of the chances that
are under way in the U.S. health care delivery system, and an
assessment of the system and the changing needs that will emerge by
the year 2000. Since the majority of American health care
consumers, health care professionals, industry suppliers, insurers
and reimbursement organizations consider the current system 'out of
control', it is an indisputable fact that modifications will occur.
As a result, many new opportunities will be created. It is the goal
of this study to describe the current health care delivery system,
to keynote potential changes while emphasizing composition,
structure, and dynamics. Since most participants and market
observers agree on the overwhelming nature of this goal, we at BCC
have focused on specific market aspects. These particular
objectives include providing information on the significant
segments that deliver goods, products and services that are
susceptible to change, and the resultant opportunities that will
emerge. It is these opportunities that are the major objective of
this report.<P>

<B>REASONS FOR DOING THIS STUDY</B><P>

The United States health care delivery system is nearly an $800
billion industry, representing 14% of the Gross Domestic Product
(GDP). It grew at an estimated rate of twice that of inflation
during the 1980s with no sign of slowing through the next decade
The system is under attack for being too costly and is accused of
not being capable of providing equal care to all citizens,
particularly denying care to the growing number of people without
health insurance and those not eligible for Medicaid.<P>

There is little disagreement that the health care delivery system
will be forced to change, but what type of change will occur is
open to debate. The political arena, particularly in this election
year, has entered the fray Observers of Congress report that
approximately sixty various proposals for some form of universal
health insurance or cost containment methods for providing more
equal care at lower costs are coming before Congress. The consensus
of many industry observers is that some form of a universal health
care plan will be enacted, but who will pay and how many changes
will be implemented are unknown. BCC's goal is to identify all
potential changes and to analyze the most probable evolution of the
industry and to identify  specific opportunities resulting from
these changes.<P>

<B>CONTRIBUTION OF THE STUDY AND FOR WHOM</B><P>

This study provides information in the following areas:<P>

<UL><LI> U.S. health care delivery system infrastructure<BR>
<LI> Number and distribution of professional service providers,
     medical facilities and dispensing sites, and products<BR>
<LI> Funding and financing vehicles within the system<BR>
<LI> Role of technology and its impact on the health care delivery
     system<BR>
<LI> Foreign health care delivery programs<BR>
<LI> Innovative programs and significant trends<BR>
<LI> Viewpoints of health care industry participants and observers<BR>
<LI> Emerging opportunities</UL><P>

Since the study is oriented to provide information on
opportunities, as well as market data, it will prove to be of
particular value to current industry participants and companies
anticipating entry into the health care delivery market. Readers
who should find benefits within the study are corporate executive
officers, corporate managers, industry planners, new product
developers, government liaison executives, industry analysts,
investors and venture capitalists.<P>

<B>SCOPE AND FORMAT</B><P>

This study encompasses a description of the current health care
delivery system and the system that will probably evolve by the
year 2000, including professional service providers, facilities and
dispensing sites, and the products/services market. Also included
is a discussion of funding and financing of the system and current
health care delivery practices. Selected programs existing in
various states and foreign countries are also described. The report
includes proposed programs as well as viewpoints expressed by
industry participants and observers of the probable components of
the future American health care delivery system. Significant within
the report is a section detailing future opportunities for health
care goods, services and products.<P>

<B>METHODOLOGY</B><P>

The changing nature of the current health care delivery market
caused BCC to develop an innovative methodology for this study that
would be capable of detecting the latest, up-to-the minute changes,
as well as the detection of emerging opportunities. Consequently,
the primary methodology of this report was the collection and
analysis of opinions held by various market participants and
observers as to what they envision the U. S. health care delivery
system will be in the year 2000. The major portion of this
information was derived from telephone and personal interviews with
individuals in the forefront of the health care delivery system.
This data, combined with data from secondary sources and from BCC's
extensive data bank on this subject, was analyzed by BCC staff
members with numerous experiences in the medical marketplace.
Findings and forecasts were confirmed with industry experts.<P>

<B>INFORMATION SOURCES</B><P>

Interviews were conducted with physicians, hospital administrators,
government personnel, insurers, professional organization
representatives and lobbyists, pharmaceutical company executives,
medical products company executives, health care planners and
university academicians. Further information was obtained through
an extensive literature search.<P>

<H1 ALIGN=center>CO47N CANCER TREATMENT AND DIAGNOSTIC

PRODUCTS</H1>

<I> <H3 ALIGN=center>ANNA CRULL/GERIANN PARK</H3> </I>



<H2 ALIGN=center>INTRODUCTION</H2>



<H3>GOALS AND OBJECTIVES</H3>



<P>This BCC, Inc. technical/marketing report analyzes the segment of the cancer

industry that provides products for therapy and diagnosis.  Market forecasts are

provided for chemotherapeutic agents, hormone therapies, biological therapies, radio-

pharmaceuticals, electromedical diagnostic devices, and cancer detection products. 

The report provides a general overview of common types of cancer products; discusses

both commercial agents and those in development; summarizes the federal

regulations affecting these products; describes the major players in industry; and

suggests where research and development is headed.</P>





<H3>PURPOSE OF THIS REPORT</H3>



<P>This report provides the reader with insight into the direction of the cancer

industry.  From this report, the reader should be equipped to identify business

opportunities, be familiar with the major players, and be knowledgeable about the

advances in therapy and diagnosis.</P>



<P>This BCC, Inc. study is intended for those who require a business-oriented

overview of this area of medical research.  The report is designed for those who desire

to learn the new and developing areas of cancer research and those who are

interested in exploring opportunities for commercialization.  The report will be of

value to manufacturers of drugs, diagnostics, and medical devices; marketing

directors and strategic planners; investors; and companies interested in entering or

expanding their involvement in the cancer industry.</P>





<H3>SCOPE AND FORMAT</H3>



<P>As the population ages, the market for products that diagnose and treat cancer

increases.  At the same time, new technologies, especially those from the

biotechnology industry, are being developed that will revolutionize the cancer

industry.  This updated BCC, Inc. study analyzes the sales of products for cancer and

suggests new trends and directions for research and development.  This report

provides information about drugs, diagnostics, medical devices, and their markets, as

well as companies, government agencies, and universities involved in cancer product

development.  Certain company profiles feature specific product information.</P>



<P>Although in practice diagnosis precedes therapy, BCC approaches the market

sectors in order of importance to the industry.  Diagnostic products experience slower

growth and keener competition, while therapeutic agents enjoy the glory.  This

observation may explain why diagnostic agents have been dubbed the "stepchild" of

the large therapeutics sector.  Nevertheless, diagnostic products are an important

constituent of the market.</P>  



<P>The report begins with an overview of the four modalities of cancer therapy: 

surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and biological therapy.  After reviewing

federal regulations, the report analyzes the markets for chemical anticancer drugs,

biological products, and radiation therapy.  Then, diagnostic products are described. 

The leading companies are profiled in a separate chapter.</P>  



<P>Values of the market in this report are for the year given, represent sales by

companies in the marketplace, and are for the United States only.  Projections are in

terms of real dollars and represent real growth.  Competition from other drugs or

diagnostics plays a role in the success or failure of these agents.  The values are

generally based on the best estimates of those involved in the commercialization of

the techniques.</P>



<P>Products that are not of therapeutic benefit to the patient, such as pain relievers

and artificial limbs, are not included in the market analysis.  Accordingly, costs due

to surgery, including the technique of bone marrow transplantation, are not

considered in this report.</P>



<P>Many believe that the manipulation of genetic information holds the key to

products that will diagnose, treat, and prevent cancer.  Highlighted in this report are

new and developing technologies, many of which are the brainchildren of the

expanding biotechnology industry.  This emphasis suggests the advances in store for

the cancer industry.</P>





<H3>METHODOLOGY</H3>



<P>Research for this report began with an in-depth analysis of technical and

business literature, as well as a review of the history of the diagnosis and treatment

of cancer.  Interviews with industry experts, federal government representatives,

company representatives, and university scientists provided the basis for an

assessment of the outlook for the anticancer industry.</P>

<B>REASONS FOR DOING THIS STUDY</B><P>

This technical/marketing study has been prepared as an in-depth analysis to 
forecast and track the significant advances in the advanced alternative drug 
delivery systems market.  Many of these advances include the development of 
systems based on novel delivery technologies that offer near-term impact on 
the pharmaceutical industry, while other systems based on emerging delivery 
technologies are just beginning to be understood and will not make their way 
to the marketplace until 1998 or later.<P>

As a result of the benefits derived from using the newer drug delivery 
systems, the advanced alternative drug delivery segment of the U.S. 
pharmaceutical industry continues to grow significantly and to encroach on 
conventional means of drug delivery.  This segment is attracting the attention 
of researchers involved in the development of new chemical entities for the 
delivery of precise, controlled dosages to specific locations.  Interest in 
this segment has broadened as physicians and patients become increasingly 
aware of the economic, therapeutic and social benefits of controlling the rate 
and duration of an active ingredient.<P>  

<b>HISTORY OF THE MARKET</B><P>

The concept of advanced alternative drug delivery systems, especially those 
that offer a sustained, controlled release action targeted to a desired area 
of effect has had great appeal for nearly half a century.  However, prior to 
the advent of improved alternative delivery methods, drug delivery systems 
were considered only as a means of "getting the drug into the patient."  
Actual practice of controlled release began with the applying of timed release 
coatings to pills or solid drug particles in order to mask their taste and 
make them more palatable.<P> 

Between the late 1940s and early 1960s, the concept of chemical 
microencapsulation technology began to generate considerable interest as an 
alternate means of delivering drugs.  New uses of this technology are being 
derived from continued research into the chemistry of polymer entrapment.<P>  

In the continued quest for more refined systems, in the 1980s, 
polymer/membrane technology came to the forefront as alternative drug delivery 
systems entered a new phase of development with the introduction of 
transdermal drug delivery systems. This passive technique continues to 
experience high growth and carve out a specialty niche within the 
pharmaceutical industry.  Advances on this technology include more active 
techniques, such as electroporation, iontophoresis and sonophoresis, that use 
either low electrical currents or ultrasound to deliver drugs through the 
skin.  Similar, upcoming active techniques are pulsed or self-regulated 
delivery systems that can be adjusted to a patient's biological rhythms.<P> 

Expect researchers to refine further the process of targeting site-specific 
delivery with pinpoint accuracy, by attaching drugs to liposomes, bioerodible 
polymer implants and monoclonal antibodies.  Emerging technologies have 
brought many developmental advanced alternative systems from the realm of 
theory to either commercialization or near-commercialization.  These systems 
include hydrogels, microsponges, mucoadhesives, cyclodextrins, erythrocyte 
ghosts, encapsulated cells, self-regulated devices and enzyme-mediated 
devices.<P>

<b>METHODOLOGY</B><P>

This research results from extensive primary and secondary research, with much 
of the information being gathered through telephone interviews with leading 
pharmaceutical and drug delivery systems market participants, drug 
reformulators, academic researchers and pharmaceutical industry observers, as 
well as government and professional agencies and academic researchers.  The 
balance of the information comes from an on-line data search of available 
government, trade and technical publications relating to this topic, including 
literature on licensing agreements, company activities, patents and state-of-
the-art technologies.<P> 

Projections are given for the mid-term potential of various alternative drug 
delivery systems.  These projections are in terms of 1993 constant dollars, 
including the predictions for the 1993-98 time period.  The average annual 
growth rates conform to the convention for significant figures.  Where precise 
information was not forthcoming, a consensus was made, using a formulation of 
reasonable assumptions and estimates based on a baseline obtained from 
historical data.  The specific demographic area covered by the projections is 
the U.S.<P> 

<b>VALUE OF THIS REPORT</B><P>

This comprehensive technical/marketing study will be of particular interest to 
senior technical and marketing personnel and corporate and product planners 
within the pharmaceutical industry.  The report will be also be of value to 
investment analysts, investors and venture capitalists.<P>

<B>OBJECTIVES AND GOALS OF STUDY</B><P>

The objectives of this study are threefold:<P>

<UL> <LI> To qualitatively identify the inert ingredients of drugs,
      not just conceivable ones but the ones actually being used,
      and not just in tablets but in all dosage forms.<P>

<LI> To quantify the consumption of inert ingredients, not
      merely in terms of preferences but in terms of pounds and
      dollars.<P>

 <LI> To communicate the issues driving the consumption of inert
      ingredients in drugs and shaping new directions in the
      types of inert ingredients.</UL><P>

<B>REASONS FOR STUDY AND ITS CONTRIBUTION</B><P>

  Most technical-business studies on drugs focus on the active
  therapeutic agents of medications, but very little attention
  is ever paid to the inert ingredients that actually make those
  medications possible.  Yet, inert ingredients are critically
  important, since they create the dosage forms and provide
  other specific benefits.  This study therefore seeks to shed
  light on a "hidden" topic of importance to drugs.<P>

  The present study updates a previously published report done
  several years ago.  In the intervening years, we also
  published a study addressing a more specialized aspect of
  inert ingredients.  At the time of their publication, these
  previous studies appeared to be the only ones of their kind
  estimating the quantities of inert ingredients consumption.
  We believe we continue to be unique with the present study.<P>

  Being the only published study attempting to quantify inert
  ingredients has a risk because comparisons cannot be made.
  However, we have received feedback from our earlier studies
  allowing us to make refinements for the present one, and for
  this study we obtained new data and information, as well as
  "helpful hints," allowing us to improve on our earlier
  efforts.  The result is this updated, expanded and more
  refined study.<P>

 <B> REPORT AUDIENCE</B><P>

  This study is intended for business managers, strategic
  planners, marketers, product managers, and sales executives.
  It is not a text on drug formulation and this study is not
  intended to serve formulation scientists.<P>


<B>SCOPE AND CONTENT</B><P>

  This study covers inert ingredients for drugs.  Drugs are
  defined as products requiring clinical trials and FDA approval
  for marketing. This study quantifies inert ingredients for
  drugs formulated in the U.S.  Products formulated outside the
  U.S. and marketed here (or elsewhere) are excluded; the U.S.
  includes all 50 states and, for the purpose of this study, we
  include Puerto Rico.  Drugs formulated in the U.S. and sold
  outside the country are included.<P>

  This study encompasses inert ingredients principally for
  conventional drugs and it covers all conventional dosage
  forms: oral solids (including tablets, capsules and other),
  oral liquids, topicals (including dermal, ophthalmic and
  otic), injectables, respiratories, suppositories and other
  conventional forms.  The following advanced forms of drug
  delivery are excluded: transdermal patches, implantables, oral
  delivery of peptide drugs, and other delivery forms generally
  regarded as advanced.  Inert ingredients for advanced dosage
  forms will be covered in a separate study.<P>

  This study includes only inert ingredients intended to be in
  and part of the final, formulated drug compositions, e.g.
  fillers, vehicles, and performance-related substances.  It
  excludes process aid chemicals that help the drug formulation
  process but which do not appear in the final compositions
  (e.g. wet granulation solvents).<P>

  This study includes prescription and nonprescription (OTC)
  drugs, but  considers only orthodox drugs and excludes
  cosmaceuticals, nutraceuticals, and herbal medicines. Also
  excluded from consideration are personal care products,
  cosmetics and toiletries.  The study excludes veterinary
  drugs.<P>

  This study analyzes inert ingredients in drugs only in the
  aggregate aspects, with regard to chemical types and by types
  of dosage forms served.  We do not analyze inert ingredients
  by specific therapeutic drug class and we do not consider
  individual products and brands.<P>

  In the instances when a substance serves as an inert
  ingredient in some products and as an active ingredient in
  other products, we consider only the inert ingredient use.  In
  the instances when a substance simultaneously serves as active
  and inert ingredient, we do not consider it (but do consider
  the other inert ingredients in the formulation).<P>


<B>METHODOLOGY AND INFORMATION SOURCES</B><P>

  This study is the product of only three man-months of effort.
  Much of the information, data and insights come from telephone
  interviews with ingredient suppliers, generally involving
  product and sales managers as well as technical staff.  We
  also had telephone interviews with drug manufacturers,
  contract formulators and ingredient semiformulators.  In all,
  we directly interviewed about fifty people.<P>

  This study also made use of secondary information, including
  product literature from ingredient suppliers, technical papers
  written by pharmacy and formulation experts, and various
  professional magazine articles written by people knowledgeable
  about the subject.   We also made use of the major
  professional and scientific texts in this field.<P>

  In instances where data were lacking, we made estimates of our
  own and checked them for "reasonableness" by seeking
  concordances between quantities of dosage forms in their
  entirety and quantities of ingredient categories.<P>

  All analyses of inert ingredients consumption refer to the
  domestic U.S. only.  Quantities of solid materials are
  expressed in lbs., quantities of liquids in gallons (with
  conversions to lbs., based on density), and quantities of
  solutions in lbs. of dry substances.  Dollar values are stated
  for products  and grades ready and suitable for pharmaceutical
  use, and generally refer to the supplier level directly in
  contact with formulators.  Values are expressed in millions,
  where l MM lbs. = one million pounds and $l MM = $l million.
  Forecasts of sales to 1998 are expressed in constant 1993
  dollars to reflect real changes without inflation, and the
  AAGR is the average annual (compounded) growth rate, derived
  using standard tables of present value.<P>

  Product brand names are indicated in capital letters.
  Mentions of products are not endorsements and omissions, if
  any, are not intentional.  All analyses are made
  independently, without the bias of vested interests.<P>

 <B> STUDY GOAL AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>

This report was written to piece together, in a comprehensive
fashion, the emerging directions of all the major forces
shaping the evolution of the industry, namely, new discoveries,
domestic and international competition and competitiveness,
economics, science, demographic changes and the public sector,
along with their reciprocal feedbacks. These will shape also
the strategies of the major actors in the 1990s and beyond.<P>


<B>REASONS FOR DOING THE STUDY</B>

<P>The report was written to fill a void: most studies of the
industry focus on new chemical entities in the market or in the
pipeline, and on their potential sales in the U.S., given an
existing demand. While NCEs and their potential demand are
important, they do not exhaust all the forces acting on the
industry's environment; therefore, they provide no guide for
strategic planning, nor do they reveal new opportunities.</P>


<B>CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE STUDY AND FOR WHOM</B>

<P>The business executive will find in this report a detailed
summary of the global environment of the pharmaceutical
industry and its future implications.  We put in first place
the forthcoming unification of europe with its unified science
policy, regulationS and markets.  In this context, we stress
the importance of both domestic and cross-border competition
(i.e., joint ventures in r&d and marketing).  At the same time,
we give great emphasis to research, insofar as discoveries
create markets.  The information presented together will lead
directly to the strategies of the dominant companies, whose
foundations can be summarized as follows: a) being the first to
exploit new discoveries and technologies and to build around
them national and international research, marketing and
distribution networks able to exploit economies of scale and
scope;  b) diversifying across all segments of the industry
while shedding unrelated operations in other industries;  c)
keep "reinventing" existing business, for instance, by looking
for new uses of existing drugs.  In this respect, it is
remarkable that some old drugs are being found useful for
diseases they were not originally meant to cure.</P>

<P>Although we stress the links among the major components of the
industry's environment, every effort was made that the reader
with specific interests in individual sectors or fields of
research can meet these in individual chapters without any loss
of information.</P>


<B>SCOPE AND FORMAT</B>

<P>This very comprehensive report begins with an examination of
the economic structure of the american drug industry and
continues with a presentation of the biotechnology segment.
This innovative segment of the drug industry is presented at
greater length in all relevant aspects:  R&D, the role of
biotechnology within the traditional sector of the industry,
and the specific research on the major diseases present and
future drugs are meant to treat (heart disease, cancer, nervous
disorders, AIDS, diabetes, and others).  In each case, market
forecasts are provided, based on both trends of the disease
incidence of the diseases in the general population, and on
expected drug price inflation.</P>

<P>The public sector, a major presence in the industry, is
presented in all the roles it plays through the FDA, the patent
system and as a purchaser of drugs. the generics and OTC
markets are presented separately for the different roles they
play in the industry.  This is followed by a profile of
consumers and the different products different age groups
require.</P>

<P>Finally, the dominant foreign markets -- primarily, the EC and
japan -- are presented at length, along with the major moving
forces within them: patent systems, rules and regulations,
mergers and cooperative research. as mentioned, the EC receives
greater attention for the historic events taking place there.
the report ends with a brief description of the dominant
american companies.</P>


<B>METHODOLOGY</B>

<P>Forecasts of individual markets, and of the pharmaceutical
market as a whole, are based on trends, which in turn are
premised on the assumption that the age-specific incidence of
the individual diseases will remain unchanged through the
present decade.  Changes in demand will then be affected most
by age shifts in the general population. expected price growth
of the drugs is applied to the affected population in order to
calculate sales' growth through the year 2000.  It is our
contention that growth in prices rather than in demand will
continue to drive the growth in drugs' sales.</P>


<B>INFORMATION SOURCES</B>

<P>The report is based largely on two different sources:
information on emerging drugs and on their therapeutic
potential from medical and pharmacology literature; industry
economics figures from trade literature and other sources.</P>

<B>RELATED BUSINESS COMMUNICATIONS WORK CREDENTIALS</B>

<P>Previous business communications reports from the same author
include studies on engineered foods, the dairy industry and on
"grey markets" for an aging america.</P>

<B>STUDY GOALS AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>

The market for advanced wound care products has been rapidly 
evolving over the past 25 years and has recently entered a 
new phase with the introduction of several sophisticated 
products based on biotechnology and biomaterials science.  
Some of the new entrants projected to become dominant in the 
coming years were technically not feasible until recently.  
These novel products and technologies have made it through 
the regulatory hurdles and now face the daunting task of 
changing traditional wound care practices.  Although 
traditional practices continue to dominate many sectors of 
wound care, advanced wound dressings and related 
technologies offer impressive, often lifesaving, 
advancements that are being increasingly accepted by both 
the hospital and alternative care markets.  Growth is coming 
largely at the expense of traditional gauze and impregnated 
gauze dressings which still hold a majority share of the 
market.<P>  

Our report analyzes the current market for wound care 
products and focuses on emerging products and technologies.  
Markets are divided into hospital and alternative care 
sectors.  The alternate care sector includes all medically 
supervised care of wounds in non-hospital settings.   Both 
markets are huge consumers of wound care products and the 
newer dressings and technologies are gaining broad 
acceptance within each sector.<P>

This report describes the types of wound care products and 
technologies being used in the year 1995 as well as those 
which are poised to become major market factors by the turn 
of the decade.  Discussion of wound care products is divided 
into the following product and technology sections:<P>

1)  Synthetic Dressings<P>

  Alginate dressings<P>
 
  Composite dressings<P>
 
  Contact layer dressings<P>
 
  Foam dressings
        Wound Cover
        Wound filler<P>

  Gauze dressings (non-impregnated)<P>
  Gauze dressings (impregnated)<P>
 
  Hydrocolloid dressings
         Wound cover
         Wound filler (powders, granules, and pastes)<P>

  Hydrogel dressings
         Wound cover
         Wound filler (gel and dry forms)<P>

2) Biological and Biosynthetic Dressings<P>

3) Topical Adjuvants
  Enzymatic debriding agents
  Wound cleansers
  Skin sealants, protectants, and moisturizers<P>

4) Novel Products and Technologies
  Currently available novel products and technologies
 Allografts, heterografts, and tissue culture 
products
 Electrical stimulation
 Hyperbaric oxygen
 Autologous growth factors.
 Emerging novel products and technologies
 Artificial skin
 Tissue growth factors
 Miscellaneous emerging products<P>

The plethora of synthetic dressings on the market makes 
organization of this section difficult.  In the interest of 
following already established systems, we use a 
categorization system developed by the Durable Medical 
Equipment Regional Coordinators (DEMERC).  DEMERC was 
established in October of 1993 to streamline the Medicare 
Part B claims procedures.  An overview of DEMERC is included 
in the Regulatory Issues chapter of this report.   Please 
refer to Appendix A for a listing of the DEMERC synthetic 
dressing categories.<P>  

The above listing of synthetic dressing categories includes 
some minor deviations from the DEMERC system.  DEMERC has a 
category for wound fillers not otherwise listed and a 
category for miscellaneous surgical supplies.   We have 
deleted these categories and created a section, Biological 
and Biosynthetic Dressings, that includes most of the 
dressings listed by DEMERC under the deleted DEMERC 
categories.<P>
   
Under the Topical Adjuvant section, skin sealants, 
protectants, and moisturizers are reimbursed by DEMERC but 
wound cleansers and enzymatic debriding agents are not.  
Enzymatic debriding agents are classified as drugs, and 
wound cleansers were dropped by DEMERC in 1995 for the 
apparent reason that they are considered expendable.  We 
include a discussion of these three topical products in this 
report as each is widely used and intimately related to 
wound healing.<P>  

The Novel Products and Technologies section includes 
products and technologies that are now or will soon be at 
the vanguard of wound management, especially with reference 
to chronic wounds and severe burns.<P>  


This report provides the reader with a comprehensive 
analysis of the markets for wound care products and 
technologies and illuminates the important and emerging 
products, technologies, and companies.  It also includes 
discussion and analysis of topical issues relating to 
pricing, evolving market trends, and regulation.  It 
provides the reader with an accurate bearing on where the 
industry is heading as we move into the next century.<P>

<B>REASONS FOR THE STUDY</B><P>

Although the medical sector as a whole has been undergoing a 
gradual revolution over the past hundred or more years, 
progress in the dressing and management of wounds has been 
more erratic.  The use of the term "modern" dressings, the 
primary subject of this report, did not occur until the 
1960s.  Since the 1980s, developments have been fast paced 
and growth of gauze dressing alternatives has mushroomed.  
These developments have seen the emergence of many new 
suppliers and the demise of others.  Consolidation in the 
industry is occurring at a rapid pace and competition for 
market share within all categories is keen.<P>  

Change is affecting the industry in many ways.  For example, 
less well-known suppliers are finding it more difficult to 
compete in a market in which demands for cost curtailment 
are causing hospitals, extended care facilities, and other 
large buyers to narrow their listing of approved vendors and 
to take advantage of the cost incentives provided by volume 
purchases.   A smaller vendor list also simplifies paperwork 
and inventory costs.<P>

Participants in this industry must remain acutely aware of 
market developments if they are to plan intelligently.  This 
report provides manufacturers, distributors, health care 
providers, and other interested parties with the knowledge 
needed to make informed decisions relating to investment, 
strategic planning, procurement, product development, and 
related matters.<P>


<B>STUDY RATIONALE</B><P>

The intent of this study is to help simplify the tough 
choices faced by today's health care industry executives.   
Market intelligence plays a critical role in decisions 
relating to research and development, sales planning and 
strategy, marketing planning and strategy, capital 
investment, and myriad other choices faced by buyers and 
sellers of wound care products and technologies.  Many wound 
care products on the market are new and growing at double 
digit rates, while others are mature and subject to 
displacement.  Product development is being pursued 
aggressively by all key manufacturers, while physicians, 
nurses, and other health care providers weigh the costs and 
benefits of the newer introductions against the exigencies 
of curtailed budgets and the comfort of doing things the old 
way.<P> 

In this environment, market ignorance can prove very costly.  
This report gives you the solid information you need to 
pursue an intelligent plan of action.<P>  


<B>SCOPE AND FORMAT</B><P>

The geographic scope of this report is the United States.  
The wound care product scope includes wound dressings, 
topical medications, and  novel products and technologies 
for wound healing used under the guidance of trained medical 
personnel.  This categorization includes wounds treated 
within the home, provided a visiting nurse or similarly 
trained person is overseeing the wound management.  The 
important types of wounds are listed and described.  
Categories of wound care products and technologies are 
listed and described, and are associated with a particular 
wound type.  Neither the "over-the-counter" market for home-
use products nor the industrial market for wound care 
products is covered.<P>


<B>METHOD USED TO PREPARE THIS REPORT</B><P>

The extensive research capabilities of the BCC staff were 
employed to analyze markets and access government and 
industry statistics.  New technologies, market developments, 
and research and development expenditures and trends were 
identified through patent and data base searches and 
discussions with key industry sources.   Person-to-person 
and telephone interviews were the primary method of 
information gathering.<P>


<B>INFORMATION SOURCES</B><P>

The heart of this report is a summation of interviews with 
hundreds of key industry officials, trade association 
spokespersons, consultants, health care providers and 
Department of  Health, Education and Welfare personnel.    
Interviews with key industry personnel were the primary 
sources of information on market share and market volume and 
value.<P>

<H3><I>INTRODUCTION</I></H3>
</CENTER>

<B>REASONS FOR STUDY</B><P>

Pharmaceutical manufacture is an important enterprise in the U.S.
and other industrialized countries, and oral tablet manufacture is
the most significant of all because more drugs are made as tablets
than any other dosage form.  Tablet manufacture has significance to
pharmaceutical firms, ingredient suppliers, the medical community
and patients, as well as health authorities and others concerned
with healthcare.<P>

The way tablets are manufactured has been undergoing change in
recent years and is likely to head in new directions.  As a
consequence, the requirements for inert ingredients used in tablet
manufacture, in particular the requirements for tablet binders and
processing-aid solvents used in wet granulation, are undergoing
change as well.  For business reasons, it is essential to grasp the
nature of the forces for change and their significance to the
future, especially for ingredient suppliers who wish to stay in the
game.<P>

<B>OBJECTIVES AND GOALS</B><P>

The objectives of this study are to:  (a) Shed light on the forces
for change in oral tablet manufacture, especially wet granulation;
(b) Forecast directions of change over the next five years; and (c)
Quantify materials requirements for tablet binders and
processing-aid solvents used in tablet manufacture, especially in
wet granulation tableting.  The goals are to provide useful
insights for the management of change and to identify emerging
business opportunities.<P>

<B>AUDIENCE FOR REPORT</B><P>

Readers of this report  are expected to be senior business managers
with decision-making responsibilities, having position titles such
as strategic planning, new business development, marketing and
product managing; the writing is geared to this type of audience.
Although the study contains some technical discussions, scientists
will find this report of only limited value and for them we suggest
various scientific texts on drug formulation.  Our technical
discussions are not intended to go into depth but to bring out
insights constructive for business purposes.<P>

<B>CONTRIBUTION OF STUDY TO BUSINESS INTERESTS</B><P>

Few publications address the manufacture of tablets and ingredients
requirements for tablet manufacture from a business perspective.
As far as we are aware, this is the only published market study to
deal with the subject of tablet manufacture and, in particular,
tablet binders and process-aid tableting solvents.  Moreover, as
far as we are aware, this is the first and, so far, only published
study to deal with the subject quantitatively.  Other market
studies address only the sales of formulated, finished drugs and
often include tablet sales, but they do not shed light on sales of
inert ingredients for drug formulation or on tablet binders and
process-aid solvents in particular.  Scientific publications
typically address only the art and science of drug formulation and
the physical-chemical and performance characteristics of tableting
materials but not the business aspects.  This study's contribution
is to fill the information gap with respect to business interests.<P>

The writing of a first or only publication on any subject always
raises the issue of not having other publications to compare it
with.  In some respects the publication is a breakthrough, while at
the same time it engenders uncertainty as to the validity of data
and their meaning.  Compounding the issue is that, as outside
analysts, we are not privy to all the data that may exist within
pharmaceutical and ingredient supply firms.  In the particular
instance of this study, readers may be able to supplement our data,
analyses and insights with information known only to them and thus
use this publication simply as a guide.<P>

<B>SCOPE AND FORMAT OF REPORT</B><P>

After the introduction and summary, this report opens with an
overview of pharmaceuticalS and tablets.  It discusses the major
types of dosage forms, details tablets and describes BCC's
forecasting scenario as it relates to the future of tablet binders
and solvents.<P>

Next is a description and analysis of tablet manufacturing
technologies and major trends in manufacture.  Issues affecting
tablet manufacture directly relate to business prospects for tablet
binders and tableting solvents.<P>

Third, we discuss the industry structure for tablet binders AND
solventS.  This section includes industry participants, business
dynamics, major driving forces for future directions and
international aspects.<P>

Fourth is a brief description of government regulations and their
influences on tablet manufacture and materials requirements.<P>

Fifth is a section on markets for tablet binders.  This section
includes technical and accounting definitions of tablet binders,
and a comprehensive examination of tablet binders from various
perspectives.  This section includes a first-time-ever quantified
analysis of the market size for tablet binders, with market
segmentations.<P>

Sixth is a section on markets for tableting solvents.  The issue of
process-aid solvents in tablet manufacture is a major one, and our
discussion illuminates this timely subject, with full quantifying
of market sizes.<P>

Seventh is a section providing selected company profiles.  They
were selected as representative of various aspects of materials
supply industry structure.<P>

Finally, this report has three appendices:  the survey
questionnaire used in this study, a directory of tablet binder and
solvent suppliers, and a list of technical and trade information
sources.<P>

by the analyst, on "Inert Ingredients For Drugs."  That study
covered the whole, broad subject of inert ingredients including
bulkers and fillers, vehicles and bases, manufacturing aids and
specialty additives used for U.S. manufacture of all common dosage
forms, including oral, topical, injectable, nasal, otic, ophthalmic
and insertable.  That study was the first ever published to address
drug inert ingredients from the business viewpoint and the first to
comprehensively attempt to quantify amounts of consumption and
dollar sales of those materials.<P>

That study examined the totality of materials usage in drugs, but
it did not break down the functional performance roles of materials
serving multiple purposes, nor did it break down material uses by
dosage form, for materials serving multiple types of dosage forms.
Therefore, to do this study on tablet binders and wet granulation
solvents took a special effort.  This entire study is the result of
four man-months of effort, fully half of which addressed just the
quantification of binders and solvents.<P>

A unique feature of this study is a survey of drug formulators.  A
total of forty subjects representing a cross-section of U.S. drug
firms were asked a set of questions designed to bring out
information on current practices, future directions and feelings
toward material suppliers and their products.<P>

</CENTER>

<B>STUDY GOAL AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>

The goal of this study is to assess the impact of new technologies
on sales of neuroproducts over the next five years and beyond.  The
objective is to help executive managers plan for the future.<P>

<B>REASONS FOR STUDY AND ITS CONTRIBUTION</B><P>

Medical product data services ably provide information on where
companies have arrived in the market as a result of decisions made
in the past.  Rarely do they delve into the information and
insights needed to navigate and implement the future.  Neuromedical
products now receive prominence as a consequence of the 1990s being
hailed as "The Decade of the Brain."  What products should be
developed?  What products can be developed?  What do new
technologies have to offer?  What will product sales likely be five
years from now and beyond, and who will receive the revenues?  What
can be done now to get in on a rising tide?  What areas are more
problematic and are to be viewed more as long-term?<P>

This report's contribution is to take a forward look at
developments now in progress and being implemented in the
neuromedical arena.  Not only data but also analyses, insights and
explorations of critical issues are provided.  In a time when
resources have to be rationed, there can be little substitute for
this kind of forward "thinking."  Excitement over new developments
is tempered here by a rational examination of all dimensions.<P>

<B>AUDIENCE FOR REPORT</B><P>

Readers of this study are expected to be business managers and
scientists interested in business.  This report is specifically
geared to address the job functions of strategic planning, new
business development, marketing, product management and research
management.  Investment analysts should also find this report of
value.<P>

<B>SCOPE AND CONTENT</B><P>

This report is a business study and not a science or medical text.
Emphasis is on new and future developments, and not on the past.
The focus of this study is the central nervous system, and
peripheral system agents are barely discussed.  Historical sales
analyses include current dollars, constant dollars and constant
dollars per unit population.  Present and projected sales refer to
the United States, but this study has some important demographic
analyses for other countries.  The study goes to great length to
shed light on issues and forces shaping the neuroproducts market
and neuroproduct supply.  Forecasts are reasoned and explained, not
just stated, and possibilities for commercial failure are
considered as much as the opportunities for commercial success.<P>

<B>METHODOLOGY</B><P>

This study results from three man-months of research and
concentrated effort to gather all relevant and timely information
on the subject.  Primary sources of information were scientists,
physicians, psychiatrists and business managers of many sorts, who
were interviewed by telephone.  Secondary sources were copious
technical and business literature gathered from scientific
publications, government publications and companies, as well as our
in-house computerized literature search capabilities and current
awareness newsletters such as Applied Genetics News.  Original
contributions by the author, and critical assumptions, are
explained in the text.<P>

Sales figures are expressed in U.S. millions of dollars ($1 million
= $1 MM = $1,000,000).  In general, they refer to U.S. sales and
consider only the manufacturer-level.  Projections to 1995 are
expressed in constant 1990 dollars to reflect real changes without
inflation, and assume constant prices.  The five-year average
annual growth rate (AAGR) is derived by the compounding method
using standard tables of net present value.<P>

BCC and the analyst have no vested interest in any company or
product mentioned in this report.  All analyses and forecasts are
made independently and without bias.  Omissions of company names or
products, if any, are unintentional.  Medical opinions are the
expressions of others.<P>

<B>CREDENTIALS AND RELATED WORK</B><P>

The writer of this study is a biochemist and M.B.A., with previous
experience in the pharmaceutical industry.  Among his published
studies in the biomedical field are:  Cancer Diagnostic and
Treatment Products, Medical Anti-Infectives, Toxicology,
Bioengineered Medical Proteins, New Forms of Drug Delivery, STDs,
Inert Ingredients For Drugs, Materials for Tablet Manufacture, and
Protein Manufacturing Technologies.  Other related BCC studies, by
others, include Blood Industry, Medical Diagnostic Kits, Drug Abuse
and Monitoring Reagents, New Horizons In Pharmaceuticals,
Diagnostics and Treatments For Immune Diseases, and Non- and Semi-
Invasive Surgery.<P>

<B>STUDY GOAL AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>

This market report on advances in the treatment of immune diseases
is an attempt to provide the pharmaceutical and biotechnology
executive with a comprehensive assessment of the current state of
technical advances as well as the commercial and market potential
of the development programs currently underway at various companies
and institutions.<P>

<B>REASONS FOR DOING THE STUDY</B><P>

Immune diseases are represented in a substantial proportion of the
population, are often chronic, debilitating and life threatening
and currently have no cure.  Many immune diseases are rare in
occurrence and not well known.  This study was undertaken to
examine the developments in the understanding of the immune system
over the 1980-1990 period and present the most likely commercial
products emanating from this research.<P>

<B>CONTRIBUTION OF THE STUDY</B><P>

The information and analysis presented in this report on immune
diseases will be an important asset in decision-making for managers
involved in business development, marketing, market research,
product development, mergers and acquisitions, licensing,
investment banking and deal creation, business management, and
consultants to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry.  The
study provides a comprehensive analysis of the markets for drugs
for the treatment of immune diseases from currently available
treatment to the market potential of promising drugs under
development.<P>

<B>STUDY SCOPE AND FORMAT</B><P>

The scope of the study is worldwide and presents all major immune
diseases.  The summary section provides a description of immune
diseases, prevalence of patient population and worldwide market
size estimates as well as growth rates for the period 1991 to 2001.
The industry overview section presents the growing importance of
the treatment of immune diseases in terms of market size and growth
in comparison to the total worldwide and U.S. pharmaceutical
industry.  Key tables on worldwide and U.S. prevalence, market size
and growth estimates for treatment of each of the major immune
diseases is presented in this section to provide a quick overview
of existing size and market potential.<P>

The section on Government Regulations explains the process of
clinical drug development, the U.S. FDA expedited Drug Approval
Plan of 1989 and the U.S. FDA Orphan Drug Act of 1983.<P>

The market section is the heart of the report and provides a
detailed analysis of each immune disease, currently available
treatment, status of new drugs under clinical development, early
research and development of new treatment modalities, companies
leading in research and development of immune-based drugs as well
as companies currently having leadership positions in the present
form of treatment.  Throughout the market section, all this
information is incorporated in developing estimates of expected
approval time frames for new immune-based and other drugs under
clinical trials, and market size and growth projections for the
treatment of each of the major immune diseases over the period 1991
to 2001.<P>

The section on industry structure provides a discussion on the
impact of and projected market position of new immune-based drugs
in the treatment of immune diseases, current and future market
leaders in the treatment of immune diseases, marketing and drug
development relationships between young, promising biotechnology
companies and worldwide pharmaceutical companies.  Pricing and
manufacturing issues during the commercialization of new immune-
based drugs have also been presented.<P>

The section on company profiles provides important information on
those companies that lead the pharmaceutical and biotechnology
industry in the research and development of new immune-based drugs
in the treatment of immune diseases as well as information on those
companies that have leadership position in the currently available
treatment of immune diseases.<P>

Included in the Appendix section is a discussion on the workings of
the body's immune system as well as a description of the immune
system drugs derived from biotechnology which demonstrate
commercial significance.<P>

<B>METHODOLOGY AND INFORMATION SOURCES</B><P>

The information and analysis presented in this report are based on
an extensive survey of the biotechnology and pharmaceutical
industries as well as a detailed examination of published
literature and reports obtained from regulatory authorities,
medical research institutions, pharmaceutical trade associations,
and national and world health organizations.  Key information from
the business literature was used as a basis to conduct dialogue and
obtain expert opinion on commercial potential and market sizes from
industry professionals.<P>

<B>STUDY GOAL AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>

The market for vaccines and drugs for AIDS and AIDS-associated diseases is an
explosive one which will have a significant impact on the pharmaceutical
industry.  Although the disease incidence and the related market is not of the
magnitude of those for illnesses such as heart disease, the market is
nevertheless still significant. Various vaccines and innovative drugs are
under development with great potential for treating and, perhaps, preventing
AIDS.  The goal and objectives of this study are to fully describe the current
and future status of this market segment and its dynamics, and to forecast
market size through the year 2000.<P>

<B>REASONS FOR DOING THIS STUDY</B><P>

AIDS infection within the U.S. population is reaching devastating levels.
Approximately 242,000 Americans have been diagnosed as HIV positive.   A
cumulative 160,000 have already died from AIDS. Projections by the World
Health Organization forecast that approximately 40 million people worldwide
could be HIV-infected by the year 2000, with the U.S. experiencing 1.5 million
cases. Efforts aimed at "curing" AIDS have not been successful and drugs
currently marketed to treat HIV/AIDS are only pallitives.  Only the drugs to
treat AIDS-associated infections and related conditions have met with
therapeutic success.<P>

A quest has begun within the medical community to combat this disease and to
develop vaccines to prevent HIV infection and/or the development of full-blown
AIDS. Also, the search includes development of better drugs to treat the AIDS-
associated infections.   Recent theories postulating on the multiple phases of
HIV disease and the complex events promoting the deterioration of an HIV-
infected patient's immune system have added a new parameter to the development
of treatment strategies.<P>

The Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association (PMA) recently reported that
there are currently in progress 95 projects involving 91 different medicines
and vaccines relating to AIDS.  To date, 17 therapies for AIDS and AIDS-
associated diseases have received FDA approval for marketing.  These drugs
have provided a 1993 U.S. market of $787.5 million at the manufacturer's
(wholesale) sales level.  By 1998 this combined market is projected to grow to
over $1.4 billion in constant dollars.<P>

It is the purpose of this study to define this market in detail, with
particular emphasis on emerging products and opportunities.<P>

<B>CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE STUDY AND FOR WHOM</B><P>

This study details the United States market for vaccines and drugs for AIDS and
AIDS-associated infections, including:<P>

<UL><LI>products that are currently marketed<BR>
<LI>emerging and current technologies<BR>
<LI>analysis of these technologies, including their limitations and
           potential impact on future products and market growth<BR>

           including health care financing issues<BR>
<LI>niche areas offering opportunities for development<BR>
<LI>identification of potential market barriers<BR>
<LI>international aspects of the market</UL><P>

<B>SCOPE AND FORMAT</B><P>

This study encompasses the nearly 100 products currently under development, as
well as all existing products for AIDS and AIDS-associated medical conditions.
Also included are any emerging technologies that offer potential opportunities
for new drugs or vaccines.<P>

The AIDS therapy market is defined against current disease incidence and
forecasted incidence.  Wherever possible component suppliers, end markets,
government and regulatory agencies, major companies competing in this
marketplace, relative market shares and impact on worldwide status are
discussed.<P>

<B>METHODOLOGY</B><P>

The methodologies employed in this study include use of both primary
interviews with industry personnel and analysis of secondary data.  Among the
primary data sources are drug company personnel, government and regulatory
representatives, industry observers, scientists and industry professional
organizations.  Growth calculations are made in constant 1993 dollars at the
manufacturers' price level.<P>

All data collected was reviewed by BCC's specialists in the health care
industry and all findings and projections were confirmed with numerous
industry sources.<P>

<B>INFORMATION SOURCES</B><P>

Data sources for this report include information obtained from interviews with
various market participants and observers.  Substantial secondary data was
available from the federal government through the National Center for
Infectious Disease division of the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the
Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (U.S. Department of Health and
Human Services.  BCC's extensive library also served as a data source as did
corporate and industry trade association publications.<P>

<B>STUDY GOALS AND OBJECTIVES</B>

<P>A goal of this study is to identify the forces shaping the re-emerging vaccine 
market. Another goal is to quantify the sales of both vaccines and forecast 
future sales.</P> 

<P>The objectives of the study are to:</P>

   <P>Identify key business and political issues as they relate to the vaccine
      industry </P>
   <P>Describe potential vaccines in clinical trials and in preclinical and
      research programs</P>
   <P>Describe development efforts to improve vaccine delivery using adjuvants 
      and other new delivery technologies</P>
   <P>Define the patient populations, forecast markets to 1999 and identify high
      growth areas.</P>


<B>REASONS FOR STUDY</B>

<P>The vaccine industry is changing rapidly.  New methods of preparing vaccines, 
new targets for vaccines and new delivery technologies are emerging.  Diseases 
such as Lyme disease and hantavirus are becoming international problems.  New 
outbreaks of old diseases such as tuberculosis and cholera point out the need 
for improved vaccines. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention has 
announced that common bacterial infections are becoming immune to current 
antibiotics.  The threat is increasing as germs genetically change.  There is 
an increase in fatalities due to tuberculosis in AIDS patients.</P> 

<P>Vaccines offer both preventive and therapeutic opportunities for controlling 
and/or eradicating numerous diseases.  The key issues shaping the market need 
to be defined, analyzed and put into a composite image of the industry.  A new 
industry is emerging as new types of vaccines target old diseases and new 
types of diseases are being targeted by the biotechnology industry.</P> 


<B>CONTRIBUTION OF THE STUDY AND FOR WHOM</B>

<P>This report is written for business executives interested in serving the 
market for vaccines.  The study will be a valuable resource of information, 
data and analysis for suppliers of these products, including the 
pharmaceutical manufacturers, as well as purchasers of the vaccines.  
Investors looking for new growth areas in healthcare, and those looking for 
strategic alliances and business opportunities will find this study highly 
worthwhile.</P> 

<B>SCOPE AND FORMAT</B>

<P>The vaccines covered in this report provide both a clear image of the industry 
today and a look at the future of the vaccine industry.  For over 30 diseases, 
this study provides information on market size (patient population), sales 
estimates and projections of growth for the market.  Included in the study are 
the traditional childhood diseases (measles, mumps, rubella, chicken pox, 
whooping cough), the diseases endemic and epidemic in developing countries 
(malaria, diphtheria, cholera, HIV), diseases showing resurgence in unexpected 
areas (tuberculosis, polio) and diseases not previously treated with vaccines 
(rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, cystic fibrosis, diabetes, 
chlamydia, genital warts).</P> 

<P>Excluded from this study are vaccines for allergies.  Also vaccines which have 
not been actively discussed in the trade literature over the past year are 
excluded.  Examples include adenovirus vaccines and yellow fever vaccines.</P> 

<P>The study format includes for each disease a detailed description including 
companies, composition of vaccines, status of development of vaccines and 
related comments in a tabular format.  For selected diseases with high levels 
of activity, a "phase diagram" providing a snapshot of who (company), what 
(vaccine description) and when (status) is included.</P> 


<B>METHODOLOGY</B>

<P>Primary sources include meetings with pharmaceutical industry professionals 
and telephone conversations.  Secondary information was obtained from various 
trade literature, the Pharmaceutical Research & Manufacturers Association, 
company press releases and other company literature, the Physicians' Desk 
Reference, U.S. government documents, disease-specific associations such as 
the American Cancer Society and Lyme Disease Foundation and numerous technical 
books and journals.</P> 

<P>All sales figures are for worldwide sales unless stated for a specific 
country.  Sales are expressed in millions of dollars (106) and shown in tables 
as "MM".  All dollar figures are in constant dollars.  No corrections for 
inflation are included.</P> 

<P>Sales figures were determined using U.S. government documents, 1994 Red Book 
prices for vaccines, and sales data and vaccine descriptions found in company 
and trade literature.  Projections are based on projected approvals for new 
vaccines, known efforts by government agencies worldwide to provide vaccines 
for specific diseases, current vaccination rates and populations.</P>

</CENTER>

<B>STUDY GOALS AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>

A goal of this study is to identify diseases and medical conditions affecting
only women or disproportionately affecting women, or which require special
diagnostic or therapeutic products because of the unique requirements of
females. Another goal of this study is to quantify the sales of diagnostic and
therapeutic products for women's medicine and to forecast sales.<P>

The objectives of the study are to:<P>

<UL><LI>  Describe the current treatments and roles of drugs in the market
       applications where women are the only or the majority of patients.

<LI>   Examine potential therapeutics now in clinical trials and in
       preclinical and research programs that target women's diseases
       and medical conditions.

<LI>   Define the patient populations, forecast therapeutic and diagnostic
       markets to 1997, and identify high growth markets.</UL><P>


<B>REASONS FOR STUDY</B><P>

Women's diseases and medical conditions have never been a separate issue of
attention for the pharmaceutical industry until now.  Yet, today we know that
the special needs of women are not always being met and we recognize that the
female and male responses to medications can differ in many instances.<P>


<B>AUDIENCE FOR REPORT</B><P>

This report is written for business executives interested in serving the
women's market for diagnostics and therapeutics.  The study will be a valuable
resource of information, data and analysis for suppliers of these products,
including pharmaceutical and diagnostics manufacturers, as well as for
purchasers of the products.  Investors seeking new growth areas in healthcare,
and those looking for strategic alliances and business opportunities will find
this study highly worthwhile.<P>



<B>SCOPE OF STUDY</B><P>

The diseases and medical conditions covered in this study exclusively or
primarily relate to women. For the 20 diseases or conditions covered, this
study provides market size (patient population) data, sales estimates, and
projections of growth for each of the 20 diseases and conditions. Included are
female-specific cancers (ovarian, cervical, endometrial, breast);
gynecological infections; female-specific kidney and urological diseases;
menopause and osteoporosis; and female reproduction (contraception,
infertility, pregnancy).<P>

Excluded from this study are diseases and medical conditions which affect men
and women about equally or in a non-gender related way, such as heart disease,
hypertension, lung cancer and many others.  Important as they are,
understudied as they are from the perspective of women's needs, this study simply cannot address them all.<P>


<B>METHODOLOGY AND INFORMATION SOURCES</B><P>

Primary information came from telephone interviews with physicians, scientists and business executives in the medical field.  Secondary information was obtained from various trade literature, the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Assn., pharmaceutical company annual reports and other company literature, the Physicians' Desk Reference and USP Drug Index, U.S. government documents, disease-specific associations such as the American Cancer Society and Endometriosis Society, and numerous technical books and journals.<P>

Except where noted, all sales estimates and analysis relate to the U.S. market only. Except where noted, all sales figures refer to the retail level. Estimates are provided for 1992, 1993 and 1997 and are given in millions of dollars.  Forecasts for 1997 are expressed in constant 1992 dollars to reflect real changes without inflation.   The average annual growth rate, AAGR, is derived by the compounding method from standard tables of present value.

All analyses are made independently, without the bias of vested interests. Mentions of products are not endorsements, and omissions, if any, are not intentional.<P>


<B>ANALYST CREDENTIALS</B><P>

The analyst for this study has a B.S. degree in chemistry (Drexel University)
and an M.B.A. degree in management (Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute), as well
as additional credits in marketing (Hartford University Graduate Center).  She
has extensive work experience in a major pharmaceutical company, as a research
analyst.<P>

<B>STUDY GOALS AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>

This report, New Strategies In Drug Markets, addresses the tactical marketing maneuvers pharmaceutical companies are implementing, or perhaps should 
implement, in response to the efforts of health care reformers to cut costs.   <P>

The U.S. pharmaceutical industry generated domestic sales of over $57 
billion for drugs in 1993, up nearly 7% from the previous year, but the 
industry has shown past annual growth rates at the double digit level.  The industry is one of world's most profitable, but recent attacks on drug pricing, as well as patent expirations allowing for inroads by generic drugs, 
changes in the tax laws (Section 936), and poor foreign exchange rates do not bode well for the near future. Furthermore, large multinational companies and 
foreign-owned companies experiencing contracting markets, due to many of the 
same problems in their own countries, are focusing on the U.S. market for 
expansion.  Drug companies have been actively developing various strategies, 
both current and future, in their quest for maintaining current position and 
sustaining growth.<P>

Within the goals of this study BCC will provide detailed 
information on these various strategies and an analysis of each, with 
particular emphasis on how they will impact on the current and future status 
of the pharmaceutical market through the year 2000.<P> 


<b>REASONS FOR DOING THIS STUDY</B><P>

The current climate for developing, manufacturing and marketing pharmaceuticals
is at an all-time low and the short-term outlook is one of further uncertainty. 
Among the reasons BCC undertook this study is to provide information and
analysis on: Barbara Briendel


<UL><LI> Strategies required for drug companies to survive and thrive in this 
    uncertain climate<P>

<LI>  Numerous new marketing concepts drug companies are instituting, including
    joint ventures, licensing, marketing alliances, mergers, acquisitions, 
    and new pricing strategies<P>

<LI>  Innovative product concepts, drug delivery systems, and new dosaging formats
    companies are incorporating into their product lines<P>

<LI>  Distribution methods and group purchasing programs being undertaken by
    pharmaceutical companies<P>

<LI>  Creative approaches in advertising and promotion. <P></UL>


<b>CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE STUDY AND FOR WHOM</B><P>

pharmaceutical industry, since it provides details on the United States
pharmaceutical market with emphasis on drug marketing, including:<P>

<UL><LI> new marketing concepts and trends<P>

<LI> changes in traditional strategies<P>

   <LI> changes in marketplace and market segments<P>

<LI> impact of outside influences such as national health care programs and 
       the  regulatory environment; with identification of potential market 
       barriers<P>

<b>SCOPE AND FORMAT</B><P>

The entire pharmaceutical industry is examined in this report, with particular 
emphasis on those companies that are taking innovative marketing actions to 
position themselves as market leaders through the year 2000.<P>  

The market is segmented into ethical and over-the-counter drugs in both the 
branded and generic forms.  Throughout the report an effort is made to discuss 
vertical integration of market segments and to identify component suppliers, 
end markets, government and regulatory agencies.  Companies participating in 
the marketplace will be described as to relative market share, marketing 
strengths, participation in new segments, and innovative marketing practices.<P> 

<b>METHODOLOGY</B><P>

The methodologies employed in this study include use of both primary interviews
with industry personnel and analysis of secondary data.  Among the primary data
sources are drug company personnel, government and regulatory representatives,
industry observers, scientists, and industry professional organizations.<P>  

Growth forecasts are made in constant 1993 dollars based on the manufacturer's
(wholesale) price level unless otherwise noted.<P>

All data collected was reviewed by BCC's specialists in the health care 
industry, and all findings and projections were confirmed with numerous 
industry sources.<P> 

<b>INFORMATION SOURCES</B><P>

Data sources for this report include information obtained from interviews with 
various market participants and observers.  BCC's extensive library also 
served as a data source, as did corporate and industry trade association 
publications and industry data banks.<P>

<B>STUDY GOAL AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>

The goals and objectives of this study, The Biocompatible
Materials Marketplace, are to provide the reader with a
comprehensive description and evaluation of this dynamic
marketplace so that its significance to the practice of modern
medicine is understood.  The report focuses on the major
materials now in use and the emerging trend towards advanced
materials natural products.  Particular emphasis in placed on
research and development activities which will provide the
products being introduced within the next decade.<P>


<B>REASONS FOR DOING STUDY</B><P>

When BCC last looked at this market in 1984, it was a smaller,
less extensive market relying on materials that were
commercially available to other industries.  Products were
developed quickly, and often on a make-shift basis, to answer
clinical needs.  Today, the industry has evolved into one that
has a strong commitment to research and development in order
to design the most effective and efficient products possible.
This has yielded a complex mix of products within all
therapeutic categories with no single biocompatible material
serving all applications.<P>

As a result of this growth and recent scientific discoveries,
many opportunities are emerging within this market, as well as
many uncertainties.  This new study focuses on identifying
these areas.<P>


<B>CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE STUDY AND FOR WHOM</B><P>

This study will supply information on these particular areas:<P>

      Structure of the present and future biocompatible
materials industry<P>

      Market size of the industry at present and through 1995<P>

      Major segments and major materials and their relative
market share<P>

      Major players, their market share and estimates of
their future market presence<P>

      Technological and research advances<P>

      The significance of the regulatory environment and its
impact on this industry<P>

      International developments impacting on potential
end-markets<P>

      Market dynamics<P>

     Corporate strategies<P>


<B>SCOPE AND FORMAT</B><P>

This study encompasses all present and potential biocompatible
materials.  It specifically excludes any materials or products
that may be used in medical applications that do not come into
contact with the human body or body fluids.  Readers
interested in materials used in other medical applications and
products should contact BCC.<P>

The biocompatible materials covered in detail in this report
include polymers, ceramics, metals, composites and natural
materials.  End-market segments under examination include
implants, tissue replacement materials, materials for drug
delivery systems, detoxicants/dialysis/separation/filtration
systems, biosensors, artificial organs and cosmetic and dental
materials.<P>

Specifically excluded from this study are the materials used
as fillers and time release agents in drugs and medical
devices such as syringes and needles.<P>


<B>METHODOLOGY</B><P>

To prepare this report, the BCC analyst utilized primary and
secondary research techniques, including use of BCC's
extensive library of medical and scientific literature.
Numerous interviews were conducted with scientists, market
participants, market observers and regulatory personnel. Once
these data were collected they were analyzed by experienced
BCC personnel to determine specific findings. These findings
and all market forecasts were correlated with industry experts
to confirm their validity.<P>

Since this is a complex, multi-discipline market the task of
forecasting was complicated.  All forecasts made by BCC in
this report are the result of our extensive analysis of this
market.  All of these forecasts represent the consensus
opinion of BCC personnel, industry participants and industry
observers.<P>

<B>RELATED BCC WORK CREDENTIALS</B><P>

The BCC analyst serving as Project Director on this report has
both technical and advanced marketing degrees and extensive
experience in the medical and pharmaceutical industries as
well as in other high technology markets. Among other BCC
studies the analyst has published are reports on bioengineered
protein drugs, genetic engineering, drug packaging, new drug
delivery systems, medical diagnostic equipment and the laser
industry.<P>

<H3><I>INTRODUCTION</I></H3>
</CENTER>

Intravenous therapy is a critical element in the treatment of patients. One out of
eight persons will undergo intravenous therapy of some form this year.<P>

Intravenous infusion has been tried periodically for blood transfusion since the mid-
1600s, with mixed results. Only in the last 50 years, has it become more
commonplace.<P>

Today, infusion therapy is almost routine. In hospitals, 90 percent of surgical patients
and a third of non-surgical inpatients receive some form of intravenous therapy.
Intravenous infusions are used for introducing fluids, nutrition, blood or its products,
and medications to patients.<P>

Infusion product markets consist of two components: therapeutics, and hardware. The
former consists of intravenous solutions and nutritionals, blood products, and
intravenous drugs. The latter consist of vascular access and delivery devices.<P>

There has been major progress on both fronts. On the therapeutic front, new drugs
and therapies have expanded the applications, offering more effective treatment of
certain diseases. Biopharmaceuticals have been a recent entry in this field, and will
continue to have a major impact in the coming years. Newer experimental therapies,
such as those for removing and modifying certain cells very selectively, could
significantly expand the role of infusion therapy.<P>

On the hardware front, electronic infusion pumps, and disposable infusion pumps
have become smarter, offering features such as patient control, and remote
programming. Catheter manufacturers are looking at improving the catheter materials
and catheter design to make them more biocompatible, and to offer better infection
control. In spite of all the progress, infection at present has remained a major
problem.<P>

The question of safety has become the issue of the nineties. This will provide for a
major growth opportunity for equipment makers, and breathe some life into some of
the mature segments of the IV business.  The AIDS epidemic has given added urgency
to design safer hardware. To this end, intravenous sets and catheters, which protect
workers from needlestick injuries, have been amongst the newest innovations. The
cost-containment climate actually helps these more expensive products. Apart from
protecting the workers, they prove cost-effective; diagnostic tests and treatment for
needlestick injuries cost about $200 per injury according to one estimate. Newer
guidelines for worker safety are also pushing the use of the value-added, safer
products.<P>

Alternative site care is another factor that will continue to reshape the infusion
products industry. The cost-containment movement by hospitals was fueled by the
implementation of the prospective payment system (PPS), as mandated by Congress
in the mid-eighties. As a result, home and alternative site infusion businesses have
been booming. Innovative hardware design, and newer and safer drugs have facilitated
this trend. Growth of infusion products for the alternative site market will remain
strong.<P>


<B>PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY</B><P>

This study examines a very important segment of the healthcare market. It analyzes
technology, current status and future trends of infusion products.<P>

In spite of the infusion products business being around for nearly 50 years, it has
continued to evolve. It has seen new therapies, such as nutritional and drug therapies,
added to its menu. Progress in materials, electronics and manufacturing technology
have made today's hardware quite sophisticated.<P>

Today, far from being a settled business, this industry is changing and still evolving.
On the one hand, new drugs and therapies, concerns about worker safety, the trend
towards alternative site therapy, and more value-added hardware are offering growth
opportunities for some of the market sectors. On the other hand, advances in newer,
less invasive drug delivery and targeting methods, threaten to bite into some of the
IV products market.<P>

This study looks at the markets and technologies, and attempts to identify the future
course of this business. Infusion products include IV solutions, hardware, drug and
blood products. Often the latter two are not included as part of the infusion products
business. We have tried to provide a more complete picture of the infusion products
business by including drugs and blood products in our study. We feel that this would
be helpful for those who may want to see the 'big picture.'<P>


<B>TARGETED AUDIENCE</B><P>

This study will be useful to those who are in the infusion industry, or are interested
in the infusion industry. It is intended to provide them with an understanding of the
markets, trends, technologies and overall structure of the industry. Executives of
companies involved with the manufacture or distribution of infusion products or
supplies, including hardware, solutions, drugs, or blood products, will find this a
useful resource. It would be helpful also to prospective entrants in this business,
organizations promoting or serving the infusion business, analysts, venture capitalists,
investors and industry watchers.<P>

<B>SCOPE OF THIS STUDY</B><P>

This study examines the intravenous infusion products used for therapeutic
applications. It includes intravenous solutions, drugs, nutritionals, blood products, and
necessary hardware to administer these products. The focus is clearly on intravenous
and therapeutic products.<P>

We therefore have generally excluded infusion products used for other routes, e.g.
enteral products, peritoneal catheters, non-IV drugs, etc. We have also excluded non-
therapeutic applications, such as some of the diagnostic catheters.<P>

An exception to this general definition of 'infusion' is when we have discussed the
home infusion industry. This industry combines service and products, and the
definition of infusion used in the context of the home infusion industry, by
convention, is broader, and includes enteral nutrition, intramuscular injections, and
certain aerosol inhalation therapies. We have also excluded diagnostic catheters from
our study.<P>

In the hardware sector, we have included needles and catheters, IV sets, pumps and
controllers, and other miscellaneous devices such as filters, valves and fittings.
Additionally we have also included certain critical raw materials and components,
such as tubing, filters and plastic films.<P>

We have provided detailed description and analyses of markets by product types and
by segments where they are used. We have also discussed markets for key raw
materials and components, and the home infusion business. The emphasis throughout
this report is on domestic markets, but we have provided a short chapter that
estimates the international markets.<P>


<B>METHODOLOGY</B><P>

Research for this study consisted of extensive study of published literature, BCC
resources, and interviews with industrial, university and governmental experts.<P>

Published information was searched via databases covering medical, biological,
chemical and business fields. Additionally dozens of books, government reports,
conference proceedings, company annual reports and related marketing reports were
consulted.<P>

Primary data collection was via interviews with industrial manufacturers, end users,
market watchers, and officials of governmental and business associations.<P>

 The information was assimilated and discussed among the BCC staff. The basis and
assumptions behind projected and forecasted markets are clearly defined in this
report.<P>

<B>STUDY GOAL AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>

This new Business Communications Company (BCC) report provides a
detailed analysis of the markets and technology for advanced optical
materials which fulfill a host of different needs in both military and
commercial applications. The study updates and revises BCC report GB-
103A Advanced Optical Materials that was published in 1987. The materials
investigated in this report include:<P>

 Glasses and other Crown glasses, flints, borosilicates,
common optical materials etc.
 Glass ceramics/ceramics (Zerodur, ULE, 9600, spinel,
 ALON, silicon carbide, alumina, etc.)
 Crystalline/polycrystalline (Fused silica, fused quartz, cultured
 materialsquartz, calcite, natural quartz,
sapphire, germanium, silicon
 Alkaline FluoridesMagnesium fluoride, calcium
 fluoride barium fluoride, lithium
fluoride
 Metal Halides, Potassium chloride, sodium chloride,
potassium bromide<P>

The principal objectives of this study are to:<P>

 Characterize the current and potential markets for these materials
through 1995 in light of existing and new materials, technology, and
applications<P>

 Evaluate the effects of proposed and actual military budget cuts on
the advanced optics industry<P>
 
 Discuss new defense- and nondefense-related applications for
advanced optical materials<P>

 Characterize the major end-use markets for these materials<P>

 Define and quantify the current and potential applications for these
materials<P>

 Identify and characterize the major players<P>

 Discuss the major economic and geopolitical factors impacting the
industry.<P>

<B>REASONS FOR DOING THE STUDY</B><P>

A great deal has happened over the last three years since the first advanced
optical materials study was published by BCC. There have been major
changes in global politics with the opening up of Eastern Europe, the
marked changes in the Soviet Union, and the potential for increased threats
from the Middle East. The industry has reeled under the threat of major
cutbacks in defense spending, and defense-related programs already have
been stretched out, delayed, or cut. At the same time, the U.S. economy
appears to be sliding ever so slowly into a recession. It would appear that
difficult times await the advanced optics industry. BCC, which actively
follows the advanced optics industry, as well as related industries
including electro-optics, sensors, fiber optics, and microelectronics, found
that the oft-quoted dismal predictions for the industry are not likely to be as
terrible as feared. BCC recently completed a major study investigating
nonlinear optical materials (BCC report GB-117), and found significant
margin for growth in a number of different defense-related and
nondefense-related areas. In addition, two recently completed major
studies on the aerospace industry (BCC reports GB-122 and GB-124)
projected growth in related industries that utilize substantial amounts of
advanced optics. These studies, along with many inquiries from executives
in the advanced optics industry, suggested to us that a new advanced
optical materials study should be initiated to go back and look at the crucial
issues affecting the industry and re-evaluate the markets for advanced
optical materials during this transitional and unsettled period.<P>

<B>CONTRIBUTION OF THE STUDY</B><P>

This BCC report provides a thorough analysis of the advanced optical
materials industry as it pertains to both defense and commercial
applications. Specifically, this study:<P>

 Analyzes and quantifies specific applications in military/aerospace
for reconnaissance, guidance and control, identification, designation, fire control, etc.<P>

 Analyzes and quantifies specific applications for nonmilitary
applications in industry for vision, various sensors, materials
processing, thermal measurement and control, etc.<P>

Analyzes and quantifies specific medical and other commercial
applications<P>

 Provides U.S. and worldwide market projections for advanced
optical materials through 1995<P>

 Evaluates the materials and markets<P>

 Discusses companies and organizations involved in materials
production, research, and manufacturing<P>

 Discusses foreign materials competitors, end users, and markets.<P>

<B>METHODOLOGY AND INFORMATION SOURCES</B><P>

The information presented in this study was derived from over 150
interviews with knowledgeable industry, government, and academic
sources, including materials producers, fabricators, end users, and
research scientists and engineers in all of the areas covered. Due to the
increasing worldwide nature and importance of these special advanced
materials, foreign sources were contacted, in addition to domestic sources,
and worldwide information and specific market data, where available,
were included in this study. In addition, a thorough search of the technical,
trade, scientific, and governmental literature was conducted.<P>

BCC's extensive in-house resources were consulted and utilized where
appropriate, and portions of several recently published major BCC market
research studies  were included in the evaluations. This study was
conducted over a four-month period ending in August 1990. Information
and data are current to the end of August 1990. Dollar market projections
are given in constant 1990 dollars unless otherwise indicated. A list of
acronyms appears in Appendix A.<P>

<B>STUDY OBJECTIVES</B><P>

This new Business Communications Co. (BCC) report provides a
technical and economic market analysis of the fiber optic sensor
industry.<P>

The principal objectives of this study are to:<P>

<LI>Investigate and discuss fiber optic sensor technologies, and
  applications<P>

<LI>Characterize and quantify the current and future U.S. and
  worldwide markets for fiber optic sensors, including:<P>
<UL>       - intrinsic and<BR>
       - extrinsic sensors</UL><P>

<LI>Identify and characterize the principal industry participants<P>

<LI>Provide an overview and characterize the end-use markets for
  fiber optic sensors, including:<P>

This study provides a substantive overview of the overall sensor
industry in order to compare conventional sensors with fiber optic
sensors.<P>



<b>REASONS FOR CONDUCTING STUDY</B><P>

Business Communications Company initiated this study of the fiber
optic sensor industry in response to inquiries regarding this
market. This new study provides a thorough analysis of the
U.S./North American market, and provides a market analysis and
market projections worldwide. In addition, this report is a natural
follow-on for a number of other optics, electro-optics, and fiber
optics reports that have been published by BCC over the last few
years.<P>

The study also is timely because of the many changes occurring in
the fiber optics end-use industries, particularly in the
military/aerospace industries, and other industrial and commercial
industries. There is considerable potential for fiber optic
sensors, but the industry is fraught with problems that must be
understood in order to plan successful strategy for this industry.<P>


<b>CONTRIBUTION OF THIS STUDY</B><P>

This study comes at a critical time in the development of new fiber
optic sensors and new fiber and sensor applications that will
demand unique types of sensing environments. This timely BCC study
seeks to answer these questions, and to provide a cogent discussion
covering the reasons for its conclusions.<P>

Foreign companies, fiber optic sensors, and technologies are
discussed, and a worldwide market analysis is included for fiber
optic sensors.<P>

The report provides a thorough analysis of the current and
potential markets for fiber optic sensors--specifically, it:<P>

<UL> -    provides an assessment of relevant technologies<P>
  -    provides market projections for 1990, 1993, and 1998<P>
  -    characterizes existing and potential applications<P>
  -    discusses the major driving forces behind the development of
       the industry<P>
  -    identifies niches of specific promise<P>
  -    provides a thorough and representative list of companies and
       organizations involved in the test equipment industry and
       major end-users<P>
  -     provides brief company profiles<P></UL>


<b>METHODOLOGY AND INFORMATION SOURCES</B><P>

The information presented in this study was derived, in part, from
over 50 interviews with knowledgeable industry and government
sources. Due to the increasing worldwide nature and importance of
the industry, in addition to domestic sources, foreign sources were
contacted and worldwide information and specific market data are
included in this report. In addition, a thorough search of the
technical, trade, and government literature was conducted.<P>

Extensive BCC in-house resources were consulted and utilized where
appropriate. This study was conducted over a two and one half-month
period ending in January, 1994. Dollar market projections are given
in constant 1993 dollars unless otherwise noted.<P>

<B>STUDY GOAL AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>

This new Business Communications Company (BCC) report provides a
detailed analysis of the markets and technology for optical thin-film
deposition materials, equipment, and services (merchant and captive). The
report covers both defense- and nondefense-related applications. This study
updates and completely revises an earlier BCC report GB-100--Thin Films
for Microelectronics and Advanced Optical Applications. However, because
of the extraordinary interest in optical thin films, the current report is
devoted exclusively to optical thin films. Microelectronic thin films are not
treated in the current study.<P>

The major topics covered in this BCC report include:<P>

<MENU> Materials used for optical thin-film deposition, including:
common compounds, precious metals, diamond, and others<P>

       Equipment used for optical thin-film deposition<P>

       Thin-film deposition technology<P>

       Special processes, such as various types of energy-assisted
deposition, diamond production processes, and sol-gel processes<P>

In-depth analysis of the markets, applications, and technologies<P>

       Worldwide market projections through the year 2000 (merchant
 and captive)<P>

       Discussion and listing of companies, government agencies and
laboratories, universities, and their foreign counterparts<P>

       Geopolitical analysis of events relevant to the industry<P>

       Recent patents and analysis</MENU><P>

The principal objectives of this study are to:<P>

<LI>       Characterize the current and potential markets for optical thin-
film deposition materials, equipment, and services through 2000<P>

<LI>       Evaluate the effects of proposed and actual military budget cuts on
the industry<P>

<LI>      Characterize and discuss new defense- and nondefense-related
applications for optical thin-films<P>

<LI>       Characterize the major end-use markets for optical thin films<P>

<LI>       Define and quantify current and potential applications for optical
thin films<P>

<LI>      Identify and characterize the principal industry participants<P>

<LI>       Analyze and discuss the major economic and geopolitical factors
impacting the industry.<P>

<B>REASONS FOR DOING THE STUDY</B><P>

A great deal has happened since the first optical thin-films study was
published by BCC, Inc. in May 1987. The stock market crashed later that
year. The Soviet Union began releasing its Warsaw Pact Satellites--
culminating in the fall of the Berlin Wall. The U.S. economy steadily slid
into a recession. The Savings & Loan industry failed, the banking industry
is heading in the same direction, real estate values have tumbled from their
inflated values of the mid-1980s, and unemployment is up and rising, all of
which have shaken the consumer's confidence. <P>

The astoundingly huge
bailout of the S&Ls will place a long-term economic burden on the United
States for decades, not to mention the rising national debt. Iraq invaded
Kuwait, and now the U.S. and a good deal of the West have participated in
the Gulf War. And to top it all off, now the Soviet Union and its tanks are
rolling backwards toward its old dictatorial ways--freedom for Latvia and
Lithuania is being crushed, and it is yet to be determined who is next.<P>

The optics industry has reeled under the threat of major cutbacks in
defense spending, and defense-related programs already have been
stretched out, delayed, or cut. It would appear that difficult times await the advanced optics industry, and thereby, the optical thin-film deposition industry. BCC, which actively and carefully follows the advanced optics industry, as well as related industries including electro-optics, sensors, fiber optics, microelectronics, and other high-performance materials found that the oft quoted dismal predictions for the industry are not likely to be as terrible as suggested.<P>

BCC recently completed several major studies covering different aspects of the optics industry. Two major studies, one investigating the advanced optical materials industry (BCC report No. GB-103R) and another investigating nonlinear optical materials (BCC report No. GB-117), found significant margin for growth in a number of different defense-related and nondefense-related areas. In addition, during the course of producing BCC's monthly newsletter, Optical Materials & Engineering News (OMEN), it has become apparent that there is tremendous interest and ongoing work in the field of optical thin films.<P>

These studies and OMEN, along with many inquiries from executives in
the advanced optics industry, suggested to us that a new optical thin-film deposition study should be initiated to go back and look at the crucial issues affecting the industry and re-evaluate the markets for optical thin films during this transitional and unsettling period.<P>

<B>CONTRIBUTION OF THE STUDY</B><P>

This BCC study fills an essential gap in the industry. It is the only "on the
shelf," openly available report that provides an in-depth technical/economic
analysis of the optical thin-film deposition industry.<P>

This BCC report provides a thorough analysis of the optical thin-film
deposition industry as it pertains to both defense, nondefense government,
and commercial applications. Specifically, this study:<P>

<LI>       Analyzes and quantifies specific applications in military/
aerospace for reconnaissance, guidance and control,
identification, target designation, navigation, etc.<P>

<LI>       Analyzes and quantifies specific applications for nonmilitary
government applications, such as those for The Mission To Planet
Earth and its component Earth Observation System (EOS)<P>

 <LI>      Analyzes and quantifies specific applications for nonmilitary
applications in industry for vision, various sensors, materials
processing, thermal measurement and control, etc.<P>

<LI>       Analyzes and quantifies specific medical and other commercial
applications<P>

<LI>       Provides U.S. and worldwide market projections through the year
2000 for both merchant and captive market segments<P>

<LI>       Evaluates the technology, applications, and markets<P>

<LI>       Discusses companies and organizations involved in materials
production, research, manufacturing, equipment production, and
service providers (merchant and captive)<P>

<LI>       Discusses foreign competitors, end users, and markets<P>

<LI>       Analyzes and discusses relevant geopolitical issues<P>

<B>METHODOLOGY AND INFORMATION SOURCES</B><P>

The information presented in this study was derived from over 150
interviews with knowledgeable industry, government, and academic
sources, including materials producers, equipment manufacturers,
service providers, end users, research scientists, and engineers in all of the
areas covered. Due to the increasing worldwide nature and importance of
this special field, in addition to domestic sources, foreign sources were
contacted and worldwide information and specific market data, where
available, were included in this study. In addition, a thorough search of the
technical, trade, scientific, patent, and governmental literature was
conducted.<P>

BCC's extensive in-house resources were consulted and utilized where
appropriate, and portions of several recently published major BCC market
research studies  were included in the evaluations. This study was
conducted over a three-month period ending in March 1991. Information
and data are current to the first of March 1991. Dollar market projections
are given in constant 1990 dollars unless otherwise indicated.<P>

<B>REASONS FOR DOING THE STUDY</B><P>

The optics/electro-optics industry has reeled under the threat of
major cutbacks in defense spending, and defense-related programs
which already have been stretched out, delayed, or cut. It would
appear that difficult times await the advanced optics/electro-optics
industry. BCC, which actively and carefully follows the advanced
optics/electro-optics industry, as well as related industries, has
found that the oft-quoted dismal predictions for the industry are not
likely to be as terrible as suggested.<P>

BCC recently completed several
major studies covering different aspects of the optics industry.
Three major studies, one investigating the advanced optical materials
industry (BCC report no. GB-103R), another investigating nonlinear
optical materials (BCC report no. GB-117), and the third, covering
the optical thin-film industry (BCC report no. GB-141), found
significant margin for growth in a number of different
defense-related and nondefense-related areas. In addition, in editing
BCC's monthly industry newsletter, Optical Materials & Engineering
News (OMEN), it has become apparent to this writer that there is
tremendous interest and ongoing work in optics/electro-optics and
technology transfer. These studies and OMEN, along with many
inquiries from executives in the advanced optics/electro-optics
industry, suggested to us that a new study should be initiated during
this transitional and unsettling period to investigate the crucial
issues affecting the industry; re-evaluate the markets for lasers,
detectors/sensors, components, and materials; and develop estimates
of the market potential for technology transfer in these fields.<P>

<B>CONTRIBUTION OF THE STUDY</B><P>

This BCC study fills an essential gap in the industry. It is the only
"on the shelf," openly available report that provides an in-depth
technical/economic analysis of the optics/electro-optics industry in
terms of individual component technologies, application markets, and
the potential for technology transfer.<P>

This BCC report provides a thorough analysis of the
optics/electro-optics industry as it pertains to technology transfer
in defense, nondefense government, and commercial applications.
Specifically, this study:<P>

<MENU>-    provides estimated market potential for technology transfer in the areas indicated above through 2001.<P>

-    provides U.S. and worldwide market projections through the year
2001 for optics/electro-optics technologies and commercial end-use
applications.<P>

government applications, such as those for The Mission To Planet
Earth and its component Earth Observation System (EOS)<P>

-    analyzes and quantifies specific commercial applications, such
as remote sensing, medical, instrumentation, vision, various sensors,
materials processing, thermal measurement, process control, etc.<P>

-    evaluates the technology, applications, and markets.<P>

-    discusses and lists government agencies, companies,
organizations, universities, and research consortia involved in
technology transfer activities.<P>

<B>METHODOLOGY AND INFORMATION SOURCES</B><P>

The information presented in this study was derived from over 175
interviews with knowledgeable industry, government, and academic
sources, including technology-transfer officers in government,
industry, and academia; researchers and executives in the laser
industry, detector/sensors industry, components industry, and
materials industry. Interviews of representatives of all of the major
optics/electro-optics-related consortia also were conducted. Due to
the increasingly worldwide nature and importance of the industry, in
addition to domestic sources, foreign sources were contacted and
worldwide information and specific market data, where available, were
included in this study. In all, approximately 220 companies and
organizations were surveyed. In addition, a thorough search of the
technical, trade, scientific, patent, and governmental literature was
conducted.<P>

BCC's extensive in-house resources were consulted and utilized where
appropriate, and portions of several recently published major BCC
market research studies were included in the evaluations. This study
was conducted over a 3.5-month period ending in August 1991.
Information and data are current to the first of August 1991. Dollar
market projections are given in constant 1991 dollars unless
otherwise indicated.<P>

<B>STUDY GOAL AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>

This new Business Communications Company (BCC) report provides a
detailed analysis of the potential for optically active organic
materials. As defined in this report, they include:<P>

<MENU>Organic Polymers<BR>
 Metallorganic Optical Materials<BR>
 Biomolecular Optical Materials</MENU><P>

These materials may be used for various nonlinear optical and
electro-optical applications, principally in:

<MENU>communications<BR>
 information processing<BR>
 memory/storage<BR>
 imaging<BR>
 optical limiting, and<BR>
 new applications, many of which, are yet to be created.</MENU><P>

The principal objectives of this study are to:<P>

<MENU><LI>     Investigate and discuss the relevant technologies and
applications<P>

<LI> Characterize and quantify the current and potential markets
for optically active organic materials and devices<P>

<LI> Characterize and quantify the current and potential end-use
markets for the major optics/electro-optics applications for

worldwide<P>

<LI>  Identify and characterize the principal government
participants, worldwide<P>

<LI> Identify and characterize the principal university
participants, worldwide.</MENU><P>

<B>REASONS FOR DOING THE STUDY</B><P>

BCC recently completed several major studies covering different
aspects of the optics industry. Three major studies, one
investigating the advanced optical materials industry (BCC report
no. GB-103R), another nonlinear optical materials (BCC report no.
GB-117), and the third, covering the optical thin-film industry
(BCC report no. GB-141), found significant margin for growth in a
number of different commercial areas and defense-related areas. In
addition, during the course of editing BCC's monthly industry
newsletter, Optical Materials & Engineering News (OMEN), it has
become apparent that there is tremendous interest and ongoing work
in optics/electro-optics, particularly with respect to nonlinear
optical processes. These studies and OMEN, along with many
inquiries from executives in the advanced optics/electro-optics
industry, suggested to us that a new study should be initiated to
ascertain the current state of the art, and the market potential
for optically active organic materials.<P>

<B>CONTRIBUTION OF THE STUDY</B><P>

This BCC study fills an essential gap in the industry. It is the
only "on the shelf," openly available report that provides an
in-depth technical/economic analysis of optically active organic
materials in terms of individual component technologies,
applications, markets, and potential.<P>

This BCC report provides a thorough analysis of the potential for
optically active organics, including polymers, organometallics, and
biomolecular materials. Specifically, this study:<P>

<MENU><LI> provides an assessment of the relevant technologies<P>

<LI> provides worldwide projections through the year 2001 for the
major end-use markets which could utilize these materials and
devices<P>

organics<P>

<LI>  provides lists of companies, government laboratories, and
universities involved in optically active organic materials/devices
research and development<P>

<LI> provides summaries of interviews with companies, government
agencies, universities, and research consortia<P>

<LI>  provides summaries of company, government laboratory, and
university research and development activities<P>

<LI>  provides a patent search and analysis, current through August
1991.</MENU><P>

<B>METHODOLOGY AND INFORMATION SOURCES</B><P>

The information presented in this study was derived, in part, from
over 75 interviews with knowledgeable industry, government, and
academic sources. Due to the increasing worldwide nature and
importance of the industry, in addition to domestic sources,
foreign sources were contacted and worldwide information and
specific market data, where available, were included in this study.
In all, over 100 companies and organizations were surveyed. In
addition, a thorough search of the technical, trade, scientific,
patent, and governmental literature was conducted.<P>

Extensive BCC in-house resources were consulted and utilized where
appropriate, and portions of several recently published major BCC
market research studies were included in the evaluations. This
study was conducted over a 1.5-month period ending in October 1991.
Dollar market projections are given in constant 1991 dollars unless
otherwise indicated.<P>

<B>STUDY OBJECTIVES</B><P>

This new Business Communications Co. (BCC) report provides one
of first views into the new Intelligent Vehicle Highway System
(IVHS) from a marketing, economic, and technical approach.<P>

The principal objectives of this study are to:<P>

<UL>   <LI>  Investigate and discuss the relevant technologies and
          applications<P>

    <LI>  Characterize and quantify the current, near-term, and
          mid-term technologies, applications, and markets for IVHS
          components<P>

   <LI>  Identify and discuss the pertinent institutional and
          legal issues<P>

  <LI> Identify and characterize the principal industry
          participants<P>

   <LI> Identify and characterize the principal government
          participants<P>

   <LI> Identify and characterize the principal university
          participants.</UL><P>

In addition, this study sought to distinguish between the
technologies and systems which are likely to be incorporated into
IVHS, and those which are more fantasy than reality.<P>

<B>REASONS FOR CONDUCTING STUDY</B><P>

Although there are several government-sponsored studies available
covering IVHS, there have been no multi-client technical/economic
market analyses of this important and potentially enormous new
industry. IVHS promises to be one of the largest and broadly based
new industries of the 21st century--and it appears to be getting
off to a roaring start in the '90s. It is important to have an
unbiased and thorough analysis of this new industry in order to
make investment decisions, the consequences of which will carry
through well into the first two decades of the next century. IVHS
has the potential for developing into a multi-billion dollar
industry over the next five years, and certainly over the next ten
years. The U.S. government is providing enormous sums of money for
the development of IVHS technologies, and it seems very likely that
it will continue  to do so. IVHS may very well be the "bail-out" of
the defense industry, now that the Cold War has ended.<P>

Thus, IVHS is a budding and burgeoning industry that cannot be
ignored. Business Communications Co. is the first market
research firm to provide an independent analysis of the
technologies, applications, markets, and potential.<P>

<B>CONTRIBUTION OF THIS STUDY</B><P>

This study comes at a critical time in the development of IVHS.
Companies and governments are seeking realistic evaluations of the
potential for IVHS technologies and applications. Is IVHS real or
a boondoggle? Or, how much and what parts of IVHS are feasible and
viable in the near term and mid term; are the long-term features of
IVHS doable? This timely BCC study seeks to answer these questions,
and provide a cogent discussion covering the reasons for its
conclusions. The study also provides convincing rationale for
continuing government support of these programs regardless of which
administration is in power.<P>

Foreign companies and programs are discussed and compared to U.S.
programs. Competition between foreign and U.S. IVHS industries is
also discussed in detail.<P>

The report provides a thorough analysis of the current and
potential markets for IVHS technologies and component systems.
Specifically, it:<P>

<UL>     <LI>  provides an assessment of relevant technologies<P>
     <LI>  provides market projections from 1992 through 2002<P>
     <LI>  characterizes potential applications<P>
     <LI>  discusses the major driving forces behind the development
          of the industry<P>
     <LI>  identifies niches of specific promise<P>
     <LI>  discusses the thorny institutional and legal issues<P>
     <LI>  provides a thorough and representative list of companies
          and organizations involved in IVHS<P>
     <LI>  provides brief company profiles.</UL><P>

<B>METHODOLOGY AND INFORMATION SOURCES</B><P>

The information presented in this study was derived, in part, from
over 75 interviews with knowledgeable industry and government
sources. Due to the increasing worldwide nature and importance of
the industry, in addition to domestic sources, foreign sources were
contacted and worldwide information and specific market data, where
available, are included in this report. In all, over 150 companies
and organizations were surveyed. In addition, a thorough search of
the technical, trade, and government literature was conducted.<P>

Extensive BCC in-house resources were consulted and utilized where
appropriate. This study was conducted over a three-month period
ending in October 1992. Dollar market projections are given in
constant 1992 dollars unless otherwise noted.<P>

<H3><I>INTRODUCTION</I></H3>
</CENTER>

<B>STUDY GOAL AND OBJECTIVES</B>

<P>This study analyzes the market for laser materials and
components in the United States and abroad.  The study's
primary goal is to give readers a clear understanding of where
this market currently stands and where it is heading. 
Detailed market forecasts are presented and important economic
trends are analyzed to give readers a broad knowledge of the
laser materials and components area.  The basic technology
involved in each of the products is also explained in order to
give readers a complete understanding of this complex and
rapidly changing market.  <P>


<B>REASONS FOR THE STUDY</B>

<P>While the market for laser systems has been extensively
analyzed in many market research reports, the materials and
components that comprise or are associated with lasers have
not been covered in great detail.  The market for laser
materials and components is highly stratified and competitive
and requires extensive analysis to fully understand.  

<P>The laser materials and components industry is undergoing
significant change.  Many of the markets that have
traditionally purchased these materials and components are
stagnant or declining, while other industries that have rarely
used components are showing increasing interest in employing
them.

<P>These changes are creating a market that is in flux for both
materials and component manufacturers and end users.  This
study attempts to identify the major industry movements and
trends and to serve as a guide for suppliers, manufacturers,
and users of this technology.<P>  


<B>CONTRIBUTION OF THE STUDY</B>

<P>Different sectors of the laser materials and components
industry will find this report beneficial in different ways. 
Manufacturers and suppliers of laser materials and components
will be able to identify those areas of the industry that are
in decline and those areas likely to experience strong growth. 
They will also be able to take advantage of new opportunities
identified in the report and alter their development and
marketing strategies accordingly.

<P>End users will be able to use the report to identify important
technological trends in instrumentation that will help them
use lasers more efficiently.  Other individuals will also find
this report valuable.  Technology specialists and venture
capitalists will gain an overview of this industry and will be
able to make informed decisions about where to direct
investments or development funding.  Engineers and researchers
will learn about important economic and technical trends
impacting their area of expertise.<P>


<B>SCOPE AND FORMAT</B>

<P>This report primarily focuses on the U.S. market for laser
materials and components.  However, Chapter 9 also provides an
overview of the international market.  The report is limited
to major classes of materials, components, instruments, and
equipment associated with lasers.  Coverage of smaller, highly
specialized areas has not been attempted.

<P>Most of this report is directed toward identifying and
analyzing market data and trends.  Chapters 4 through 8
analyze each major market segment in turn and form the heart
of the report.  Each of these chapters is organized as
follows:
<P>

<B>OVERVIEW</B>

<P>A brief summary of each market segment is presented first in
order to quickly orient the reader and facilitate quick
analysis.

<P>Products and Applications
<P>
The technology underlying each product is explained as are
major applications.<P>


<B>MARKET FORECASTS</B>

<P>Sales forecasts are presented for each product for the years
1995 to 2000, with an average annual growth rate calculated
for that period.  In addition, sales forecasts and average
annual growth rates are presented for each major application
area for the years 1995 to 2000. <P>


<B>MARKET SHARES</B>

<P>Market share estimates for each product category are estimated
for the year 1995.  Company background and product lines are
briefly discussed and analyzed.
Following Chapter 8 is an overview of the world market for
laser materials and components.  Chapter 10 comprises profiles
of 25 of the most important companies in the industry. 
Appendix A gives a complete listing of company names,
addresses, and phone numbers for each major company in the
industry.<P>


<B>METHODOLOGY</B>

<P>A careful methodology was followed to generate all the
forecasts contained in this report.  The methodology employed
both secondary sources of information and primary interviews
with a variety of industry participants to arrive at market
forecasts.

<P>First, sales figures for all material and component
manufacturers within each product category were gathered. 
When sales data was unavailable from published sources,
company managers and industry experts were consulted to arrive
at an accurate sales figure for each company.  For
manufacturers that produce components for more than one
product category, industry experts and company executives were
consulted to arrive at an estimate of what share of a
company's revenues should be assigned to each product.

<P>When sales figures were complete, they were added together to
estimate current market size for each product.  These data
were also used to estimate current market shares for all
companies.  The figures for current market size for each
product were reviewed by industry experts to ensure accuracy.

<P>Sales forecasts for each product were generated by analyzing
the growth of underlying industries that constitute demand for
each product.  First, the revenues generated by each end user
sector for each product were estimated based on published
sources or interviews with company marketing managers.  Then,
published data from numerous sources were used to forecast
growth in each end user sector through 2000.  This initial
estimate was adjusted up or down based on specific trends in
each application area and interviews with a variety of
industry sources.  

<P>A similar methodology was used to construct all the forecasts
and tables in the report.  Therefore, a separate methodology
explanation is not included in each chapter.

<P>A variety of information sources was used to compile this
study.  Some of the main sources include:

<UL><LI>    Detailed personal interviews with industry experts,
     including consultants, marketing managers,
       researchers, and executives of leading laser materials
       and components companies.  These interviews were used

<B>STUDY GOAL AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>

This study analyzes the market for optical coatings in the United States and abroad.  The 
study's primary goal is to give readers a clear understanding of where this market currently 
stands and where it is heading.  Detailed market forecasts are presented and important 
economic trends are analyzed to give readers a broad knowledge of the optical coatings 
area.  The basic technology involved in each of the product and service sectors is also 
explained in order to give readers a complete understanding of this complex and rapidly 
changing market.<P>  


<B>REASONS FOR THE STUDY</B><P>

The market for optical coatings and services has not been thoroughly analyzed for several 
years.  The market for optical coatings is highly stratified and competitive and requires 
extensive analysis to fully understand.<P>  

For the last several years, the optical coating industry has undergone significant change.  
New technological developments have made a variety of new coatings materials and 
deposition processes widely available for the first time.  The array of coatings and methods 
of depositing those coatings that are now available can be overwhelming, even to 
experienced industry professionals.  In the economic sphere, many coatings companies have 
had to wean themselves  away from a reliance on military applications and instead focus on 
fast changing and competitive commercial applications.<P>


These changes are creating a market that is in flux for both optical coatings manufacturers 
and service companies, as well as end users.  This study attempts to identify the major 
industry movements and trends and to serve as a guide for suppliers, manufacturers, and 
users of this technology.<P>  


<B>CONTRIBUTION OF THE STUDY</B><P>

Different sectors of the optical coatings industry will find this report beneficial in different 
ways.  Manufacturers and suppliers of optical coating materials and products will be able to 
identify those areas of the industry that are in decline and those areas likely to experience 
strong growth.  Likewise, optical coating service companies and deposition equipment 
vendors will  be able to take advantage of new opportunities identified in the report and alter 
their development and marketing strategies accordingly.<P>

End users will be able to use the report to identify important technological trends in coatings 
and deposition that will help them use optical coatings more efficiently.  Other individuals 
will also find this report valuable.  Technology specialists and venture capitalists will gain an 
overview of this industry and will be able to make informed decisions about where to direct 
investments or development funding.  Engineers and researchers will learn about important 
economic and technical trends impacting their area of expertise.<P>


<B>SCOPE AND FORMAT</B><P>

<B>METHODOLOGY</B><P>

A careful methodology was followed to generate all the forecasts contained in this report.  
The methodology employed both secondary sources of information and primary interviews 
with a variety of industry participants to arrive at market forecasts.<P>

First, sales figures for all major companies within each product category were gathered.  
When sales data was unavailable from published sources, company managers and industry 
experts were consulted to arrive at an accurate sales figure for each company.  For 
manufacturers that produce components for more than one product category, industry 
experts and company executives were consulted to arrive at an estimate of what share of a 
company's revenues should be assigned to each product.<P>

When sales figures were complete, they were added together to estimate current market 
size for each product.  This data was also used to estimate current market shares for all 
companies.  The figures for current market size for each product were reviewed by industry 
experts to ensure accuracy.<P>

Sales forecasts for each product were generated by analyzing the growth of underlying 
industries that constitute demand for each product.  First, the revenues generated by each 
end user sector for each product were estimated based on published sources or interviews 
with company marketing managers.  Then, published data from numerous sources was used 
to forecast growth in each end user sector through 2001.  This initial estimate was adjusted 
up or down based on specific trends in each application area and interviews with a variety 
of industry sources.<P>  

A similar methodology was used to construct all the forecasts and tables in the report.  
Therefore, a separate methodology explanation is not included in each chapter.<P>

<B>GOAL AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>

This comprehensive study deals with all aspects of
modified/controlled atmosphere and vacuum packaging, and
includes elaborate treatment of processes, atmospheres used,
materials and types of containers used, as well as a description
of the types of products which can benefit from this form of
packaging.  1990-1995 consumption figures are used throughout
this report.<P>

This study is important because modified/controlled atmosphere
packaging is finally becoming an important factor in the overall
food packaging market and by 1995 should be the fastest growing
facet of this market.  This prognosis is based on the rapid
growth of material and process technologies, past Western
European experience and the great economic benefits of
MA/CA/vacuum packaging for foods such as meats, poultry,
produce, fruit and pasta.<P>


SCOPE AND FORMAT</B><P>

This is an in-depth study and a quantified description of
different aspects of MA/CA/vacuum packaging.  The study deals
with the advantages and disadvantages of different types of
packaging atmospheres and materials, applications, suppliers and
consumption figures for materials, containers and equipment.
End-use markets which benefit from MA/CA/vacuum packaging are
described and quantified.<P>


<B>METHODOLOGY</B><P>

This report consists of four principal sections:

<MENU>     1. Overview<BR>
           2. Basic Systems - Technology<BR>
           3. Materials<BR>
           4. Markets</MENU><P>

In the Overview, the scope and major components of MA/CA/vacuum
packaging systems are described.  Terms related to gas packaging
are defined and the market structure for major system components
is delineated.  Products packaged in specific atmospheres as
well as gas selection criteria are listed. Overall consumption
of materials, gas blends and types of containers is quantified.
Packaging by the type of system (CAP, MAP, vacuum) is also
tabulated.  This section concludes with a discussion of
international dimensions of the gas packaging market.<P>

Basic Systems - Technology section deals in detail with
different atmospheres and the function of individual gases and
gas blends.  It also elaborates on the supplier market.  Gas
generation methods and gas consumption figures for bulk and
retail forms of packaging are provided.  The role and
performance of oxygen and carbon dioxide absorbers as well as
gas emitters and their suppliers are elaborated.<P>

Microbiological problems and safety concerns as pertaining to
MA/CA/vacuum packaging and refrigerated distribution are
described and related to specific products.<P>

Equipment used in MA/CA/vacuum packaging is described. Equipment
suppliers are listed and their products analyzed.  A brief
description of the sealing methods is provided because of the
crucial importance of sealing to the proper functioning of
MA/CA/vacuum packaging systems.<P>

Finally, the three basic modes of gas packaging are defined and
described, including the sous vide process which is a special
case of vacuum packaging.<P>

The section on Materials deals with basic forms of packaging
used for MA/CA/vacuum packaging -- films and trays -- as well as
with the different types of plastics and non-plastic materials
used.  Different types of mono-, multilayer and barrier films,
resins used and the types of containers made from films are
elaborated.  Trays, tray materials and complex systems using
trays and films are also described. In each case, the principal
suppliers and consumption figures for materials and types of
containers are tabulated.  The new smart films for breathable
products are discussed.<P>

The last section of the study deals with the end-use Markets
such as meats and poultry, fish, produce and fruits, pasta and
baked products, and miscellaneous products including non-foods.
Specific examples of packaging for individual products are
provided as well as consumption figures by units, volume of
packaging materials used, types of containers, types of systems
and materials used.<P>


<B>CONTRIBUTION AND TARGET AUDIENCE</B><P>

This study is designed for manufacturers of packaging materials,
especially films and trays, gas atmospheres and packaging
equipment, as well as companies which sell basic packaging
systems or specialize in gas packaging.  It will also be of
great help to industry analysts and investment firms that
specialize in packaging and distribution of food products and
oxygen and moisture-sensitive non-food products.<P>

<B>STUDY GOAL AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>

In a dynamic industry, this report analyzes and quantifies how
suppliers of  packaging materials  and preformed packages used
by processors  of prepared convenience foods are responding to
processors' changing  needs, interests,  and  preferences,  as
processors, in  turn, respond to shifting consumer demands for
packaging. The  prepared  foods  of  interest  include  quick-
cooking frozen,  chilled/refrigerated, shelf-stable foods in a
variety of packages that require different cooking methods, as
well as  these three  food types  marketed  in  microwave-only
packages. The  packaging materials  of  concern  are  plastic,
paperboard, glass, steel, and aluminum cans.<P>

Today's consumers  demand that  packages satisfy both personal
needs, shaped  by demographics and social trends, and those of
the product, as well as be consistent with prevailing societal
attitudes and  goals. Packages should have convenient features
that make food preparation and serving easier, yet respect the
environment by  having fewer  materials  added  to  the  waste
stream.   They should  be recyclable  or reusable.  Along with
these  demands   are  the  usual  expectations  that  packages
preserve food  quality and  resist  any  elements  that  could
affect food safety.<P>

Changes in packages have been made possible by improvements in
food processing,  package materials,  and configurations.  New
food processing methods have produced the need for packages to
become more heat-resistant, extend shelflife with little or no
chemical preservatives, and improve the quality of foods.<P>

Improvements in  package materials  have enabled  suppliers to
develop  packages   that  are  microwaveable,  cook-in/eat-in,
stronger,  lighter,   simpler  and  safer  to  use,  and  more
environmentally friendly.    Moreover,  material  improvements
have alleviated  some problems  created by  the use of certain
materials, such  as off-flavors,  off-aromas, and migration of
chemicals, as well as deficits of microwave oven cooking.<P>

Improvements in  package configurations  allow the development
of   convenience features, such as lids that are easy to open,
close, reclose,  and reseal, single-serve packages for portion
control, and  light-weight packages  for easy  portability for
consumption outside the home.<P>

The prepared  food packaging  industry is composed of material
suppliers and  package converters  of preformed  packages. For
some packages,  food  processors  can  choose  between  buying
preformed packages  or buying  the materials  and forming  the
package on-site at the food plant.<P>

This industry  is a highly fragmented segment of the packaging
industry, and  is very  competitive with  many companies vying
for their material or configuration to be the favored, generic
choice of  the majority  of food  processors.  Most  companies
confine themselves to supplying just one type of material that
can be used for one or more food types.<P>

As package materials wax and wane in popularity, some industry
leaders who  find their  material losing  favor have  begun to
move into  other, more  promising materials.    A metals maker
may  acquire   a  plastic   container  manufacturing  company.
Sometimes, material  suppliers will  try to  improve  a  given
material so  that it  matches the desired characteristics of a
competing material or at least addresses some of its deficits.
An example  of this  would be  an aluminum can maker trying to
make cans stronger and more durable like steel cans.<P>

In this  report, BCC has defined prepared convenience foods as
those foods  which are referred to as second-generation foods,
either because  of preparation, packaging, or a combination of
both. The  foods are fully prepared by a food processor before
packaging, distribution,  and sales,  and are ready-to-heat or
ready-to-eat either  cold or  at room  temperature.  The foods
may be  a whole  new food idea like a frozen stuffed sandwich,
or a  familiar canned  item like  sliced fruit  but in a small
plastic cup or aluminum can with easy open lid.<P>

Further  definitions  for  consumer  cooking  methods  include
packages that  require foods to be removed before microwave or
conventional cooking, dual ovenable packages for microwave and
conventional  ovens,   cookable  packages  for  microwave  and
stovetop cooking,  packages  for  microwave-only  cooking,  or
packages that require no heating/cooking for foods.<P>


<B>REASONS FOR DOING THE STUDY</B><P>

This report was designed to accomplish the following
objectives:<P>

<LI>To  identify   specific  areas  of  interest  and  concern  to
consumers  regarding  packages,  and  analyze  how  they  have
contributed to  the development  of attitudes  that, in  turn,
have  shaped   consumer  demands  for  package  materials  and
configurations.<P>

<LI>To  gain   an  understanding  of  consumer  demands  that  can
influence  purchasing  decisions,  in  order  to  suggest  the
linkage between  packages and foods and consumer acceptance or
rejection thereof.<P>

<LI>To learn  how certain  consumer attitudes,  as well as social,
economic, regulatory, and technological trends, help or hinder
package suppliers  who seek  to satisfy  the demands  of  food
processors.<P>

<LI>To analyze  the role  of suppliers  and the  structure of  the
supplier  industry,   and  suggest  the  directions  in  which
suppliers must  move in  order to  help food processors market
products in  packages that  consumers  will  accept  as  safe,
convenient, and "green."<P>


<B>CONTRIBUTION OF THE STUDY</B><P>

BCC sought to provide insight into one key question:  How, and
with what  types of  package materials and configurations, can
suppliers serve food processors interested in meeting consumer
demands for  packages that  protect both  food quality and the
environment, while delivering optimum convenience?<P>

The study  will discuss  the  social,  demographic,  economic,
environmental, and  educational influences that shape consumer
preferences for  package materials  and  configurations.    It
analyzes the  confluence of  these market  forces and how they
either advance  or hamper  development and growth of packages.
It suggests  how these  preferences influence  buying patterns
that ultimately  affect the increase or decrease in demand for
the foods themselves.<P>

It will  describe food  processing methods,  how each  package
material and  configuration succeeds or fails to withstand the
rigors of  each, what  package choices  are open  to the  food
processor on  the basis of each method, how the choices affect
the degree  of consumer  convenience in  cooking the food, and
how food  processors offer  consumers cooking  flexibility  by
packaging the same foods differently.<P>

It will  discuss the  packaging needs  of each  food type, the
advantages  and   disadvantages  of   each  material  and  its
appropriateness for  each food  type.   It looks  at how  each
package configuration  can serve  each food  type and specific
application.       Materials    covered    include    plastic,
paper/paperboard, metal and glass.<P>

It will  delineate how  a food processor views each package in
terms of  image and  status for the product and as a marketing
tool to  attract consumers, how new types of packages can help
food processors  save  costs,  and  how  new  packages  expand
applications and  markets that  heretofore  might  have  posed
economic or technological constraints on food processors.<P>

It will  discuss material  preferences,  e.g.,  metal,  glass,
plastic.   Types of  metals, glass  or plastics  aren't broken
down by type.<P>

The insights  and conclusions  reached in this study can be of
special value to suppliers of materials and package converters
for the  food processing  industry. The  information  provided
here can  be useful  for developing  packages that enable food
processors to  stay competitive  and maintain  or gain  market
share.<P>


<B>SCOPE AND FORMAT</B><P>

BCC has confined this report to examining prepared convenience
foods defined  as those quick-cooking foods that serve as part
or full  meals rather  than snacks  such as popcorn. The first
section deals  with frozen  food packages.  The second section
discusses packages  for chilled/refrigerated  foods. The third
section reports  on  shelf-stable  foods.  The  final  section
encompasses  frozen,   chilled,  and   shelf-stable  foods  in
packages that are designed only for use in the microwave oven.<P>

The first  three sections  include discussion of microwaveable
foods and packages as one cooking method among many.  However,
the final section is devoted exclusively to foods reformulated
for the  quick cooking  time of  the microwave  oven and/or in
packages designed  to interact  with the  foods.  These  foods
should not  be cooked  with any  other method because the food
processor  ensures  optimum  quality  only  with  the  special
formula or package design.<P>

<B>METHODOLOGIES</B><P>

BCC describes each package material and configuration for each
food type,  then evaluates  each in  terms of  its  value  and
utility to  food processors.  A discussion  follows about  how
food processors  are trying  to satisfy consumer demands, what
that implies  in terms of requirements from suppliers, and how
suppliers are  trying to  comply  with  the  demands  of  food
processors. Estimates  and projections  of package  volume and
sales for  each material  and  configuration  were  calculated
according to  several factors:  expected growth  or decline in
the consumption  of certain  foods and  shipments  of  various
types of containers; patterns and trends in package usage; and
the  influence   of  market   forces  on   each  material  and
configuration.<P>

<B> GOAL AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>

This detailed report deals with the all-plastic barrier packaging in all its
forms: monolayer, multilayer -- coextruded, coated and laminated systems.
Both rigid and flexible forms of packaging are elaborated. In addition, some
background information on metallized plastic and other forms of packaging
is provided. The overall packaging container market is schematically
represented in the Introductory Figure.<P>


<B>INTRODUCTORY FIGURE
THE PACKAGING CONTAlNER MARKET</B><P>

This study was undertaken because of the explosive growth in the
consumption of different barrier resin packaging systems and the
proliferation of new processing technologies, types of barriers and a new
appraisal of how much barrier must be provided for different types of
products.<P>

<B>SCOPE & FORMAT</B><P>

This study is an in-depth elaboration and quantified description of various
types of all-plastic barrier food and non-food packaging systems and their
use in different markets. The study deals with processing, properties,
applications, markets, manufacturers and consumption figures of resins
and processes and describes the end-markets. Forecasts are made through
1995.<P>


<B>METHODOLOGY</B><P>

This study is divided into five major sections:<P>

1. Overview
2. Barrier and Structural Resins
3. Adhesive Tie layers
4. Multilayer Film and Sheet Technology
5. Markets for Barrier Packaging<P>

In the Overview, the scope and major issues are described. Food and non-
food packaging as well as types of barrier resins are delineated. Monolayer
and multilayer -- coextruded, coated and laminated systems are described
and quantified. Flexible and rigid packaging is described and discussed.<P>

New trends in the development of barrier and structural polymers are
discussed and the consumption statistics for major types of resins are
provided. Inter-layer adhesives are defined and briefly discussed.<P>

Technical aspects of barrier packaging systems are related to the type of
processing: hot-filling, retorting, aseptic and CAP-MAP. The use of
containers and plastic resins is related to the type of processing and is
quantified. Finally, the food preservation techniques, material technologies,
markets and distribution systems as well as shelf-life considerations are
briefly elaborated.<P>

The section on barrier and structural resins deals with different types of
barrier resins and their use in monolayer and multilayer packaging
systems. Multilayer packaging is further subdivided into coextruded,
coated and laminated systems. The principal barrier resins discussed are
PVdC, EVOH, acrylonitrile-MA, nylons and such polymers as modified
polyesters, acrylic derivatives and liquid crystal polymers. Silica coatings of
plastic containers, as well as oxygen scavenging systems are also
elaborated.<P>

Principal barrier resins are described in detail, including properties, types
available as related to usage, applications, market structure and
consumption statistics.<P>

One new type of chemical barrier packaging, known as Oxbar, is also
briefly treated in this section of the study. The chapter concludes with a
brief description of structural resins used in barrier packaging systems.
These include: polypropylene, polyethylenes, nylon, polyester, polystyrene
and polycarbonate.<P>

The section on "Tie Layer Adhesive" resins deals with the adhesive
properties of such resins, their consumption, and with different domestic
and foreign manufacturers.
The section on Multilayer Technology deals briefly with the coated and
laminated barrier systems and extensively with the coextruded systems.<P>

Different types of coextrusion feedblock systems and their respective merits
are elaborated, as well as the chief parameters involved in the control of
viscosity variations, gauges amd film uniformity.<P>

Principal purveyors of feedblock coextrusion systems, as well as the
developments in thermoforming technology for barriar containers, are also
discussed.<P>

This section of the study concludes with the description of integrated
barrier packaging systems and elaboration of the economic factors involved.<P>

The last section of the study deals with the markets. The following areas
related to markets for barrier packaging are elaborated and quantified:<P>

1. Overall packaging markets and Plastics share of the market.
2. Barrier packaging and its share of plastics packaging.
3. Food and non-food packaging.
4. Flexible and rigid barrier packaging.
5. Types of resins used in barrier packaging.
6. Markets by the level of barrier required.
7. Type of packaging by food processing.
8. Submarkets served by barrier packaging.<P>

Finally, after a brief discussion of food preservation techniques, individual
food markets are elaborated.<P>


<B>CONTRIBUTION AND TARGET AUDIENCE</B><P>

This study is designed for the manufacturers of barrier resins, barrier
packaging systems, and manufacturers of related equipment as well as for
companies which specialize in packaging. It will also be of great assistance
to industry analysts and investment firms that specialize in plastic
packaging of food and non-food products.<P>


<B>INFORMATION SOURCES</B><P>

Information sources for this study include interviews with numerous
representatives of manufacturer barrier resins, barrier packaging systems
and equipment, as well as with several food and non-food packagers who
use all-plastic barrier packaging. Other important sources were suppliers'
literature, technical and commercial magazines, government statistical
publications and selected BCC Opportunity Reports such as:<P>

P-085 -- Coextruded Barrier Packaging
P-089 -- Hot-Fill & Retort Packaging
P-111 -- Multicomponent Film and Sheet
P-107 -- Medical Packaging
P-106 -- Plastic Packaging Trays<P>

<B>OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</B><P>

It is  apparent to  everyone in  the broadly-defined packaging
business that  concern for  the environment  will not abate in
the 1990s.  It will grow as we examine our living patterns and
our commercial  practices from the standpoint of the impact on
resources.  The EPA, charged with the responsibility of caring
for the  environment, is pursuing a policy of source reduction
and development of recycling infrastructures for all packaging
materials.   Certain forms  of packaging  will meet  this dual
criteria and  thrive in the marketplace.  Others will fail one
or both  aspects of this test and gradually yield market share
to  other,   more   economic   and   environmentally-favorable
packaging media.<P>

One  form   of  plastic  packaging  that  has  been  available
virtually since  the dawn of the commercial plastic era is the
flexible pouch.   While  some products are ideally packaged in
rigid containers  (e.g., cans,  cases, tubs, trays, etc.) made
of either  plastic materials  or non-plastics,  virtually  all
food and many non-food products are suitably packaged in small
or large  pouches produced  from single-  or multi-layer film.
The  contents  can  be  liquid,  semi-liquid,  or  solid,  and
dispensed all at once or over time.  As the durability and the
barrier properties  of these  pouches  were  improved  and  as
processing and  filling equipment  evolved to  the point where
they could accommodate high-speed production lines, they began
to compete,  not only  against other  flexible packaging media
(e.g., paper  and plastic  bags), but  against rigid packaging
media (e.g., metal and plastic cans) as well.<P>

What are  the direct  and indirect  economic and environmental
advantages of  the plastic  pouch today?   What  has been  its
recent growth performance (in the 1980s) and what is it likely
to be  in the  near future  (through 1996)?   How much of this
past and  anticipated future  growth is  derived from existing
markets and  how much  from new markets, replacing alternative
plastic and  non-plastic packaging  media?   And,  critically,
what advantages  (e.g., weight,  thin-walls, low-cost  resins,
processing and  filling speeds,  recyclability) does the pouch
realistically offer  the packaging company today facing slower
economic growth in the short term and heightened environmental
awareness in the long term?<P>

These are  the issues  which we  address in  this report.   We
believe our judgments of a quantitative and qualitative nature
to be  both accurate  and candid, based on the wide network of
information gathered  and industry  participants consulted  in
the course  of our  research.   For example,  we would contend
that from the perspective of the first part of the EPA's waste
management  program  -  source  reduction  -  the  thin-walled
flexible pouch  is in  an excellent  position to  gain  market
share.  However, from the standpoint of the second objective -
recyclability -  the pouch  offers no distinct advantages over
rigid plastic  or most  other packaging  media, and its growth
potential may be restricted for that reason.<P>

<B>SCOPE AND FORMAT OF THE STUDY</B><P>

This study  views pouch  production and  consumption  patterns
from all  aspects, including  the types  of pouches  currently
available, the  equipment used  to fabricate  and  fill  these
pouches, the  various resins  used as  substrate  and  barrier
materials, the  key applications  in the  primary markets, the
economics of  pouch production, and the past/future pattern of
consumption--in absolute  terms and as a share of the entire
spectrum of packaging materials.<P>

Interestingly,  many   of  the   resin  suppliers,   equipment
manufacturers, film  suppliers, and  film  converters  in  the
field make  little distinction  between a pouch and a bag.  In
the absence  of an  industry consensus  for what constitutes a
pouch, we  have decided  to define  a pouch  as a bag which is
formed on-line  during the  filling stage,  usually with  more
hermetic seals than typically found in a bag.  It is made from
heat-sealing film  or a  combination of  such film with coated
paper or  foil, then  sealed at  the sides  and at the bottom.
The main  distinction, therefore, between a pouch and a bag is
that the  latter unit is fabricated completely before filling.
In addition,  there are  several other packaging media that do
not fall neatly into the pouch or bag categories which we have
elected to  include as well - namely, the bag-in-box container
and the boil-in-bag concept.<P>

The quantitative  data that  we offer  for the  various  pouch
types and pouch applications relate to a base year (1991), the
previous and  the next year (1990 and 1992), and a year in the
medium-term future  (1996).   Forecasts are provided and five-
year (1991-1996)  average annual growth rates are projected in
each case.   The  quantitative characteristics  of the various
pouches,  as   supplied  by  the  film  converters  and  pouch
fabricators, will relate to 1991 conditions.<P>

Our focus  is not  only on  the pouch  and its  current/likely
future position  in the  packaging industry,  but also  on the
evolution of  key players  in this  market  niche.    We  have
consulted with and identified key players throughout the chain
of pouch  production  and  consumption  -  the  substrate  and
barrier   film    suppliers,    the    processing    equipment
manufacturers, the  film converters, and the pouch fabricators
who are  the major package end-users of both food and non-food
products.   From all  of these inputs we feel that we are able
to pinpoint  the leading  resins  and  pouch  structures,  the
leading processing technologies, and the leading companies who
will influence the grow of pouches in the 1990s.<P>


<B>STUDY METHODOLOGY</B><P>

In addition  to telephone interviews with primary players from
each level  of pouch  production and consumption, we were able
to gather data and insights into the pouch and the future from
published  sources   such  as   trade  associations,  industry
conferences,  trade  publications,  and  government  agencies.
There is  no consensus  source of  information on  the volume,
value, and  industry break-down  of  pouch  consumption.    We
developed our  estimates by  merging  existing  data  on  film
demand with  quantified and non-quantified assessments offered
by key industry participants.<P>

<B>CONTRIBUTION OF THE STUDY</B><P>

This study  is intended  for use  by existing  resin and  film
suppliers and  packaging end-users,  as well  as by  companies
seeking to identify the opportunities and the growth prospects
in the  pouch business.  Plastics industry participants (e.g.,
resin  and  film  suppliers)  will  gain  some  insights  into
evolving  plastic  material  and  inter-material  competition.
Film converters  will be  interested to learn of technological
changes which  will impact  on the cost and characteristics of
pouches.   Packaging end-users  will be  able to  evaluate the
evolving cost/performance  of  the  pouch  vis-*-vis  all  the
alternative packaging  media that they either use or could use
in the various product categories.<P>

<B>PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY
</B><P>

This study examines a very important segment of the packaging
industry--that of polymeric barrier packaging. It analyzes the
technology, current status and future trends of barrier and
selective barrier products.<P>

The packaging industry itself has been around for centuries, and
even barrier packaging in the form of metal or glass containers has
been around for quite some time. Even polymeric high barrier
material, such as PVDC, has been utilized since the sixties, and
the EVOH was first commercialized in the early seventies. However,
the improvements in the coextrusion technology, which enabled
efficient assembly of multilayer structures in a single pass, came
about only about 15 years ago, and the barrier plastics business
got a major boost.<P>

Use of plastic-based barrier and selective barrier structures has
grown in recent years for applications in food, pharmaceutical,
medical, chemical, and industrial packaging. Barrier structures
provide needed protection of contents, while at the same time
minimizing the escape of inside constituents. Selective barriers,
on the other hand, allow passage of gases and vapors, while barring
the passage of liquids.<P>

Today, far from being a settled business, this industry is changing
and still evolving. The activities are on several fronts in which
newer materials and structures are still needed. For example, as of
yet an ideal polymeric barrier material does not exist. Moisture
susceptibility, high cost, the difficulty in recycling or disposal,
and inadequate barrier protection are some of the problems with the
current materials. Further, coated structures such as silicon oxide
coatings may challenge some of the polymeric materials,
particularly as their costs start coming down.<P>

Some of the other areas of activities and innovations are blending
incompatible polymers to create high barriers at moderate cost,
increasing efforts at source reduction, and improving the
recyclability of the polymers.<P>

This study looks at the markets and technologies, and attempts to
identify the future course of this business. Polymeric barrier
products include both oxygen and chemical barrier materials such as
HDPE. In selective or permeable barriers, we have included
technology and markets for gas permeable films used in the
healthcare markets, and for the controlled atmosphere packaging
area (CAP) being used to pack items such as produce and baked
goods. Although this study is aimed at polymeric barriers, we have
included a short chapter on non-polymeric barrier coatings on
plastic films (metal and oxide coatings).<P>


<B>TARGETED AUDIENCE</B><P>

This study will be useful to those in the packaging industry.  It
provides them with an understanding of the markets, trends,
technologies and the overall structure of the industry. Executives
of companies involved in the manufacture or distribution of
packaging products or supplies, including materials, equipment, or
services, as well as those end users involved in packaging their
goods, will find this a useful resource. It will be valuable also
to prospective entrants to this business, organizations promoting
or serving the packaging business, analysts, venture capital and
other, investors along with industry watchers.<P>


<B>SCOPE OF THIS STUDY</B><P>

This in-depth BCC analysis examines the materials, applications,
and the markets for barrier and selective polymeric materials and
structures used in packaging. Structures analyzed include flexible
and rigid, and monolayer and multilayer. Non-polymeric surface-
coated structures (silicon oxide and metal) are also briefly
covered. Market projections through 1998 are provided.<P>

The materials include the gas (particularly oxygen) barrier
materials, and the chemical barrier material HDPE, which is a poor
oxygen barrier. The oxygen barrier materials covered (most of which
also have excellent solvent barrier properties and are used in
chemical packaging as well) are polyvinylidene chloride (PVDC),
ethylene vinyl alcohol copolymer, (EVOH), nylons, acrylonitrile
methacrylate copolymer (AN-MA), and other specialty polymers such
as certain copolyesters.<P>

Materials with oxygen permeability of below 2 (ml-mil)/(100
sq.in.-day-atm) under dry and moderate humidity conditions are
termed barrier materials; those below 0.1 are termed high barrier
materials, those between 0.1-2 are termed moderate barrier
materials. EVOH, and PVDC are high barrier materials, and the rest
are moderate barriers.<P>

Selective barriers included are those that allow relatively easy
movement of gases, while restricting the passage of liquid. These
include Tyvek polyolefin films used in healthcare packaging and
permeable films used in controlled atmosphere packaging (CAP),
which allow products such as the produce to 'breathe'.<P>


<B>METHODOLOGY</B><P>

Research for this study consisted of extensive study of published
literature, BCC resources, and interviews with industrial,
university and government sources.<P>

Published information was searched via databases covering medical,
biological, chemical and business fields. Additionally dozens of
books, government reports, conference proceedings, company annual
reports and related marketing reports were consulted.<P>

Primary data collection was via interviews with industrial
manufacturers, end users, market watchers, and officials of
government and business associations.<P>

The information was assimilated and discussed among the BCC staff.
The basis and assumptions behind projected and forecasted markets
are clearly defined in this report.<P>


<B>NOTE ON UNITS</B><P>

There are a number of tables throughout the report which list the
permeability values of gases or water vapor. Unless otherwise
noted, the gas permeability units in this report are (cc-
mil)/(atm-day-100 sq.in.), and for water vapor (cc-
mil)/(100 sq.in.-day). Conversion factors for other units
are given in Appendix A.<P>

<CENTER><H3><I>SUMMARY</I></H3>
</CENTER>
In this report we have examined the overall market for the
polymeric barrier and selective barrier materials and structures.
These materials are used in the food, chemical, and healthcare
sectors.<P>

The barrier polymers are defined as those with oxygen permeability
of less than 2 (cc-mil)/(100 sq.in.-atm-day) which are used
for their gas and chemical barriers, and HDPE used only for
chemical packaging.<P>

The overall market for gas and chemical barrier polymers, tie
resins, and structural polymers is estimated at 3,071 pounds
(valued at $1,571 million) in 1993, estimated to grow  at 7% to
4,144 pounds (valued at $2,236 million) in 1998.<P>


The market for these is summarized in Summary Table A.<P>

</PRE>
The breakdown of the barrier resin market is provided in Summary
Table B. Chemical barrier HDPE accounts for the bulk of the market
(84% by weight, about 50% by value). About 80% of the HDPE is
untreated, whereas the remainder is surface treated, blended, or
used in multilayer composites to boost the solvent barrier
properties. Use of HDPE as a chemical barrier packaging material
will increase at a healthy 8%, helped by switching from metal and
glass containers for chemicals, and from metal to plastic for
automobile fuel tanks.<P>

The oxygen barrier materials will also show a healthy 7% growth
rate for the next five years. Whereas the PVDC markets have
matured, EVOH will continue to show a strong 11% average growth
over the next five years. Growth of the other materials will also
be healthy: nylon at 8%, and nitrile polymers at 6%. The use of
these oxygen barrier polymers is divided between the food sector
(76%), chemical (16%), and healthcare (8%). The growth in the
chemical segment will be especially strong, at 12%, caused by
continued switching to plastics, due to toughened air quality and
safety standards requiring more barrier packaging, and also by
switching to plastic fuel tanks.<P>

The selective barrier markets are in the healthcare area (for vapor
permeable Tyvek material) and in the controlled atmosphere
packaging area (CAP). The total market is currently estimated at
$72 million, and is expected to grow at 8% to $108 million by 1998.
The Tyvek market for healthcare packaging is mature, and whereas
the market for CAP films is evolving and expected to grow at a
robust 11% average annual rate over the next five years, as more
produce is centrally packaged and distributed in permeable films to
retain freshness for a longer time. The markets for selective
barrier films are summarized in Summary Table C.<P>

</CENTER>

<B>STUDY OBJECTIVES</B>


<P>This report presents a quantitative analysis of the competition among
thermal insulation materials used within the residential and nonresidential
construction industry.  It focuses on the competition within each market
and assesses sales trends over the next 5 and 10 years.  It explains those
factors that we expect will contribute to the gains of some materials and the
losses of others.  Our analysis emphasizes relative price differentials and
real and/or perceived technological advantages offered by different materials.<P>


<B>REASONS FOR DOING THE STUDY</B>


<P>During the last five years, the construction industry has been in the
doldrums as the recession of 1991 and 1992 played havoc with the housing
market.  Housing starts were down from 1.376 million units in 1989 to
1.014 million in 1992.  Single-family home starts fell to 840,000 in 1992
from 1.003 million in 1989 and the roof over starts of multifamily units
simply caved in.  In 1989, those multifamily units accounted for 38.4% of
total starts.  By 1992,  that ratio had declined to 14.2%.  It had dropped to a
low of 12.5% in 1993.<P>


<P>Existing home sales also declined steadily in 1989, 1990, and 1991.  So did
expenditures for residential repairs and alterations.  The latter dropped by
over 16% in 1991 alone.<P>

<P>To make matters worse for the construction industry, the private office and
industrial plant boom of the 1980s came to an abrupt end at the beginning
of the 1990s.  Plagued by high vacancy rates in every part of the country,
builders simply stopped erecting more skyscrapers, office buildings,
manufacturing facilities, etc.<P>


<P>Unfortunately, data for sales of insulation materials for that period are at
best sketchy and far from being reliable.  We are nevertheless told that the
impact on such markets as ceiling, attic, wall, crawl space, and flat roof
insulation materials dropped drastically.  Sales prospects disappeared and
layoffs and bankruptcies spread throughout the industry.<P>  


<P>On the technology front, new products made their appearance mostly as a
result of the announced ban of the production of CFCs, a blowing agent
used in such materials as polyisocyanurate, polyurethane, and polystyrene
insulation materials.<P>

<B>CONTRIBUTION OF THE STUDY</B>


<P>In this report, we answer such questions as which material is gaining
ground within each of the markets studied.  Which one will dominate by
1999 and 2004 and for what reasons?  We believe that sales and strategic
planning professionals within the housing and insulation materials
industries will greatly benefit from our analysis.  The information included
in this report will also prove to be an invaluable guide for any analysis of
future sales or for planning capital investment projects.<P>

<B>SCOPE AND FORMAT</B>


<P>The study begins with an overview of the housing market, past, present,
and future.  Emphasis is put on demographic changes that augur well for
housing over the next 5 to 10 years.  This section is followed by an overview
of the thermal insulation materials industry, the technical and thermal
aspects of such materials, the range of materials available, the price
differentials found for those materials, and the recently enacted government
restriction imposed for the manufacturing of some of those materials.  A 5-
and 10-year forecast concludes that section.  This section is followed by an
analysis of each of the most important insulation materials.  The topics
covered include their manufacturing process, the technical properties of
each material, their end uses, and the most important producers.  A 5- and
10-year forecast concludes each analysis.<P>


<B>INFORMATION SOURCES</B>


<P>A study of this kind relies heavily on published data and on the expertise of
professionals in the field.  The insight provided by those experts is most
appreciated.  We also wish to thank the professionals of the several trade
associations we contacted.<P>

<B>STUDY OBJECTIVES</B><P>

This report focuses on the quantitative analysis of the competition
between paper and plastics between 1989 and 1993.  It reviews the
production and sales of the main grades of paper and paperboard and
assesses the tonnage gained or lost during the five-year period. 
It explains, in detail, those factors that contributed the most to
those gains or losses and emphasizes the role played by competing
plastic products.  A forecast through 2004 is included.<P>



<b>REASONS FOR DOING THE STUDY</B><P>

Material or product substitution is not a new phenomenon.  Indeed,
we can argue that such substitution is at the very heart of
progress.   New technologies, differences in relative prices, new
government regulations, and the desire to be more productive are
just some of the reasons why the search for new ideas, new
products, and new materials goes on.  During the last two decades,
paper producers have learned the hard way the meaning of
competition from new materials.  They have experienced the
onslaught of a wide range of plastic products, an onslaught that
has seriously affected their own productive capacity.  Whether it
be T-shirt grocery bags or HDPE milk containers, the demand for
several paper products has suffered.<P>


The result has been that, during most of the 1980s, plastic
products gained market share, often at the expense of paper
products.  That was particularly true in the packaging and wrapping
areas.  Whether we discuss boxes, bags, or wrapping material, there
was always a plastic film or container that could do the job more
efficiently and more cheaply.<P>


In a previous report (BCC report P-027N, Plastics vs. Paper),
issued five years ago, we forecasted that the competition between
the two materials had more or less run its course.  At the time, we
believed that successful packaging needed to draw from the
strengths of both materials.  Hence, the movement to replace one
material for the other would come to an end during the 1990s and
both would grow in tandem.<P>

We also thought that an energy crisis was in the offing, a crisis that would adversely affect the plastics industry.  Though the crisis has not yet manifested itself the way we thought it would, that is, through substantially higher energy prices, it seems that it is only a matter of time before that happens.  The U.S. is now more dependent than ever on foreign oil, and the booming economies of India, China, Southeast Asia and South America are depleting the readily available sources of
supplies.  There is a time bomb ticking and it is only a matter of
time before it goes off.<P>

We also thought that the competition between paper and plastics would slow down because plastic was perceived as a nonrecyclable material.  We were partly right.  There has been a strong movement during the last five years against the use of plastic products for the very reason that those products contribute unfairly to our stock of post-consumer waste. 
Significant strides have been made to recycle plastic containers,
especially milk and soda bottles.  Other products are being
recycled but the pace of progress is much slower.  Paper, on the
other hand, has never received the bad press to which plastic was
subjected.<P>  



<b>CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE STUDY</B><P>

In this update, we take an extensive look at the developments over
the last five years.  We believe that those involved in the
production or sales of either plastic or paper products that
compete with one another will greatly benefit from our analysis. 
These professionals may be involved with the production or sales of
bags, boxes, or wrapping materials of all types and sizes.  The
information included in this report will prove to be an invaluable
guide for any analysis of future sales or for planning capital
investment projects.<P>



<b>SCOPE AND FORMAT</B><P>

The study includes an analysis of the competition for the following
products: cover, envelope and label papers; shipping, grocery,
shopping, and merchant bags; corrugated boxes, folding cartons, and
bleached boxboard for milk and other food services.  In each case,
a quantitative analysis of the tonnage gained or lost is provided,
together with the major factors that have contributed to the gains
and losses.  An 11-year forecast concludes each section.<P> 

<b>INFORMATION SOURCES</B><P>

A study of this kind relies heavily on hard data and on the
expertise of professionals in the field.  The insight provided by
those experts is most appreciated.  We also wish to thank the
several associations that have contributed most generously with
their data and their interpretation.<P>

<B>REASONS FOR DOING THIS STUDY
</B><P>

This technical/marketing study has been prepared as an in-depth
analysis to forecast and track significant changes in the market
for fillers and extenders used in plastics.  BCC has conducted this
study in order to update the current status of fillers and
extenders for plastics commonly used in the U.S., both thermosets
and thermoplastics, and assess the growth potential of these
materials over a five-year period extending to 1998.  Our key
objective is to present an analysis of the current and potential
market for fillers and extenders in plastics.<P>


<b>HISTORY OF THE MARKET</B><P>

Traditionally used as bulking agents, fillers now tend to be more
functional, as compounding techniques become increasingly sophisticated.  Today's fillers and extenders for plastics not only bulk,
but enhance and modify specific physical properties.  Enhancement
of desirable physical properties has produced functional, semi-reinforcing fillers that now compete with both resins via replacement and with traditional reinforcers, such as fibrous glass
and other composites, by reducing reinforcing and formulation
costs.<P>


<b>SCOPE OF THIS REPORT</B><P>

The scope of this report includes an overall view of the fillers
and extenders in plastics market.  This report both quantifies and
qualifies data gathered on this market.  Data are analyzed for
trends and economic indicators affecting the demand for plastic
fillers and extenders.<P>

This report is divided into three parts.  The first part includes
an overview of fillers and extenders in plastics as well as a
review of the current status of the industry, its structure and its
competitive aspects.  The second part of the report covers filled
polymer systems and filled resin applications, while the third part
of the report delves into the market for the various types of
fillers and extenders.<P>

The common filled thermosets and thermoplastics are covered in this
report as well as some of the common elastomers.  Rubber, latexes,
polymer-based papers, paints and thin-film coatings are not
included.  In this report, filler refers to solid or powdered
mineral, synthetic or organic-based materials.  Extenders refer to
plasticizer-like, liquid or semi-liquid additives used for bulking.
Multi-functional pigments, such as calcium carbonate, titanium
dioxide and carbon black, are included, as well as such semi-
reinforcing functional fillers as mica, microspheres and short
fiber glass fillers.  Not considered are the long fiber glasses,
carbon fibers, whiskers and other composites.<P>


<b>METHODOLOGY</B><P>

Much of the information for this technical/marketing report was
gathered through telephone conversations with supplier representatives, as well as industry and academic experts in the field of
filled polymers.  The balance of the information was gathered from
available government, trade and technical publications.  An online
data search was made of data bases to retrieve information and
cover all of the existing literature.  Licensing agreements,
company activities, patents and state-of-the-art technology were
evaluated.<P>

A review of the period 1988-1993 and predictions for 1993-1998 are
made from a synthesis of information gathered from the BCC
database.  Value projections are given in 1993 constant dollars for
U.S. sales only.  The average annual growth rates conform to the
convention for significant figures.  Where precise information was
not forthcoming, a consensus was made, using a formula of
reasonable assumptions and estimates based on a baseline obtained
from historical data.<P>


<b>VALUE OF THIS REPORT</B><P>

This comprehensive technical/marketing study will be a valuable
basic market reference and technology summary for the producers,
processors, manufacturers and others who may produce or are
considering producing plastic filling and extending compounds in
the U.S. market.  The plastics compounding industry can track
potential competition or analyze new resin/filler compatibilities
and opportunities.  Reinforcing plastic and composite manufacturers
and suppliers can use this technical/marketing report to assist in
evaluating the competitive functional fillers and extenders and
their market opportunities.<P>

<B>STUDY GOALS AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>

The building and construction industries are the major marketplaces for pipe.
The pipe industry thus finds itself firmly ensconced among those boom and bust
industries which ride the coattails of our nation's economic fortunes.  The
lackluster  economic growth in recent years has been hard on the building and
construction sector, and most segments of the pipe industry have shared in
these hard times.   As in other manufacturing sectors of the national economy,
retrenchment tactics have prevailed.<P>

Significant consolidation and rationalization of excess capacity has occurred
in some segments, while cost containment and improved process and quality
control measures have led to productivity gains and quality improvements
across the entire pipe industry.   Even for those segments of the business
that have experienced a gain in sales and market share, few have had the good
fortune to see those results settle to the bottom line as improved
profitability.<P>

This report endeavors to give the reader an accurate bearing on where the
industry is heading as we move into the middle of this decade.  The primary
objectives are:<P>

<UL> <LI>       To describe the industry, its importance and its future prospects.

  <LI>       To analyze the current and historical volume and value of shipments for
        each type of pipe material.

 <LI>        To forecast the volume and value for each type of pipe material
        through 1998.

 <LI>        To analyze the end use markets for each type of pipe material.

 <LI>        To analyze the changes impacting the industry.

 <LI>        To describe manufacturing methods and economics.

 <LI>        To describe recent technological developments and trends.

 <LI>        To discuss the driving forces influencing demand.

 <LI>        To analyze the primary competitive market categories and to
        determine the market share held by each competing material
        within those market categories.

  <LI>       To review exports, imports and apparent consumption.
 <LI>        To review international implications.

 <LI>        To discuss regulatory and environmental issues and concerns.<P></UL>

<B>REASONS FOR THIS STUDY</B><P>

Major changes that have taken place in the industry over the past five years
and the continuing winds of change  provide the impetus for this study.
Rationalization, restructuring and product and process improvements have
heightened competition between both differing and identical pipe materials.
Certain end uses are the focus of intense competition as producers fight to
retain or, as the case may be, increase market share; and productivity gains
have sharpened the competitiveness of the entire industry. Issues remain
unresolved with regard to the use of certain materials in certain
applications, and building codes continue to evolve.  The participants in this
industry need to be acutely aware of these developments to intelligently plan
for the future.<P>

This report brings these factors into focus and provides manufacturers,
distributors and users of pipe with the knowledge needed to make informed
decisions relating to investment, procurement or pipe material selection.<P>

<B>CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE STUDY AND FOR WHOM</B><P>

This report is intended to inform those companies involved in the production
of raw materials, the manufacture of pipe and pipe fittings, and
distributors, retailers and consumers of pipe.  The study is an analysis and
summation of interviews with hundreds of key industry officials, trade
associations and government agencies and a statistical compilation and
analysis of data obtained from these sources.<P>

<B>SCOPE AND FORMAT</B><P>

Our subject is the Competitive Nature of the U.S. Pipe Industry and, in this
report, we define the industry as the  producers and  fabricators of pipe and
the markets which they serve.  BCC published an identically titled report in
1987 and this report brings the analysis "up to date".  The report is
logically divided into the following nine chapters:<P>

<UL> 1 - Introduction.  The reader is given the objectives, rationale, scope,
   methods and information sources for this report.<P>

2 - Summary.  This chapter gives a concise overview of the findings and
conclusions of the report.<P>

3 - Overview.  The industry and its relationship to the economy are described.
A brief historical perspective is given.<P>

4 - The Major Pipe Materials and Shipment Trends.  Each pipe material is described
and broken into its major product  subclassifications.  Volume and value data
are given for the years 1987 and 1993 and forecasts are made through 1998.<P>

5 - The Major Pipe Materials and End Uses.  Major uses of each pipe material are
analyzed and forecasts made through 1998.<P>

6 - Technological Issues.  This chapter describes manufacturing methods as well as
economics and important developments and changes.<P>

7 - International Implications.  The international aspects of the pipe industry
are discussed, including import/export statistics and apparent U.S.
consumption.  The influences of foreign investment and technology are covered.<P>

8 - Industry Structure and Competitive Markets.  The role of the distributor is
detailed.  The key competitive market categories are identified and
comprehensively analyzed.  The leading companies in each sector are named.<P>

9 - Regulatory and Environmental Issues.  A thorough analysis of current and
pending regulatory and environmental issues is made.<P></UL>

<B>METHODOLOGY</B><P>

The extensive research capabilities of the BCC staff were accessed to analyze
government and industry data on pipe consumption.  New technologies, market
developments and present and future trends were identified through patent and
literature searches and discussions with key industry sources.  Current
regulatory and environmental issues were ascertained through discussion with
industry sources, regulatory agencies and the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency. International trade statistics were obtained from the U.S. Department
of Commerce. Manufacturing methods, process economics and major influences on
the industry were derived from discussions with a wide range of industry
sources.<P>

<B>INFORMATION SOURCES</B><P>

The substance of this report is based on interviews with principal
participants in the industry. Over 200 organizations were contacted including
raw material suppliers, pipe manufacturers, pipe distributors, pipe consumers,
federal and state governmental agencies and standards, and code making
organizations.  The U.S. Department of Commerce and various industry trade
groups were resources for historical data on the volume and value of
shipments.<P>

<B>CONTEXT OF THE REPORT</B><P>

It has become axiomatic in the plastics industry to regard the
development of new resins as too capital-intensive, expensive and
fraught with risk with regard to ultimate market acceptance.  This
may hold true for the higher-volume commodity resins, but it is
clearly not true of the specialty, higher-performance types of
thermoplastics and thermosets.  Nowhere is the search for new
materials more intense nor the possible rewards for such efforts
greater than in the field of high-temperature polymers.<P>

By 1980 the plastics design engineer had only a narrow palette of
plastics to choose from in order to produce a part that could
withstand long-term heat resistance of 300oF and short-term heat
excursions up to 500(F and above, as well as deliver equally
critical mechanical/electrical/processing features.  Among the
thermoplastics there were the fluoropolymers that were ideal for
extrusion applications such as wire and cable insulation, but these
resins were not easily adapted to injection molded parts with
complex geometries.  There were the sulfone-based resins such as
polysulfone and polyphenylsulfone, and polyamideimide which had
proven itself in small parts that had to operate in hostile
environments.  Among the thermosets, there were only a few
commercial grades of bismaleimide on the market requiring heavy
glass or carbon fiber reinforcement to overcome this resin's
inherent brittleness, and silicone offered excellent thermal
properties, but it could not be processed with conventional
processing equipment.  Meanwhile there were many condensation- and
addition-type polyimides being actively pursued under Government
contracts, but up to that time they remained largely laboratory
curiosums rather than commercial realities.<P>

Over the past decade, from 1980 right up to 1991, the pace of
research and commercialization of high-temperature plastics - in
this country and abroad - has accelerated dramatically.  These
global research programs among the thermoplastic resin
manufacturers have yielded a vast - in fact, perhaps, excessive -
menu of imide-, sulfone- and ketone-based polymers, along with the
startling new performance features of liquid crystal polymers.  The
thermoset manufacturers have brought out a whole range of
polyimides with excellent mechanical performance at elevated (500-
700oF) temperature for consideration by the military and commercial
aircraft engine builders today and other (e.g., automotive)
manufacturers for the future.  They have also upgraded the thermal
and mechanical performance of all the major thermosets - the epoxies,
phenolics, vinyl ester cyanate esters, bismaleimides,
etc. - through compounding with high-temperature thermoplastics and
modifying the basic thermoset formulations.<P>

In effect, the search for higher-temperature performance extends
right through the whole contemporary resin classification system,
and this is leading to increased competition among the suppliers
and increased options among the end-users.  Manufacturers of
commodity resins such as polystyrene, nylon and PVC have recently
introduced "high-temperature" grades of their resins.  Formerly
intractable resins such as polyphenylene oxide and maleic anhydride
have been harnessed to high-temperature applications through the
medium of alloying and blending with more processable resins.
Alloying and blending has also been a route to synergistic
combinations of thermal and mechanical performance in the field of
polyimides and liquid crystal polymers.  Moreover, there are whole
new resins such as polyetherimide (1982) and polyphthalamide (1991)
available to the high-temperature plastics decision-makers.<P>

<B>SCOPE OF THE REPORT</B><P>

In this report we cover the full range of "old" and "new" high-
temperature plastics competing against alternative materials such
as metals, ceramics, glass, etc. and against each other in the
major end-use markets where thermal performance is critical -
namely,<P>

<MENU>          - aerospace<BR>
          - aircraft interiors and exteriors<BR>
          - automotive under-the-hood and underbody parts<BR>
          - electrical/electronic assemblies and parts<BR>
          - medical devices and ware<BR>
          - missiles<BR>
          - others</MENU><P>

The resins that we have isolated for consideration are those that
can meet specific thermal performance criteria in the virgin resin
state - principally a continuous use temperature of 300oF and
above.  This recognizes the fact that numerous fillers such as
glass fibers can enhance the thermal properties of plastics, but a
penalty in either processability or mechanical performance or both
is normally incurred.<P>

Moreover, high-temperature plastics are now supplied in various
forms such as<P>

<MENU>          - molding compounds (liquid, powder and pellets)<BR>
          - film<BR>
          - foam<BR>
          - sheet<BR>
          - prepregs<BR>
          - fibers<BR>
          - stock shapes for subsequent machining</MENU><P>

In this report we cover all these forms with the exception of
fibers which will be treated in a separate, forthcoming report from
BCC.<P>

From a geographical standpoint, this report provides a
comprehensive update on developments on the supply side among
foreign (e.g., European and Japanese), as well as domestic, high-
temperature resin manufacturers.  However, we draw most of our
examples of high-temperature plastic applications from the U.S.
marketplace, and our consumption totals relate primarily to current
and likely future U.S. demand for these materials.<P>



<B>CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE REPORT</B><P>

BCC has covered the field of high-temperature plastics in multi-
client and custom reports on several occasions over the past decade
when the list of these resins and grades grew so markedly.  It has
also conducted other studies that touched in part on key markets
for high-temperature plastics (e.g., aircraft, advanced composites,
electronics).  Thus we bring years of research expertise and a
wealth of industry contacts out in the field to this present
research program.  The result, we feel, is an accurate,
comprehensive and in-depth analysis of the driving forces at play
(e.g., changing part design requirements, regulations, economics of
high-temperature plastics processing), the key players in this
business, the evolving industry structure, and the quantitative
short-term and long-term prospects for these high-value-added,
high-temperature resins in the decade ahead.<P>

The insights and the data that we have put together here come from
an extensive review of the domestic and foreign plastics literature
and from a broad-based survey of key market participants.  We are
thus able to quantify the amount of resin that is not only capable
of high-temperature performance, but actually used in that
connection - now and through the coming decade.  This information
should be a valuable input to existing companies supplying or specifying high-temperature resins, as
well as to other companies
contemplating entering or expanding their presence in this
specialty niche of the plastics industry.<P>

<B>STUDY GOALS AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>

The objective of this study is to provide an analysis of transparent plastics 
in terms of current and forecasted markets. New developments in clear plastics 
expanded usage in existing and new applications and competition between 
polymers exhibiting optical clarity will be covered.  The competitive scenario 
between glass and clear plastics will also be described.  The competition 
between transparent plastics will be discussed in detail.<P> 

Important suppliers of clear plastics, their product lines, and other 
important factors that impact the market will be discussed.<P> 


<b>REASONS FOR DOING THE STUDY</B><P>

The 1990s has spawned the search for niche markets by most plastics suppliers, 
somewhat irrespective of potential volume.  Selection criteria focus on 
growing specialty markets with opportunities for respectable profits even 
though sales volumes may be less than desired.<P> 

Transparent plastics could be a possibility for a niche market since the 
category encompasses many types of polymers.  In addition to acrylics and 
polycarbonates, many styrene-based materials, along with commodity and 
specialty polymers, qualify as having clear grades.  Opportunities in several 
application areas are in need of reappraisal in regard to transparent or clear 
plastics.<P> 


<b>SCOPE AND FORMAT</B><P>

The term "transparent" or "clear" is obviously a subjective one.  Most relate 
clarity of plastics to percent of light transmission as defined by ASTM test 
D-1003.  Light transmission percentages above 85% usually are accepted as 
transparent.  Other related ASTM tests are D-523 and D-542.<P> 

Clear plastics are commercially available in many forms, e.g., injection 
molded, extruded, blow molded, thermoformed, etc.  Many extruded products are 
converted to films.  The many uses of these films (commodity, specialty, 
coextruded, plastic food, medical packaging, etc.) could be the subject of a 
separate report.<P> 

Blow-molded plastics are hollow and most are converted to bottles or 
containers, while thermoformed plastics are similar to injection molded except 
that they are usually thinner and require less expensive equipment and capital 
expense. <P>

This report will cover rigid, clear, non-packaging plastic parts which include 
injection molded, non-film extrusion, and thermoforming (including cast 
sheet).  The major plastic products excluded from this report will be flexible 
and hollow materials (including films).<P> 


<b>METHODOLOGY</B><P>

A comprehensive review was undertaken of literature relating to clear 
polymers, their applications and technology, and significant new developments.  
Included in the review were supplier trade literature, texts, and monographs.<P> 

Following the collection and analysis of this information, extensive 
interviews were conducted with many producers, suppliers, and fabricators of 
transparent plastics.<P> 

All dollar values are in 1994 dollars, "millions" are often abbreviated as 
"MM", growth rates are annually compounded, and tradenamed products appear in 
upper-case letters.<P> 

The terms "transparent" and "clear" are used interchangeably.  The acronyms 
PS, PP, and PC are often used to denote polystyrene, polypropylene, and 
polycarbonate, respectively.<P> 

Methylmethacrylate and MMA are also used interchangeably, as are polymethylmethacrylate and PMMA.  Methylmethacrylate polymers are synonymous with
PMMA.<P>

<B>Goals and Format</B><P>

Recent developments in blending and alloying technologies have led to
the proliferation of new products, methods of blending and many new
applications for thermoplastic blends. This detailed report addresses
these recent changes and developments in the field of polymeric
blends, including new compatibilizers and new applications in
automotive and non-automotive products.<P>

One of the principal reasons why alloys and blends are so popular is
the achievement of superior properties at often reduced cost. Also,
the less stringent requirements for the development of alloys than for
the development of entirely new polymers, which usually take several
years from research to full commercialization.<P>

<B>Scope and Format</B><P>

This study is an in-depth qualitative and quantitative description of
properties, applications, markets and suppliers of thermoplastic
alloys and blends. It also deals with consumption figures for
different types of alloys and different applications and forecasts
this data through 1996. The report also deals with the
compatibilization of the otherwise immiscible blends and with impact
modification of hard and sometimes brittle thermoplastic materials.
Other aspects of blending-alloying technology including the types and
preparation of interpenetrating polymer networks (IPNs) are also
described in detail.<P>

<B>Contribution and Target Audience</B><P>

This study is designed for manufacturers of thermoplastic alloys and
blends as well as suppliers of additives for such blends as
compatibilizers, impact modifiers, reinforcing fillers and fibers and
coupling agents. It will assist them in making decisions relative to
markets, property requirements for specific uses, production levels
and potential sales of their products. It will also provide them with
information relative to competitive products.<P>

The information included in this report will be also useful to
processors and distributors active in the field of thermoplastic
alloys and blends as well as additives. It will also be of value to
investment firms and market analysts advising potential investors.<P>

<B>Methodology</B><P>

This study consists of five major sections:<P>

<MENU>1. Overview<BR>
2. Technological Aspects of Alloying and Blending<BR>
3. Alloys and Blends by Type<BR>
4. Markets and Applications<BR>
5. Suppliers of Alloys and Blends</MENU><P>

In the Overview, the scope of alloying and blending as well as the
historical perspective are delineated. The terms related to alloys and
blends are defined and there is a brief discussion of miscibility and
compatibilization of blends. A description of competitive polymeric
products such as reinforced thermoplastics, RIM, SMC and thermosets
is followed by a brief description of major markets. Types of alloys
are listed together with their present and projected consumption
figures. International dimension and the listing of major alloy and
blend manufacturers conclude this section of the study.<P>

The chapter on Technological Aspects of Alloying and Blending deals
with the problems in alloying and blending as related to miscibility,
compatibility, thermodynamic considerations as well as the phenomenon
of synergy. It deals with the modification of major properties and
their mechanisms, process control, reactive blending and polymer
tacticity. The types of compatibilizers available are discussed in
some detail. The types and characteristics of IPNs are also discussed.
Impact modifiers and their effect on blend properties of different
types of alloys are elaborated.<P>

The section of this report dealing with the types of alloys and blends
describes in-depth the properties, applications, consumption figures
and manufacturers of individual types of alloys and blends. The types
of alloys are classified according to their major thermoplastic
component. The following types of thermoplastic alloys are described:
polyphenylene oxide or ether (PPO and PPE), ABS, nylons,
polycarbonate, polyesters and PBT and miscellaneous blends which
include those based on acetals, polysulfone, SMA, polyarylate,
polyurethane and ASA. Minor engineering alloys and blends are also
briefly described. The chapter concludes with the discussion of
commodity-based alloys, mostly those based on PVC, polypropylene,
other polyolefins and polystyrene and IPNs.<P>

The chapter dealing with Markets and Applications describes and
analyzes two major markets for thermoplastic alloys and blends:
automotive and non-automotive. Automotive applications which consume
a large volume of thermoplastic alloys are stressed. In this context,
thermoplastic alloys are compared to major competitive materials such
as steel, RIM and SMC. The partnership between car and thermoplastic
alloy manufacturers is described and analyzed. Major suppliers of
thermoplastic alloy parts for the automotive industry are listed. The
automotive market is divided into three sections: exterior, interior
and under-the-hood applications. Special consideration is given to
exterior automotive panels and bumpers.<P>

Non-automotive applications such as business machines, appliances,
tools, consumer products, electrical and electronic parts, and
building and industrial products are also elaborated.<P>

The final section of this report deals with the suppliers of alloys
and blends. They and their products are detailed starting with the
most important suppliers (General Electric) and ending with those
suppliers who contribute less than one per cent of the market. The
information on sales of alloys by major manufacturers in volume and
percentage of the market controlled is also provided in this section
of the report.<P>

<B>Information Sources</B><P>

Information sources for this study include technical and commercial
magazines, government statistical reports, interviews with numerous
representatives of manufacturers and users of thermoplastic alloys and
blends, private publications, patents, papers presented at various
conferences and informal discussions with their authors. Selected BCC
Opportunity Reports have also been used as a source of information.

<B>OBJECTIVES OF THE REPORT</B><P>

     "We don't sell toys, nobody in the toy industry sells toys.  We sell
     plastics; that's what we sell.  We sell it in different forms from our resin
     suppliers.  They sell it as a pellet, we sell it in the form of a toy.  The
     safest type of toy you can make today is a plastic toy, and as we continue
     to design toys we only think of one thing - plastic.  We don't develop toys
     in wood or metal or anything ----.  So, plastic is here to stay, we'll always
     be a plastic industry, and as the industry grows - which it will - the
     industry will continue to go after different markets (new toy concepts).
     Consequently, there will be growth in plastics - I would say 5 percent
     minimum per year."<P>

<B>Hasbro Official</B><P>

The above panegyric on the role of plastics in the design, manufacturing and
marketing of toys captures the enthusiasm that U.S. and global toy and recreational
equipment vendors have for these materials in their current decision-making.  The toy
and recreational equipment business is relatively recession-proof, so the consumption
of all materials has steadily increased over the recent past and will continue to do so
over the coming years.  And the economic, environmental and design advantages of
plastics as a group over traditional toy and recreational equipment materials (wood,
metals, rubber, textiles, etc.) have led to the gradual replacement of these materials
and a more prominent role for both the commodity resins and selected engineering
resins that can offer cost-effective mechanical strength, clarity, impact resistance, and
other critical qualities required in toys.<P>

Yet, despite the size and scope of the opportunities for plastics - over 800 million
pounds of resins consumed as of 1991 and probably over 1 billion pounds by 1996 -
the toy industry has seldom been studied from the standpoint of the evolving inter-
materials competition, as well as the evolving preferences for specific plastic materials
and plastics processing methods, for low- to high-volume toy part programs.  In this
research program, BCC has set out to determine and quantify wherever possible the
opportunities that the toy business offers to resin manufacturers, plastics
compounders, plastics processors, additive manufacturers, and all the other players
on the plastics supply chain.<P>

One basic objective in this report, therefore, is to illuminate for all the companies in
the toy and plastics industries the current and likely future role of plastics based on
evolving economic, demographic, environmental and industry-specific considerations.
Toy companies will benefit from the data and insights offered on trends in plastic
material decision-making among their domestic and, in some cases, foreign
competitors.  Plastics companies will benefit from the details offered on the evolving
pricing, processing and performance requirements for plastics in both colored and
clear toy part programs, large and small parts, and from the candid assessments
offered on the current pallette of plastic material grades promoted for use in toys of
all types.  They will also learn the performance enhancements that the domestic toy
manufacturers are seeking from plastics for their next generation of products.<P>



<B>SCOPE OF THE REPORT</B><P>

The toy industry embraces a vast number of products designed to both entertain and educate children.  In this report we focus on three basic categories of toys:<P>

<UL>dolls<BR>
traditional toys (including novelties)<BR>
outdoor playground equipment<P></UL>

Dolls are a well-defined segment of the toy industry.  Outdoor playground equipment
is brought into scope, not only because this is a large and fast-growing medium for
entertaining children outside the home (in the backyard of residences, in schoolyards
and preschool playgrounds, at institutions, restaurants, etc.), but it is also
characterized by lively competition among materials - mainly wood, metals and
plastics - for structural and non-structural parts (e.g., slides, crawl tubes, rails, roofs,
etc.).  Traditional toys are the residual or "all other" toy category, including pre-school
toys, play figures, games and puzzles, cycles and ride-on vehicles, activity toys, video
games, simulated sports gears, novelties, etc.<P>

The interviews we conducted were with U.S. toy manufacturers, and we tended to
concentrate on those companies with at least some domestic manufacturing
capabilities because these are the primary toy industry customers for the U.S. plastics
industry participants.  However, in those cases where leading U.S. companies
consulted have little or no domestic manufacturing capabilities, we still attempted to
determine their plastic material preferences and the internal and external influences
on that decision-making in offshore production facilities.<P>

As for the data presented in this report, we were able to draw from statistics
generated by both the toy industry and the plastics industry covering the period 1980-
1991 for several key series.  In our interviews with officials at toy and plastics
industry associations and at leading companies in both fields, we concentrated on
verifying the published 1991 data, determining the trends already evident in the
current year (1992), and then forecasting out to the year 1996, based on their
assessments.  The resulting estimates from all these sources should be accurate within
very small tolerance margins.<P>



<B>RESEARCH METHODOLOGY</B><P>

Our sources for the qualitative and quantitative assessments offered here were as follows:<P>

<UL><LI> toy industry associations such as the Toy Manufacturers
        Association (TMA),<P>
    <LI> plastics industry associations such as the Society of the Plastics Industry (SPI),<P>
    <LI> government publications on trends in the U.S. toy industry such
        as those from the U.S. Department of Commerce,<P>
     <LI> plastics and toy industry trade and company literature,<P>
     <LI> telephone interviews with leading U.S. toy companies,<P>
     <LI> telephone interviews with leading custom plastics processors
        serving the U.S. toy industry, and<P>
     <LI> telephone interviews with leading resin manufacturers and other
        plastic material suppliers.<P></UL>

We received tremendous cooperation from all these sources, particularly the leading
U.S. toy companies where officials with either product design or materials R&D or
plastics purchasing responsibilities generally provided us with a wealth of data and
insights with respect to their current and future approach to specific grades of resins
and plastics processing methods.  Thus, the forecasts we present here for the U.S. toy
industry in general and for specific sub-markets can genuinely be regarded as industry
consensus figures.<P>



<B>CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE REPORT</B><P>

For those companies either already in or contemplating entering the materials supply
line to the toy industry, this report represents a valuable set of independent insights
into one key set of materials in common usage in a vast number of part programs -
namely, plastics.  For the main companies along the plastics supply chain - some of
them already servicing toy industry accounts and others for whom the toy industry
is still an untapped source of sales - this report represents both a comprehensive guide
to this industry and a cost-effective sales/marketing tool to respond to evolving
material requirements among the industry leaders.<P>

<B>SCOPE OF THE REPORT</B><P>

The appliance industry has grown to become a major set of
opportunities for plastics, both in this country and around the
world. BCC last looked at this marketplace back in the late
1970s. Since then plastics technologies have developed to the
point where these materials can cost-effectively replace non-
plastic materials (metals, wood, glass, et al.), and they can
also facilitate the creation of whole new appliance types made
possible by the light weight, functionality and design freedom of
plastics.<P>

The term "appliance" can be defined in a variety of ways because
appliances come in various shapes and forms, and they are used in
both residential and non-residential environments. Our focus in
this report is first and foremost on electricity-powered
appliances designed for use in the home.<P> 

Secondly, we concentrate
on functional appliances designed for use throughout the
household, and these include large and small kitchen appliances,
personal care products normally used in bathrooms and bedrooms,
portable or installed air conditioners and humidifiers that can
be used in any room, and the relatively new kitchen waste
compactors and disposers. The household units that we exclude
from our analysis here are what one might categorize as
"entertainment" appliances, that is, radios, televisions, VCRs,
electronic videos games, and so on. We also exclude lighting
fixtures (portable and installed) insofar as these units are
probably best addressed in the context of plastics in building
and construction.<P>

We also deal exclusively in this report with those appliances
manufactured in the U.S. for either domestic sale or export. Our
logic here is related to the methodology we selected to conduct
this report, and that is to consult directly with all the leading
U.S. manufacturers of large and small household appliances. It is
impossible, without research facilities in the Far East and
Europe, to cover the markets for plastics in those regions with
the same detail and accuracy as one can cover the U.S.
marketplace. Thus, even though we collected in the course of our
research program a sense of the evolving plastics preferences for
appliance parts produced outside of the U.S. and we pass along
such information in this report, our clientele are primarily U.S.
resin manufacturers, plastics processors and compounders, and
appliance OEMs. And data and insights into the U.S. market for
plastics in appliances are of the greatest relevance to these
companies.<P>

<B>METHODOLOGY OF THE REPORT</B><P>

Our approach to the objectives of identifying and quantifying the
types and amounts of plastics consumed in household appliances
(in the past, currently, and for the foreseeable future)
proceeded through the following four research stages:<P>

<UL>   I   -a thorough review of the plastics and appliance industry
        trade literature over the past few years (1987-1992)<P>
   II  -a series of consultations with officials at plastics and
        appliance industry associations<P>
   III  -a survey of over 50 U.S.-based manufacturers of large
        and small appliances<P>
   IV  -a survey of roughly 30 resin manufacturers and plastics
        processors with significant positions in the current
        plastic appliance material and part supply chain</UL><P>

Stage I provided us with a good sense of the applications within
the broadly defined appliance industry where plastics actually do
or potentially could play a role.<P> 

Stage II provided us with data
relating to the past trends in U.S. appliance production and in
plastics consumed within the appliance industry. Officials at the
Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers (AHAM) and the
Society of the Plastics Industry (SPI) were particularly helpful
in this respect. Stage III was absolutely critical in developing
accurate assessments of the evolving plastic material preferences
among the major U.S. manufacturers of large and small appliances
and the volume of plastics consumption, often on an application-
by-application basis. And then Stage IV served to confirm and
refine the quantitative and qualitative assessments drawn from
Stage III with respect to the future plastics preferences and the
future pace of growth of plastics in the household appliance
business.<P>

<B>CONTRIBUTION OF THE REPORT</B><P>

This report is actually the second part of a trilogy of reports
covering:<P>

<UL><LI> plastics in toys and outdoor playground equipment,<BR>
<LI> plastics in household appliances, and<BR>
<LI> plastics in housewares.</UL><P>

These reports (individually and collectively) offer a unique, in-depth perspective on the role of plastics in items commonly found
in the home. The report on toys and outdoor playground equipment,
published in May 1992, provided data and insights into plastics
drawn from all the leading manufacturers of these articles, and
it pointed to the opportunities ahead for plastic material
manufacturers, compounders and processors if they could meet
evolving  cost/performance parameters. Now this report offers a
detailed probing of the current plastics mind-sets among the
design engineers who are developing the household appliances of
the future. It illuminates their cost sensitivities and their
shifting performance objectives that together will determine
their eventual selections of plastics to serve as parts of their
assemblies. It also points to the actual/perceived advantages and
disadvantages of the various thermoset and thermoplastic resins
and resin blends in terms of the new economics and emerging
environmental implications of plastics utilized in all these
large and small appliances.<P>

<B>STUDY GOAL AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>

Geosynthetics continue to be a growing technology and market, with expanding applications in land reclamation, waste and hazardous waste site construction, and a variety of construction problems.  Although some of the materials have been on the market for as much as 45 years, the markets are not mature in many
ways.  There are areas for significant growth over the next 10 years, with
room for new products and competitors.  However, there are some definite
uncertainties about market penetration, profitability, particularly in
geomembranes, and some technical issues regarding materials acceptability for
some applications.  Nevertheless, many segments of the markets addressed are
less adrift in uncertainty now than 5 years ago because of new regulatory
requirements which have been put in place.<P>

For much of the diverse industry
the growth that is expected will be accelerated during the next 5 years
because of expected investment in the U.S. infrastructure.  For some of the
competitors involved in these markets, there is significant upside growth
potential through arrangements with non-U.S. competitors to distribute,
engineer, and sell materials in Europe, and throughout much of the world.  Some firms expect profitability over the next 5 years to depend on growth in
international sales due to government regulations based in part on present
U.S. environmental regulation.<P>

The present push of the new U.S. President is
to institute spending plans to accelerate roadway and public works repair.
These factors would make for faster growth than is predicted in this report,
in which rather moderate growth is forecast based on a maturing of the market.<P>


<B>REASONS FOR DOING THIS STUDY</B><P>

The present state of the industry is changing fairly rapidly.  There is an
active industry organization with good access to technical advancement.
Within the U.S., reports are generally that engineering firms often do not
have adequate engineers trained in using these materials.  With these changes
and difficulties, a technology/marketing report update is needed.<P>

This technology/marketing report, covering geotextiles, geomembranes and
geomatrices, describes the market growth, the developing technology trends,
industry leaders, and industry needs.  This study is directed toward
understanding the present and potential markets for the materials involved.
Key patents are abstracted and characteristic applications for the materials
are given.<P>

This technical marketing report on geotextiles, geomembranes, geosynthetic
clay liners, and geomatrices details several very distinct and different types
of materials, all generally referred to as geosynthetics.  The emphasis is on
the material base, structure of the industry and company involvement.
Essentially it is a market that has evolved from commodity resins and has become a specialty of its own.  Such a report, covering the three
classifications of materials, fits together quite nicely in that the
applications for the materials have a lot of overlap.  In many applications, geomembranes are used in combination with various geotextiles to stabilize the subsoil.  In certain applications geomatrices may compete where some geotextiles are used.  This BCC Business Opportunity Report addresses these problems.<P>


<B>CONTRIBUTION OF THE STUDY AND FOR WHOM</B><P>

This report will be valuable to those involved in the material supplying
business to evaluate business opportunities and technology trends, as well as those firms in the engineering end of the business, in evaluating further integration possibilities.  The report should prove useful to engineering firms to understand the state and growth of the market and to understand and react to market challenges.  BCC and the analysts involved wish to thank those companies, agencies, and university researchers who have made information available and provided other verbal information for this report.<P>


<B>SCOPE AND FORMAT</B><P>

This report divides the diverse geosynthetic industry into three parts:
geotextiles, geomembranes, and geomatrices.  The words geotextile,
geomembrane, and geomatrix are not new to most users.  The word geomembrane
should not be confused with the word membrane as commonly used with the
permeable thin film membranes of separation science.  These membranes are
distinct and are the subject of other technical/marketing reports and
newsletters.  Many of the spun-bonded or other nonwovens may appear to have
common characteristics with the materials of the same name in separation
science.  The materials for geotextiles are generally stronger, sturdier, and
applicable for much larger-scale operations than those of the filtration
industry.  The word geotextile is reserved for those materials used in
connection with "earth" and "engineering" activities.<P>

For geotextiles, also known as industrial or construction fabrics, there are
two main subsectors, the woven and the nonwoven textiles.  Geotextiles as
woven or nonwoven fabrics have applications in civil engineering such as
interfacing with soils to create reinforced structures for roads and
underlayment, or applications to enhance the hydraulic properties of soils.<P>

The major functions of geotextiles used with a soil are filtration and/or
separation.  The structure of the fabric becomes especially important in such applications as liquid filters or solid-liquid separators, including controlling the water table, as well as drainage, irrigation, and erosion control.   Vastly different applications and performance characteristics and testing procedures are related to each of the primary subsectors.  The most important uses for geotextiles are related to construction, such as roadbeds or airstrips, or in reinforcements such as soil stabilization, drainage, and erosion control.  The nonwoven geotextile market accounts for about 65% of the sales volume, estimated at $315 million in 1993.<P>

The major uses for the geomembranes or performance elastomers are in large-
volume linings, such as waste water ponds, landfills, and hazardous waste
storage pits.  What each type of material has in common is that it is used on
the ground, and it either replaces, supplements or creates a civil engineering
application.  It is usually based on synthetic organic polymers.<P>

Geosynthetic clay liners have developed as a distinct composite material
category largely over the last 5 years.  They encompass several versions of products which deliver high quality, low permeability clay (bentonite) in a user-friendly form for construction.  These materials offer technical advantages in terms of reliability in a landfill or hazardous waste impoundment, and potential savings in construction costs and in the efficiency of siting materials storage.  The materials are often specified in addition to geomembranes in construction projects.  Market demand has not yet fully developed.  Market concerns for the profitability of geomembranes could cloud the short-term profitability for geosynthetic clay liners; however, geosynthetic clay liners should experience significant long term growth.<P>

An additional part of the market is geomatrices.  These are generally 3-D materials that are used alone or with geotextiles to augment the confinements and add stability or drainage.  This is probably the most rapidly
evolving market of the three, and is the hardest to define.  For the purposes
of this report, geonets and geogrids are included in the section on
geomatrices, but that division is admittedly arbitrary.<P>

The geosynthetic industry structure is a diverse one and includes the primary
polymer manufacturers, textile companies, and rubber compounders.  In general
geosynthetics can be considered as a group to have matured to the same extent
as other specialty polymers and elastomers.  Each section includes lists of
market leaders and comments about products available, along with typical
applications.<P>

This study is directed toward accessing as completely and as fairly as
possible the present and potential markets for the materials involved.
Information for this report was collected by extensive industry contact with
people active in the use and production of polymer materials and the finished
materials, by review of technical literature, patents, computer-retrieved
information, and the author's experience with geomatric materials, especially
in the underdeveloped parts of the world.  Key portions of patents are
information can be found in greater depth, especially as related to
geomembranes in included in this report and cited where appropriate.  Other

<B>OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</B><P>

Static electricity is a natural phenomenon that affects every modern production
facility in some way or other, and in several contexts it constitutes a serious hazard
to people and products.  Insofar as it can be generated by continuous processing
equipment where speed of material throughput is essential, it must be drained off so
as not to create a shock to workers and sensitive electronic monitoring and production
equipment.  Insofar as it can affect the film used in food packaging, it can attract dust
that can contaminate the package contents.  It can also be generated in a healthcare
service context (e.g., a hospital room) where sensitive life-support monitoring
equipment is vulnerable to an electrostatic discharge (ESD) event.  And it is obviously
a critical concern in the production, storage and transportation of ammunition where
a simple static charge (spark) can prove to be catastrophic in its effects.<P>

Although static has been recognized from the very dawn of the industrial age as a
potential hazard, its most prevalent and widespread effects on productivity and
quality control have been felt in the modern microelectronics industry.  Here the
effects of unwanted static can disrupt any part of the product supply chain - from the
microelectronics component stages to the assembly stages to the use of the equipment
out in the field.  Many of today's microelectronics components can be damaged or
destroyed if exposed to charges of less than 100 volts and, for some, sensitivity to ESD
extends down to 10 volts.  And this potentially destructive effect is totally invisible;
it has to be caught by electronic monitoring equipment before it goes further down
the supply chain.  Thus, computer systems, medical diagnostic equipment, telephone
exchanges, etc. are all vulnerable to ESD.  The annual loss of output attributable to
ESD is conventionally estimated at $10 billion, and it could be even higher than this.<P>

Part of the solution to this problem of static electricity is to eliminate or limit insofar
as possible those factors in the work environment that can generate, store and
transfer static charges to ESD-sensitive equipment.  Every aspect of the workplace
must be assessed from this perspective.  The classic ESD event is a triboelectric
charge that an office worker brings into the work environment or generates on the
flooring.  If this worker subsequently comes into contact with an ESD-sensitive device
before that charge can be drained off safely to ground, there can be ESD-induced
damage.  Thus, for many years now and over the past decade in particular, the
workplace environment has been modified to reduce or eliminate this risk.<P>


Static control programs have very significant implications for plastics.  Many of the
items in the workplace are made of materials that are non-conductive in nature - that
is, unable to dissipate or transfer a static charge to ground in a controlled, predictable
manner.  Plastics (e.g., in film, foam, and rigid part configurations) and paper fall into
the category of insulative materials whereas the metals are, to varying degrees,
conductive.  In order to continue to capture the design freedom, processability and
other economic advantages of plastics, they must be modified and made neutral to
static charges.<P>

In this report we offer comprehensive coverage of the current routes to rendering
plastics antistatic, static dissipative and conductive.  We then examine the specific
applications where ESD is a primary design parameter and where plastics play a vital
role - items such as film bags to package microelectronic components, floor mats to
provide worker comfort, molded and formed materials handling containers and
accessories, wrist straps and ground cords, etc.  For each of the plastic films, sheet
and compounds utilized, we identify the leading manufacturers and discuss their
current position and likely future strategy in this market, based on our consultations.
In the same way, for each application utilizing plastics either in whole or in part, we
identify the leading manufacturers of these items and discuss their current and likely
future materials preferences (plastics and non-plastics).<P>



<B>SCOPE OF THE STUDY</B><P>

Static electricity represents a hazard in five primary markets - namely:<P>

<MENU>   - continuous processing plants<BR>
       - electronic/electrical equipment manufacturing<BR>
       - food packaging<BR>
       - healthcare services<BR>
       - military hardware and electronics.</MENU><P>

Another that is just emerging as an opportunity for antistatic plastics is automotive
fuel delivery systems where flexible fuels have to be accommodated in the future.
Whereas our analysis and summary data relate to all these fields, the majority (70
percent) of the consumption of antistatic plastic items is in the production of
commercial electronic/electrical equipment.  Therefore, we focus most of our efforts
on this segment of the business.<P>

Moreover, there are myriad actual and potential applications for static-free plastic
compounds and products.  Our analysis and data relate to all actual applications, and
we have concentrated primarily on the following:<P>

<MENU>  - film and film bags<BR>
       - flooring (tiles, mats and other flooring systems)<BR>
       - foam<BR>
       - footwear<BR>
       - gloves<BR>
       - materials handling equipment (extruded, formed and molded)<BR>
       - work surfaces<BR>
       - wrist straps</MENU><P>

In addition to exploring in detail all these applications, we have covered in detail all
the materials and methods used to render plastics antistatic or conductive, and these
include<P>

    <MENU>   - chemical antistat agents<BR>
       - conductive coatings<BR>
       - conductive fillers (carbon blacks, metallic
         particles and fibers, etc.)<BR>
       - metal coating of plastics and plastics fillers<BR>
       - radiation curing<BR>
       - topical sprays<BR>
       - others at the R&D stage.</MENU><P>

And, finally, whereas we alert our readers to data, developments and practices in this
field outside the U.S. wherever possible, the data presented here relate primarily to
U.S. markets and future trends in U.S. materials usage and product sales in volume
and value terms.<P>



<B>RESEARCH METHODOLOGY AND SOURCES</B><P>

In putting together this report we relied on four primary research sources - namely,<P>

<MENU>    - telephone interviews with industry participants<BR>
       - analysis of product literature and pricing information
 from these companies<BR>
       - a thorough review of the trade literature<BR>
       - attendance at ESD-related conferences and a review<BR>
         of proceedings from these conferences.</MENU><P>


The telephone interviews were overall the most valuable source of data and insights
into current trends in ESD theory and practice generally and into the plastics used
in static control products in particular.  We interviewed between 150-200 industry
participants in the following market segments:<P>
<DD>(a) the regulatory agencies,
<DD>(b) the associations dealing with ESD standards,<BR>
<DD>(c) the resin manufacturers and compounders producing antistatic grades of
   plastics,<BR>
<DD>(d) the antistatic/conductive additive manufacturers,<BR>
<DD>(e) the manufacturers of antistatic/conductive materials other
   than plastics,<BR>
<DD>(f) the static control product manufacturers, and<BR>
<DD>(g) a sample of static control product end-users.<P>

From all these consultations, we were able to calculate realistic quantitative estimates
by material and by product and to refine our understanding of the evolving
dynamics/terminology of this business, in terms of standards and testing, materials
and product design.<P>


<B>CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE STUDY</B><P>

This study is designed to assist companies already in or contemplating entering the
static control product business, either from a material or product standpoint.
Although the emphasis is on plastics, the analysis at all points considers the
competition to plastics - from paper, metals, rubber, etc.  The estimates that we put
forward are distillations of data generated and/or views held by key industry
participants.<P>

There has been a good deal of recent "hype" regarding the current and future size of
the static control product business.  Our remit was to provide a candid, comprehensive
and clear assessment of where this business is as of 1991, and where and how fast it
is likely to grow over the medium-term future (out to 1996).  As such, it should be a
valuable input to companies already in this marketplace and to those contemplating
entry into this business.<P>


<B>RELATED BCC STUDIES</B><P>

BCC has covered the field of plastics and non-plastic materials in the fields of ESD,
EMI/RFI shielding and electronics in general for many years in its multi-client
reports.  A sample of these studies includes the following:<P>

<B>CONTEXT OF REPORT</B><P>

BCC has covered the production of large plastic parts several
times in the past, but in each instance it has been focused on
the application.  In this report we have examined the methods of
producing hollow plastic parts.  Parts such as automobile fuel
tanks, underground chemical storage tanks, pressure vessels,
drums, and many others fall into the scope of this report.  Blow-
molded plastic bottles (less than 2 gallons in size) are
excluded, while larger carboys are included.  The report look
most closely at three processing methods:<P>

                Blow Molding
                Rotational Molding
                Filament Winding<P>

While the majority of hollow plastic parts are produced using
these three methods, some injection molding, reaction injection
molding, structural foam molding, and others are used in specific
applications.  They are discussed, but not in detail.  The report
also looks at the soluble core processing method that is a
direct, more economical replacement for the lost core process.<P>

Each of the processes is competitive in that they are all methods
of producing hollow plastic parts.  However, there seems to be
very little direct competition in the marketplace.  Each process
offers distinct advantages over the other, whether it be in the
types of materials that can be used, the kind and cost of
machinery, or the cost economics of differing volume production
runs.<P>

Have improved processing methods allowed plastics to replace
other materials in holow part programs?<P>


<B>METHODOLOGY OF THE REPORT</B><P>

BCC has once again surveyed the range of plastics processors in
order to develop realistic estimates of the use of plastics in
the production of hollow parts.  We initially referenced all the
relevant literature and company reports/releases dealing with the
resins, machinery and designs used to manufacture hollow plastic
parts.  We followed up this stage by reviewing the recent patents
on materials and processing methods.  We then consulted with
officials at leading companies and small businesses as well, at
every stage of the production of a hollow plastic part such as:<P>

                resin manufacturers
                machinery manufacturers
                captive and custom molders
                hollow part end-users.<P>

We also consulted with associations dealing with the different
processing methods and applications.<P>


<B>CONTRIBUTIONS OF THIS REPORT</B><P>

As in previous BCC reports on plastics processing, this report
will be a valuable input for those companies active in the field
of selling (or contemplating selling) materials and machinery in
the market for hollow plastic parts.  It will also be very useful
to those companies already processing plastics to make hollow
parts.<P>


<B>PREVIOUS BCC RELATED REPORTS</B><P>

BCC has published several recent reports that cover the whole
range of plastics processing methods for both packaging and non-
packaging applications.  Among them are the following:<P>

    P-078  "Large Molded Parts: Competing Processes and Markets"
    P-029X "Blow-Molded Plastic Bottles"
    P-077R "The Rigid Container Business"SUMMARY<P>

<B>STUDY OBJECTIVES</B><P>

This report provides an analysis of the impact that degradable
plastic products will have in helping solve the problem of
disposing of post-consumer plastic waste.  We believe that it is
within this context that the strategic importance of degradable
plastics can best be appreciated.  Hence, the study looks at the
present and future status of the degradable plastics industry.  It
probes the present and future demand and supply levels of various
types of degradable plastics, the technological difficulties now
encountered, and the breakthroughs foreseen.  The report also
identifies the major producers and their strategies, as well as the
end-uses for degradable plastic products.<P>



<B>REASONS FOR DOING THE STUDY</B><P>



At the onset of the environmental movement a few short years ago,
degradable plastic products were seen as a panacea for the disposal
of post-consumer plastic waste.  How better to deal with plastic
refuse than to have it disappear into thin air!  This enthusiasm
brought about a flurry of activity.  However, over-enthusiastic
manufacturers of diapers, grocery and trash bags ended up promising
more than they could deliver.  The very concept of degradability
quickly became mired in confusion.  Misleading claims led to legal
actions.  Today, whenever degradable plastic products are mentioned, consumers are more likely to express a healthy dose of
skepticism than all-out enthusiasm.<P>


Nevertheless, scientific research into this important area of
plastics technology is going forward.  New approaches, new
products, and an increasing number of manufacturers and converters
have joined the ranks of the pioneers.  Today, the industry is
alive, and new developments promise further, if not guaranteed,
growth.  It is appropriate, therefore, that we take a comprehensive
look at these new findings and new products and assess expectations
over the next ten years.<P>


Another reason for doing this study is the need to emphasize
degradability as one of several solutions to our waste disposal
problems.  For example, we all know by now that the success of the
Plastics Industry during the last 15 years has been overwhelming.
Sales and production of virgin resins have increased at a record
pace, and few markets have remained untouched by the onslaught of
new plastic products.<P>


The flip side of that success is the volume of plastic products now
being discarded every year.  The volume of post-consumer plastic
waste is building up rapidly.  Given the increased level of
environmental awareness and the alleged decline in landfill
capacity, alternate solutions have to be found to dispose of this
rapidly accumulating tonnage of waste.<P>


Among the various solutions offered, incineration and recycling
appear to be the most promising on technological and economic
grounds.  Incineration, unfortunately, is proving unacceptable on
environmental grounds.  It has also become obvious that recycling
alone will not be sufficient to handle all of the post-consumer
plastic waste expected over the next decade.  According to our own
estimates (see BCC reports P-125, The Secondary Recycling Plastics
Business, and P-132, Technology of Plastic Waste Recycling), by
the year 2000 we are expected to recycle less than 6 billion pounds
of HDPE, PET, LDPE, etc.   That will represent a mere 7% of
the total stock of post-consumer plastic waste expected that year.
The other 93% (more than 50 billion pounds) will still
continue to be discarded in landfills unless another solution can
be found.<P>


It is the contention of this report that, over the next 10 years,
degradable plastics will begin playing a crucial role in helping
solve our waste disposal problems.<P>



<B>CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE STUDY</B><P>

This report will prove most useful to all those actively involved
in trying to find solutions to the disposal of post-consumer
plastic waste.  More particularly, recyclers, composters, incinerators, and manufacturers of degradable resins, additives, and other
degradable products should benefit from our analysis.  These
professionals will find in this report a one-stop source of
information on the present and future status of an increasingly
important segment of the plastics industry which has had its image
tarnished but is also making a strong comeback.<P>


<B>SCOPE AND FORMAT</B><P>

The study is limited to three main areas-namely, the biodegradability and photodegradability of synthetic resins and the
degradability of natural plastics.  By concentrating on those three
major topics, we are better able to provide a more comprehensive
coverage of both recent and expected future developments.<P>



<B>INFORMATION SOURCES</B><P>



This study could not have been completed without the input of the
large number of scientists and manufacturers that we contacted.
Their insights have proved to be extremely valuable, and we thank
them for their contribution.  We must emphasize, nevertheless, that
the conclusions reached are our own, and we are solely responsible
for the views expressed in the report.  We have also made use of
the voluminous literature published in trade and scientific
journals.  Research on degradability is expanding if we can judge
by the number of scientific papers published on that topic.<P>

<B>STUDY GOALS AND OBJECTIVES</B>


<P>BCC's last study devoted to the plastics foam industry, published
in 1990, characterized the raw materials, foams, markets,
technologies and the key companies at each level of foam
fabrication and consumption.  In the interim three-year period a
great deal has occurred in terms of environmental factors that
already are affecting not only the overall markets for foam
products but also the market shares of individual foam-grade
resins.  These issues relate to solid waste (e.g., recycling),
consumer safety (e.g., flammability) and atmospheric protection
(e.g., ozone-depletion/global warming).  We are now able to discuss
those issues in greater detail and apply demand forecasts based on
a better understanding as to what level of impact these
environmental issues have on foam consumption.</P>

<B>SCOPE AND FORMAT</B>

<P>This study deals with the rigid and flexible foams employed for
their insulative and cushioning properties in a variety of major
markets, such as transportation, building and construction,
packaging, electrical/electronics, appliances and home products
(e.g., bedding, furniture and rug underlay).  In addition, we have
included structural foam products which compete against traditional
molded plastics due to their cost/performance advantages.</P>

<P>The demand data presented are supported by market trends, affected
not only by conventional market factors such as pricing,
intermaterial competition and industry macroeconomics but also the
environmental issues of recycling, flammability and ozone
depletion/global warming, which have become accepted factors in
determining material usage.  Current and forecast demand data are
presented for the years 1990, 1992, 1993 and 1998.  These data
points represent the most accurate description of the current
demand situation, and provide an insight into the short-term growth
that can be expected.  For most of the data tables, five-year
average annual growth rates are calculated for the period 1993-
1998.  In some cases, growth rates are calculated for the eight-
year period from 1990-1998.</P>

<B>METHODOLOGY</B>

<P>The research for this study included personal contacts with key
participants among the users of foam products in all markets, resin
suppliers, suppliers of foam systems, foam molders and raw material
suppliers.  The information gathered from these primary sources
formed the basis for our estimates of current resin usage in foam
markets.  Their forecasts for future demand of resin and product
were merged with our analysis of industry trends and the
probabilities of resin consumption to meet future demand.  Our
final analyses and projections are based on a combination of a
consensus among the primary contacts and our understanding of the
impact of trends from an historical perspective.</P>

<P>In addition, we reviewed secondary sources of information such as
trade publications, trade associations, company literature,
industry conferences and on-line databases to supplement our
understanding of the markets, applications and trends affecting the
resins used in portable electronics devices.  Data from government
sources yielded information on the macroeconomic trends in the
relevant industries.  Also, the analyses of environmental issues
impacting on foam markets are based on legislative- and regulatory-
type information gathered from governmental agencies at the
national, state and local levels.  Finally, trends and technologies
of foam  products outside the United States are reviewed to
demonstrate foreign influence on the U.S. foam industry.</P>

<B>CONTRIBUTION OF THE STUDY</B>

<P>The foam industry is a major segment of the U.S. plastics industry,
accounting for 5-10% of resin consumption.  Foams offer insulative
and cushioning characteristics to industrial and consumer products,
which contribute not only to energy conservation and protective
shipping but also to source reduction (i.e., less material that
ultimately is added to the wastestream) and lower manufacturing
costs.</P>

<P>Prior to the 1990s, the plastics industry had only marginal effects
from environmental issues.  This study was commissioned not only to
review new foam materials and technologies developed since the
earlier study but also to provide companies participating in the
foam industry with an analysis of the level of impact from
environmental issues.  The study can be useful, as well, to
financial institutions and venture capitalists interested in
emerging technologies with large growth potential, and to foreign-
based companies seeking to understand the dynamics of U.S. foam
markets in an atmosphere of anti-plastics legislation and
government regulation.</P>

<B>RELATED BCC STUDIES</B>

<P>BCC traditionally has followed the various industries in which
plastics resins are consumed.  These studies typically cover
plastics demand and performance criteria, competing materials,
relevant technologies, major players, market trends and government
legislative and regulatory impact on plastics.  There are several
recently-published studies, cited below, which deal with some
aspect of the technologies, materials and markets for foam
products.</P>

<B>STUDY GOALS AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>



In the slightly more than two years since BCC's last study on the
polymeric foams industry, significant changes continue  to  occur
in  this  major segment of the plastics production and processing
industry.<P>


Products  and  markets change as technology and  society  change.
Polymer   foams  find  their  primary  applications  in  consumer
products,  such  as  cushioning for  furniture  and  automobiles,
thermal  insulation for construction and packaging,  and  similar
end uses which are driven by the business cycle.<P>

Most  of  the  markets for plastic foams are the same  ones  that
existed  a  few years ago; however, there are a couple of  faster
growing  newer  markets, such as expanded polypropylene  foam  in
auto  bumpers and foamed PVC in house siding, windows/doors,  and
other construction shapes.<P>

Polymers  are foamed for reasons of cost and performance.  Foamed
plastics are lighter than non-foamed articles made from the  same
resin,  and therefore require less resin and achieve lower costs.
Equally  or more important, foamed plastics have properties  that
are  not  attainable  with non-foamed ones.  The  insulating  and
cushioning  qualities of the gas bubbles in a foamed article  are
obvious  attributes, but less obvious is the fact that  a  foamed
article  is  often  stronger  than its  non-foamed  analog.  Thus
structural shapes and forms, such as piping and wall siding,  can
be stronger when foamed.<P>

What  has driven these markets in this decade and caused the most
significant changes have been environmental and public perception
issues.  Environmental issues include:<P>

   -  Consumer  safety issues, ranging from fire  resistance  and
flammability  to  concerns  over the use  of  plastic  which  are
claimed   (almost  always  erroneously)  to  be  health   hazards
(especially carcinogens).<P>

   -  Solid waste disposal and recycling, a continuing public and
political "hot button" of the 1990s.<P>

   - Atmospheric protection, caused by concerns and actions taken
regarding   blowing  agents  used  to  produce  foamed
plastics.<P>
Because  of  concerns  over the earth's ozone  layer  and  global
warming,  chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) have been banned  and  their
first  group of replacements, HCFCs, are also planned for  phase
out  early  in  the  next century.  Volatile hydrocarbon  blowing
agents are under increased control as air polluting VOCs.<P>
Our  goal  is to describe the most common and popular  commercial
polymeric   foams  and  their  applications,  their   technology,
competing  plastic and foams and those made from other materials,
and  future trends.  We estimate and forecast markets for plastic
foams of several kinds, in many different important markets  such
as construction, transportation, and packaging.  The polymers and
applications that we cover are discussed below in "Scope."<P>


<B>REASONS FOR DOING THE STUDY</B><P>

Polymer  foams touch our lives every day, in unseen  applications
such  as  the insulating sheathing on our houses and  inside  our
refrigerators,  and in visible end uses such as the  foamed  seat
cushion  and the polystyrene "hot cup" used for fast food coffee.
These products are important items in the economy, and because of
the  environmental issues noted above, represent  an  interesting
dynamic of the American society in the 1990s.<P>

The  plastic  foam industry is a major segment  of  the  American
plastics  industry, accounting for about 10% of  total  commodity
resin  consumption.   Foamed products, such  as  those  used  for
insulation and protective shipping, reduce energy consumption and
product damage, and thus lead to lower manufacturing costs,  less
waste, and other good results.<P>

BCC performed this study to provide a comprehensive reference for
those  interested and/or involved in these products;  this  is  a
wide  and varied group of chemical and other companies that  make
and use polymer foams, process technology and equipment designers
and  marketers,  politicians  of all  stripes,  and  the  general
public. We have sorted through and condensed information  from  a
large  amount  of  literature and other  reference  materials  to
compile this report.<P>


<B>CONTRIBUTION OF THE STUDY AND FOR WHOM</B><P>

This  report  is  intended to assist those  involved  in  several
different segments of the U.S. industrial and commercial business
sectors,  primarily  those  whose main  interest  is  in  thermal
insulation  (construction, appliances,  and  the  like),  comfort
cushioning    (furniture,   auto   seats,   and   other    uses),
transportation  (other  automotive  parts  such   as   protective
cushioning, bumpers, and other parts), and packaging.<P>

These organizations and people include those who are involved  in
the  development,  formulation, manufacture,  sale,  and  use  of
foamed  polymers  and  polymer foaming processes,  and  ancillary
businesses  such  as processing equipment, additives,  and  other
support  chemicals  and  equipment.  These  include  process  and
product  development  experts,  process  and  product  designers,
purchasing  agents, construction and operating personnel,  market
staff, and top management. BCC feels that this report will be  of
great  value to technical and business personnel in the following
areas, among others:<P>

  - Marketing and management personnel in companies that produce,
market, and sell polymeric foams.<P>

   - Companies involved in the design and construction of process
plants  which manufacture polymeric foams and those that  service
these plants.<P>
   -  Companies  that  supply  chemicals,  equipment,  and  other
materials to plastic foam producers and users.<P>
    -  Basic  research  personnel  in  academia,  goverment,  and
industry.<P>
  - Financial institutions that supply money for such facilities,
including  banks,  merchant  bankers,  venture  capitalists,  and
others.   Such  institutions need to identify and know  areas  of
potential trouble as well.<P>

   - Personnel in end-user companies and industries; these are  a
wide  ranging  group  of  companies in industries  as  varied  as
automobile manufacturing and healthcare products packaging.<P>

   -  Personnel in  government at many levels, not  only  at  the
federal level (such as the federal EPA), but also state and local
health,  environmental, and other regulators who  must  implement
and enforce the laws regarding public health and safety.<P>


<B>SCOPE AND FORMAT</B><P>

This  BCC  study  covers  in depth many  of  the  most  important
technological,    economic,    political,    and    environmental
considerations  in  the  U.S. polymeric foams  industry.   It  is
primarily  a  study of U.S. markets, but because  of  the  global
nature  of  polymer and packaging chemistry it  touches  on  some
noteworthy  international activities; these are  primarily  those
that   can   have   an  impact  on  the  U.S.  market   such   as
imports/exports and foreign firms which operate here.<P>

All market figures are rounded to the nearest million pounds, and
all  growth  rates  are compounded (signified as  average  annual
growth  rates  or AAGRs). Because of this rounding,  some  growth
rates  may  not agree exactly with figures in the market  tables.
All market figures are at the manufacturer's or producer's
level.<P>

This  report in segmented into 10 sections, of which this is  the
first.<P>

Section  II,  Summary, encapsulates our findings and conclusions,
and  includes summary major market tables.  It is the place where
the  busy  executive can find the major findings of the study  in
summary format.<P>

Section  III  is  an overview to the industry, starting  with  an
introduction to the petrochemical industry that is the source  of
polymers, and the plastic resin industries which make the  resins
that  go  into  polymer foams. We introduce polymeric  foams  and
discuss each of the major foamed plastics and its principal  foam
structure.   We  end  with a discussion of  some  competing  foam
materials. Our intent in this section is to introduce the  reader
to the field of polymers and foamed plastics and foam
structures.<P>

Section IV discusses and forecasts markets for foamed plastics by
material  types.  These include three classes of major  commodity
resins  used  to  produce  foams: polyolefins,  polystyrene,  and
polyvinyl chloride. We focus on the largest foamed polymer group,
the  polyurethanes (PURs). We also include some  specialty  foams
such  as  phenolics and structural foams, and  also  analyze  and
forecast  markets  for plastic foam blowing agents  and  PUR  raw
materials.<P>

We  start  this  section  with our overall  market  analysis  and
forecast  for the major types of polymeric foams, for  base  year
1995  and  forecast  year  2000.  Then,  in  each  subsection  we
describe  each type of foam in more detail, discuss its important
applications, and forecast its market in more detail.<P>

Section  V  discusses and forecasts the markets by  polymer  foam
application. We have categorized applications into seven specific
major   groups:   appliances  (primarily   thermal   insulation),
building/construction    (primarily    insulation     and     PVC
profiles/shapes), electrical/electronics (with the largest market
in acoustical and noise control foams), furniture and furnishings
(mainly  comfort  cushioning),  medical  applications,  packaging
(both  functional  and  product protection),  and  transportation
(primarily cushioning). We end with a group of other applications
ranging from sports equipment to shoe insoles and powder puffs.<P>

Section  VI is devoted to technologies, starting with some  basic
polymer  chemistry, manufacture, and properties of plastics  used
in  producing  plastic  foams. We  go  on  to  conventional  foam
technologies.   We then cover some new polymer foam technologies,
including   new   blowing  agents  and  polyol  technology,   and
microcellular  foams.   We  end  with  a  discussion  of  polymer
recycling technology.<P>

Section VII covers the structure of the polymeric foams industry,
with  emphasis on the major domestic producers and suppliers  and
trends  in  the  industry.  We briefly discuss and  analyze  some
international  aspects  of  the business,  including  the  global
nature  of  the business, major foreign owned supplier  companies
which operate in the United States, and trends outside the United
States.<P>

Section VIII covers environmental, regulatory, and public  policy
issues,  items  of  increasing importance to  the  polymer  foams
industry.   Environmental considerations rate the  most  emphasis
because  of  the  rapid  change in blowing agent  technology  and
markets, health and safety, and waste disposal/recycling.<P>

Section  IX  consists of profiles of some 80  supplier  companies
which  BCC  considers to be among the most important and/or  best
representatives of this business.<P>

Section  X  is a glossary of some important terms, abbreviations,
acronyms,  etc. used in the chemical, polymer, and polymer  foams
industries.<P>

Some topics and materials covered in the text of this report  are
not  included  in our market forecast tables. A good  example  is
microcellular  foams,  an  exciting but  not  yet  commercialized
technology.  We include these for completeness; however, they are
either really outside the market scope of this study, or are  too
new to have yet developed a measurable commercial market.<P>


<B>METHODOLOGY AND INFORMATION SOURCES</B><P>

Searches  were  made  of the literature, including  many  of  the
leading  trade  publications, as well as technical compendia  and
government  publications.  Product  and  market  information  was
obtained  whenever  possible  from the  companies  involved.  The
information  for  our corporate profiles was  obtained  primarily
from  the companies, especially the larger publicly owned  firms.
Other sources included directories and articles.<P>

<B>STUDY GOALS AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>

The objective of this study is to analyze current and future markets for medical 
plastics _ excluding medical packaging.<P>


<B>REASONS FOR DOING STUDY</B><P>

Plastics usage in the healthcare field encompasses several distinct markets_
predominantly applications for medical devices and related products and 
packaging.  Market research studies in the past have often combined these two 
applications which does not benefit companies exclusively involved in medical 
devices or medical packaging.<P>

This study will cover plastics usage in medical devices which have sustained 
annual growth rates far in excess of  the Gross Domestic  Product (GDP) .  The 
obvious aging of the U.S. population, continuing cost reduction pressures in the 
healthcare field, advances in polymer performance, introduction of new and 
often life-saving devices and the ever- present 
environmental/disposable/nondisposable medical device triad warrant an in-
depth study as we enter the second half of the 1990s.<P> 

<B>SCOPE AND FORMAT</B><P>

This report will follow a similar scope and format to BCC's P-121 "Plastics in 
Non-Packaging Medical Applications," published in March 1990.  All industry 
and market information will be updated and more definitive and detailed 
market estimates will be provided.<P>

Advances in polymer technology, new types of medical  devices, the changing 
resin producer scenario, impact of government agencies, sterilization techniques 
and medical plastics product lines and trade named products are some of the 
topics that are covered.<P>


<B>METHODOLOGY</B><P>

An extensive review was undertaken of trade and technical literature on plastics 
use in medical devices.  Following the collection and analysis of this data, in-
depth interviews were completed with polymer producers, compounders and 
medical device manufacturers.  Dollar values are in 1996 dollars.  The word  
"millions" is often abbreviated as "MM".  Growth rates are annually compounded 
and trade named products appear in upper case letters.  All tables not sourced 
"BCC" were extracted from a variety of trade literature.<P>

<B>STUDY GOALS AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>

The hose and tubing industry is a moderately large and broad-based sector of the North American economy and it serves many masters.  The industry can be logically separated into three hose sectors:  automotive hose, general 
industrial hose, and hydraulic hose; and two tubing sectors:  industrial 
tubing and medical tubing.  Each of these sectors contains several 
subcategories. Demand within all sectors, with the exception of medical 
tubing, ebbs and flows with the health of the national economy.<P> 

Hose and tubing fabrication methods have become more or less standardized, 
with the major producers achieving comparable levels of efficiency. Quality 
control measures have been and are continuing to be upgraded to meet 
International Standards Organization (ISO) standards, to reduce rejection 
rates and to ensure against product liability claims.  Manufacturers work 
closely with compounders and producers of resins and elastomers to introduce 
improved hose and tubing materials.<P> 

Regulatory and environmental standards are pushing the limits of available 
product capabilities, especially in the motor vehicle sector.  Certain 
materials are gaining share at the expense of others as the entire industry 
adapts to these new demands.<P> 

In that resins and elastomers are integral to describing this industry, this 
report contains a detailed description and analysis of each of the major 
resins used in hose and tubing applications.<P> 

It provides the reader with a comprehensive understanding of the markets for 
hose and tubing in North America and of the major raw materials employed.  It 
gives an accurate bearing on where the industry is heading as we move into the 
latter part of this decade.<P> 

This report:<P>

          for the years 1988 and 1993, and provides a forecast of
          volume and value for the year 1998<P>

<LI>         Analyzes the primary competitive markets and determines
          market share held by competing manufacturers within each
          market and in subsectors within those markets<P>

   <LI>      Describes the primary types of hose and tubing materials
          and identifies the specific resins, elastomers and
          thermoplastic elastomers employed in each market and
          market subsector<P>

  <LI>       Analyzes the current and historical volume and value of
          shipments for each type of hose and tubing material in
          each market category and makes a forecast for the year
          1998<P>

          concerns

<LI>         Profiles the most important producers of hose and tubing
          products.<P>


<b>REASONS FOR THIS STUDY</B><P>

Important changes have occurred within this industry in recent years and the 
pace of change will likely quicken as environmental and regulatory 
requirements continue to tighten.  Competition for market share is keen within 
all hose and tubing sectors, and capacity use remains low in some sectors in 
spite of strong demand. Repositioning and new product introductions within 
certain high performance sectors are especially active.   The development of 
novel technologies has enabled certain producers to gain an edge while 
improvements in manufacturing economies have aided others.<P> 

On the raw material side, demand has recovered significantly but plenty of 
capacity is in place.  Prices, which held relatively static for the prior five 
years, began to rapidly escalate in late 1993 and 1994.  Use of thermoplastic 
elastomers is climbing in all markets at the expense of traditional materials, 
and high performance thermoplastics such as nylons and fluorocarbons are 
growing as quality and longevity win out over economy.<P> 

The participants in this industry need to be acutely aware of these 
developments to intelligently plan for the future.  This report brings these 
factors into focus and provides manufacturers, distributors, users, and raw 
material suppliers with the knowledge needed to make informed decisions 
relating to investment, procurement and material selection.<P> 


<b>CONTRIBUTIONS OF THIS STUDY AND FOR WHOM</B><P>

This report provides up-to-date technical and market information concerning 
the manufacture, distribution, regulation and shipments of hose and tubing.  
It also provides historical and forecast data on the volume and value of the 
elastomers and resins used as the raw materials for hoses and tubing and 
describes the competitive environment surrounding the industry.  It shows the 
market share held by the important producers in each major market segment and 
profiles the most important companies.  It is intended to inform producers and 
distributors of hoses and tubing and their raw material suppliers, as well as 
users of hoses and tubing and other parties interested in this multifaceted 
industry.<P> 


<b>SCOPE AND FORMAT</B><P>

The scope of this report is North America with a strong emphasis on the U.S.  
The important types of hose and tube are differentiated into rubber, 
thermoplastic, and thermoplastic elastomer, according to the elastomer or 
resin used. Much emphasis is placed on the analysis of hose and tube markets 
and hose and tube materials.<P> 

We have not included metal tubing in this report.  Metal tubing is used 
primarily in markets where plastic and rubber are simply inappropriate, such 
as air-conditioning and refrigeration condensers.  There is an overlap in 
certain applications and we make note of these when appropriate throughout the 
report. Hydraulics is an example of a sector where metal tubing competes with 
plastic and rubber hose; and the semiconductor where metal tubing competes 
with plastic and rubber hose; and the semiconductor and pneumatic control 
industries exemplify applications where metal tubing competes with 
thermoplastic and TPE-based tubing.<P>

Metal tubing continues to be displaced by 
rubber and plastic materials.  The rate of conversion has slowed quite 
dramatically in sectors such as hydraulics but remains very strong in the 
semiconductor sector.  We comment on those market segments where metal tubing 
is competitive and offer some insight into the importance of the specific use 
as it relates to volume gain or loss to rubber and plastic hose and tubing.<P> 


<b>METHODOLOGY</B><P>

The extensive research capabilities of the BCC staff were accessed to analyze 
markets, consumption trends and supply and demand.  New technologies, market 
developments and present and future trends were identified through patent and 
literature searches and discussions with key industry sources.  Current 
regulatory and environmental issues were ascertained through discussions with 
industry sources, relevant agencies and literature searches. Manufacturing 
methods, process economics, international trade statistics and major 
influences on the industry were derived from discussions with a wide range of 
industry and government sources.<P> 


<b>INFORMATION SOURCES</B><P>

This report is an analysis and summation of interviews with hundreds of key 
industry officials, trade association representatives, consultants, users of 
hose and tubing, and governmental personnel.  Statistics on shipments were 
obtained from the U.S. Department of Commerce and from industry trade 
association sources.<P>

<B>STUDY GOALS & OBJECTIVES</B>
<P>
The objective of this study is to provide a canvass of the
markets for plastics and rubber.  This involves determining the
size of the current market and also reviewing developmental
applications.</P>


<B>REASONS FOR DOING THE STUDY</B>
<P>
The primary reasons BCC conducted an under-the-hood parts study
was to clarify the many developments in the market of plastics
and rubber materials, and to establish a professional guide to
understanding the use of plastics and rubber in these kinds of
applications.</P>


<B>CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE STUDY</B>

<P>The present under-the-hood parts study is an accurate,
informative document for all those working in under-the-hood
applications.  Of particular value are the market statistics
presented in the study which should assist development, product
and market managers to understand the size and nature of the
market, both in plastics and rubber.</P>

<P>The report also provides research trends and data which will
assist the R&D community.

<P>It is especially valuable to companies which are already selling
to the under-the-hood market, and to those which want to market
new products.  Producers of most rubbers and a wide array of
plastics will find the report a valuable marketing tool.
</P>

<B>SCOPE & FORMAT</B>

<P>The report includes information on all under-the-hood rubber and
plastic products.  With rubbers, markets have been broken down
into hose and tubing, seals and gaskets, belting, wire and
cable, engine mounts and mechanical goods. Plastics are divided
into developmental and established uses.  Established uses such
as battery cases, ducting, reservoirs, fan shrouds and
electrical housings are covered.  In developmental applications,
the report includes throttle bodies, oil pans,  intake
manifolds, fuel rails and fuel system parts (such as fuel sender
modules and fuel line tubing).

<P>The report is presented in four sections.  Section I offers an
overview of the industry with definitions and key problems.
Overall statistics are also presented.  Section II encompasses
a review of rubber parts with separate market sections for each
of the applications mentioned above.  In Section III, plastic
and composite parts are described with a strong emphasis on
developmental plastics.  Finally, in Section IV, descriptions of
raw material and testing are presented in line with the
characteristics of the market.

<P>The report is based on both qualitative and quantitative market
research.  Approximately 150 primary research calls were made to
all quarters of the industry including elastomer and resin
suppliers, as well as molders and end-users.  An extensive
literature research also was conducted to produce a report with
both marketing and research information.

<B>STUDY OBJECTIVES</B><P>

This report provides a comprehensive study of the present and
future recycling rates for various plastic resin markets.  It
analyzes, in detail, the stock of plastic material available for
recycling, by types of plastic resin and by life expectancy
groups.  Those stock estimates are compared to the amounts of
plastic resin being recycled and recycling rates are derived.
Forecasts for stocks, amounts to be recycled and recycling rates
are provided through the year 2000.  The report also identifies
the most important recyclers and their productive capacity.  It
focuses on the technological problems encountered and the
breakthroughs recorded and expected.  Other topics covered include
the end-use markets for the recycled resins and the financial
considerations affecting present and future recycling efforts.<P>



<B>REASONS FOR DOING THE STUDY</B><P>



In 1990, plastic resin sales in the U.S. totaled 61.5 billion
pounds, 5.5 per cent more than in 1989.  Between 1979 and 1990,
plastic resin sales more than doubled, placing the plastics
industry among the top industrial performers of the decade.  Yet,
the plastics industry has been unable to rest on its laurels.  For
the last three years, it has been embroiled in an environmental
controversy threatening both its future rate of growth and its
ability to compete effectively against alternative materials.<P>


Concerned consumers have become acutely aware of the severity of
the waste disposal problems facing their communities.  For reasons
that remain mostly unclear, plastic products, especially plastic
packaging products, are perceived as major contributors to those
problems.  In the process, legislators are constantly being
pressured to enact a wide ranging number of laws restricting
either the sale or the uses of plastic products, especially
packaging products.<P>


Most of those worries seem to be misplaced, however.  So far,
scientific evidence has shown that plastic products are not major
contributors to our waste disposal problems.  At most, plastic
products make up only 18 per cent of our landfills when waste is
measured by volume and maybe as little as 7 per cent to 8 per cent
when it is measured by weight.  In contrast, paper and paperboard
products contribute more than 5 times that level in terms of
weight and more than twice in terms of volume.<P>


Regardless, the plastics industry has taken note of the criticisms
directed at its products and it has reacted positively.  In a
previous report on the plastics and paper bag markets (The
Changing Bag Markets: Highlighting Intermaterials Competitions,
BCC Report #P-082), we described at length the achievements of the
plastics industry and its efforts to introduce degradable bags.
More promising, however, are the recycling efforts of the plastics
industry.  In the last two years alone, there has been a virtual
avalanche of new recycling projects started across the country.
So far, efforts have concentrated on the collection, sorting and
recycling of plastic packaging material, especially soft drink PET
bottles and HDPE milk and HIC bottles.  Efforts are also under way
to recycle other plastic products such as T-shirt bags, film and
polystyrene containers.  Little is being done, however, to recycle
durable and semi-durable products such as toys and household
appliances.<P>


Markets for recycled resins continue to be developed.  The most
promising new developments focus on utilizing recycled pellets to
make the same products that were recycled.  This is known as
"closing the loop."  By the end of this decade, we believe that a
large range of plastic containers and a host of other non-
packaging plastic products, regardless of resins, will contain
some fraction of recycled resins in their structure.  Some of the
recycled pellets will compete with virgin resins for a share of
the markets.<P>


It is therefore important, at this stage of development, to take a
close look at what is being done, in which area and by whom.  We
also need to look at the opportunities faced by this young
industry as well as at the drawbacks that may hamper its future
growth.  We need to address the financial problems encountered and
the opportunities that are developing.<P>



<B>CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE STUDY</B><P>



This report hopes to emphasize two sets of problems: the growing
stock of non-packaging recyclable material during the 1990s and
the low recycling rate of this type of plastic material.  The
report also highlights the limits and opportunities of present and
future recycling efforts.<P>

To achieve our objectives, we focus on the recycling rate.  We
first calculate, for each type of resin, how many pounds of resins
are available for recycling and compare those estimates to the
number of pounds of plastic resin that are actually being
recycled.  We also look into such questions as who the main
players are, how profitable recycling is, and what is being
manufactured with those recycled resins.<P>


By performing this analysis, we are better able to evaluate the
future of the recycling industry and its role within the broader
context of the plastics industry itself.<P>



<B>SCOPE AND FORMAT</B><P>



This study is limited to those plastic products that are being or
will shortly be recycled.  As such, we will study the following
resins: high density polyethylene (HDPE), polystyrene (PS),
polyvinyl chloride (PVC), low density polyethylene (LDPE),
polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polypropylene (PP).<P>


In the first section of the report, we review some of the most
important issues concerning the future of the plastic recycling
efforts.  We analyze, for example, the role of plastics in
landfills, the legal climate facing both the plastic resin
manufacturers and the sales of plastic products, and the
technological problems that need to be resolved by recyclers.<P>


In the following sections, we focus on individual resins.  For
each one, we define three groups of recyclable stocks and compare
those estimates to the amounts of resin being recycled to derive a
recycling rate. We tackle such issues as the collection, sorting
and processing difficulties hampering recycling efforts.  We
identify the major recyclers and their productive capacity.  We
also look into the economics of recycling and the end-use products
for recycled resins.  For each resin, we also provide long-term
recycling rate forecasts.<P>


<B>INFORMATION SOURCES</B><P>



This study relies heavily on two types of inputs.  First, we
obtained important insights from our discussions with a large
number of company officials, both in the marketing and technical
areas, involved in the recycling of plastic products.  Second, we
also benefited from the scientific and business literature that is
rapidly becoming available.  The recycling of plastic products is
being studied not only by the technical departments of plastics
companies themselves but by a host of other interested parties
such as university research laboratories, environmentalist groups,
municipal services departments in charge of waste management and
industry trade organizations.  We have incorporated the
contributions of the various groups that have been most generous
in sharing with us their concern and extensive knowledge.<P>

<B>BACKGROUND</B><P>

This report deals with the solid waste management issues,
especially recycling, which have had (and will continue to have) a
significant impact on the materials used in packaging, the manner
in which they are processed, packaging forms, and the markets for
plastic packaging.  It discusses in detail the attempts by all
participants in the packaging market to provide packaging that
satisfies consumer demands for environmentally-friendly products
while remaining cost-effective.  It reviews food and non-food
flexible and rigid packaging forms and the major markets that these
products serve.  Specific packaging forms such as bags, liners,
coatings, bottles, cups, closures, etc. and the markets they serve
are discussed in detail.<P>

The analyses in this report are specific to the plastics packaging
market and do not deal with the collection, identification,
separation, and processing techniques involved in plastics
recycling.  Those issues are covered in a companion study published
recently by Business Communications Company (BCC).<P>


<B>OBJECTIVES</B><P>

In this report we discuss how the recycling decision-makers
influence plastic packaging.  Most important among these are the
Federal, state and local lawmakers who have the power to mandate
the use of certain materials or (vice versa), preclude the use of
certain materials which do not satisfy the requirements of the law.
The inability of these lawmakers to pass consistent legislation
relating to solid waste issues is the primary reason that forecasts
of future plastic packaging demand are difficult to quantify.  The
many variables involved include which states or localities will
pass recycling or degradability legislation, to what degree will
that legislation impact which plastics, and when will the
legislation become effective (e.g., implementation timetable).<P>

Legislators, however, do not operate in a vacuum; they should be
responsive to the constituencies they represent.  While the vast
majority of the U.S. public are generally in favor of protecting
the environment, they are not united on what options will best
accomplish that goal.  They are easily influenced by printed and
visual media offerings.  The most outspoken spokesperson for the
public on this subject, the environmentalist, has risen from the
masses to lead the charge in favor of environmentally-friendly
products and opposed, violently, those products which they deem
unfriendly.  It is the impact of these environmentalists, who
created "green consumerism", that this study reviews since they
have had the most influence on consumer end-use packaging and
consumer-legislator packaging issues.<P>

In response to the outcry from consumers and legislators for
"better packaging", the packaging end-user has turned to the
package designer and he in turn to the material supplier and
fabricator to redesign packages and alter materials and material
processing so that packaging markets would not be lost. The study
shows how the package designer communicates his concerns about a
package's ability to meet environmental protection requirements to
those who take his design from conception to product, the material
suppliers and the fabricators.<P>

The plastics industry has addressed solid waste management issues
through material substitution, source reduction (e.g., downsizing),
changes in processing technology, new polymer grades, new additive systems, and by creating
degradable technologies.  Each of these is reviewed in  terms of its success
in accomplishing environmental objectives, achieving satisfactory recyclable
materials, maintaining performance properties, and maintaining acceptable
cost structures. The study analyzes how competing material industries have dealt
with and succeeded/failed in their efforts to meet environmental needs.

Solid waste management issues have created opportunities for some
plastic materials and meant loss of markets for others.  Each of
the packaging forms is analyzed in terms of what future markets
would exist if there were no environmental impact and what they
might be, based on expected levels of impact.  These calculations
include an analysis of the existing and proposed legislation by
state.  State data are factored into total U.S. consumption by
packaging form and market.<P>


<B>SCOPE AND METHODOLOGY</B><P>

This report is intended to be an objective assessment of the many
factors that influence packaging design, packaging processing, and
packaging materials.  Information sources include trade
associations, relevant published literature, and many interviews
with packaging end-users and companies supplying resins, additives,
and machinery to the packaging market.<P>

The problems and opportunities for plastic packaging are measured
in terms of relative environmental impact, both negative and
positive.  For each packaging type and market, the study gives a
brief overview of the practical use of that product, examples of
how products are changing as a result of environmental
considerations, and statistics are given showing the estimated
growth of that product as if there were no environmental impact,
compared to expected growth because of environmental influences
(although for some products there may be no impact at all).  The
data are supported by text which explains the issues that affect
the forecast.  Data are provided for 1990, the current year (1991),
1992, and an estimate for 1996, with average annual growth rates
calculated for the five-year period from 1991-1996.<P>

In all cases, the descriptions and data relate to the changes in
products, materials, additives, equipment, and markets.  This study
does not pursue the markets for recycled packaging products which
go into other markets, only those products which are returned for
use in the packaging industry. The descriptions relating to
equipment refer not to the conversion of recycled product into
recycled resin, but rather to the modifications made to plastics
processing equipment to accommodate the manufacture of recycled
resin alone or in combination with virgin resin.<P>

<B>SUMMARY</B><P>

The net impact from all environmental factors is estimated to be
the loss of about 700 million pounds of virgin resin in 1991 or 4.7
percent of the  demand originally forecast for the plastic
packaging industry.  By 1996, BCC estimates that 2.2 billion pounds
of virgin resin will be lost due to environmental factors,
representing 13 percent of the 17 billion pounds of forecast demand
for plastics packaging.  The largest impact in 1991 is attributed
to source reduction, a common, continuing feature in plastic
packaging, accounting for more than 55 percent of total virgin
resin loss. By 1996, however, the establishment of recycling
infrastructures for all plastic packaging materials will make the
use of recycled material the number one environmental factor
accounting for almost 50 percent of virgin resin loss.  The
relative impact from each environmental factor, in terms of pounds
of virgin resin loss is shown in Figure I.<P>

Each of these issues will have varying impacts depending on market
usage and material consumed.  For rigid packaging source reduction
currently has the greatest impact accounting for almost half of its
virgin resin loss.  The use of post-consumer recycled material
(PCR) has the second greatest influence today, but BCC estimates
that the huge amount of PCR going into bottles (accounting for the
largest virgin resin loss in any packaging product) will make
recycle content the number one environmental impact on rigid
packaging by 1996.  Substitution effects during the five year
period will remain constant at about 13-17 percent virgin resin
loss.  Degradability, oriented to flexible packaging only, will
have zero impact for the 1991-1996 period.<P>

In flexible packaging, source reduction is (and will continue to
be) the most important environmental factor, although the increased
use of PCR will reduce the current 65 percent of total virgin resin
loss to 44 percent by 1996.  Recycle content, in spite of FDA's
reluctance to allow recycled material in food packaging, will
become the third most influential environmental factor in 1996
displacing degradability.  Substitution will maintain its number
two ranking for the five-year period at 24-28 percent of total
virgin resin loss.  Although the demand for degradable polymers
will increase in the 1991-1996 period, the higher growth forecast
for PCR will drop degradability to last among the environmental
factors for flexible packaging. During the 1991-1996 period, the
growth rates of the various environmental factors will be: source
reduction (6 percent); degradability (12 percent); substitution (17
percent); and, recycle content (41 percent).<P>

The rankings and percentages of the four environmental factors are
shown in Table 1.<P>

<B>SCOPE OF THE STUDY</B><P>

Fluoropolymers hold  a unique  position among the specialty or
engineering thermoplastics.  They are unparalleled in terms of
their ability  to resist  chemical attack,  and as a group they
almost all  qualify as high-temperature resins--that is, able
to resist  long-term thermal excursions above 300 degrees F.  In light
of their  inherent lubricity  and  durability,  they  are  the
materials of  choice in  several applications  such as  plastic
bearings,  gears   and  other   vital  industrial   parts   in
replacement of metals which are vulnerable to corrosion.<P>

The  fluoropolymer  business  began  in  1938  when  a  DuPont
research chemist  sawed apart  an  apparently  empty  cylinder
containing tetrafluoroethylene  gas.   Plunkett, the  research
chemist, performed  this  operation  because  Fron  refrigerant
gases seemed  to disappear  from the  cylinder and  yet weight
measurements indicated  that matter  of some  sort  was  still
present.   In the  cylinder he  found a  white, waxy substance
which was  later to  be called  Teflon.    This  material  was
initially used in the Manhattan project during World War II as
a  coating   for  volatile  elements  in  radioactive  isotope
production.   Teflon did  not appear  in volume  as a commercial
product until the 1950s.  In effect, that time was required to
fully   understand    the   exact    nature   of   these   new
"fluoropolymers,"  their   properties,  and   their  potential
applications in the various manufacturing industries.<P>

The original  fluoropolymer discovered in the DuPont research
lab was  polychlorotrifluoroethylene  (PCTFE).    DuPont  also
commercialized  ethylene-tetrafluoroethylene   (ECTE)  in  the
1940s and  introduced fluorinated ethylene-propylene copolymer
(FEP) in  1960.  The company went on to develop polyvinylidene
fluoride (PVDF) in 1961 and commercially introduce it in 1965.
Then  in   1972,  the  company  introduced  one  of  the  last
fluoropolymer    resins,     perfluoroalkyltetrafluoroethylene
copolymer (PFA).<P>

Today, the  term "fluoropolymer"  covers  a  whole  family  of
resins and  elastomers brought  to the  market by  DuPont  and
other domestic  and foreign  resin  manufacturers.    All  the
fluoropolymers (of  course) contain  fluorine, and the bulk of
these high  -performance materials are fluorocarbon (plastics)
resins,    mostly     analogs    of     ethylene    such    as
polytetrafluoroethylene, polymers of chloro-trifluoroethylene,
fluorinated ethylene,  etc.   Another group  of fluoropolymers
with a  different set  of properties  beyond  high-temperature
resistance and  chemical resistance  are the  fluoroelastomers.
One important  group of fluoroelastomers, for example, are the
polyfluorocilicones.      Both  the  fluorocarbon  resins  and
fluoroelastomers can be homopolymers or copolymers.<P>

Recently a  third category  of fluoropolymers  has  come  into
commercial prominence.   These  are  the  low-molecular-weight
materials  with   a  fluorine   base,  with  varying  chemical
structure  and   functional  advantages  that  go  beyond  the
original fluoropolymers.<P>

A final  category of  fluoropolymers is made up of a series of
miscellaneous   products    which    include    CTFE    fluids,
perfluoromembrane surfactants,  fluoropolymer composites,  and
developmental materials.<P>

Thus, the  fluoropolymer  family  of  resins,  elastomers  and
miscellaneous fluorine-based  plastic materials  that form the
scope of  this  study  are  listed  below,  along  with  their
acronyms:<P>

<B>OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</B><P>

The major  objective of  this report  is to  provide  existing
players and  companies directly  or indirectly  interested  in
these resins with an up-to-date and reliable assessment of the
fluoropolymer market.  Key elements of this objective are:<P>

<DD>  (a) develop meaningful  market estimates  in volume
    (pounds) and  value (dollars) terms for the present (1991)
    and the medium-term, (1996) <P>

<DD>  (b) segmenting these  volume and  value  data  into
major application areas<P>

<DD> (c) identification  and   analysis   of   important
    worldwide fluoropolymer  suppliers as  to specific products
    and overall sales and market shares,<P>

<DD> (d) assessing the  various factors  impacting  this
marketplace,<P>

 <DD> (e) describing the synthesis/production of the more
    commercially important fluoropolymers,<P>

 <DD> (f) contrasting the advantages and disadvantages of
    each of  the major  fluoropolymer types,  vis-*-vis  other
    plastic materials inside and outside this group, and<P>

<DD> (g) evaluating the  recent and likely future growth
    in  European   and  Japanese   markets,  as  well  as  the
    suppliers, wherever possible.<P>

In effect,  new product developments here and elsewhere in the
world have  necessitated a  complete reappraisal  of the  many
fluoropolymers. Demands  of the  marketplace  have  shifted  in
terms  of   reassessing  the   cost/performance  of  individual
fluoropolymers.   Moreover, restructuring  of the industry has
significantly  changed   the  competitive   positions  of  key
suppliers.   Thus, a  timely review  of fluoropolymers here at
the beginning  of the  1990s is called for and offered in this
study.<P>


<B>RESEARCH METHODOLOGY</B><P>

The data and insights offered in this study were gathered from
various sources.   Information  was  initially  gathered  from
suppliers' literature  to  ensure  that  their  products  were
properly represented  in terms  of tradenames,  properties and
processing parameters,  and suggested  or actual applications.
Further correspondence  and telephone conversations with major
fluoropolymer suppliers sorted out any lingering discrepancies
from the trade literature.<P>

A thorough search of the trade literature was the next step in
the information  gathering process.   Sources  included  trade
magazines, U.S.  government and  trade association data, and a
variety of  contacts within  the  industry  developed  by  the
author over twenty years in the industry.<P>

Following the  development of  preliminary  market  estimates,
"fine-tuning"  of   the  numbers  generated  was  accomplished
through consultations  with major fluoropolymer suppliers which
included the  following:   Allied-Signal, Atochem,  Ausimont,
Daikin America,  Dow Corning, DuPont, Ethyl, General Electric,
Halocarbon Properties,  Hoechst-Celanese, ICI  America,  Solvay
Polymers and The 3M Company.<P>

Beyond current  and likely future market estimates, the issues
addressed with  the officials  from these  companies  included
major driving forces in this segment of the plastics industry,
trade practices,  industry realignments,  emerging  competitive
strategies, etc.<P>


<B>CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE STUDY</B><P>

Companies   already    in,    contemplating    entering,    or
directly/indirectly affected  by developments  in the  broadly
defined  fluoropolymers   business  will   benefit  from  this
comprehensive competitive analysis insofar as it addresses the
following key issues:<P>

<MENU> -   the global nature of this business<P>
  -   the ease of entry into this business<P>
  -   why several  key  fluoropolymers  still  have  only  one
supplier<P>
  -   why end-use applications drive most of these materials<P>
  -   how environmental  pressures  can  foster,  rather  than
      impede, the growth of selected fluoropolymers<P>
  -  why joint ventures and licensing arrangements will
     continue as a vital part of this business<P>
  -  how recent acquisitions have caused some restructuring of
     leading producers/suppliers<P>
  -  the effect of an additional domestic supplier with an
     offshore resin production facility<P>
  -  the possibility of developing other fluorine-based
systems.</MENU><P>

<B>GOALS AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>

The objective of this study is an in-depth analysis of toughened
resin markets in automotive, industrial, construction, consumer,
medical and miscellaneous applications.<P>

The report analyzes four principal groups of toughened polymeric
materials; polyolefins, engineering resins and alloys, thermosets,
including matrix materials and intermediate-price resins. It notes
recent changes and developments in plastics toughening
technologies. The principal reasons for the expansion in the use of
toughened plastics are growing requirements for high-impact
resistant resins, needed to upgrade the presently used conventional
materials and the increased availability of toughened plastics due
to the improvements in copolymerization technology and in additive
impact-strength modification, as well as blending and alloying
methods.<P>

<B>Scope & Format</B><P>

This study is a thorough qualitative and quantitative analysis of
technology, markets and suppliers of different types of toughened
resins and impact modifiers. It also deals with the consumption
figures and five-year consumption forecasts for both specific
products and applications.<P>

<B>Methodology</B><P>

The report consists of five sections:<P>
<UL>1.      Overview<BR>

3.      Toughened Plastics-Major Groups<BR>
4.      Markets and Applications<BR>
5.      Suppliers of Toughened Resins and Systems</UL><P>

In the overview, major terms, such as toughened plastics, are
defined and the scope and limitations of the study are noted. Major
groups of toughened resins and research on toughening technologies
are broadly delineated, and reasons for the use of toughened
plastics, such as replacement of metals and non-metallic materials,
are discussed. Major properties required of toughened plastics are
identified. Industry structure as well as the overall consumption
patterns of toughened plastics are also listed.<P>

Impact modification technologies as related to specific resins and
systems are also discussed.<P>

Section three deals with different types of toughened
(impact-modified) resins and with different varieties of impact
modifiers. It provides information on properties, applications,
consumption figures and principal manufacturers of specific resins
and impact modifiers. Polyolefins, engineering resins and alloys,
thermosets, including matrix resins and intermediate-price resins
are discussed in detail. Elastomeric, rubber, polyacrylate,
polyethylene and polymeric plasticizers as impact modifiers are
discussed and their consumption is quantified.<P>

Section four deals with different markets for various types of
toughened resins. The principal applications are discussed within
each market and are quantified whenever possible. These markets
include: packaging, automotive, medical, industrial, consumer,
construction and miscellaneous uses.<P>

Finally, in the last section of the study, the principal suppliers
of particular toughened resin systems and their chief products are
discussed and are related to specific applications.<P>

<B>Contribution  & Target Audience</B><P>

This study is designed for manufacturers and users of toughened
polyolefins, engineering resins and alloys, thermosets,
intermediate-price resins and impact modifiers. It will assist them
in making sound decisions as far as markets, property requirements
for specific uses and potential sales levels of their products are
concerned. It will also provide them with information on
competitive products. Information included in this study will also
be useful to distributors of toughened plastics and impact
modifiers. It will also be of value to investment firms and market
analysts advising potential investors.<P>

</CENTER>

<B>STUDY GOALS AND OBJECTIVES</B>


<P>One of the fastest growing sets of opportunities for plastics is in
the manufacturing of medical devices.  Once dominated by traditional
materials such as glass, carbon and stainless steel, rubber et al.,
the manufacturing of medical devices has benefitted from quantum leaps
in productivity stemming from the commercial availability and medical
industry acceptance of a wide range of plastics that can be processed
into molded and extruded parts, film and sheet.</P>

<P>The materials used in flexible medical tubing have to satisfy a wide
range of performance and processing criteria - perhaps the widest of
any application where plastics are currently specified, inside or
outside of the medical device business.  First and foremost, they must
be flexible, durable and strong with a low coefficient of friction to
withstand fluid flow pressures and to facilitate flow.  They must be
highly resistant to chemicals and to temperature variations, not only
to satisfy end-use requirements, but also to tolerate the conditions
encountered in various sterilization methods.  They must be
biocompatible and inert in contact with blood, tissue and other body
fluids/matter.  Transparency is at times convenient and at other times
vital in order to monitor visually or electronically the flow of
contents through the tube.  And in the final analysis all these
properties must be delivered cost-effectively in standard extrusion
or co-extrusion processing equipment.</P>

<P>The dominant material in flexible medical tubing since the 1940s when
plastics first began to replace the natural rubber and natural rubber
latex is flexibilized polyvinyl chloride (PVC).  In fact, PVC is
commonly specified for other medical device components such as bags,
trays and rigid molded parts.  PVC has the multiple
advantages of low raw material cost, good processability in
conventional extrusion equipment operated by medical device OEMs and
custom plastic part suppliers, durability across a wide range of
durometer values, water-white transparency in thin- or thick-wall
tubing, and relative bio-inertness.  However, PVC has one drawback
from the standpoint of medical tubing performance parameters - namely,
the presence of leachable plasticizers and other compounding additives
for enhanced performance or processability that can compromise its
reaction with blood, tissue and other critical medical/pharmaceutical
fluids and matter.</P>

<P>This performance limitation applying to PVC has attracted other resin
manufacturers and compounders into the burgeoning flexible medical
tubing business - first polyethylene, then nylon, polyurethane,
thermoplastic (styrene-, propylene- and urethane-based) elastomers,
and even the high-performance specialty resins such as silicone and
fluoropolymers.  Each of these resins brings particular advantages to
the flexible medical tubing marketplace in one or more applications,
but they also have their own peculiar limitations in either
performance, raw material and/or processing cost terms.  Thus, the
search continues to this day to develop new plastic materials or
variations of existing ones to either replace the current industry
standard, PVC, in the high-volume tubing applications or to capture
niches where the mid- and high-performance resin
manufacturers/compounders have set their sights.</P>

<B>CONTRIBUTION OF THE STUDY</B>

<P>In this report we offer the results of a detailed survey of key
players along the chain of flexible plastic medical tubing
manufacturing - that is, the resin manufacturers and compounders
active in the field of medical grade plastics for tubing, additive
manufacturers, medical tubing extruders and distributors, and medical
device manufacturers that incorporate tubing into their units.  From
the resin manufacturers and compounders we elicited information on the
grades that they currently offer for medical tubing, the prices of
these grades, the target applications for these grades, and their
sense of evolving plastic material preferences in the various tubing
applications.  From the extruders and medical device OEMs we elicited
information on the current and likely volume of business in plastic
medical tubing by major application, the evolving
economic/environmental imperatives impacting on plastic material
decision-making, and their sense of the materials that will either
gain or lose market share in medical tubing over the coming years.</P>

<B>METHODOLOGY OF THE STUDY</B>

<P>Beyond our direct telephone consultations with over 50 companies on
the supply chain of plastic flexible medical tubing, we surveyed the
relevant plastics and medical industry literature to refine our
understanding of the key issues at play in this market.  We also
consulted with key officials in U.S. regulatory agencies to obtain
copies of past or pending legislation or guidelines with direct or
indirect implications for material decision-making in flexible medical
tubing.</P>

<B>OTHER RELATED BCC STUDIES</B>

<P>BCC has covered the field of plastic medical tubing as part of other
multiclient and single-client studies with a similar or broader
research remit.  Some of our more recent multiclient studies in this
connection are the following:</P>

<B>OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</B><P>

The plastic  resins industry  has reached  the mature stage of
its commercialization.   No  longer do  plastics grow  at  the
annual double-digit  rates seen  in  the  development  stages.
From 1946  to 1971,  the plastics  industry  experienced  13.5
percent average  annual growth  .  From 1971 to 1996, however,
annual growth  will have  been about 5-6 percent.  In a future
scenario which  will see  annual plastics  growth at less than
four percent,  the thermoplastic  polyesters as  a  group  are
expected to  experience six  to seven  percent annual  growth.
This study examines the reasons for this above-average growth,
examines the  implications for  the  plastics  industry  as  a
whole, and  the critical  participants  in  the  thermoplastic
polyester business.<P>

Thermoplastic polyesters  serve three separate functions--they
are used  as   packaging materials,  engineering  resins,  and
performance polymers.   Their successful penetration into each
of  these  segments  is  based  on  different  criteria.    In
packaging, for  example, competition  between  PET  and  other
thermoplastics (and  non-plastics) involves  issues of barrier
properties, microwaveability,  sterilizability, recyclability,
and cost.<P>

Engineering applications  require a  balance between  cost and
performance.    Mechanical,  thermal,  electrical,  and  other
physical properties  determine which  polymer will be selected
(assuming the  cost is  not prohibitive).  But, in performance
polymer applications  the cost/performance  balance is shifted
toward performance.   In  such applications  the ability  of a
material to  perform better  than its  competition  in  severe
environments supersedes the extra cost required.<P>

This study  attempts to identify the circumstances under which
market  penetration  is  justified  and  how  successful  that
penetration has been and will be in the future.<P>


<B>SCOPE AND FORMAT OF THE STUDY</B><P>

This study  views the  family of thermoplastic polyesters from
every  phase   of  their   production  through  their  use  in
"engineering-type"  applications   such   as   transportation,
electrical/electronics, industrial,  and  appliances,  and  in
packaging, PET's  major outlet.   It  answers the questions of
what polymers  are being  used, in  which markets, how much is
consumed, and  why particular  polymers are  used or not used.
Intermaterial  competition  is  evaluated  in  three  ways  --
comparisons of one supplier's grades versus another within the
same polymer  type, comparisons  within a  polymer group (e.g.
engineering resins, performance polymers) of the thermoplastic
polyesters versus  similar thermoplastics, and the competition
between the thermoplastic polyesters and non-plastics.<P>

As with  all aspects  of the plastics industry, any evaluation
of competitive  performance characteristics  must include cost
comparisons. The  chemistry for  preparation from  monomer  to
polymer is  described for  each polymer with an explanation as
to how  feedstock prices  affect the  ultimate price  of these
polymers and,  in turn,  how pricing  might  favor  or  hinder
market penetration.   Cost  data include price per unit volume
as well  as for  price per  unit  weight  to  present  a  fair
competitive scenario.<P>

The companies  who participate  in the thermoplastic polyester
business  generally   specialize  in  engineering  resins  and
performance polymers.   This  study profiles their activity in
the United  States but  includes a discussion of their foreign
relationships which  impact on  the ability  to  market  these
polymers globally.    The  profiles  of  the  resin  suppliers
include market  shares within  each polymer  type, capacities,
and grade  offerings.   The study  discusses the  impact  from
those  companies   on  the   periphery  of  the  thermoplastic
polyester business,  such as feedstock suppliers, compounders,
processors, and recyclers.<P>

The quantitative data supplied for the various polymers relate
to a  base year  (1991) and  a medium-term  future year (1996)
with average annual growth rates calculated for that five-year
period.   Data for 1989 and 1990 are shown to establish trends
prior to the forecast period.<P>


<B>STUDY METHODOLOGY</B><P>

In addition  to telephone  conversations with  the major resin
suppliers and  compounders, our  research included the product
literature  offered   by  those   companies,  government  data
publications, industry  conferences, and  trade  publications.
The current  and forecast  demand data  provided represents  a
consensus from  among the resin suppliers.  The discussions of
trends  and   outlook  are  based  on  our  conclusions  after
comparing the suppliers' objectives with market needs.<P>


<B>CONTRIBUTION OF THE STUDY</B><P>

This study  is intended  for use  by existing  resin and  film
suppliers, as  well as  by companies who process, compound, or
recycle thermoplastic polyesters.  It can be used by those who
wish to  determine the  opportunities and  growth prospects in
the  several   market  segments  in  which  the  thermoplastic
polyesters  participate.    Insights  into  new  technological
developments indicate  how existing  markets can be penetrated
and how  new markets will be opened where these materials have
been previously excluded.<P>


<B>RELATED BCC REPORTS</B><P>

This analysis of the thermoplastic polyesters is the latest in
a  series  of  studies  reviewing  the  polymers  and  related
materials which  comprise the U.S. plastics industry.  The BCC
studies shown  below may  be of  interest to companies who are
following the growth of thermoplastics and thermosets, and the
interpolymer competition  that is  inherent  to  the  plastics
industry.<P>

</CENTER>

<B>STUDY OBJECTIVES</B><P>

In a previous report, we analyzed in detail the prospects for the
recycling of post-consumer plastic waste during the 1990s.  We
found that the production of recycled resin could quadruple over
the coming 10 years.  In this report, we follow up by asking two
questions: (a) do we have the technological know-how to meet this
forecasted level of output? and (b) which equipment manufacturers
will benefit most from this development?<P>


This report has therefore two objectives.  First, it looks at the
technological aspects of such crucial steps as the collection of
plastic material, the sorting technologies required, the prospects
for the continued success of the mechanical and thermal
technologies as well as for the various chemical technologies now
on the drawing boards.  It analyzes the technological problems
associated with the manufacturing of products made of recycled
resins.  Throughout, the report also seeks to forecast the growth
in the sales of equipment needed over the coming decade.  Second,
the report also peers into the future and provides insights into
the forthcoming generation of promising new technologies and
equipment aimed at removing some of the obstacles now besetting the
recycling of post-consumer thermoplastic waste.<P>


The report, therefore, takes a critical look at the wide range of
recycling technologies and equipment now available to recyclers and
at the rate of growth in the sales of equipment.  It seeks to
identify the technologies that will be capable of sustaining the
forecasted growth of the post-consumer recycling business over the
coming decade.  We believe that today's dedicated recycling
technology is still in its infancy and that the expected
developments within the next few years will be a boon to the
recycling industry as well as to the equipment manufacturers.<P>



<B>REASONS FOR DOING THE STUDY</B><P>


In a previous report (BCC report #P-125, The Secondary Recycling
Plastics Business), we concluded that in 1990, the industry
recycled 1.1 billion pounds of post-consumer plastic waste.  That
represented 2.9 per cent of the total volume of plastic waste
available for recycling that year.  We also noted that most of the
activity, so far, has focused on the recycling of plastic packaging
material, especially milk and soft-drink bottles.  However, the
latter group makes up less than half of the total stock of
recyclable material.  The industry has yet to make a dent in
recycling the even larger volume of durable goods such as plastic
household appliances, toys, pipes and other non-packaging products.
Our forecast calls for a rapid increase in the volume of such
recyclable material during the 1990s.<P>


We also noted in that report that the technology available to
recycle post-consumer plastic waste was in its infancy.  Very
little has been done to develop and market machinery and equipment
unique to the recycling of post-consumer waste.  Recyclers now use
mostly "virgin resin machinery" adapted, in an ad hoc fashion, to
their needs.  Recycling technologies, together with inadequate
equipment and machinery, were identified as obstacles holding back
more rapid developments of recycling efforts.<P>


In this report, we focus on the collection, the sorting and the
mechanical/thermal and chemical recycling processes.  We analyze
not only the type of equipment available for each of those key
steps but also their growth in sales.  We look into the critical
collection and sorting equipment now in use.  We examine the types
of equipment available for the granulation, shredding, extrusion
and pelletizing steps.  We look at the impact the increased
production of recycled resins will have on the sales of virgin
resins.  We also analyze the roles played by additives and the
properties of finished recycled products themselves.  We provide
some insights into the numerous emerging chemical recycling
processes.<P>


By taking a closer look at each stage of the recycling process, we
are in a better position to understand the limits of post-consumer
waste recycling efforts and the opportunities that will open up for
equipment manufacturers.  By reporting on the research being done,
we can better assess the outlook for plastics recycling over the
next 10 years.<P>


There are at least two other reasons for focusing on the equipment
and technological aspects of post-consumer plastic recycling now.
First, the plastics industry is under intense pressure to increase
its recycling rate of not only plastic packaging but of all plastic
products.  Unless the industry widens its recycling efforts, it
will continue to lag behind other industries such as paper, glass
and aluminum.  In some instances, because some resins are under
heavy environmental pressures, recycling will also ensure the
survival and continued growth of those resins and plastic products.
In other instances, it could help shape legislative actions that
will influence the future growth of most plastic resins.<P>


Second, the development of new technologies will benefit both the
recyclers and the manufacturers of the equipment themselves.  Those
manufacturers can only benefit from a rapidly growing recycling
business.<P>



<B>CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE STUDY</B><P>



For each of the post-consumer waste recycling steps, we analyze the
present and forthcoming technologies.  We also include a
quantitative and qualitative profile of the competition among the
equipment manufacturers.  We provide in-depth analysis of those
factors that obstruct present recycling efforts and those that
promise to unleash a more rapid growth.<P>


The study is aimed at groups and individuals within the plastics
recycling community and at the equipment manufacturers.  We believe
the information included in this report is unique.   The reader can
find, in one place, information about the present status of the
technology of plastics recycling as well as a discussion of where
that technology is heading over the next 10 years.<P>



<B>SCOPE AND FORMAT</B><P>



The study is limited to the various stages related to the recycling
of thermoplastic post-consumer plastic waste.  Therefore, we look
into the all-important collection and sorting technologies that
promise a steady supply of post-consumer plastic products to
recyclers.  We discuss the role of Municipal Recovery Facilities
(MRFS) and the possible establishment of Plastics Recovery
Facilities (PRFS).  We analyze the present and forthcoming types
and sales prospects of equipment and machinery used in the
mechanical/thermal processes (granulation, extrusion, pelletizing).
We also analyze developments in and expectations for the use of
chemical processes such as glycolysis, methanolysis, refinery
recycling, etc.  We study the characteristics and properties of
products manufactured with recycled plastics.  In this instance, we
focus only on those products that "close the loop."  The latter
section also includes an analysis of the use of new additives.
Throughout, we focus on the status of present-day operations and,
for each section, we provide an outlook for expected developments.<P>



<B>INFORMATION SOURCES</B><P>



This report relies on a wide variety of sources.  We are especially
thankful to the hundreds of recyclers and equipment manufacturers
contacted.  They have been willing to share their remarkable
expertise as well as their research findings.  However, they cannot
be held responsible for the views expressed in the following pages.<P>


We have also made wide use of publicly available sources of
information.  These include journals devoted to the plastics
recycling business, the data published by various government
agencies, the Society for the Plastics Industry, the Society of
Plastics Engineers, etc.  Members of these various groups have also
shown patience and interest in this report and we are thankful for
their input.<P>

<B>OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</B><P>

It is  now apparent  to everyone  in the  plastics industry  that
concern for the environment will not abate in the 1990s.  It will
grow as  we  examine  our  living  patterns  and  our  commercial
practices from  the standpoint  of the  impact on  resources  and
waste management.<P>

The EPA,  charged with  the  responsibility  of  caring  for  the
environment,  is  pursuing  a  policy  of  source  reduction  and
development/improvement  of  recycling  infrastructures  for  all
basic  materials.     Concurrently,   OSHA,  the   Department  of
Transportation, and other government regulatory agencies continue
to monitor  and improve  manufacturing practices which affect the
consumer and  worker in  terms of  safety.   It is in this era of
environmental concerns  that the  PVC industry is faced with loss
of market  share as  plastics usage  is scrutinized with the view
toward its impact on our society's well-being.<P>

This study  is concerned  with the efforts of the PVC industry to
counteract negative perceptions of its environmental-friendliness
while actively  promoting its  materials not only as contributors
to a  better standard  of living  but also as equal partners with
other polymers  in supporting  good environmental  practices.  We
will identify  and quantify  those areas where PVC does not offer
an environmental advantage vis-*-vis another polymer.<P>

The commission  of this  study was  prompted by  our initial view
that there would be dramatic changes (i.e., losses) in PVC demand
arising from consumer and processor desires to switch from PVC to
plastics or  non-plastics which  are perceived  to be  more  pro-
environment.   The main  questions to  be answered were: how much
PVC demand  would be  lost to  other materials;  which materials;
what would be the level of recyclate replacing virgin resin; and,
which companies  would be the beneficiaries and losers from these
impacts.<P>

PVC reached its level of importance in the U.S. plastics industry
because it  is the  most versatile  of all  plastics due  to  its
blending capability with plasticizers and other additives.  It is
used in  a wide  range of applications from thick, rigid pipe and
siding to  thin film  for surgical  gloves or food packaging.  In
addition, its  cost-performance characteristics  rate it  as  the
material-of-choice for  many applications.  Thus, understandably,
processors and  end-users alike  are reluctant  to shift to other
materials which  might be more expensive, would require different
equipment, and  create the need for more research and development
to satisfy the requirements of their specific products.<P>

Indeed, our  conversations with processors, compounders, and end-
users  indicate   that  they   would  discontinue   PVC  only  if
legislatively forced  to do  so.   Since we  have concluded  that
anti-PVC sentiment  will not  cause such  legislation,  the  most
likely impact  on PVC  demand for the next five years will be the
traditional market factors of cost and performance.<P>


The PVC  industry, with  nine billion pounds of demand, is second
only to  polyethylene in  terms of  importance  to  the  plastics
industry.  We will show that the impact from environmental issues
will affect  only a  small percentage of PVC markets, in terms of
lost share, during the next five years.  The environmental impact
on PVC will be more affected by changes in processing technology,
new polymer grades, and greater use of recycled material.<P>


<B>SCOPE AND FORMAT OF THE STUDY</B><P>

This study  views the  PVC industry  from 1991 through 1996.  The
quantitative data  that we  offer for PVC and competing materials
in the  various markets  include domestic  demand for  the  years
1989, 1990, and a forecast for 1996.  Average annual growth rates
are calculated for the 1991-1996 period.<P>

The  scope   of  the   study  includes:  an  explanation  of  the
environmental issues  which are likely to impact on PVC; past and
pending    environment-related    legislation    involving    PVC
specifically or  the markets  in which PVC competes; and, how the
other material  industries are coping with environmental factors.
These analyses  supplement our  quantitative measurement  of  the
loss or gain by PVC due to environmental issues and the materials
which will  have resultant benefit or liability.  In addition, we
have identified  the key players at each level of PVC manufacture
and use,  together with  changes in processing technology and new
polymer grades caused by environmental pressures.<P>

The cause  for substitution  of one  material for  another is not
always clearly  explained.  We have made every effort to separate
environmental  factors  from  cost  and  performance  factors  to
develop our quantitative analyses.<P>


<B>STUDY METHODOLOGY</B><P>

In addition  to telephone  interviews with  primary players  from
each level  of PVC manufacture, we have gathered data and insight
from industry  specialists in  trade associations  and government
regulatory agencies.    These  contacts  were  supplemented  with
information obtained  from  the  technical  and  marketing  trade
literature and  supporting data from previous BCC reports.  Thus,
we  believe  this  study  represents  an  accurate  view  of  the
consensus for  the current  and forecast  degree of impact on the
various PVC markets from environment-related issues.<P>


<B>CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE STUDY</B><P>

This study  is intended  for use  by  existing  resin  companies,
processors,  compounders,  and  end-users  of  PVC  resins.    In
addition, companies who specialize in recycling will gain insight
into the  developing infrastructure  and  potential  markets  for
recycled  PVC.  Companies  which  compete  against  PVC  will  be
interested in  the growth  opportunities for  their materials  as
replacements for  PVC where  environmental  considerations  cause
material selectors  to abandon  the traditional  cost-performance
factors  in  qualifying  materials.    Finally,  those  companies
considering entrance  into the  PVC business  will learn  of  the
current environmental  factors which  will alter  the anticipated
growth of PVC markets.<P>

</CENTER>

<B>STUDY GOAL AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>

From its commercial beginnings in the late 1930s up to recent years, the fundamental
marketing strategy of the plastics industry has been to develop and refine polymeric
materials that could replace "traditional" materials - metals, wood, rubber, glass,
paper, et al. - in existing, high-volume and/or high-value applications.  By the 1960s
there were transparent plastics such as polycarbonate and polymethyl methacrylate
to compete against glass, engineering grades of thermoplastics and thermosets to
compete against wood, thermoplastic and thermosetting elastomers to compete against
rubber, and so on.<P>

Whereas there are also advanced composites with high-modulus fibers available to
compete against the great strength of steel, the one characteristic of steel and other
metals that has consistently eluded polymer scientists is electrical conductivity.  Thus,
until recently, the route to mimicking the conductivity of metals (particularly copper
and steel) was to either compound into the inherently insulative resin a conductive
filler (e.g., metal or carbon powder or fiber), coat the plastic film or part with a
conductive metal solution, or simply bond the plastic film or part to a conductive
metal substrate.  This did achieve a measure of conductivity, but there were generally
compromises in terms of processability or performance or total part economics.<P>

Thus, the search for "inherently conductive" polymers commenced in earnest in
corporate, academic and government-supported research laboratories around the world
- in the U.S., Europe and Japan, in particular.  And in the 1950s and 1960s, as the
implications of the microelectronics revolution became apparent to all, the search for
such materials accelerated further, taking on the trappings of the search for the Holy
Grail.<P>

In the mid-1970s, quite by accident, the first polymer capable of conducting
electricity - polyacetylene - was discovered at the University of Pennsylvania.  The
announcement of this discovery quickly reverberated around the polymer science
community, and the intensity of the search for others magnified dramatically.  By
1984-1985 the number of patents issued in the field of electrically conductive polymers
had shot up, and by 1987 the first application - a polymer electrode in a miniature
("button") battery - was registered.<P>

Here in the early 1990s the commercialization of electrically conductive polymers is
still in its infancy.  Production of these materials has been scaled up from grams to
pounds, but overall global production and consumption totals are still negligible.
However, just as there was an air of inevitability to the success of conventional
insulative plastics (polyolefins, nylon, epoxy, et al.) in the 1940s, there is a similar
air - indeed, a conviction - of inevitability to the success of these new conductive
polymers in the 1990s and beyond.  No one is yet predicting billions of pounds of sales
by the year 2000.  But in the early years and decades of the 21st century, the
processes and the products in a host of vital industries:<P>

<UL>             -   aircraft/aerospace<BR>
             -   automobiles<BR>
             -   biotechnology<BR>
             -   chemical processing<BR>
             -   electrical/electronic equipment<BR>
             -   military hardware</UL><P>

will be completely transformed by the integration of these conductive polymers into
an ever-widening menu of materials.<P>

U.S. and global manufacturers and their material/part suppliers have always faced a
choice between the known and the unknown in materials decision-making.  The
companies that are willing to plumb the unknown and learn to enhance their total
processing/performance spectrum will enter the next century as vital competitors in
the evolving global marketplace for products and services.  Those that don't will soon
face technological obsolescence and disappear.  This certainly applies all along the
product/service supply chain in the industries cited above and others as well.<P>

The companies that succeed in developing and marketing electrically conductive
polymers and other novel molecular transformations will be those driven by "patient
money."  These are hardly materials that offer quick rewards "going right down to the
bottom line."  Rather, this is a field where careful, time-consuming and very often
cooperative research will eventually be rewarded with applications beyond any
contemporary crystal ball-gazing.  And in our research we have identified many
companies - in North America, Europe and Asia - determined to participate in those
applications in the future with materials currently dubbed "exotic."<P>

<B>SCOPE OF THE REPORT</B><P>

Since the initial wave of patents relating to material composition and method of
preparation of the various electrically conductive polymers began in the early 1980s,
there have been numerous symposia and seminars devoted to these topics.  The
plastics trade literature has also covered these novel materials, speculating on likely
future applications.  Thus, there is a rich and growing database on the nature of these
materials.<P>

What remains to be offered is a comprehensive and candid assessment of the practical
dynamics of introducing these novel materials into existing applications and markets
and a quantification of the volume and value of business likely to be generated.  This,
then, is our remit in this report.<P>

The scope of this report, therefore, is basically threefold.  First, we offer summary
descriptions of the dozen or so most promising polymers and polymer blends offering
high conductivity (i.e., low volume and surface resistivities) when modified (doped).
Then we provide an in-depth assessment of the leading players on both the supply and
the demand side of the electrically conductive polymers equation.  Thirdly, we provide
a realistic chronology for the penetration of these materials into the target
applications and markets to arrive at consumption volume and value of sales estimates
from 1992 through 2000 out to the year 2010.<P>

<B>METHODOLOGY OF THE REPORT</B><P>

Our research program proceeded along three tracks - namely,<P>

<UL> -  a thorough review of the patents in the field of electrically
conductive polymers<P>
-  a similarly thorough review of the plastics and chemicals
 industries' trade literature and conference proceedings<P>
-  telephone interviews with officials at key university and
government research laboratories, as well as companies
interested in the actual/potential supply/use of these and
related materials.</UL><P>

From earlier BCC research in this field, we already had a U.S. patent database
covering the period 1970-1985.  We supplemented this with a new search of the U.S.
patents assigned over the period 1985-1991.  This allowed us to chronicle the advance
of this research work and commercial inroads from the very beginning up to the
present date.  It also allowed us to identify the changing cast of key players in this
field over the past 20 years.<P>

We also reviewed articles and papers on these polymers and related issues (processing
and performance) over recent years (1988-1991).  We followed this up by contacting
officials at over 70 U.S. and foreign companies, universities and government agencies,
which have been or are still actively pursuing opportunities in this field.<P>


<B>CONTRIBUTION OF THE REPORT</B><P>

This report is designed to provide a cost-effective set of data and insights to
companies either already in or contemplating entering the field of electrically
conductive polymers.  The data that we provide as of 1991-1992 are accurate and
verifiable to the maximum extent possible, and the projections of future material
production and consumption are not "wild-eyed," but rather realistic, based on the
assessments of companies with existing commitments.  For companies already in this
field, we attempt to point out possibly profitable alliances of a research or marketing
nature.  For companies contemplating entry, we set out as precisely as possible the
costs of entry and some attractive candidates for acquisition.<P>

Ultimately, our intention is to provide a clear, candid assessment of these evolving
materials and technologies to companies planning to make commitments in this
business today and out to the year 2000.<P>

conductive polymers and their actual/potential markets.  For example, we have
covered the field of electrically conductive polymers on their own in earlier reports
(1983 and 1988).  We have also covered these materials as part of a total spectrum of
materials in the recent reports listed below.<P>

</CENTER>

<B>OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</B><P>

The environmental issues which face the plastics resins industry are becoming a major
influence in the way resins are produced and marketed.  Of no less concern is the
impact on the materials which are added to resins to improve their property
performance, processability, and final cost.  In the 1990s, a fourth function has been
added for these materials--an ability to promote the pro-environmental qualities of
polymers.<P>

This study identifies and quantifies the effect of those additives which will have the
greatest contribution in satisfying polymer suppliers' efforts to maintain market share
while under environmental pressures.  As with any case of a change in the status quo,
there will be "winners and losers."  Thus, the study will review and analyze the
materials and their suppliers which are at risk from material substitution and those
which will be the beneficiaries of that substitution.<P>

In addition, the demand for several of these additives will be affected in terms of
increased or decreased use, as in recycling where greater loading levels will be needed
to process recycled resins in some cases or less/no additive will be needed since they
already exist in the recycled material.  This study will separate those instances where
environmental factors rather than cost and performance factors have led to changes
in demand.<P>



<B>SCOPE AND FORMAT OF THE STUDY</B><P>

This study distinguishes between those additives whose demand will be significantly
impacted by environmental issues and those   we discovered had little or no
environmental pressures. Of the twenty-eight additive categories we identified for
potential analysis, nine are reviewed in depth--flame retardants, foaming agents,
stabilizers, plasticizers, colorants, compatibilizers, coupling agents, impact modifiers,
and degradability additives.  The biocides, polyurethane catalysts, and mold release
agents, having only moderate environmental impact are discussed qualitatively, and
the remaining additives were excluded for lack of relevance.  Among the latter are
antiblocking agents, antioxidants, organic peroxides, polyester initiators, antifogging
agents, antistats, crosslinking agents, curing agents, deodorants/odorants, emulsifiers,
low-profile additives, lubricants, processing aids, slip agents, surfactants, thickening
agents, UV stabilizers, and viscosity depressants.<P>

The study views plastics additives from the current (1992) time through the next ten
years.  All quantitative data shown for additives demand and other materials are
keyed to 1991, 1992, 1997, and 2002.  Average annual growth rates are calculated for
the 5-year 1992-1997 and 1997-2002 periods.<P>

The scope of the study includes: a discussion of the environmental issues which affect
the use of additives; past and pending legislation which specifically restricts the use
of polymer compounds; similar regulatory issues; the role of additives as contributors
to plastics' pro-environment characteristics; and the impact on additive demand from
environmental issues.  In addition, we have identified the major players who supply
the various additives and the compounders/processors which, along with the resin
suppliers, are the major users of additives.<P>



<B>STUDY METHODOLOGY</B><P>

In addition to telephone interviews with the major players in additive production and
use, we have gathered data and insight from trade associations and government
agencies.  These contacts have been supplemented with information obtained from the
technical and marketing trade literature and relevant data from previous BCC studies.<P>


All BCC estimates of future demand, both with and without environmental impact,
are based on our interpretation of the information received from an extensive list of
industry specialists.  Thus, we believe this study represents an accurate view of the
current and forecast impact on plastics additives from environmentally-related issues.<P>



<B>CONTRIBUTION OF THE STUDY</B><P>

The plastics additives industry consumes more than 11 billion pounds of material,
accounting for 15 percent of the total weight of plastic compounds consumed annually.
It is a one billion dollar industry involving more than 900 companies.  While
replacement of heavy metals in pigments and vinyl stabilizers and removal of halogens
from flame retardants have already been initiated to meet environmental standards,
the role of additives in facilitating recycling will provide a major boost in future
additive demand.  Consequently, their position as a major factor in plastics warrants
an analysis on the extent of environmental impact.<P>

This study is intended for use by existing resin suppliers, additive suppliers,
compounders, processors and recyclers, with an interest in evaluating how the
environmental pressures on additive use will affect their businesses.  Our
comprehensive analyses show  which additives are likely to lose market share and
those which will be the beneficiaries of those losses.  The conclusions drawn from
these analyses can aid companies in developing new additive systems and guide those
companies considering entrance into additive markets as to where the areas of growth
and decline will occur.<P>

<B>STUDY GOAL AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>

The goal of this report is to provide a detailed and comprehensive
multi-client study of the U.S. market for clean coal technologies,
products, and systems and potential business opportunities.  The
objectives include a thorough coverage of the underlying social,
political, economic, energy, and environmental issues driving the
clean coal technology and air pollution control business, as well
as assessments of new and potential products and systems.  Another
important objective is to provide realistic market data and
forecasts for low-sulfur coal, related air pollution control
equipment, instrumentation, and related chemical technologies.<P>

<B>REASONS FOR DOING THE STUDY</B><P>

The main reason for doing this study is that during the past five
years there has been a growing concern about the environment in the
United States.  This has manifested itself in the emergence of
Green political initiatives and an expanding number of
environmental standards, air emission targets, and regulations.
For the clean coal technology business, the most important has been
the passage into law of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.
Recent directions in the legislative and regulatory arena indicate
that environmental pressures -- despite the recession -- remain
important to the public and legislators.   In addition, it is
assumed that these pressures will intensify in the years to come,
engendering further changes in the clean coal technology business.<P>

<B>SCOPE AND FORMAT</B><P>

The clean coal technology industry is not a precisely defined
sector and has not yet been assigned in any of the major economic
classification codes or activities.  Indeed, even air pollution
control and environmental protection does not fit any one standard
definition or classification.  Air pollution control is usually
defined as including the suppliers of equipment, technologies,
products, and services which monitor, prevent, and limit damage to
air quality.  Clean coal technology would deal with those
technologies, products, and services that monitor, prevent, and
limit damage to air quality arising from the burning of coal.  This
is the definition of the industry used in this report which
includes "end-of-pipe" air pollution control equipment,
instrumentation and monitoring equipment, low-sulfur coal, and
chemical products used in coal desulfurization and denitrification.<P>

Basically, the scope of the report is limited to those goods which
monitor, prevent, and limit damage from air pollution arising from
combustion of coal  at stationary sources such as electric power
generation plants and industrial facilities.  The scope of the
report does not include the cost of ancillary equipment and
components (piping, wire and cable, electrical devices, etc.),
construction-related costs (field erection and construction labor,
concrete foundations, sitework, etc.), and general engineering and
environmental services.  Many of these technologies and chemicals
can be used to treat flue gases arising from the combustion of
other fossil fuels.  To the furthest extent possible, revenues
associated with technologies to reduce sulfur dioxide and nitrous
oxide emissions from these other fossil fuels are not included
within the scope of this report.<P>

As the number of environmental issues of major concern increase,
the definition proposed by some industry observers has been
broadened to include the supply of energy-efficient equipment,
which contribute to reducing greenhouse gas and other emissions. This report does not include this type of equipment because to a
certain extent the substitutionary adoption of such technologies
may be motivated by financial incentives rather than environmental
policy initiatives.  In addition, the report does not include
advanced clean coal technologies such as fluidized bed combustion
(FBC), pressurized fluidized bed combustion, (PFBC) integrated
gasification combined-cycle (IGCC), and other advanced coal
conversion/-combustion technologies.  The report also does not
include chemicals used in traditional coal preparation processes
(wet-washing, froth flotation, etc.).<P>

Within the report some duplication does exist.  Revenue estimates
of catalysts used in selective catalyst reduction (SCR) systems are
presented in the section dealing with chemicals.  The reported
revenues include catalysts used for both the initial "charging" of
these systems and replacement demand.  In the section dealing with
SCR systems, the revenue estimates of the SCR systems reflect their
net sales value, about 60-70% the value of which is
catalysts.  This duplication is taken care of in the summary by
removing the value of catalysts -- about $25 million in 1993 --
from the total.<P>

The scope of this report is comprehensive, covering the present
status of and future prospects for clean coal technologies in the
United States.  It covers the many issues concerning the merits and
future prospects of the clean coal technology business, including
low-sulfur coal, technologies and equipment  for sulfur dioxide and
nitrous oxide removal, ESP upgrades, boiler modifications,
instrumentation and monitoring, and related chemical products.  It
also covers in detail the socio-political, economic, energy, and
environmental issues that so many regard as critical to the
industry's current state of change.<P>

The report provides a review of the clean coal technology industry, its structure and the many companies involved in supplying these goods.   The competitive position of the main players in the market and the strategic options they face are also discussed, as well as such competitive factors as marketing, technical services, distribution, and
operations.  The report also looks at the varieties of basic
research, product development, and commercialization that are being
conducted in the area of clean coal technology.<P>

The value of revenues for clean coal technology products -- in
million of U.S. dollars -- represents the value of the products
sold.  This value reflects the net sales price, f.o.b. plant or
mine, to the customer, net of discounts, allowances, and freight
charges.  As used in this study, the term revenues is equivalent
to, and used interchangeably with, the terms demand and sales.
During the discussion of the individual market segments, revenues
are related to indicators in the tables which are  used for
comparative purposes.  They do not imply that the indicator used
(e.g. electric utilities' new plant and equipment expenditures)
represents the sole market for that product.<P>

All growth rates mentioned in the tables and in the text are based
on the average annual rate of growth from 1993 through 1998 or from
1998 to the year 2003.  The compounding method of calculating
growth rates is used.  Because current dollar measures are used,
these growth rates thus reflect the growth in volume or real growth
and the growth including the effects of price changes and changes
in product mix.  The effects of inflation are  eliminated by
including unit sales data or by the use of price indexes to provide
measures of real growth.<P>

<B>CONTRIBUTION OF THE STUDY</B><P>

This study provides the most complete accounting of ongoing clean
coal technology developments in the United States currently
available in a multi-client format.  It provides the most thorough
and up-to-date assessment that can be found anywhere on the
subject.  The study also provides extensive quantification of the
many important facets of the market developments in the United
States for clean coal technologies, products, equipment, and
systems.  This, in turn, contributes to the determination of what
kind of strategic response companies may adopt in order to compete
in this dynamic market.<P>

<B>INFORMATION SOURCES</B><P>

Initially, a comprehensive and exhaustive search of the literature
on clean coal technology was conducted.  These secondary sources
included technical journals, technical books, marketing literature,
other product/promotional literature, annual reports, security
analyst reports, and other publications.  In addition, there were
formal and informal interviews with coal producers, electric
utilities, air pollution control equipment producers,
instrumentation producers, suppliers of environmental services,
technical experts, government officials, trade association
officials, and personnel of the companies themselves.<P>

</CENTER>

<B>STUDY GOAL AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>

The objective of this report is to provide a basic understanding and
independent investigation of the chemical products, applications, technology,
and competitive scenario of the caulk/ sealant market.<P>

Included in this assessment will be credible market estimates and forecasts
along with key factors which will impact the market.  The replacement of
lower-performance materials by higher-performance versions will be
highlighted.<P>


<B>REASONS FOR DOING THE STUDY</B><P>

Primary reasons for undertaking this study are to reassess a large specialty
chemical market which has been undergoing difficult times and to present a
reasonable future outlook.  Many of the companies in caulks/sealants are also
involved in adhesives as well.<P>


<B>SCOPE & FORMAT</B><P>

The definition of a sealant in Hawley's Condensed Chemical Dictionary reads as
follows:  "any organic substance that is soft enough to pour or extrude and is
capable of subsequent hardening to form a permanent bond with a substrate."
There is no definition of "caulk" in almost any chemical dictionary, and the
reader is referred to "sealants."<P>

For this report, a sealant is defined as any material used to fill a void and
prevent passage of liquids, solids, or gases between two substrates.  This
definition includes caulks, preformed, non-cured, and partially cured
materials.  Surface coatings such as paints and roofing materials are excluded
from this definition.<P>

All caulks are sealants, but not all sealants are caulks.  The term "caulk"
was first used to describe materials such as hemp fibers impregnated with tar
or pitch (oakum), or putty - a mixture of chalk with linseed oil.  Development
of synthetic polymers along with subsequent formulation technologies led to
the term "sealant," a term now used collectively for caulks and newer
formulated materials based on these synthetic polymers. Most products
considered as caulks or sealants are pourable (able to be applied with a
special gun-like apparatus) and also termed "gunnable."  Most homeowners
readily recognize the caulking gun.<P>

To simplify reading of this report, caulks and sealants will be referred to as
"caulks/sealants" for the remainder of the report.<P>

This report includes only form-in-place gaskets and pre-formed gaskets
designed for weather stripping applications.  Examples are silicone formed-in-
place gaskets used by the auto industry (oil pan and axle hub sealing) and
polyurethane or PVC foam for weather stripping.  Faucet washers, O-rings, and
after-market oil pan gaskets, etc., are excluded.<P>

There are several other polymer-based materials that are excluded because
their primary function is more of a cementing (adhesive) than sealing
function.  These include the following:<P>

<UL>--- epoxies ... used as in situ polymerized materials in adhesives, flooring,
protective coatings, and laminates<P>

--- phenolics ... two-package systems of silica or carbon fillers containing
an acid setting agent (p-toluene sulfonic acid) and an A-stage phenolic resin<P>

--- unsaturated polyesters ... fibrous glass-reinforced unsaturated polyesters
often filled with silica or calcium carbonate used as plastic cements in sewer
pipe and in plastic concrete<P>

--- urea resins ... kaolin-filled urea-formaldehyde resins used to seal cracks
in underground irrigation pipes<P>

--- furan resins ... two-package resin cements used extensively as mortars,
and grouts for brick and tile</UL><P>

It is also important to clarify the difference between adhesives and
caulks/sealants, especially since they are often produced and marketed by the
same company.<P>

An adhesive, as defined by Hawley's Condensed Chemical Dictionary is "any
substance, inorganic or organic, natural or synthetic, that is capable of
bonding other substances together by surface attachment."<P>

Many adhesives also function, in a secondary manner, as a caulk/ sealant in that a void is filled between the substrates thus preventing the passage of gases, liquids, or solids.  Similarly, some caulks/sealants have substantial adhesive properties ("tack"), and serve to hold two substrates together.  As technologies advance caulks/sealants are being formulated with epoxies to improve their adhesive qualities.<P>

The determinant of whether a product is a caulk/sealant or an adhesive in this
report is the product's primary intended use often a subjective judgment since
suppliers often claim dual functionality for their caulk/sealant and adhesive
products. Truthfully, it is often difficult to differentiate since the product
adequately performs both functions - one example will suffice.<P>

In structural glazing - a construction process where glass panels in high rise
buildings are held in place by caulks/sealants - silicone products may be used
without any mechanical means of fastening.  This can be clearly defined as an
adhesive application since the silicone material is being used to bond the
glass and metal surfaces together. On the other hand, it also serves as a
caulk/sealant because it prevents the passage of gases, liquids, or solids
through the joint.  This report would include the use of silicone materials in
this application as a sealant, primarily because it has appreciable volume.<P>

The report will initially describe and analyze caulk/sealant chemicals and
will include resins, elastomers, and additives.  After the discussion of
caulk/sealant product forms, application markets will be covered followed by a
review of technologies.  R & D/new products, standards and testing, and
application equipment are the next sections of the report.  Industry structure
including distributors, competitive situation, major producers/suppliers,
marketing, acquisitions/divestitures, and pricing comprise the next section. The report concludes with a discussion of government regulations/environmental concerns, company profiles, and the Appendix.<P>


<B>METHODOLOGY</B><P>

Within this framework of definitions and categories, information was initially
gathered from suppliers' trade literature to ensure that their products were
properly represented in terms of properties, tradenames, and suggested or
actual applications.<P>

Further correspondence and telephone conversations with major caulk/sealant
suppliers sorted out any lingering discrepancies.<P>

A thorough literature search was the next step in the information-gathering
process. Sources included trade magazines, U.S. government and trade
association data, and a variety of contacts within the industry developed over 20 years.<P>


<B>INFORMATION SOURCES</B><P>

Some of the sources included:<P>

<UL>--- Chemicalweek<BR>
--- Chemical & Engineering News<BR>
--- Chemical Marketing Reporter<BR>
--- Kirk-Othmer, Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology<BR>
--- U.S. International Trade Commission<BR>

<B>STUDY GOALS AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>

The objective of this report is to provide a basic understanding of the events
surrounding the "commodity polymer revolution," highlighting polyolefins and
polystyrene.<P>

Reasonable market estimates and forecasts along with a proposed timetable are
included.  The impact of these new products on conventional commodity and
specialty products will be highlighted.<P>


<B>REASONS FOR DOING STUDY</B><P>

Although growth across many plastics sectors has leveled, polymer modification
is experiencing renewed vigor.  In fact, some recent catalyst developments can
now be considered as important as the breakthroughs of the 1950s and 1960s.
And now, these new commodities are competing in both new and old market
niches.<P>

This study therefore clarifies the changing scenario and assesses the
realistic commercial penetration possibilities of these new materials over the
next five years.<P>


<B>SCOPE AND FORMAT</B><P>

The materials covered in this report include polyethylenes, polypropylenes and
polystyrene.  Each of these, of course, has distinct commercial sub-
categories, but not all of them are involved in the "polyolefin/polystyrene
revolution."<P>

This new comprehensive BCC study examines the major technological advances
occurring in metallocene-based single site catalysts, as well as Spherilene,
Unipol, and Catallog processes.  To "round-out" the scenario, random
polypropylene copolymers, bimodals, LDPEs, and Dow's octene/LLDPEs are also
discussed.<P>

There are several problems that became evident and are dealt with in this study:<P>

          -   What constitutes a "new" product?<P>
          -   What is meant by "new materials"?<P>
          -   How do we deal with the complexity of
              technology, especially in terms of relating
              polymer structure to properties and eventually to
              potential applications?<P>
          -   How may we break through the reticence of
              many key companies to discuss details of their
              technologies and potential markets?<P>
          -   How best may we separate the hype in the trade
              press from the realities of the marketplace?<P>
          -   What's really the truth when intense competition
              among producers often cause them to be critical
              of the efforts of other companies?<P>
          -   How do we know what the future holds for these
              products when none is available in "commercial"
              quantities as of the end of the third quarter of
              1993?<P>
          -   How do we best asses the long term impact of
              these new products to the year 2000 and beyond?<P>

As to the definition of a commercial product, there appear to be five levels:<P>

<UL>          -   in development<BR>
          -   trial runs completed (pilot plant)<BR>
          -   some product available for testing (lab)<BR>
          -   product being evaluated by users<BR>
          -   product actually been sold<P></UL>

None of the "new" products have reached the last stage.<P>

Therefore, a "new" product will be defined as one which should reach full
commercialization by 1998.  Clearly, several are already being tested by
processors/potential end-users.  When discussed in a general context, these
will be called "new polyolefins/polystyrenes" and will be cited as such in the
report (without the quotation marks).<P>

Additional concepts dealt with in this report:<P>

<LI>   Those new materials which include only polyethylenes and polypropylenes
will be called "polyolefins" (without quotation marks).  When discussing the
various new polyethylenes, the term "polyethylenes" will be used (without
quotation marks).<P>

<LI>   Many of the markets which will be targeted by these new products are
discrete, while others are very broad, e.g., specialty films.  Indeed, the
one area of agreement is that the initial impact will be in "specialty"
markets in the $1+ 20c/lb area.  A major bone of contention is if and when
these new polymers will impact commodity markets.<P>

<LI>   The market data will be segmented into definable and non-definable areas.
Actual estimated values will appear in the former and not the latter.

<LI>   The "polyolefin/polystyrene revolution" is real and follows on the heels of
other important milestones:<P>

<UL>1930s  ... development of high-pressure process for polyethylene<P>
   1950s  ... discovery of stereoregular polyolefins (isotactic
        polypropylene)<P>
    1970s  ... development of low-pressure gas phase technology for
        linear polyolefins (UNIPOL)<P>
   1990s ... development of metallocene single-site catalysis<P></UL>

<LI>   There have been other non-polymerization catalyst technology-related
advances in the polymer field such as polymer alloys/blends and development of
thermoplastic elastomers (TPEs).<P>

<LI>   It must be stressed that metallocenes are not the only "new" catalyst
polymerization technologies, e.g., Himont's CATALLOY and SPHERILENE,
bimodals, Union Carbide's UNIPOL II, and others.  All of these and
others will be covered in this report.<P>


<B>METHODOLOGY</B><P>

Information was gathered from suppliers' trade literature followed by an
exhaustive analysis of trade magazines from 1990 to the present.<P>

Technical texts were consulted to clarify important points, and extensive
interviews were conducted with major polyolefin/polystyrene producers.<P>


<B>INFORMATION SOURCES</B><P>

Some of the sources included:<P>

<UL>Chemicalweek<BR>
 Chemical & Engineering News<BR>
      Chemical Marketing Reporter<BR>
      Modern Plastics<BR>
     Plastics Technology<BR>
     Plastics News<BR>
   Rubber & Plastics News<BR>
  Rubber Technology - 3rd Edition (Maurice Morton)<BR>
    Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology (Kirk-Othmer)<BR>
   Encyclopedia of Polymer Science & Engineering (Wiley)<P></UL>

Extensive interviews were conducted with the major companies involved,
including: Amoco, Chisso, Dow, Exxon, Fina, Himont, Mobil, Phillips, Quantum,
Union Carbide, etc.<P>

In regard to market information, all values were given in pounds because
prices for the new polyolefins/polystyrenes are widely divergent and
continually changing.<P>

Growth rates for these materials were excluded because they were all starting
from a base volume of zero.  Tradenames (and catalytic process names) appear
in upper case letters.<P>

This report presents the findings of an analysis of the U.S. market for
polymers in the wire and cable industry.  Wire and cable is undergoing
technological changes in communications, where fiber optics are rapidly
replacing copper wire, and in high-temperature and plenum wire, where there
are problems with smoke and toxic gases during combustion.<P>


<B>STUDY GOALS AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>

This report brings to the reader a detailed analysis of the use of polymers as
insulating and jacketing materials in wire and cable, with emphasis on future
trends, changing technology, and opportunities.<P>

The major objectives of this study are as follows:<P>

<LI>  To make available the most current and reliable information
         on consumption of polymers in wire and cable applications.<P>

<LI>   To forecast the market for these applications, broken down
         insofar as possible by end use and by individual product or
         product group.<P>

<LI>   To identify the most rapidly changing applications and the
         reasons for their growth or decline.<P>

<LI>   To describe the major trends in the end uses.<P>

    <LI>   To provide a description of the most important companies
         supplying polymers to wire and cable applications.<P>


<B>REASONS FOR DOING THE STUDY</B><P>

Although there have been studies of materials used in wire and cable, none have
addressed the changes in the market that are occurring because of the new
developments described above.  This report, therefore, fills a need for a new
comprehensive and detailed study of the current and future demand for polymer
materials.<P>


<B>SCOPE</B><P>

This report covers all important polymers used in wire and cable applications,
as well as flame retardant systems needed to meet the new low-smoke
requirements.  Flame retardants seem to be the most controversial ingredient
currently used in wire and cable compounds.  The report does not, however,
cover other additives such as fillers, plasticizers, and rubber chemicals.<P>


<B>METHODOLOGY AND SOURCES OF INFORMATION</B><P>

Information on market size, growth rates, technological trends, and regulatory
influences was obtained from interviews with key marketing personnel with
suppliers of polymers, wire and cable, flame retardants, and other additives.<P>

Secondary sources include published government data, and reviews of trade
journals such as "Chemical & Engineering News," "Chemical Marketing Reporter,"
"Laser Focus World," and "Modern Plastics."<P>

Product literature from selected major suppliers was also reviewed.<P>

<B>STUDY GOALS AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>

The objective of this study is to provide a market analysis of
polymer property modifiers developed via post-polymerization
processes as opposed to those properties imparted by new catalyst
polymerization technologies.<P>

Market estimates and forecasts will be included for selected major
property modifiers, and their polymer substrates. Major
applications will be discussed in qualitative terms. Important
property modifier suppliers, their product lines, and other
important factors that impact this market will be discussed, and
estimated sales and market shares provided where feasible.<P>


<B>REASONS FOR DOING STUDY</B><P>

There is continuing interest in upgrading both commodity and
specialty polymers.  Recently, there has been a great deal of
activity in catalyst polymerization technologies as one means of
improving polymer properties.<P>

Another major technique to upgrade polymers is via post-polymerization methods during compounding. Improved property modifiers
along with the introduction of new modifying materials has prompted
interest which led to this study.<P>

Impact modifiers, reinforcing agents, compatibilizers, coupling
agents, and nucleating/clarifying agents were selected for this
study because of their advantageous affects on polymer properties.<P>


<B>SCOPE AND FORMAT</B><P>

This study describes the chemistry, properties and markets for
structural modifiers, use with specific polymer substrates and
overall applications.  The report provides current estimates and
five-year forecasts by property modifier types in both pounds and -
dollars.<P>

The difference between modifiers and additives is not really clear.
Modifiers are generally used to change a specific property, while
additives add a characteristic to a polymer.  The latter normally
includes: flame retardants, colorants, heat/light stabilizers, etc.<P>

This report also covers polymer alloys/blends since they are
involved with compatibilizers and are often impact modified.<P>

The polymer property modifiers quantitatively reviewed in this
study are:<P>

<UL> - impact modifiers<BR>  
-  nucleating agents<BR>
-  compatibilizers    <BR>
-  reinforcing agents<BR>
  -  coupling agents<P></UL>

Where feasible, volumes of polymers modified will be included.<P>


<B>EXCLUSIONS</B><P>

Since any additive to a polymer is, in essence, a modifier because
it affects properties of the substrate, this field (modifiers/-
additives) is very large.<P>

Generally, this report will focus on thermoplastics, although some
discussion of thermosets will be included.  By necessity, the
following will also be generally excluded:  antiblockers,
fragrances, fillers, plasticizers, antioxidants, light & heat
stabilizers, catalysts, flame retardants, colorants, blowing agents
and processing aids.<P>

The confusing issue of how to deal with elastomer-containing
thermoplastics vs. various polymer alloys/blends is a thorny one.
For the purposes of this study, where the elastomeric component is
significant, the product will be considered a polymer alloy/blend
and will be generally excluded.<P>

Whereas the elastomeric portion is not significant, it will be
viewed as a modifier of a thermoplastic and thus included.<P>


<B>METHODOLOGY</B><P>

Information was gathered from supplier's trade literature followed
by a detailed analysis of trade magazines from 1990 to the present.<P>

Technical texts were consulted to clarify important points, and
extensive interviews were conducted with major polymer property
modifier producers and suppliers.<P>



<B>INFORMATION SOURCES</B><P>

Some of the sources included:<P>

<UL>--- Chemicalweek<BR>

--- Chemical & Engineering News<BR>

--- Chemical Marketing Reporter<BR>

--- Modern Plastics<BR>

--- Plastics Compounding<BR>

--- Rubber & Plastics News<BR>

--- Rubber Technology - 3rd Edition (Maurice Morton)<BR>

--- Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology (Kirk-Othmer)<BR>

--- Encyclopedia of Polymer Science & Engineering (Wiley)<P></UL>

Extensive interviews were conducted with individuals and major
companies involved in all aspects of polymer modification.<P>

All dollar values are in current 1993 dollars, "millions" are often
abbreviated as "MM," growth rates are annually compounded, and
tradenamed products appear in upper-case letters.<P>

The terms "alloy," "blend," and "alloy/blend" are used
interchangeably.<P>

<B>STUDY OBJECTIVES</B><P>

One may argue that the trend toward miniaturization in the
electronics industry was consumer-initiated or it was manufacturer-initiated.  However, there is no doubt that the availability of
portable electronic devices has led to a resurgence of the U.S.
electronics industry after a few years of slowed growth in the late
1980s to early 1990s.<P>

This study analyzes the emergence of the portable electronics
device as a major factor in the electronics industry, with
particular attention shown to the impact that such devices have had
on the type and volume of plastics employed vis-*-vis larger,
stationary devices, or in some cases, how new products created new
markets for plastics which did not exist before the 1990s.<P>


<B>SCOPE AND FORMAT</B><P>

This study is basically a review and analysis of plastics resins
and electronics products.  It is a supplemental version of a study
done in 1992 on plastics enclosures for electronics products.
However, that study did not discuss in detail the types of products
targeted in this study, namely such portable electronic devices as:<P>

<UL> - laptop/notebook/pen-based computers<BR>
-  navigational devices<BR>
-                  video games<BR>
- telephones & other communications devices<BR>
-  calculators<BR>
-                   musical keyboards<BR>
- blank media<BR>  
-            data organizers<BR>
- audio/visual products<BR>  
- watches and other timepieces<BR>
- spell checkers<BR>
            -      translators<P></UL>

The plastics involved span the spectrum from the commodity to
engineering-type resins.  The primary materials included are ABS,
polycarbonate, polystyrene, PVC, modified polyphenylene oxide and
blends of those resins. Cost/performance comparisons of these
competing resins rationalize the material selection process for
specific products.  Our conclusions are based on discussions with
the primary players in resin supply (including compounders) and the
plastics molders which serve the electronics industry.  The key
plastics molding technologies are highlighted with specific
emphasis on trends in such technologies arising from the different
requirements for portable devices compared to stationary devices.<P>


In addition to the data on resins and products, we have identified
the major issues which impact on the use of portable electronics,
namely electronic industry macroeconomics, the influence of
foreign-based manufacture, shielding regulations and standards and
consumer attitudes toward electronic products which provide the
functionality of stationary devices but offer the portability
characteristics of convenience and flexibility.<P>

Current and forecast demand data are presented for the years 1990,
1992, 1993 and 1998.  These data points represent the most accurate
description of the current demand situation, and provide an insight
into the short-term growth that can be expected.  Five-year average
annual growth rates are calculated for the period 1993-1998.<P>


<B>METHODOLOGY</B><P>

The research for this study included personal contacts with key
participants among the OEM electronics manufacturers, resin
suppliers, molders and compounders.  The information gathered from
these primary sources formed the basis for our estimates of current
resin usage in portable electronics enclosures.  Their forecasts
for future demand of resin and product were merged with our
analysis of electronics trends and the probabilities of resin
consumption to meet future demand.  Our final analyses and
projections are based on a combination of a consensus among the
primary contacts and our understanding of the impact of trends from
a historical perspective.<P>

In addition, we reviewed secondary sources of information such as
trade publications, trade associations, company literature,
industry conferences and on-line databases to supplement our
understanding of the markets, applications and trends affecting the
resins used in portable electronics devices.  Finally,
macroeconomic data and import/export data from government sources
yielded information on the importance of portable devices within
the overall electronics industry and the influence of foreign-based
manufacture on U.S. demand.<P>


<B>CONTRIBUTION OF THE STUDY</B><P>

Although the market for portable electronic devices is changing
rapidly with the constant introduction of new, enhanced products,
the plastic materials which will be employed during the next five
years are relatively constant.  This study will benefit plastics
resin suppliers and electronic industry officials (e.g., materials
design engineers, plastics purchasing agents and new product
design/marketing teams) by providing information on the important
trends in plastic material preferences for enclosures and the logic
behind those preferences.<P>

The portable segment of the electronics industry is the driving
force for overall electronics growth.  These products are
increasingly gaining in share versus stationary devices as the
market is expanding beyond the traditional commercial office,
laboratory and manufacturing environments into consumer/home
applications.  Consequently, our attention is drawn to this segment
which will dominate the electronics industry into the next century.<P>



<B>RELATED BCC STUDIES</B><P>

BCC has followed the electronics industry closely due to its
importance both in terms of its size and its rapidly-changing
technologies, particularly as they impact on plastics usage.  For
example, a series of EMI/RFI shielding studies has been done
periodically for the last twenty years, the most recent published
earlier this year.  In addition, there are several recently-
published studies, cited below, which analyze the technologies,
materials and markets for electronics products.<P>

<B>STUDY GOALS AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>

The objective of this study is to provide an analysis of styrene
polymers in terms of current and forecasted markets.  New
developments in styrene polymers have expanded usage in existing
and new applications.  The competitive scenario between styrene and
other polymers will be described, in addition to competition among
styrene polymers themselves.  In some cases, styrenics have
replaced non-plastic materials.<P>

Important suppliers of styrene polymers, their product lines, and
other important factors that impact the market will be discussed.<P>


<b>REASONS FOR DOING STUDY</B><P>

Styrene polymers have evolved as more than commodity polystyrene. 
Even with ABS reaching "commodity status" with volumes over one
billion pounds and prices in the $.80/lb. range, other styrene
polymers have become successful and important commercial products. 
Styrene polymers have found use in almost every plastic application
and are available as rigid thermoplastic films, sheet, foams, and
elastomers.  Furthermore, styrene polymers form an important part
of alloys/blends and thermoplastic elastomers (TPEs).<P>

Styrene polymers comprise about 12% of total U.S. resin sales; 15%
of thermoplastic sales; and have equivalent volumes with
poly-propylene -- the third ranking resin behind polyethylene and
PVC.<P>

Styrene polymer growth rates should keep pace with both
polyethylenes and PVC although aggregate styrene polymer prices are
higher than polyethylene, PVC, and polypropylene.<P>


<b>SCOPE AND FORMAT</B><P>

The term "styrene polymers" is somewhat subjective.  For the
purposes of this report, it will include the following:<P>

<UL>-  polystyrene (injection molded, extruded, thermoformed,
   film/sheet, and foam/expanded)<P>
-  ABS (acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene)<P>
-  SAN (styrene-acrylonitrile)<P>
-  SMA (styrene-maleic anhydride)<P>
-  SBC (styrene butadiene block copolymers -- also called
   thermoplastic styrenes)<P>
-  HIPS (high-impact polystyrene)<P>
-  PPO/HIPS (polyphenylene oxide/high-impact polystyrene
   alloy/blend)<P>
-  PC/ABS (polycarbonate/ABS alloy/blend)<P>
-  Other ABS alloys/blends (PVC, PBT, polyurethanes, etc.)<P>
-  Other styrenic alloys/blends.<P></UL>

Styrene-butadiene rubbers will be excluded from this study.<P>

The following styrenic applications will be covered in this report:<P>

<UL>-  adhesives<BR>
-  appliances<BR>
-  automotive<BR> 
-  building/construction<BR>
-  business machines<BR> 
-      consumer & other
electronics<BR>
-  food packaging<BR> 
-  furniture/furnishings<BR>
-  housewares<BR>
-  lawn/garden equipment & tools<BR>
-  medical<BR> 
 -      other packaging<BR>
-  polymer modifiers<BR> 
-      sport/leisure<BR>
-  telecommunications<BR>
 -  toys/novelties</UL><P>


<b>METHODOLOGY</B><P>

A comprehensive review was undertaken of: literature relating to
styrene polymers, their applications and technology, and
significant new developments; supplier trade literature; texts and
monographs, etc.<P>

Following the collection and analysis of this information,
extensive interviews were conducted with many producers, suppliers,
and compounders of styrene polymers.<P>


<b>ACRONYMS</B><P>

The following acronyms will be used throughout the report:<P>

<UL>ASA  -    acrylic-styrene-acrylonitrile<BR>
ABS  -    acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene<BR>
EPS  -    expandable PS<BR>
HIPS -    high-impact polystyrene<BR>
OPS  -    oriented polystyrene<BR>
PPO  -    polyphenylene oxide<BR>
PS   -    polystyrene<BR>
SAN  -    styrene-acrylonitrile<BR>
SBCs -    styrene-butadiene block copolymers<BR>
SMA  -    styrene-maleic anhydride<BR>
SPS  -    syndiotactic polystyrene</UL><P>

Trade names will appear in upper case letters, volumes are in
millions/MM of pounds/lbs., and dollar values in 1994 dollars. 
Growth rates are annually compounded.  Alloys and/or blends will be
noted as "alloys/blends," and Dow Chemical will be written as
either "Dow" or "Dow Plastics."<P>

<B>OBJECTIVES</B><P>

The U.S. market for plastics disposables is growing steadily as the
population increases, the need to reduce the costs of healthcare
persists, and Americans continue to seek convenience and protection 
for their products.<P> 

We demonstrate in this study that disposable products, chiefly
composed of plastics, can contribute to our society's need for
quality healthcare at an affordable price, while concurrently
supporting efforts to improve the environment.  Other markets also
benefit from the trend toward disposables and away from reusable
products as being consistent with the desire to better handle the
disposal of waste.  The study reveals that the use of plastics will
accomplish that objective.<P> 

<b>SCOPE AND FORMAT</B><P> 

This study targets those plastic products viewed as "disposable,"
in the sense that the products are single use or at least complete
their function in a relatively short time.  Arbitrarily, we have
selected a period of one year as the maximum useful use in our
definition of disposable.<P>

The dominant plastic materials used in these applications are the
thermoplastics, particularly the commodity plastics of
polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, and PVC.  The study,
however, identifies and quantifies all thermoplastics employed in
packaging and non-packaging, including engineering resins. 
Plastics consumption is analyzed as intramaterial and intermaterial
competition (i.e., versus such non-plastics as glass, paper, and
metal in terms of cost and performance).<P>   

The study follows the resins consumed in disposables from the resin
suppliers and distributors, through the grades of resin used,
competing materials, and identifies the major manufacturers and
suppliers.  These data are presented in a framework of current
trends in materials, markets, and technologies within the structure
of the several industries which consume plastics disposables.<P>  

In addition to a description of resins used in typical products,
our analyses include specific product offerings, particularly where
material selected, product design, or manner of use represents an
innovation versus traditional consumption.<P>  

Since these products are consumed in a highly regulated
environment, an important aspect of the study is a discussion of
the regulatory agencies and specific regulations which determine
the types of resins which may be used, the role of safety and
health issues, and the potential liabilities associated not only
with resins but also with product design in terms of performance in
use.<P>

A significant amount of time was spent on the medical and
pharmaceutical sector of many reasons. That sector is different
from general packaging markets due to the extensive amount of
regulation involving medical packaging and medical disposable
devices. In addition, there is more activity in terms of innovative
product designs and material enhancement (e.g., adaptability to
sterilization techniques). Among the materials consumed in medical
disposables, plastics are the leaders. Finally, the
medical/pharmaceutical market represents a major outlet for
plastics disposables, both in terms of dollars and pounds.<P>

The reader should note that not all medical (or other) disposables
are accounted for in the demand tables. There are niche markets for
which no data are available, for example, plastic stirrers. While
there may be several such markets, we believe that their
contribution to total plastics demand in disposables is negligible.
Likewise, there may be some small markets excluded where non-
plastics materials are consumed. Again, however, we believe such
markets would not alter the total demand reported by material
(where applicable) or the relevant growth rates.<P>  

The demand data shown represent current (1994) levels through the
next ten years.  Data are keyed to the years 1993, 1994, and 1999
with average annual growth rates calculated for the 5-year 1994-
1999 time period.<P>

<b>METHODOLOGY</B><P>

In addition to telephone interviews with resin suppliers,
fabricators, and end users, we have gathered data and insight from
trade associations and government agencies.  These contacts have
been supplemented with information obtained from the technical and
marketing trade publications and relevant data from previous BCC
studies.<P>

All BCC estimates of future demand are based on our interpretation
of the information received from an extensive list of industry
specialists.  Thus, we believe this study represents an accurate
view of the current and future demand for disposables.<P>

<b>CONTRIBUTION OF THE STUDY</B><P>

The U.S. market for plastics disposables is now a 19 billion pound
business, which accounts for 30% of total plastics demand. 
Plastics consumption in the U.S. healthcare industry for disposable
products alone grew at 9.7% annually from 1987 to 1992, compared to
a 2.2% growth rate for plastics overall during that period. 
Medical/pharmaceutical disposables now account for about 2% of
total U.S. plastics consumption.  This combination of widespread
use and fast growth confirms the importance of such products for
the future of the plastics industry.<P>

This study is intended for use by companies along the chain of
distribution of disposable products -- resin suppliers,
distributors, and fabricators, plus companies which participate in
the packaging and non-packaging industries with nonplastics
products.  Our comprehensive analyses identify those resins which
will have the greatest future success in healthcare products and
the reasons for their use versus competing plastics and non-
plastics.<P>

<B>STUDY GOALS AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>

The objective of this study is to provide an analysis of the automotive 
exterior plastics market in terms of current and forecasted values.<P> 


<b>REASONS FOR DOING THE STUDY</B><P>

The automotive exterior plastics market is fiercely competitive, with plastics 
vying with aluminum and steel.  Intraplastic competition is also a major 
factor in this market, especially with "plastic intensive" autos.  
Thermoplastics are also competing with thermosets for body panels, fenders and 
other major exterior parts.<P> 


<b>SCOPE AND FORMAT</B><P>

This report will cover automotive exterior plastic parts segmented by major 
types such as commodity thermoplastics, engineering resins, thermosets, 
polymer alloys/blends, TPEs, etc. Applications will be broken down into the 
following categories: body panels, bumper systems, fenders, transparent auto 
exteriors and housings and other exterior parts.  Over 20 more detailed 
applications will be covered, including roofs, doors, bumper beams and covers, 
radiator grilles, side trim, hoods, wheel covers, etc.<P> 

Other critical topics covered will include processing, marketing, research and 
development activities, new production introductions, recycling, major product 
lines of suppliers, etc.<P> 

Report also includes statistics and data on major resins used in automotive 
exterior.<P> 


<b>METHODOLOGY</B><P>

A comprehensive review was undertaken of trade and technical literature 
relating to auto exterior plastics, specific applications, technologies, new 
developments, etc.  Included in this review were supplier trade literature, 
texts and monographs.<P> 

Following collection and analysis of this information, extensive interviews 
were conducted with polymer and elastomer producers and suppliers. 

All dollar values are in 1994 dollars, "millions" are often abbreviated as 
"MM", growth rates are annually compounded and trade-named products appear in 
upper case letters.<P>

<B>STUDY OBJECTIVES</B><P>

This study reviews the various methods by which plastics are
transported to the plastic processors.  The dominant companies in
this distribution of plastics are the compounders, of which there
are independents, toll-type, proprietary and custom, the resin
companies, and the plastics processors themselves.  These companies
add value to the resin through application of additives and
reinforcing agents.<P>  

The other major category includes the distributors, which generally
do not add value to the resin but rather repackage large quantities
(e.g. truck-load) into smaller quantities for the processors.  By
1994, more than $1 billion worth of resins passed through
distributors.  The study also includes the activities of other
types of companies which may or may not actually handle the resins
but rather manage the contract paperwork between buyers and
sellers.  These companies are alternatively identified as jobbers,
brokers or resellers.  These same companies may also be
compounders, distributors or recyclers.<P>


<b>SCOPE AND FORMAT</B><P>

This study follows the path of plastics from original producer
through the end user, which may be a custom or proprietary
processor or an OEM.  In addition, the equipment and additives used
by the compounders are highlighted since they play a vital role in
compounder activity.<P>  

The study includes key trends in technology, services, material
handling and the economics related to compounding.  A major section
is the identification and profiles of the major participants in the
compounding/distribution industry.  Finally, data track the
estimated movement of resin via the different types of companies
from resin producer to end user.<P>

The demand data are presented for 1993, 1994 and 1999, with a five-
year growth rate calculated for 1994-1999.  These data are
generally in pounds and dollars so that comparisons can be made
with the rest of the plastics industry.<P>


<b>METHODOLOGY</B><P>

The primary data gathered for this study involved telephone contact
with the major compounders, distributors and other types of
resellers, machinery companies, and recyclers.  This primary
research was reinforced with information gathered from the main
trade association for the plastics distributors, trade journals and
past BCC studies.<P>


<b>CONTRIBUTION OF THE STUDY</B><P>

One of the key trends in the plastics industry is that an
increasing amount of resins are being modified to "tailor" them to
specific applications.  Resin companies are limiting their sales to
major customers, leaving the small- and medium-sized processors to
deal with compounders and distributors, particularly for specialty
resins and alloys/blends.  By the year 2000, it is estimated that
30% of plastics processors will be serviced by distributors.  In
addition, the growth of the plastics recycling industry will impact
directly on the relationship between resin producers and their
customers, create new demand for compounding equipment
manufacturers, and boost interest in compounding technology.<P>  

It is apparent that the compounding/distribution industry is
becoming a major force in the resin-to-processor distribution
channel.  Thus, our review of this industry's progress should be of
interest to resin producers, machinery suppliers and additive
suppliers.<P> 


<b>RELATED BCC STUDIES</B><P>

BCC has followed the plastics compounding industry for many years,
specializing in resin technologies that have influenced
compounding.  Listed below are some of the more recent studies done
on that industry as well as those which track trends in recycling
and disposability -- which are of interest to the recyclers.<P>

<B>SCOPE AND FORMAT</B>

<P>This study is part of a continuing BCC series on the markets for plastics by type of
process used.  Extrusion accounts for the most plastics processed at more than
20 billion pounds annually or about one-third of the total plastics industry.  The
study discusses the major application areas for extruded products such as
pipe/conduit, wire/cable, film/sheet, hose/tubing, profiles, extrusion coatings
and extruded foam.  Virtually all of the thermoplastics are involved but the
emphasis is placed on the leading resins consumed -- the polyolefins, PVC and
polystyrene.  In addition to the description and data for each application and a
technology review, the major players in each application area are ranked by
sales.</P> 

<P>Data are reported for 1994, 1995 and 2000, with forecast growth rates for the
1995-2000 period.</P>

<B>METHODOLOGY</B>

<P>The research for this study included personal contacts with key participants
among the wide range of raw material suppliers, processors, and end users in all
of the major markets served by extrusion.  The information gathered from
primary sources formed the basis for our estimates of current plastics usage. 
Their comments on future demand were considered with supporting
macroeconomic data to evolve our 5-year forecasts.</P>

<P>In support of the primary research, we reviewed secondary sources of
information such as past BCC studies, the plastics trade publications, trade
associations, company literature and annual reports, industry conferences and
on-line databases.</P>

<H3><I>INTRODUCTION</I></H3>
</CENTER>

Business Communications Company first studied the pallet business in the early
1970s.  Here in 1992 we return to this marketplace, and we chronicle the trends over
the past and over the coming years in terms of the materials and the markets for this
product.<P>


<B>STUDY GOAL AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>

The pallet has been a fundamental part of the materials handling business since the
1930s.  In the early days the wooden pallet, nailed or bolted together, was the
industry standard, and competition for shares of this growing business was waged
among the various softwood and hardwood unit fabricators.  After World War II the
metal pallet, made of roll formed and welded steel, was developed in response to
the need for units with greater load-bearing strength and toughness.  Yet the metal
pallet was expensive to produce, and it also added extra transportation costs to
shipments due to its extreme weight.<P>

The pallet business had a new entrant in the late 1960s - namely the structural foam
molded plastic pallet.  These units were promoted on the basis of their light weight,
unified construction, durability, and resistance to moisture and other environmental
conditions.  Their relatively high price (relative to the wood pallet standard) was
justified on the grounds that they would extend the life-cycle of a pallet to 20 or more
trips.  And in the current era when concern for the environment is paramount in
materials decision-making, the plastic pallet is well-positioned since it can so easily
be recycled.<P>

This concern over the role of pallets in materials handling as the environmental
impact becomes a critical decision variable has recently let to increased interest in a
fourth pallet option -  namely, the paperboard pallet which is extremely light weight
and easy to dispose of.  Corrugated or honeycomb construction is used to provide
adequate strength along with light weight.<P>

How will the pallet business fare in the 1990s and which materials are likely to gain
or lose market share as cost, performance, and environmental requirements evolve
over the coming years?  Are there new materials or new combinations of materials
on the horizon?  How will the pallet industry structure change in the 1990s?  These
are some of the issues that we address in this comprehensive analysis of the inter-
material competition and evolving industry dynamics in the pallet segment of the
materials handling industry.<P>

The objectives of this study include the determination and re-examination of:<P>

<UL>

<LI> the overall size of the wood, metal, plastic and paperboard pallet<P>
<LI> industries in units and dollars<P>

<LI> the overall profitability of the pallet industry and its component parts<P>

<LI> the industry structure<P>

<LI>the future growth potential of each of the four segments and why<P>

<LI> the changes manufacturers may have to make to compete successfully  in the next decade<P>

<LI> the importance of environmental issues on the pallet industry<P>

<LI> changing leasing opportunities<P>

<LI> the import/export trends to determine future competitive threats or
            opportunities.<P></UL>

<B>REASONS FOR DOING THIS STUDY</B><P>

The reason for examining the pallet business is to assess an industry which enjoyed
a successful growth record as established by the wooden pallet industry since the
1930's. This group of small business entrepreneurs has successfully grown at a
rapid pace that has exceeded the economy's growth.  The questions of concern are:<P>

<UL>"Can the industry maintain the established pace?"<BR>

            "What will the future bring?"<BR>

            "For which material?"<BR>

            "For which application?"<BR>

            "What are the important market niches, if any?"<P></UL>


<B>CONTRIBUTION OF THE STUDY AND FOR WHOM</B><P>

This study is intended to serve as an aid to pallet producers in their continual
assessment of evolving material preferences and growth prospects by sub-market.  it
is also intended as a guide to future purchasing decisions on the part of pallet end-
users in that we attempt to provide a consensus of the emerging economics (e.g.;
buy vs. lease) and environmental advantages of the various pallet types by materials
and construction.<P>

This study provides insights into the wood, metal, plastic, and paperboard pallet
industry on such issues as future growth, competitive economics, major producers in
key segments, and new technology.<P>

The study is intended for pallet manufacturers interested in determining how their
company fits into the industry, calculating their market share, and learning what may
happen to the industry during the next decade.  Manufacturers will also be interested
in customer perceptions of their products and how they compare with alternate pallet
forms.<P>

Suppliers to the pallet industry will find this report helpful in determining the
potential market size for their products, whether it be machinery or raw materials.
Also, data are presented on a state-by-state basis which is helpful in allocating sales
effort and locating customers.<P>

Pallet users will find the report useful in determining what kinds of pallets to acquire
or lease.  Users can use this report as a reference point for pallet applications that
may fit their particular needs.<P>


<B>SCOPE AND FORMAT</B><P>


This report describes the pallet industry which consists of unit-load platforms
capable of handling loads of up to 4,000 pounds in transit.  These pallets are
intended to be lifted by fork lift trucks.  The four main material types - wood, plastic,
metal and paperboard - are covered in this report.  The report includes domestic
data on the United States only.<P>

The report begins with an overview of the pallet industry showing units, dollars and
prices.  It then moves on to industry structure which identifies shipments by pallet
type, geographic location of the industry, key manufacturers and industry
economics.
Future industry growth is followed by chapters on technology, markets, inter-pallet
competition and international trade.  The purpose is to describe key factors affecting
the future of the pallet industry.<P>


<B>METHODOLOGY</B><P>

The research methodology used is a combination of telephone interviews with key
industry personnel and experts and a careful search of published data from the U. S.
Government and other sources.  The number of people contacted are shown in the

<H3><I>INTRODUCTION</I></H3>
</CENTER>

Polymers, or plastics to most of us, have enormously changed the modern health-care
system. Consider this:<P>

<DD><LI>Today, nearly one out of ten Americans use plastic contact lenses to correct
  vision.<P>

<DD><LI>Everyday, roughly 45,000 Americans with kidney failures get hooked up to
  artificial kidneys, wherein  polymeric membranes  remove life-threatening
  toxins from blood.<P>


<DD><LI>Some 7,000 angiography procedures are performed in the U.S. each day, to
  determine patients' cardiovascular health. A thin plastic tube, known as a
  catheter, is snaked in a patient's blood vessel, and radio-opaque dye is
  injected. Computer enhanced X-ray pictures allow the physician to examine
  blood flow.<P>

<DD><LI>When blood flow is obstructed, catheters equipped with tiny inflatable
  balloons are usually used to dislodge the plaque deposits obstructing the
  arteries.  Such modern medical plumbing often prevents expensive and more invasive
  surgery.<P>


<DD><LI>When major surgery is called for, surgeons perform bypass surgeries, often
  using synthetic plastic blood vessels to bypass damaged large arteries. When
  bypassing damaged coronary arteries, more often than not, it is a membrane
  oxygenator, with a polymeric membrane, that takes over the function of lungs
  during these open-heart procedures.<P>

It is hard to believe that these medical devices and procedures that we take for
granted today, were not commonplace 30 years ago. Materials, and particularly
synthetic polymers, more than anything else, have been instrumental in improving the
quality of our health-care.<P>



<B>OBJECTIVES</B><P>

This study examines a very important segment of the health-care market. It analyzes
technology, current status and future trends of high value-added polymeric raw
materials, and their end products, used in biomedical devices. Polymers have
revolutionized health-care in the past 25 years, and are continuing to improve the
detection and treatment of diseases.<P>

The principal objective of this study is to provide detailed analysis of the various
market segments of high value-added polymeric raw materials. Raw material could be
either virgin polymer, compounded polymer, or polymer processed into value-added
formats, such as membranes, depending upon the starting material for the end user.<P>

Additionally, this study is intended to provide its readers with an overall
understanding of the end use markets for the value-added raw materials. We have
tried to bring out the complex interplay between innovation, market requirements,
regulations and technology.<P>



<B>TARGETED AUDIENCE</B><P>

This study covers detailed analysis of high value-added raw materials, their end use
markets and technologies. It is intended to assist executives of companies involved
with the manufacture or distribution of medical devices, specialty medical polymers
or formatted raw materials, to understand trends, technologies and  the marketplace.
It would also be helpful to prospective entrants in this business, analysts, venture
capitalists, investors and industry watchers.<P>



<B>WHAT IS HIGH VALUE-ADDED?</B><P>

This study is about "High Value-Added Polymeric Raw Materials." How do we define
high value-added?<P>

We mentioned that not only polymer resins but also formatted raw materials such as
membranes will be covered in this report. We'll define very high value-added
polymeric raw materials as those which cost more than $5/lb in the resin form and
more than $50/lb  in a formatted form. Rationale behind this definition is discussed
in detail in the OVERVIEW chapter.<P>


<B>SCOPE OF THIS STUDY</B><P>

This study focuses on High value-added polymeric raw materials in the
biomedical area. For convenience, we'll refer to these as "premium polymerics" in
the remainder of this report. Premium polymerics could be in one of the following
forms:<P>

<DD>1. Resin/powder/liquid/solution/paste of polymer/prepolymer/monomer, often compounded with other additives<BR>
<DD>2. Membranes: flat sheet or hollow fibers<BR>
<DD>3. Beads<BR>
<DD>4. Sheet/rod<P>

To qualify as a premium polymeric, the basic form (#1) should sell, for at least $5 per
pound, whereas the formatted forms (#2 to #4) should sell for at least $50 per pound,
at a wholesale level.<P>

This study analyzes various market segments of premium polymerics. It estimates the
present usage and forecasts future growth. It also describes end use markets, relevant
technologies and regulatory procedures.<P>

The emphasis is on the domestic U.S. market, which is analyzed in detail. However,
there is an international section which does discuss overall world market and trends.<P>



<B>WHICH END USES ARE COVERED?</B><P>

"Biomedical" is a very broad term and often assumes different interpretations. It is
therefore important to clarify the biomedical end use markets targeted in the study.<P>

The scope of this study is outlined in TABLE 1. The shaded left column shows the
applications covered in this study. All applications are for human use only. Veterinary
uses are excluded.<P>

Moreover, this study is limited to end products wherein the polymer will be required
to interact with tissues or body fluids. Therefore, applications such as packaging,
syringes, garments, furniture and instrument casings will not be considered. These
are medical applications, but not biomedical ones, as defined here. Most of these use
commodity type plastics.<P>

Next, we only consider products used as implants or for therapy or treatment.
Therefore passive barrier devices such as condoms, face-shields and gloves are not
included. Products such as diapers are also excluded. Contact lenses, however are
included in our application since they do treat a medical problem of poor vision.<P>

Finally, in the remaining applications, the criteria of high value-added is applied. This
eliminates applications such as blood bags and most medical tubings made up of
commodity type plastics. Catheter use, is however included. Catheter manufacturers
often use premium polymerics as their starting raw material to impart special
properties such as enhanced bio-compatibility or lubricity.<P>
