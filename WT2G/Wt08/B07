<h1>Country Profile - Philippines</h1>
<blockquote>
    <p>Prepared by Control Risks Information Services</p>
    <p>POLITICAL STABILITY</p>
    <p>President Fidel Ramos</p>
    <p>Fidel Ramos, a former army general and defence minister,
    succeeded Corazon Aquino as president in June 1992 after
    winning elections in May with only 23.5% of the total vote.
    The elections were generally peaceful, free and fair and,
    despite his narrow victory, Ramos was quickly recognised as
    the legitimate head of state.</p>
    <p>Since his election, Ramos has steadily consolidated his
    position and authority: opinion polls show that Ramos'
    popularity ratings have risen to more than 65%. Although in
    the past criticised for lack of dynamism, Ramos has displayed
    a steady and astute political style which has strengthened
    the prestige and influence of the presidency and helped to
    ease legislative conflicts with vested interests in Congress.
    Increasingly he has gained a reputation for an energetic,
    hands-on approach to administrative problem-solving. His
    willingness to intervene personally in policy or bureaucratic
    impasses has proved highly effective.</p>
    <p>Unlike Aquino's administration, Ramos' cabinet is free of
    major ideological differences and personality clashes. Ramos
    chose his cabinet mainly from elite business circles (which
    support his policies of gradual economic liberalisation
    leading to increased foreign investment). Top economic posts,
    including the finance and the trade &amp; industry
    portfolios, were given to former businessmen rather than
    technocrats or career politicians.</p>
    <p>Finally, Ramos has consolidated an effective - though not
    foolproof - power base within the legislature - which Aquino
    failed to achieve. Despite the fact that his own party
    coalition, the Lakas ng Edsa-National Union of Christian
    Democrats (NUCD), won only a limited number of seats in
    Congress in 1992, Ramos was able to form and expand a
    supportive 'Rainbow Coalition' of Congressmen. In August 1994
    he took an important step forward by forming an alliance with
    the Laban ng Demokratikong party (LDP), the largest party in
    Congress, to agree common candidates for congressional and
    local government elections in May 1995.</p>
    <p>The results of the May polls - which Ramos made clear
    should be regarded as referendum on his economic policies -
    provided a major boost for his relations with Congress and
    the prospects for his Philippines 2000 reform programme. A
    turn-out of nearly 80% returned a solid victory for
    pro-government candidates: they gained nine of the 12 seats
    at stake in the 24-member Senate and an overwhelming majority
    (around 180 out of 204) in Congress. Seizing the initiative,
    Ramos announced a series of legislative measures to be
    addressed by the new Congress. These include simplifying the
    tax system (a priority), reducing tariffs, modernising health
    and education and reforming the judiciary.</p>
    <p>Despite this success, the pro-Ramos legislative alliance
    is vulnerable to disputes on particular policy issues, and
    personality politics can undermine traditionally weak party
    loyalties. </p>
    <p>The armed forces</p>
    <p>The threat from right-wing military rebels has virtually
    disappeared in the years following their heyday in the 1980s
    and early 1990s, when they staged six coup attempts against
    Aquino's presidency. In the most serious incident, in
    December 1989, more than 100 people were killed in fighting
    focused on Makati, Manila's business district.</p>
    <p>Since 1992 Ramos has offered the rightists an amnesty
    programme, released prominent rebels from jail and held
    formal peace negotiations. The talks have been largely
    successful: the rebels signed a ceasefire in December 1992
    and their leader, Col Gringo Honasan, ran successfully for
    the Senate in the May elections. Honasan supports Ramos'
    plans for economic and social development, and his
    participation in the democratic process further reduces the
    risk of rightist anti-government activity.</p>
    <p>International relations</p>
    <p>The US continued to play a role in Philippine politics
    long after independence in 1946, but by the early 1980s the
    US had long lost the ability to fine-tune Philippine
    politics. During Aquino's presidency, the issue of US bases
    in the Philippines tended to overshadow other aspects of the
    relationship between the two countries. The issue was
    resolved with the closure of the bases in 1991. Since then,
    relations between the two countries have been less
    controversial. The US remains the Philippines' most important
    Western partner by far, but anti-Americanism has been less
    pronounced. Even in the past, opposition denunciations of the
    US have often been based on political opportunism rather than
    deeply-felt convictions.</p>
    <p>The US withdrawal from the Philippine bases has left the
    country more exposed to external military pressure. Concerns
    over this issue have become more acute because of China's
    claim to the Spratly Islands, including the Mischief Reef off
    the western Philippines, which Manila believes to be within
    its maritime boundaries. The Philippines' naval and air
    capabilities are not sufficient to contain Chinese maritime
    expansionism. This is a source of considerable concern to the
    administration, but will not impinge on foreign business.</p>
    <p>The economy</p>
    <p>Economic prospects are good. The Philippines 2000
    development programme, which lies at the heart of the
    government's plans, aims to provide a focus for the
    government's economic and social goals and to enable the
    Philippines to catch up with its more prosperous South-East
    Asian neighbours. </p>
    <p>Since 1992 Ramos has successfully stimulated domestic and
    international investment within the framework of the 1991
    Foreign Investment Act. The act opens up previously
    restricted areas of the economy and allows 100% foreign
    equity in 'strategic industries', including mining. The
    Philippines 2000 programme aims to lift growth rates from
    2.3% in 1993 to around 6% by 1997. It also seeks an inflation
    rate of 4% by 1997 to assist the country's competitiveness
    with a stable exchange rate. The privatisation programme is
    well under way and it is highly unlikely that the Ramos
    administration or its successors will seek to reverse it or
    to nationalise foreign enterprises.</p>
    <p>Despite Ramos' reform achievements, politics and the
    economy remain largely in the hands of a traditional landed
    elite and its patronage network. Around 20% of the population
    owns 80% of the land, while around 40% of Filipinos live
    below the poverty line (defined by the government as $150 a
    month for a family of six). Although a growing public
    awareness of the long-term benefits of economic growth is
    evident, discontent with present harsh social and economic
    conditions can prompt mass demonstrations. Such 'opposition'
    campaigns could lead to periodic nationwide demonstrations
    and strikes, but the overall stability of the administration
    is not under threat.</p>
    <p>THREATS TO SECURITY</p>
    <p>Crime</p>
    <p>The greatest single hazard to foreign business personnel
    and premises stems from crime. Poverty, especially in urban
    areas, encourages pickpocketing, mugging and burglaries.
    There is an abundance of weapons on the streets, and most
    businesses, hotels and banks employ armed guards. Government
    efforts in 1993-94 to crack down on the number of
    unregistered weapons were largely unsuccessful. Armed
    robberies and car hold-ups occur periodically.</p>
    <p>In March 1993 a Japanese tourist and her son were found
    dead in the Dampalit area of Malabon district in Metro-Manila
    and in Ubando (Bulacan province) north of Manila
    respectively. The victims, who had been staying at the
    Philippine Plaza hotel, left the hotel with an unidentified
    tourist guide. The motive for the killings was robbery. Also
    in early 1993, a Japanese tourist was found shot dead in the
    Smokey Mountain slum district in Tondo (Manila).</p>
    <p>Awareness of the risk and sensible precautions can reduce
    the danger from crime to manageable proportions.</p>
    <p>Criminal kidnap gangs</p>
    <p>Gangs target Filipino-Chinese because of their perceived
    wealth and their unwillingness to inform the police of
    abductions. Some families of kidnap victims have refused to
    co-operate with the police because they believe that the
    kidnap gangs are led by corrupt policemen and soldiers.</p>
    <p>Kidnaps of high-profile expatriates are rare. In an
    exceptional incident, Michael Barnes, an executive working
    for Philippine Geothermal Inc (PGI - owned by US company
    Unocal), was kidnapped in January 1992 by the Red Scorpion
    Group (RSG), a kidnap gang comprising common criminals,
    ex-members of the communist New People's Army (NPA), and
    corrupt senior members of the military. A $20m ransom was
    demanded, but police rescued Barnes unharmed in March. The
    NPA denied all official links to the RSG and sentenced the
    group's leader to death. It appears that a number of other
    guerrillas have had contacts with ordinary criminal gangs
    active in Manila. Although the RSG has ceased to pose a
    threat following the police break-up of the group in February
    1993, around 15 other kidnap gangs are believed to operate
    across the country, several of them in and around the Manila
    area.</p>
    <p>The New People's Army</p>
    <p>The NPA, the armed wing of the Communist Party of the
    Philippines (CPP), has been fighting against the government
    since 1969. Since Ferdinand Marcos' fall in 1986 the NPA has
    become increasingly divided. The group has lost ground
    militarily and politically: there is no prospect that the
    movement will be able to overthrow the Ramos government or
    its successor. Ramos has consistently pushed for formal peace
    negotiations with the NPA.</p>
    <p>NPA activity in Manila has declined sharply in recent
    years. The NPA's main areas of strength have been reduced to
    the Bicol region of southern Luzon, Samar and south-eastern
    Mindanao, but the various guerrilla factions maintain a
    low-level presence in wide areas of the country and remain
    capable of launching periodic attacks against military and
    civilian targets.</p>
    <p>The NPA is opposed to 'exploitative' foreign investment on
    ideological grounds, but does not wish to alienate rural
    supporters who welcome job opportunities brought by foreign
    companies. Therefore, the various NPA factions are reluctant
    to attack foreign enterprises without clear 'justification'.
    Of more concern is the NPA's practice of raising funds by
    extorting 'revolutionary taxes' from local and foreign
    companies and aid agencies. However, there have been no
    serious attacks reported against foreign companies in
    relation to extortion demands since June 1992, when a
    40-strong NPA unit attacked the US-owned Franklin Baker
    coconut desiccating plant near Santa Cruz (Mindanao).</p>
    <p>Small local companies and subcontractors are less able to
    resist such extortion demands than are large foreign
    companies. In some cases Philippine state companies and some
    multinationals officially refuse all extortion demands, while
    tacitly accepting that payments are being made by their
    sub-contractors, suppliers and individual workers.</p>
    <p>The ABB</p>
    <p>The Alex Boncayao Brigade (ABB - the NPA's former urban
    assassination squad) attempted to win public support in 1994
    through a continued campaign of attacks. In January 1994
    Ramos attempted to increase government revenue by imposing an
    oil price rise. The proposal, which was opposed by a diverse
    coalition of pressure groups including the Catholic Church,
    former right-wing military rebels and leftist unions, was
    dropped. However, a breakaway ABB group exploited the
    campaign, attacking three oil company offices - Shell
    Philippines, Petron and Caltex - on 1 February. </p>
    <p>Muslim secessionists</p>
    <p>Muslim secessionist groups are active in the southern
    island of Mindanao. The Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF)
    operates mainly in western Mindanao and the Sulu archipelago.
    Although military officials believe that the MNLF has lost
    the ability to mount large-scale co-ordinated attacks as it
    did in the mid-1970s, foreigners remain at potential risk.
    Local Muslim community leaders can at times call upon the
    MNLF to intervene in disputes between companies and Muslim
    workers or when environmental concerns cause local
    controversy. In addition, former guerrillas/bandits stage
    kidnaps. Most target local Filipino-Chinese, but foreigners
    are at risk.</p>
    <p>As part of his national reconciliation programme, Ramos
    initiated a peace process with the MNLF shortly after
    assuming office; the two sides signed an interim peace
    settlement in September 1994. A further round of talks in
    June 1995 led MNLF leader Nur Misuari to announce that
    agreement had been reached on 75% of outstanding issues and
    that prospects for a provisional Muslim-led autonomous
    government in Mindanao were good.</p>
    <p>Abu Sayyaf</p>
    <p>In the light of the continuing peace talks between the
    MNLF and the government, the threat from Muslim groups
    outside the peace process has grown. One such group, Abu
    Sayyaf, emerged in 1993 with a series of bomb attacks, mainly
    in the Basilan/Zamboanga area. Assessments of Abu Sayyaf as
    primarily a Basilan-based group of some 200-300 active
    guerrilla/bandits have appeared less credible following a
    full-scale attack on the mainland town of Ipil (Zamboanga del
    Sur) in April 1995, in which 53 people were killed.</p>
    <p>The MILF</p>
    <p>The government's commitment to the talks with the MNLF has
    been strengthened by increasing concern over the longer-term
    threat posed by the MNLF's rival, the Moro Islamic Liberation
    Front (MILF), which is not party to the formal peace
    negotiations. The group, which is based in central Mindanao,
    is reported to have up to 20,000 guerrillas available for
    active service. It is apparently waiting for the outcome of
    the MNLF's negotiations before deciding whether to step up
    its insurgency.</p>
    <p>The MILF has the capacity to mount a serious and sustained
    offensive against military and civilian targets in central
    Mindanao. The group poses a potential threat to foreign
    business there: in July 1995 South Korea's Shinsung
    Corporation announced that it was pulling out of a $1.7bn
    Japanese-funded dam development project in North Cotabato
    province after two raids by MILF guerrillas in recent years -
    allegedly after the company's failure to pay extortion
    demands.</p>
    <p>Transnational terrorism</p>
    <p>In April 1995 police arrested six alleged Islamic
    extremists in Manila and seized bomb-making material and
    documents from their apartment. The men, who are all of
    Middle Eastern origin, are linked to alleged Islamic
    extremist leader Ramzi Ahmed Yousef. Yousef was arrested in
    Pakistan in February and extradited to the US to face charges
    relating to the bombing of the World Trade Center (WTC) in
    New York in 1993. Yousef also has been charged with murder in
    connection with the bombing of a Philippine Airlines (PAL)
    aircraft en route from Manila to Osaka (Japan) in December
    1994 and is alleged to have been planning the bombing of two
    US planes in January.</p>
    <p>POLITICAL CLIMATE FOR FOREIGN BUSINESS</p>
    <p>Democratic institutions are becoming entrenched, providing
    the political framework for sustained economic growth,
    estimated to reach around 5% annually over the next five
    years. The pro-business thrust of the administration will
    remain intact: foreign companies will meet a favourable
    investment climate. In July 1995 Ramos outlined a bold
    legislative programme designed to sustain the pace of
    economic recovery by overhauling the antiquated tax system
    and pulling down remaining barriers to free competition and
    foreign investment. He also called for legislation to cut
    bureaucracy and to root out corruption in the police force
    and criminal justice system.</p>
    <p>Although the pro-business thrust of the Manila
    administration remains strong, foreign companies must be
    aware of the influence wielded by provincial politicians who
    oversee a network of patronage and connections affecting both
    commercial and political activity. Foreign firms need to be
    aware of the personalities of key figures in proposed areas
    of operation.</p>
    <p>Finally, foreign companies must remain sensitive to the
    role of local Church-sponsored or leftist groups and
    community-based groups. Land and the environment remain
    potent issues in local politics, and disputes involving a
    foreign company can quickly mobilise opposition campaigns.
    The potential threat posed by these groups can be markedly
    reduced by an effective and comprehensive community liaison
    programme.</p>

<H1>Country Profile - China</H1>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Prepared by Control Risks Information Services</P>
<P>POLITICAL STABILITY</P>
<P>The regime</P>
<P>The regime pursues a strict style of government, maintaining control through the three main organs of power: the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), the government machine and the army. An efficient and ruthless police force, a malleable press and an easily-manipulated legal system work to the advantage of whichever clique has the upper hand.</P>
<P>Paramount leader Deng Xiaoping holds no official post, but real power will remain in his hands until his death - which is imminent. Meanwhile, his subordinates are positioning themselves for the succession struggle. Power struggles are decided within the politburo by top party leaders who play their proteges off against each other in a bid to destroy or dislodge their opponents' power bases in the bureaucracy. Deng's death could prompt a potentially bitter power struggle, with street demonstrations and widespread public disorder.</P>
<P>Ideological differences</P>
<P>There are few fundamental ideological differences within the CCP, which recognises that the survival of its authoritarian rule depends on creating wealth through continued economic reform. </P>
<P>However, there is debate within the party as to the speed and extent of this reform, with some factions maintaining that the economy should remain under central control, with state-owned industry as its backbone. Other, more progressive factions urge rapid reform of the state sector.</P>
<P>Personalities and cliques will have a greater influence on the future of the CCP than policies. Jiang Zemin, President of the People's Republic of China (PRC) and Chairman of the Central Military Commission (CMC), is Deng's chosen successor. He forms the focus of what is known in CCP jargon as 'the collective leadership', along with State Council Premier Li Peng and Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji. Despite the formation of an apparently stable leadership core in advance of Deng's death, there is likely to be a challenge to Jiang's authority after the event. Jiang has anticipated this, and used the annual CCP congress in October 1994 to move political allies from his Shanghai power base into the politburo. He has also worked to secure the support of the military, whose support will be critical in the event of a power struggle.</P>
<P>Foreign relations</P>
<P>Political uncertainty at home tends to be reflected in a more aggressive foreign policy: China's increasingly assertive diplomacy within Asia and worldwide can be seen as an appeal to patriotic sentiment from an unsteady leadership.</P>
<P>Taiwan, regarded as a renegade province by Beijing since the defeated nationalists established a rival government there in 1949, continues to attract China's most hostile rhetoric. After bilateral relations had improved gradually through 1993 and 1994 by a succession of minor agreements, a visit by Taiwanese President Lee Teng Hui to the US in June 1995 - which China interpreted as a direct challenge to its sovereignty - caused a sudden and serious deterioration in relations. Scheduled bilateral talks were indefinitely postponed by China, which conducted two series of missile tests off Taiwan's north coast in July and August 1995 that were clearly intended to intimidate Taipei and deter further attempts to gain international recognition.</P>
<P>Sino-Taiwanese relations show little sign of improving in the long term. Taiwan's diplomatic offensive, backed by its strong trade credentials and powerful lobbying groups in Washington, will continue to antagonise China, as will its persistent attempts to secure its own seat at the UN. However, Sino-Taiwanese economic links continue to expand despite diplomatic hostility (Taiwan has approximately $20bn-worth of investment in China) and this alone is likely to prevent Chinese threats turning into military action against Taiwan.</P>
<P>Relations with the US are linked to the Taiwan issue and have been undermined by the emergence of a pro-Taiwan US Congress, which has heavily influenced President Bill Clinton's China policy. Congress demanded that Lee be granted a visa for the June visit, against State Department advice. The granting of a visa, which in China's eyes constituted a direct breach of the US' avowed 'one China' policy precluding any recognition of Taiwan, resulted in a marked deterioration in relations. China withdrew its ambassador to Washington for consultations, coinciding with the scheduled return of the US ambassador to Beijing at the end of his term of office. Attempts to repair relations have foundered on a number of other mutually antagonistic issues, such as China's detention of US (Chinese-born) human rights activist Harry Wu and US allegations of illicit Chinese missile sales to Pakistan.</P>
<P>China has cited US policy inconsistency as a major factor in the troubled relationship. It saw Clinton's separation of human rights from trade issues in renewing China's Most Favoured Nation (MFN) trading status in 1994 as a major breakthrough, but now claims to be confused by the renewed rumblings in Washington about human rights and the US' apparent embrace of Taiwan. </P>
<P>China is seeking to be a recognised economic power, but its failure to become a founding member of the World Trade Organisation (WTO), which replaced the General Agreement on Tariffs & Trade (GATT) in January 1995, was a major rebuff to national esteem. The US, which is locked in a bitter trade feud with China over China's alleged abuse of intellectual property rights, was the main opponent of China's admittance to the WTO on the grounds that many of its trading institutions are too immature and vulnerable to abuse. However, more encouraging statements from US trade representatives in mid-1995 suggest that China's inclusion may be imminent.</P>
<P>THREATS TO SECURITY</P>
<P>The repressive and pervasive nature of China's security apparatus currently rules out significant activity by anti-government groups.</P>
<P>Crime</P>
<P>Economic reform has fuelled an upsurge in crime nationwide. In particular, continuing unemployment and the migration of disaffected workers without jobs to urban areas have led to rising crime in southern and coastal cities. The government is especially concerned by the increase in violent crime and drug-trafficking. The government is committed to fighting this trend: the official media issues strong warnings to would-be criminals and the number of executions carried out for violent crimes has increased rapidly. </P>
<P>The relaxation of political and economic controls has also prompted the re-emergence of organised crime, particularly in the south. Triads (traditional criminal syndicates) operating with counterparts in Hong Kong are involved in smuggling and armed robberies in Guangdong, Fujian and Hong Kong itself. There has been an upsurge in short-term kidnaps in Guangdong where wealthy entrepreneurs, many on business trips from Hong Kong, offer a tempting target for kidnap gangs. Recent reports indicate that Japanese yakuza crime syndicates are now active in Shanghai.</P>
<P>Social disorder</P>
<P>The increasing concentration of wealth in select regions, predominantly in southern and eastern coastal areas, has serious implications for China's national stability.</P>
<P>Large-scale protests are rare and are not tolerated by the authorities, who fear that public gatherings may be used to voice grievances against the government. However, there is a long-term risk of widespread public unrest as China tries to make the transition from a state-controlled to a market economy. There is growing resentment in poorer provinces at the visible enrichment of other provinces, and this is exacerbated by financial scandals in the major cities involving huge sums of money. </P>
<P>Local government corruption and the imposition of extra local taxes (despite orders to the contrary from Beijing) have sparked off outbreaks of popular unrest as the rural population, which is increasingly left behind by the economic boom in the coastal regions, struggles to cope with spiralling inflation and soaring prices. In the last major outbreak of urban unrest, 60,000 would-be investors in Shenzhen's fledgling stock market went on the rampage in August 1992 because of alleged corruption by local officials in the distribution of share application forms. </P>
<P>Corruption at high levels is also a major source of public anger and a politically-sensitive issue: it was a major reason for public support for the student-led pro-democracy movement in Beijing in April-June 1989. In July 1994 several men were arrested for staging an anti-corruption protest in front of the municipal government compound in Beijing. Jiang Zemin's dismissal of Beijing's CCP leader Chen Xitong on suspicion of corruption in April 1995 exposed more evidence of powerful figures within the CCP amassing great personal wealth at public expense. </P>
<P>In addition, as the wealth gap continues to widen, a new social class has emerged which is amassing wealth outside state control. This wealth gives those who are benefiting influence over a large number of people and has led to CCP fears that they may seek political liberalisation and dilution of central government power.</P>
<P>Labour unrest</P>
<P>Labour unrest is increasing in the rapidly-developing provinces of Guangdong and Fujian as wages fail to keep pace with rising living costs. Strikes have disrupted operations at Japanese-, Taiwanese- and Hong Kong-owned firms in the Special Economic Zones (SEZ) - particularly in Zhuhai on the southern coast of Guangdong - in recent years. Wide-ranging labour laws introduced in 1995 defining working hours and establishing a minimum wage are likely to raise awareness of labour rights and increase the potential for labour disputes, but the conditions will be difficult to enforce given widely differing work practices across the country.</P>
<P>A common demand of many strikers is the establishment of unions. All Chinese employees are represented by the All China Federation of Trade Unions (ACFTU) - an organ of the CCP. As labour unrest increases, the CCP has stepped in to prevent the emergence of independent labour organisations. Militant trade unionists are forced to conduct their operations in secret or from abroad, but many foreign businesses fear that disruptive union activity could soon be a major issue in southern China and Shanghai.</P>
<P>Anti-Chinese unrest</P>
<P>The loosening of social and economic controls has not been matched by a relaxation in security levels in traditionally restive areas. The government announced in August 1992 that it intended to open up Tibet to the outside world, but has done little so far. The authorities introduced the policy in the hope that it would weaken the Tibetan independence movement. However, in the 1980s a similar strategy failed to curb anti-Chinese sentiment. Indeed, it may have fuelled such sentiment because of Tibet's exposure to democratic ideas. The authorities ruthlessly suppressed anti-Chinese protests in the Tibetan capital Lhasa in 1987 and 1988, and show no sign of relaxing their hostility to Tibetan 'splittists'. Small-scale anti-Chinese protests will continue, but the authorities are likely to retain a repressive security policy in the region.</P>
<P>The independence of the Muslim Central Asian states of the former Soviet Union may encourage Muslim agitation in north-western China, which borders Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Kazakhstan. There are strong ethnic ties between these states and Xinjiang province. The authorities have identified at least seven separate Islamic cells operating in Xinjiang, notably the underground Islamic Party of East Turkestan, which has allegedly formed death squads to kill Han Chinese. The group is believed to have close ties with Afghan Mujahideen and to receive support from sympathisers in Turkey. Muslim separatists have been responsible for a number of small-scale bomb attacks in the province, but the movement is ruthlessly suppressed by the security forces and does not pose a serious threat to Beijing's authority.</P>
<P>China's ethnic minorities feel considerable resentment towards the Han Chinese, who make up more than 90% of the total population, but communal violence between minority groups is rare. More than 40 Muslims were injured in a brawl involving Tibetan and Hui (ethnic Chinese Muslim) communities in Xiahe in the Gannan Tibetan autonomous prefecture (Gansu province) in February 1993. The Tibetan community was angered by the construction of a mosque near the Tibetan Labrang monastery. Similar incidents were reported in 1993 in parts of Sichuan, Qinghai and Henan. The government, fearful of growing ethnic unrest from Muslim and Tibetan communities demanding greater autonomy, may be seeking to create tensions between the two groups in order to minimise the potential threat to overall political stability in the region.</P>
<P>POLITICAL CLIMATE FOR FOREIGN BUSINESS</P>
<P>Deng's economic reforms, which will dictate the direction of national development after his death and improve the investment climate for foreign business in the medium term. However, concerns over the economy remain as rapid growth fuels inflation. Provinces pursuing their own economic policies in defiance of central directives, often with the aim of attracting foreign investment with preferential economic conditions, have seriously undermined attempts at restricting economic growth to more manageable levels. A Central Bank law introduced in March 1995 has given the centre greater control over the national economy, but provincial concerns will ensure that rapid growth continues.</P>
<P>Political disputes can impinge on investment. French companies in China were discriminated against in 1993 following France's approval in November 1992 of the sale to Taiwan of 60 Mirage fighter aircraft. France's concern at the loss of business was reflected in its decision in January 1994 to halt arms sales to Taiwan. However, in less extreme cases China is content to separate diplomatic and commercial issues: there is little evidence that British companies suffered as the result of deteriorating Sino-British relations over Hong Kong, and Lee's visit to the US similarly did not elicit commercial punishment for US firms in China.</P>
<P>China continues to attach greater importance to commercial development than human rights and political reform, and has succeeded in attracting massive foreign investment ($35bn in 1994) in its attempts to modernise. In attracting this investment, the leadership is nevertheless deferring action on potentially critical issues which may cause significant erosion of its authority in the long term.</P>

<H1>Country Profile - Pakistan</H1>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Prepared by Control Risks Information Services</P>
<P>POLITICAL STABILITY</P>
<P>The PPP</P>
<P>Benazir Bhutto regained the premiership after her Pakistan People's Party (PPP) emerged as the largest party in the October 1993 general elections. Bhutto had led a minority government between December 1988 and August 1990 before being dismissed by then President Ghulam Ishaq Khan, who claimed that senior figures in her administration were corrupt and therefore unfit to govern.</P>
<P>The PPP governs in alliance with the Pakistan Muslim League-Junejo (PML-J). It faces a determined opposition, notably from former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif (leader of the opposition Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) faction) and from the ethnically-based Mohajir Qaumi Mahaz (MQM). Bhutto has been criticised for failing to sustain the pace of economic reforms, for allegedly threatening the credibility of the bureaucracy and judiciary by making political appointments, and for failing to address increasing criminal and political violence in Karachi (Pakistan's leading business centre and port).</P>
<P>Government policy is determined by three figures: the president, the prime minister and the chief of army staff. Bhutto is therefore bolstered by the support of former PPP deputy leader and incumbent President Farooq Leghari and by the military high command's current desire not to intervene directly in day-to-day politics. Sharif's confrontational tactics - for example, sporadic attempts to organise nationwide opposition strikes and demonstrations - failed to erode Bhutto's narrow parliamentary majority in 1994 or the first half of 1995. However, frictions between the PPP and its PML-J allies in Punjab had begun to cast doubt on the durability of the ruling alliance at the national level.</P>
<P>Karachi</P>
<P>Bhutto and the PPP face a significant local challenge from the MQM in Karachi. The MQM represents the Mohajirs, who are Urdu speakers of Indian refugee origin and form a majority of the city's population. The Mohajirs claim that the current political establishment discriminates against them, and demands the restoration of the Karachi municipal government, which is currently suspended, and ultimately the creation of a separate Mohajir province carved out of southern Sind. The Sind state assembly and the state government, which administers Karachi in the absence of an elected city council, is dominated by the PPP, whose representatives were voted in by the indigenous Sindi majority living outside the city. Sindis resent the economic power of the Mohajir community.</P>
<P>Bhutto is reluctant to antagonise her Sindi supporters by making political concessions to the MQM. She regards the group as a dangerous political rival whose militants have frequently resorted to violence to achieve their aims. In addition, PPP control of the Sind state assembly helps insulate her authority at the national level from the repercussions of unrest in Karachi. As a result, negotiations with the MQM have been slow. Suggestions that a municipal government should be restored have not yet been carried forward and discussions have stalled over such issues as the withdrawal of criminal charges against MQM leaders.</P>
<P>Tensions with India</P>
<P>Relations with India are dominated by competing claims to the state of Jammu & Kashmir, which has a large Muslim majority. India controls two-thirds of the state and Pakistan the remainder, which is known as Azad (Free) Kashmir. The Pakistani government supports Kashmiri calls for self-determination, and sympathisers in Pakistan have assisted Indian Kashmiri dissidents. The Pakistan government claims that it gives no more than moral support to the rebels in Indian Kashmir: India disputes this. There are periodic clashes along the line of control, but the two armies have taken steps to reduce the risk of a minor incident setting off a wider conflict, for example by informing each other in advance of major military manoeuvres near the front line. Both governments recognise that current tensions necessitate high defence spending, which impedes their economic objectives. However, neither has the political authority to risk controversial concessions over Kashmir.</P>
<P>Relations with the US</P>
<P>The issue of support for Kashmiri militants has strained relations with the US, as has Pakistan's suspected nuclear weapons programme. Bhutto's visit to the US in April 1995 helped consolidate official relations between the two countries, but did not fully alleviate US concerns. Although some $6bn in US business commitments was reportedly made during Bhutto's visit, most of these were tentative, with investors delaying final decisions until the political climate improves.</P>
<P>President Bill Clinton, acknowledging Pakistan's efforts to co-operate with international moves to curb Islamic extremist terrorism and the drugs trade, promised to work with the US Congress to resolve the sensitive dispute over the blocked sale of F-16 jet fighters to Pakistan. Under the Pressler Amendment, the US Congress blocked arms sales to Pakistan in 1990 because of Islamabad's suspected development of nuclear weapons. Controversy over the issue intensified in August 1994 with the seizure in Berlin of documents indicating that weapons-grade plutonium smuggled from Russia to Germany was bound for Pakistan. In the same month, Sharif claimed that Pakistan had already constructed a nuclear bomb. Government officials quickly denied the claims, but it is generally accepted that Pakistan is close to nuclear weapons capability even if it has not actually exploded a nuclear device.</P>
<P>The Afghan problem</P>
<P>Instability in Afghanistan remains a major external problem. Since the Soviet invasion in 1980, Pakistan has played host to more than 3m Afghan refugees. The proliferation of weapons and the expansion of the drugs trade are among the side-effects of the Afghan war, and these have contributed to a deterioration in security conditions throughout Pakistan. Pakistan needs a stable government in Afghanistan so that it can develop links with former Soviet Central Asia. </P>
<P>Afghans are still bitterly divided over their country's future, and large numbers of Afghan refugees remain in Pakistan. The presence of large numbers of refugees has led to frictions with local Pakistanis in frontier regions, and there are occasional incidents of Afghan violence elsewhere. In February 1994 three Afghan gunmen briefly held a group of Pakistani schoolboys hostage in the Afghan embassy in Islamabad. The gunmen were killed and the hostages were released unharmed.</P>
<P>THREATS TO SECURITY</P>
<P>Karachi</P>
<P>Pakistan's greatest security concern stems from political tensions and violence in Karachi, much of it the work of the MQM in a bid to force Bhutto to accept its demands for a significant role in governing the city.</P>
<P>Violence has escalated in Karachi since December 1994 following the withdrawal of the army from street law enforcement duties. This was partly because militants from the dominant MQM faction (led by exiled MQM founder Altaf Hussain) began a struggle to regain control of areas previously dominated by the rival MQM Haqiqi faction. The Haqiqi faction had gained prominence beyond its natural support base through the 'sponsorship' of the army, which operated a 'divide and rule' policy towards the Mohajir community. Following the army's withdrawal, the Altaf faction moved to oust rival armed supporters from particular districts (mainly in eastern Karachi): this process is continuing.</P>
<P>More than 1,150 people were killed in the city in January-August 1995, most in clashes in north/central, north-western and eastern suburbs. Violence has spilled over into the Clifton business area (south Karachi), but southern business and residential areas (Hotel Lines, Clifton and Defence Colony), and the Karachi Development Association (KDA) residential area (near the national stadium) remain considerably more secure than elsewhere in the city.</P>
<P>Much of the violence has comprised scattered clashes between militant factions and the police, targeted shootings, and kidnappings and killings of police and rival militants. However, in what has remained an isolated incident, two US consular workers, Gary Durell and Jackie Van Landingham, were killed in an attack by unidentified gunmen on 8 March 1995. The attack took place as the victims were travelling to work in a consular truck along the Sharah i Faisal road (which runs from central Karachi to the international airport). Gunmen in another vehicle opened fire on the truck in an apparently well-planned and specifically targeted attack.</P>
<P>The motive for the attack is unclear. It was probably either:</P>
<P>- a deliberate strike against foreigners by factions of the MQM in an attempt to provoke deeper crisis in Karachi and therefore secure more concessions in negotiations with the government; or</P>
<P>- an attack by Islamic militants with links abroad specifically aimed at US consular officials in response to the extradition of suspected terrorist Ramzi Ahmed Yousef from Pakistan to the US in January 1995.</P>
<P>Despite a bomb threat received by the US consulate in early April 1995 and subsequent reports of threatening letters sent to the Japanese and Western embassies, there is no clear evidence of a planned campaign against US or other foreign personnel. However,crime levels in Karachi are high, and the high incidence of political violence inevitably raises the risk that foreigners could be caught up in shooting or bombing incidents accidentally.</P>
<P>Security in rural Sind</P>
<P>Crime rates are high in rural Sind. Gangs of dacoits (bandits) regularly engage in hold-ups and kidnaps and the government forbids foreigners to travel in rural areas in the interior of Sind without an armed escort. In 1991 there were three kidnap cases involving foreigners in Sind, though none occurred in Karachi. One victim, a Swedish engineer, was killed in a gun battle between bandits and the police in April. A group of bandits opened fire on trucks carrying Pakistan International Airline (PIA) staff and passengers near Larkana (Sind) late in April 1995. The bandits killed the driver of one truck and kidnapped ten people (including eight PIA employees). </P>
<P>Security in tribal areas</P>
<P>The security situation in border and tribal areas of Baluchistan and North-West Frontier Province (NWFP) remains unstable. There have been periodic cases of tribesmen - often arms- or drug-smugglers - kidnapping foreigners to put pressure on the provincial authorities to address tribal grievances, release detained kinsmen or return seized arms or goods. A tribal group in July 1995 freed two German engineers, Horst Ammon and Friedrich Koehler, who were seized with a German colleague, Gunter Maier, the month before. Maier was earlier released unharmed. The three were working on an AEG/Siemens power project; they were seized as they drove from the plant site to the provincial capital Peshawar. There are no reports of a ransom payment.</P>
<P>In neighbouring Baluchistan, tribal leaders have in the past seized foreigners and locals to be used as bargaining chips in local disputes with the provincial or federal authorities, especially over the release of jailed tribal members. In May 1995 six Pakistani employees of the state Oil & Gas Development Corporation (OGDC) based in Pir Koh gas field were abducted by unidentified gunmen near Kashmore (Baluchistan); they were released two weeks later.</P>
<P>POLITICAL CLIMATE FOR FOREIGN BUSINESS</P>
<P>All mainstream political leaders favour foreign investment. Bhutto is pursuing an economic liberalisation programme including import tariff cuts, financial deregulation and sweeping privatisation measures. However, the 1995-96 budget cast doubt on the country's adherence to an adjustment programme agreed with the IMF: maximum tariffs are still 65%, 15% higher than the IMF target; and the projected budget deficit for 1995-96 is 5% of GDP, rather than 4% as the IMF had hoped. </P>
<P>Meanwhile, many foreign companies are deterred by the threat of political instability, the security crisis in Karachi and by rumours of official corruption. Bureaucratic procedures are slow and bedevilled by a lack of co-ordination between government departments. Moreover, disagreements between Islamabad and provincial governments can delay new projects.</P>

<H1>Country Profile - India</H1>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Prepared by Control Risks Information Services</P>
<P>POLITICAL STABILITY</P>
<P>The Congress (I) government</P>
<P>Prime Minister Narasimha Rao's Congress (I) government came to power in June 1991 following an extended period of weak central government. Although seen at first as a temporary compromise leader, Rao has asserted his authority and is set to lead the party into the next elections, which are expected by April 1996.</P>
<P>Congress has been vulnerable to opposition challenges, but divisions within the various opposition groups have meant that it has defeated periodic no-confidence motions. Moreover, the defection to the government of a number of minor opposition factions means that Rao can rely on a narrow but workable majority to support his legislative programme.</P>
<P>Economic liberalisation</P>
<P>Key to Rao's programme since 1992 has been reform of the centralised, protectionist economy. Restrictions on foreign investment have been systematically lifted. Sectors previously closed to foreign participation have been opened up, including power generation, heavy industry, sections of the oil industry, air transport, pharmaceuticals, roads and much of the telecommunications industry. The economic results have been positive: the GDP growth rate for 1994-95 is estimated at 5.3%, and exports are performing well.</P>
<P>Opposition to foreign business</P>
<P>The clear need for foreign capital and expertise to fuel India's economic reform process means that the basic outlines of the current liberalisation policy are likely to continue - whichever government is in power at the national level.</P>
<P>Nevertheless, parliamentary politics remains potentially volatile, and opposition to the reform programme and the subsequent increase in foreign business persists, both in Congress and in opposition parties. In May 1995 Congress dissidents under former minister Arjun Singh declared the formation of a 'rival' Congress party.</P>
<P>The Hindu right-wing revivalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the second-largest party in parliament, forms a vocal opposition. The BJP's appeal to Hindu chauvinism and tacit anti-Muslim sentiment is powerful. Hindu militant organisations such as the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS - National Volunteer Corps) bolster the BJP's ability to organise effective grass-roots mobilisation campaigns. The RSS was set up in 1925 to unite Hindu society and spread Hindu culture and has a membership of 2m. Nearly all the BJP leaders are RSS veterans.</P>
<P>The BJP, while nominally supporting economic liberalisation, is exploiting popular concerns that foreign multinationals will squeeze local manufacturers out of business. In August 1995 the BJP and its Shiv Sena ally in the Maharashtra state government cancelled a $3bn power plant contract won by US energy company Enron on the grounds that the contract, which was negotiated by the preceding Congress state government, favoured Enron at the expense of local firms. The cancellation of the project encouraged other nationalist movements to renew their campaigns against foreign companies. The Karnataka Farmers Association (KFA), which had vandalised a half-built seed processing plant in 1993, threatened attacks against Kentucky Fried Chicken and other US fast-food outlets in Karnataka state. The Hindu-based Swadesh Jagran Manch (SJM - Forum for National Awakening) revived a campaign initiated by the RSS in July 1994 to draw up a boycott list of international brands, including US soft drinks Coca-Cola and Pepsi, on the grounds that they threaten local products.</P>
<P>THREATS TO SECURITY</P>
<P>Hindu/Muslim communal violence</P>
<P>Hindu/Muslim tensions have subsided gradually since the wave of violence provoked by the BJP-led campaign to replace the Babri Mosque in Ayodhya with a Hindu temple. In December 1992 Hindu militants destroyed the mosque, sparking off nationwide violence in which more than 1,200 people were killed. Communal clashes were reported in Delhi, Bombay (Maharashtra), Calcutta (West Bengal), Jaipur (Rajasthan), Hyderabad (Andhra Pradesh), Bangalore (Karnataka), Ahmedabad (Gujarat), in the state of Kerala and on the Bangladeshi border in Assam. Communal violence flared up again in Bombay and Ahmedabad in January 1993, much of it exacerbated by local Hindu nationalist groups seeking greater political control.</P>
<P>The BJP and the RSS continue to advocate the 'reclaiming' of other mosques across India in order to prompt Hindu/Muslim violence. Hindu militant attacks may focus on sites in Uttar Pradesh, such as Mathura 100 miles (160km) south of Delhi), and Varanasi/Benares (Uttar Pradesh), where two ancient Muslim buildings stand on top of Hindu shrines.</P>
<P>Cities worst affected by communal violence tend to be those with roughly equal Hindu and Muslim populations, particularly in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. Although foreigners are not directly affected, violence has an adverse impact on the economy and can disrupt commercial operations.</P>
<P>Jammu & Kashmir</P>
<P>Since December 1989 political mismanagement, corruption and harsh military counter-measures have fuelled Muslim separatist militancy in the Kashmir Valley. The roots of the current crisis date back to independence in 1947. Both India and Pakistan claim the whole of Jammu & Kashmir, and the state is still divided along a line of control monitored by UN observers. One third of the state, known as 'Azad' or 'Free' Kashmir, is administered by Pakistan. Kashmiri militants enjoy widespread popular sympathy in Pakistan, and India accuses Pakistan's intelligence service of training them. </P>
<P>Kashmir is currently under direct rule from New Delhi, and the military maintains a harsh security regime, imposing frequent shoot-on-sight curfews. Jammu, the state's winter capital, has a Hindu majority and has been spared the worst of recent unrest. However, increasing levels of violence in the Doda-Kishtwar area to the east led to the suspension of operations at a major hydroelectric construction project at Kishtwar in 1992. The separatists have wide popular support, and the government's attempts to revive a political dialogue have stalled. The security environment in both the Kashmir valley and the Doda-Kishtwar area will remain extremely poor. Clashes with the security forces are common, and militants stage bombings, particularly against the security forces, in the summer capital Srinagar: in the deadliest attack since the insurgency began, a bombing by the pro-Pakistan Hizb ul-Mujahideen in September 1995 left 13 people dead.</P>
<P>Foreign tourists are also targets: a previously unknown militant group, Al Faran, kidnapped five foreign trekkers in July 1995 in a bid to force the release of jailed Kashmiri militants.</P>
<P>The Kashmir dispute has strained relations with Pakistan, which India claims has armed and trained militants. The two countries held talks on the issue in January 1994, but made no significant progress. Tensions will remain high, but are unlikely to escalate into open conflict.</P>
<P>Separatism in Uttar Pradesh</P>
<P>A concerted separatist movement is emerging in the north of Uttar Pradesh, with the Uttarakhand region demanding secession from the state government in Lucknow. The origins of the dispute are caste-based: the mainly upper caste Uttarakhandis resent the lower caste policies favoured by the Uttar Pradesh state government. While there is no evidence that a terrorist movement has emerged, continued refusals by Delhi to countenance the Uttarakhandis' cause may lead to a more militant approach. Violent demonstrations claimed more than 20 lives in the region in September and October 1994, with unrest occasionally spreading to Delhi, 160 miles (250km) to the south-west.</P>
<P>Sikh extremism</P>
<P>The main turning-points which have fuelled violence in the long history of Sikh radicalism were the Indian army's storming of the Amritsar Golden Temple in 1984 and the anti-Sikh pogroms in Delhi following Prime Minister Indira Gandhi's assassination by her Sikh guards later that year. Sikh militants argued that Sikhs would be safe only in an independent state of 'Khalistan' within Punjab.</P>
<P>Militants have targeted Hindus, government forces and other more moderate Sikhs within Punjab. (Terrorist attacks on Hindus were designed to force Hindus out of Punjab and so achieve de facto Sikh/Hindu partition.) They also have launched periodic bomb attacks in public places and on trains and buses in states neighbouring Punjab and in major urban centres, including Delhi and Bombay.</P>
<P>A sharp reduction in violence since 1993 ended in August 1995, when a bomb placed inside his car killed Punjab's chief minister. A known separatist group, Babbar Khalsa, claimed responsibility for the attack. Given the tight security that surrounded the minister, it is probable that the bombers were assisted by security force personnel.</P>
<P>The two years of relative peace that preceded the August attack were mainly due to the militants' loss of popular support in rural areas because of their use of extortion and often indiscriminate violence; the state government's implementation of aggressive anti-terrorist tactics; and a revival of popular confidence and participation in local democratic institutions has undermined the militants' political impact. However, there are indications that a new generation of separatists has emerged since the previous campaign faltered. Rather than being drawn from among the ill-educated rural peasantry, the new separatists are largely urban, well-educated and with strong overseas links.</P>
<P>The north-east</P>
<P>Ethnic rivalries in the north-east, together with widespread aspirations towards local autonomy, have given rise to conflicts since independence.</P>
<P>United Liberation Front of Assam (ULFA) secessionists have made extortion demands - backed up by kidnap threats - against businesses (particularly tea companies) in the region. In January 1992 the government suspended military operations against the group and held peace talks. ULFA has become increasingly factionalised: one faction agreed to lay down its arms. However, other factions maintain the capability to resume their campaigns. Assam Frontier Tea Company (AFTC) general manager Rameswar Singh was killed in Talap (Tinsukia district) in mid-February 1994 in an attack believed to be linked to extortion demands by 'anti-talks' ULFA guerrillas.</P>
<P>In north-western Assam, Bodo tribesmen demand the creation of a separate Bodo state to be carved out of Assam. The Bodo Security Force (BSF), which maintains bases across the border in Bhutan, extorts 'war taxes' from foreign-owned tea plantations in the area and kidnaps and kills plantation managers to back up its demands. The BSF is well-armed, disciplined and ruthless. In July 1994 the group attacked the villages of Muslim Bengali migrants, claiming that the Muslims (whose families originally came from Bangladesh) have taken their tribal lands. More than 50 people were killed before the army restored order.</P>
<P>The Naga insurgency continues. Armed raids by the ethnic militant Kuki Defence Force (KDF) and tribal militant National Socialist Council of Nagaland (NSCN) on ethnic Naga and Kuki communities in Nagaland and Manipur have become increasingly violent, though foreign personnel are rarely able to visit these areas and are largely unaffected. The surrender in September 1993 of some 750 of the 1,200-strong All Tripura Tribal Force (ATTF) undermines the organisation's capacity to continue its fight for independence in Manipur.</P>
<P>Naxalites</P>
<P>The Naxalite insurgency passed its peak in West Bengal in the early 1970s, but isolated groups of guerrilla bandits still operate in parts of rural Andhra Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh, where they attack government targets and transport centres, engage in extortion and robbery, and foment occasional political agitation.</P>
<P>Caste clashes </P>
<P>A plan by then Prime Minister V P Singh in August 1990 to increase the quota of government jobs reserved for the lower castes sparked off widespread rioting, mainly by high caste protesters in urban areas. Caste rivalries are still a potent source of violence, especially in Bihar.</P>
<P>Crime</P>
<P>Although petty crime such as pickpocketing is common in crowded cities, the risk of physical attack is minimal. Foreign residents often employ night-watchmen (chowkidars) to deter burglars.</P>
<P>Muslim- and Hindu-dominated organised criminal gangs are principally involved in arms-running and gold-smuggling, usually to and from the Middle East. However, Bombay's criminal gangs are becoming increasingly prominent in the city's affairs as real estate prices soar and extortion becomes more profitable. The gangs have been linked to a number of assassinations of politicians and businessmen, including that of local BJP leader Ramdas Nayak in August 1994. Criminal gangs target local companies and the operations of criminal gangs rarely affect foreign business.</P>
<P>A prominent Muslim underworld family, the Memons, is believed to be responsible for a series of bomb attacks in Bombay in March 1993. Some 250 people were killed by 13 bombs. The Memons, in conjunction with Dubai (United Arab Emirates)-based Indian crime boss Dawood Ibrahim, are believed to have smuggled large amounts of explosives into Maharashtra.</P>
<P>The motive for the attacks remains unclear. Some believe that the Memons, angered by damage to their interests by Hindu gangs during Hindu/Muslim riots in January, masterminded the attacks in an attempt to trigger off communal violence and benefit from the ensuing chaos. However, the scale and co-ordination of the attacks suggest a wider international conspiracy. Pakistan has denied accusations that its intelligence agency was involved in training the bombers. Indian officials, while still suspecting Pakistan, believe that a pan-Islamic fundamentalist group wishing to punish India for the destruction of the Babri Mosque in Ayodhya masterminded the plot and recruited the Memons. However, the attacks have not been repeated.</P>
<P>POLITICAL CLIMATE FOR FOREIGN BUSINESS</P>
<P>India's transition to an open economy, though slow, will not be reversed. However, deregulation is far from complete and an excessive number of rules continue to impede business activity. Foreign businesses have found that the setting-up process is usually long and complex. Conditions on the ground are often muddled, a situation exacerbated by logistical and infrastructural deficiencies. Local officials tend to respond to the entry of foreign business into their area on an ad hoc basis, leading to confusion and some delays. Companies need to be aware of the potential obstacles: although approved project proposals involving direct foreign investment increased by 16% in 1994-95 the increase in the value of the projects actually implemented went up by only 5%.</P>
<P>The Maharashtra state government's decision to cancel Enron's Dabhol power project is a major blow to India's image with foreign investors. The dispute exposed the problems which India's federal political system poses to foreign investors. The issue demonstrates how India's political system makes foreign companies vulnerable to the whims of state governments. However, an event such as the Enron dispute could only happen in Maharashtra, which is governed by a unique alliance of the BJP and the right-wing Hindu Shiv Sena party. Even the nominally Marxist government of Bengal and the left-leaning government of Bihar have declared their commitment to attracting foreign investment.</P>

<h1>Country Profile - Thailand</h1>
<blockquote>
    <p>Prepared by Control Risks Information Services</p>
    <p>POLITICAL STABILITY</p>
    <p>Key issues</p>
    <p>The key unresolved political issues are the role of the
    army and the ability of the fractious civilian political
    parties to govern effectively without excessive corruption.</p>
    <p>Splits within Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai's five-party
    coalition government prompted snap elections on 2 July 1995.
    Banharn Silpa-archa's former opposition Chart Thai (CT)
    emerged as the single largest party, winning 92 of the 391
    seats in parliament. Banharn, who was appointed prime
    minister on 13 July 1995, formed a seven-member coalition,
    the 'Thai Development Front'. The coalition can muster 233
    votes in parliament.</p>
    <p>Thai political parties are not marked by major ideological
    differences and are based on personal allegiances and
    ambitions rather than distinct policy platforms. Tensions and
    rivalries within the ruling coalition could lead to further
    sudden reshuffles of coalition members. However, periodic
    changes of senior government personnel are unlikely to alter
    the direction of Thailand's policy goals or the inherent
    stability of state institutions. On taking power, Banharn
    stressed that his coalition would continue to encourage
    foreign investment.</p>
    <p>There is some concern at the potential for greater
    political corruption under the Banharn administration. Senior
    members of the CT are wanted in the US for alleged
    involvement in drug-trafficking, while Banharn is seen as an
    'old style' politician adept at distributing patronage and
    favours.</p>
    <p>The role of the army</p>
    <p>Thailand's reputation as a fundamentally stable nation was
    badly shaken when the army opened fire on pro-democracy
    demonstrators in Bangkok in May 1992. The shootings brought
    to the fore the deep-seated conflict of interests between the
    military and civilian political parties, which had appeared
    to be easing as the democratic political system became
    entrenched. The army has historically had the upper hand over
    civilian politicians. Since the abolition of the absolute
    monarchy in 1932, there have been at least 17 military coup
    attempts (eight of them successful). </p>
    <p>The events which led to the 1992 shootings were sparked
    off in February 1991 when the military high command overthrew
    Prime Minister Chatichai Choonhavan's allegedly corrupt
    coalition government. Parliamentary elections in March 1992
    were inconclusive and a coalition of five pro-military
    parties formed a government and nominated army commander and
    military National Peacekeeping Council (NPC) strongman Gen
    Suchinda Kraprayoon as prime minister. Suchinda assumed the
    position, though he was not a member of parliament. His
    apparent disregard for democratic principles, and the
    perception that his military faction intended to entrench
    itself in power, sparked off opposition demonstrations in
    Bangkok. These turned violent in mid-May and more than 50
    people were killed. Suchinda resigned soon afterwards.
    Elections in September brought Chuan, whose coalition was
    centred on the anti-military alliance which had opposed
    Suchinda, to power. </p>
    <p>The Chuan government removed officers linked to the May
    1992 crackdown from active command and pursued a cautious
    policy of slimming down and professionalising the armed
    forces while upholding its own anti-corruption pledges.
    Nevertheless, the armed forces retain a strong influence over
    political affairs. The military portrays itself as the
    guardian of the wider national interest against the narrow
    commercial concerns of civilian politicians. However, some in
    the military also have large-scale business interests.</p>
    <p>The incumbent army commander Gen Pramon Palasilp has
    stated that the military under his leadership would not
    become involved in politics. Nevertheless, the military will
    seek to limit the power of civilian politicians and to defend
    its vested interests. The army will maintain political and
    financial links with politicians and may use the threat of
    direct intervention in politics to influence government
    policy. </p>
    <p>THREATS TO SECURITY</p>
    <p>Crime</p>
    <p>Crime, especially burglary, is increasing in Bangkok.
    Victims of kidnaps for ransom have almost without exception
    been Thais and Sino-Thais. Violent crime affecting foreign
    businesspeople is rare, partly because the police react
    strongly. However, in an unusual case in January 1994 a gang
    including a number of policemen was arrested in connection
    with the killing of East Asian tourists. The gang robbed and
    killed two Japanese tourists and may have killed more. Other
    victims who have been positively identified from the 13
    bodies found include two Taiwanese and three Hong Kong
    nationals.</p>
    <p>Crime involving foreigners is unusually high in the
    coastal resort of Pattaya. Criminal syndicates prey on
    tourists tempted by the sex and drugs scene. Tourists are
    given drugged drinks and are then robbed of money and
    passports. Occasional opportunistic violent robberies also
    occur in provincial towns and rural areas. A Japanese
    executive was reportedly robbed and killed in southern
    Thailand in January 1993.</p>
    <p>Thailand has a tradition of contract killings
    (predominantly involving Thais) to resolve intractable
    personal or business disputes. Foreign business personnel are
    rarely involved in such cases, but it is advisable to use
    Thai intermediaries during serious disputes - not least to
    allow for the maintenance of 'face' for the opposing party,
    and to avoid tensions rising to such an extent that the
    contracting of thugs to 'warn' or even to kill is considered.</p>
    <p>The potentially volatile nature of Thai business disputes
    was illustrated by an unusual incident involving Japanese
    Nishimatsu Construction Co personnel on 22 March 1995.
    Officials from the firm were temporarily detained by
    unidentified men to prevent them from submitting a bid for a
    $40m dam project in the eastern province of Chachoengsao. The
    officials were not harmed, but were held until the bidding
    deadline had expired. The project was later awarded to the
    Thai Chiang Mai construction company.</p>
    <p>The police and the rule of law</p>
    <p>A long-running scandal over the case of more than
    $20m-worth of jewellery stolen from a Saudi prince by a Thai
    migrant worker in 1989 has highlighted alleged corruption
    within the police force at the highest level. Controversy
    over the case has flared up periodically: in September 1994
    Chuan ordered the indictment of two police generals
    apparently involved in the killing of the wife and son of a
    prominent jeweller and key witness in the case; one general
    was cleared and reinstated in early September 1995.</p>
    <p>Although the case does not have an immediate impact on
    security conditions for foreign business, it serves as a
    reminder of corruption (involving members of the police,
    military and bureaucracy).</p>
    <p>Muslim secessionists</p>
    <p>Muslim secessionist groups in southern Thailand share a
    common ethnic and religious identity with their Malay
    neighbours. Guerrilla activity has declined in recent years,
    though periodic activity related to extortion and protection
    rackets has continued in rural areas. However, arson attacks
    in August 1993 against 35 schools in the southern provinces
    of Yala, Pattani and Narathiwat signalled a revived campaign.
    It is thought that the arson attacks, and a later attack on a
    train in Yala province in which two passengers were killed
    and 11 injured, were an attempt by a hardline Pattani United
    Liberation Organisation (PULO) faction, made up of younger
    members, to discredit the older leaders and assert their
    influence in the group. Sporadic attacks on transport targets
    have continued in the south.</p>
    <p>Border problems</p>
    <p>Burma's civil war extends to the Thai border and has spilt
    over into Thai territory. In 1995 there was a series of
    attacks by suspected Burmese troops and their Karen allies
    against rival Karen refugee camps in Thailand. Similar
    occasional infringements occur on the Laotian and Cambodian
    frontiers. On the Cambodian border, Khmer Rouge guerrillas
    and other gangs have turned to banditry and stage armed
    hold-ups on roads in Thailand near the border. Reports that
    elements of the Thai military continue to supply arms to the
    Khmer Rouge are subsiding. </p>
    <p>Several Western tourists and aid agency personnel have
    disappeared in border regions in recent years. While few
    foreign business personnel have occasion to go to such remote
    border areas, those on essential visits should ensure that
    they have a co-ordinated security plan. The risk of
    opportunistic banditry in such areas remains high. </p>
    <p>Transnational terrorism</p>
    <p>Transnational terrorism is rare. However, a sizeable
    Middle Eastern community in Bangkok provides a framework for
    potential terrorist activity. In March 1994 police discovered
    a powerful bomb in the back of a hire truck which had been
    impounded and parked outside a local police station. The
    truck had been abandoned earlier after colliding with a
    motorcycle a few hundred metres from the Israeli embassy. The
    authorities suspect Middle Eastern activists of trying to
    target the Israeli embassy in revenge for the massacre of
    Muslim worshippers by a Jewish extremist in Hebron
    (Israeli-occupied West Bank) in February 1994. </p>
    <p>There are no clear indications that there are active
    terrorists within the Middle Eastern community in Bangkok or
    that another bomb attempt is imminent. Foreign business
    interests do not face a high risk from this source.</p>
    <p>POLITICAL CLIMATE FOR FOREIGN BUSINESS</p>
    <p>The economy has flourished since the mid-1980s, and
    Thailand is now commonly referred to as the fifth of Asia's
    Newly-Industrialised Countries (NICs). Investor and tourist
    confidence recovered rapidly after the unrest in May 1992. </p>
    <p>There are no indications that the change of government in
    July 1995 will alter Thailand's pro-business stance. On
    taking power, Banharn pledged to speed up economic
    liberalisation, consolidate economic growth and increase
    spending on infrastructure projects. </p>
    <p>Reform of the financial sector began in February 1995 with
    a five-year plan to improve the efficiency of the finance
    industry and promote Thailand as a less restrictive and more
    vibrant financial centre. The foreign business community
    welcomed the plan, seeing reform of the financial sector as a
    necessary step to promote and sustain Thailand's high rates
    of growth. </p>
    <p>Thailand's fundamental stability remains assured: the
    combination of a growing domestic market, low (though rising)
    land and construction costs, and a large pool of relatively
    cheap labour will continue to encourage foreign investor
    confidence. </p>
    <p>However, there is a shortage of Thais trained to take on
    middle management roles, and there are increasing signs of
    activism among labour groups concerned by the impact of
    modern technology on their livelihoods. Moreover, Thailand's
    infrastructure has not kept pace with industrial
    construction. Attempts to improve Bangkok's chronically
    deficient transport system have been subject to extended
    delays and contractual disputes. </p>
    <p>There are commercial risks involved in offending Thai
    national sensibilities. In July 1993 the Education Ministry
    ordered schools to boycott books published by British company
    Longmans after a Longmans dictionary entry referred to
    Bangkok as a city 'where there are a lot of prostitutes'.</p>

<H1>Country Profile - Cambodia</H1>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Prepared by Control Risks Information Services</P>
<P>POLITICAL STABILITY</P>
<P>The run-up to peace</P>
<P>The Maoist Khmer Rouge was formed in the late 1960s as a rural-based political and military force. It came to prominence when Prince Norodom Sihanouk entered into a tactical alliance with it after he was ousted as head of state by US-backed forces led by Gen Lon Nol. The Khmer Rouge gathered strength as Lon Lol's regime became increasingly corrupt: in 1975 Khmer Rouge forces defeated Lon Nol's army and entered Phnom Penh.</P>
<P>Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot decreed that Cambodia (or Kampuchea as he renamed it) would revert to an agrarian society. A three-year 'experiment' in living off the land left 1m people dead from starvation, disease, maltreatment and murder. At the end of 1978, concerned by China's growing influence among the Khmer Rouge and provoked by guerrilla raids over its border, Vietnam launched an invasion of Cambodia, toppled the Khmer Rouge regime and installed a government headed by Khmer Rouge defectors and pro-Hanoi local communists.</P>
<P>An opposition front, comprising the Khmer Rouge and two non-communist organisations (the royalist FUNCINPEC and the Khmer People's National Liberation Front (KPNLF)), backed by a disparate group of countries including China, the US and Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) members (Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore and Thailand), embarked upon a guerrilla war against the Vietnamese-backed regime. </P>
<P>Continued instability</P>
<P>The war, which officially ended on 23 October 1991 when all combatant groups signed a peace treaty under UN auspices, left the country crippled. Under the treaty, the UN sent a peacekeeping force to Cambodia to prepare the ground for the country's first free and open elections, which were held in May 1993.</P>
<P>The elections, which proved far more successful than many observers had forecast, saw more than 90% of the country's registered voters cast their ballots. FUNCINPEC won 45% of the vote (giving it 58 legislative seats out of a total of 120 in the National Assembly), the former communist Cambodian People's Party (CPP) 38% (51 seats) and the republican Buddhist Liberal Democratic Party (BLDP) around 3% (ten seats). The Khmer Rouge boycotted the polls, though did little to prevent them taking place. By the end of 1993 Cambodia had a new constitution, a restored monarchy in King Sihanouk and a three-strong coalition government, two members of which, FUNCINPEC and the CPP, were former enemies.</P>
<P>The election campaign revealed the tenuous nature of the alliance between these two parties. When it became clear that FUNCINPEC was leading the ballot, the CPP rejected the results and threatened to mobilise the 240,000-strong security forces in order to retain power. The party subsequently relented and agreed to form a government with FUNCINPEC, but an already uneasy relationship was further strained.</P>
<P>Most of the government's energies after the polls were channelled into confronting the coalition's mutual enemy, the Khmer Rouge. A five-month offensive in 1994 demonstrated that the group remained masters of their own terrain: the government lost hundreds of dead and thousands of injured troops, depleted its finances and reinforced the Khmer Rouge's sense of its political significance. It also convinced Sihanouk of the need for further efforts to create national reconciliation, not least by including the Khmer Rouge in a new national unity government. Sihanouk's intervention led factions within the CPP to curtail the king's powers. The government also outlawed the Khmer Rouge, ending any immediate efforts towards political reconciliation.</P>
<P>A failed coup in July 1994 also exposed the deep divisions within the political elite. A powerful faction within the CPP was heavily involved in the abortive putsch, though Prince Norodom Chakrapong, one of the king's sons, and a former minister were the only senior political figures implicated. The coup attempt further strained relations between the CPP and its coalition partners and prompted a heavy-handed campaign which led to dismissals from parliament of opponents of the CPP within FUNCINPEC, purges of the military and the bureaucracy and the closure of dissenting newspapers.</P>
<P>Growing authoritarianism</P>
<P>By early 1995 it was clear the CPP had no intention of allowing Sihanouk to serve as anything other than a symbol, and for the royal line to end with his death. The CPP feared the king's role as a rallying point for its opponents, a group said to include significant numbers of soldiers and bureaucrats as well as many FUNCINPEC supporters, students and peasants. Efforts to sideline and then end the monarchy appear to be part of the CPP's authoritarian strategy for the next elections, which are scheduled for 1998. </P>
<P>The expulsion from parliament of FUNCINPEC MP Sam Rainsy in June 1995 marked a major watershed in post-election politics. The removal of Rainsy, a former finance minister, was not explained, but most local and foreign observers agreed that it was because of his criticism of official corruption. Rainsy's expulsion also represented the end of the increasingly CPP-dominated regime's pretence to govern through democratic institutions, prompting several Western embassies representing the main aid donor countries to openly criticise the government.</P>
<P>The CPP was closely involved in a tussle for the minority BLDP leadership in July 1995, when it sought to encourage a split in the party and erode its ability to serve as a source of criticism for CPP-driven policies from within the National Assembly. CPP elements are also thought to be behind a series of attacks on BLDP activists and rallies.</P>
<P>Further evidence of this growing authoritarianism emerged in November 1995, when the administration declared illegal a new political grouping, the Khmer Nation Party (KNP) founded by Rainsy. The KNP's formation was swift, and - despite government efforts - it gained support from some local politicians and foreign diplomats. </P>
<P>Rainsy's ten-point manifesto, outlined a month before the launch of the KNP, emphasised democracy, social justice, human rights and land reform, as well as environmental and anti-corruption issues. In March 1995 Deputy Prime Minister and Joint Interior & Security Minister Sar Kheng (CPP) warned that popular revulsion against 'official' corruption was so strong that it could reinvigorate the Khmer Rouge. Much of this corruption centres on foreign aid, which provides about 80% of the government's income. Corruption has increased following the end of the civil war. Although the government has acknowledged that corruption is a great disincentive to quality investment, it has done little to stamp it out. </P>
<P>The economy</P>
<P>The economy is based largely on an unbalanced mix of foreign aid, short-term investments (mainly in hotels and logging) by Asian groups and criminal enterprises (notably narcotics, money-laundering and smuggling). The infrastructural development which has taken place or is planned is invariably underwritten either by international agencies, such as the UN, or through bilateral aid agreements tied to specific projects. </P>
<P>THREATS TO SECURITY</P>
<P>The Khmer Rouge</P>
<P>The Maoist Khmer Rouge remains the main threat to the country's overall security. The Khmer Rouge tends to operate particularly in remote western areas on the border with Thailand, where it is engaged in cross-border traffic of gems, though many other remote areas retain a Khmer Rouge presence. The Khmer Rouge has targeted foreigners in its areas of operation: some ten foreigners have been abducted and killed in remote rural areas in recent years. No Westerners have been kidnapped in 1995. </P>
<P>The CPP</P>
<P>Elements of the CPP, the major coalition party, mount targeted acts of political violence in a bid to intimidate opponents, including journalists and political activists. Foreign business and aid agencies are at little direct risk from this quarter, not least because the CPP is aware that aggression towards foreign interests would raise the risk of a reduction in vital foreign aid.</P>
<P>The security forces</P>
<P>Indiscipline among the security forces in Phnom Penh raises the risk of sporadic acts of violence. In late August 1995 police guarding a senior politician's home shot and injured at least two passing foreigners. Tensions were heightened at the time because of rumours of an imminent coup attempt. There is no suggestion that the two were shot at because they were foreign: the incident highlights the indiscipline of most of the security forces and the need to exercise caution when challenged or confronted by soldiers or police. </P>
<P>Crime</P>
<P>Crime affecting foreigners is unusual in Phnom Penh, though there have been sporadic incidents of mugging, often by police officers or soldiers. Car theft, particularly of 4WD vehicles, has declined from a highpoint in 1993-94. There are occasional reports of mobile telephones being snatched when carried openly in the street.</P>
<P>Outside Phnom Penh, the risks posed by crime, notably banditry on roads, increase. The British and Australian embassies advise foreigners to fly between all major cities, and the British Foreign Office strongly warns against trying to enter Cambodia by land. The Khmer Rouge retains control of both sides of Highway Four, the road linking Phnom Penh with the country's main seaport at Sihanoukville.</P>
<P>Organised crime</P>
<P>The authorities have taken action to clamp down on money-laundering, but lack of regulation in Cambodia's banking sector, persistent corruption and high drug-trafficking profits mean that the country is likely to remain a popular destination for criminal earnings. According to the Interior Ministry, 19 of the 28 foreign- and Cambodian-owned commercial banks in the country are alleged to be involved in money-laundering. Bank officials suspect that millions of dollars of laundered money passes through Phnom Penh each day. Cambodia lacks the tools to combat money-laundering, or even to accurately measure its scale.</P>
<P>Similarly, moves to combat drug-trafficking are unlikely to yield results in the short term. At the end of May 1995, Cambodia and Vietnam joined China, Laos, Burma and Thailand in a UN-sponsored regional anti-drugs group. The group aims to improve police co-operation between member states and to control materials used in the manufacture of drugs. In mid-July 1995 Cambodia and Laos signed a bilateral agreement to improve co-operation along their 300-mile (490km) border.</P>
<P>POLITICAL CLIMATE FOR FOREIGN BUSINESS</P>
<P>The main challenges faced by foreign business and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) in Cambodia are:</P>
<P>- the Khmer Rouge;</P>
<P>- instability within the coalition government;</P>
<P>- the absence of a comprehensive legal framework;</P>
<P>- and corruption. </P>
<P>Efforts to construct the institutions either previously absent or destroyed by three decades of civil war and occupation continue, many of them funded by foreign organisations and governments. However, the process will take many years to complete, and the lack of coherent legislation governing arbitration, banking, taxation, land and labour legislation will remain a significant obstacle for some time. </P>
<P>Corruption often takes the form of 'sweeteners' for government contracts (inevitably paid for by aid or other foreign funding). Corruption at the highest levels of government is so widespread that it is damaging Cambodia's attempts at social and economic regeneration. It might also affect its chances of receiving international aid. Australian Ambassador Tony Kevin warned in March 1995 that rampant corruption would 'set back Cambodia's national development and prosperity'. Australian businesses have complained that they are losing out on lucrative contracts because they are unwilling to pay bribes. The government has reacted angrily to such allegations. </P>
<P>Because of these difficulties, foreign business interest is muted. There is growing interest in developing the country's natural resources, but at present most projects are confined to offshore oil and gas exploration. Nevertheless, companies experienced in operating in other 'frontier' areas should find that the difficulties in doing business in Cambodia are not insurmountable.</P>

<H1>Country Profile - Vietnam</H1>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Prepared by Control Risks Information Services</P>
<P>POLITICAL STABILITY</P>
<P>The CPV</P>
<P>The Communist Party of Vietnam (CPV) and its security apparatus have maintained tight control of political and economic activity since the end of the Vietnam war in 1975. The party has consolidated the process of economic reform - known as doi moi (renovation) - initiated in 1986 to combat the failure of centralised economic management and collective agricultural policies. In April 1992 a new constitution legally enshrined the reforms and in September 1992 the CPV initiated a series of leadership changes designed to maintain the momentum of economic liberalisation, increase administrative efficiency and provide a more equal representation for the northern, southern and central regions. </P>
<P>Economic reforms have borne fruit, and the economy has proved resilient despite severe strains imposed by the withdrawal of trade subsidies previously supplied by the former Soviet Union. Major multilateral loans, made possible following the lifting of the US block on such lending in July 1993, allowed Vietnam to begin rebuilding its shattered infrastructure in earnest. Foreign investor confidence has grown accordingly: in the first quarter of 1995 investment pledges rose to $1.48bn, nearly double those made in the same period in 1994. Total investments pledged since 1988 reached $13.7bn. The discovery of oil has been a further boost: the announcement in March 1995 that French company Total had struck oil off south-eastern Vietnam brought to five the number of oil finds since mid-1994. </P>
<P>CPV leaders remain convinced that the party's long-term political survival is dependent on meeting the economic aspirations of the Vietnamese people. However, far-reaching policies to liberalise and open the economy have not been paralleled by political reform. The security services, under the direction of the Interior Ministry, maintain an effective network of informants and secret and regular police. Their methods are not obtrusive but Buddhist priests, southern dissidents, ethnic minorities and Christian clergy believed to be antagonistic to the communist state are closely monitored. </P>
<P>Periodic security sweeps and well-publicised trials of prominent dissidents are used to intimidate potential opposition. However, it is becoming increasingly difficult to reconcile the contradictory demands of a free-market economy and a centralised political system. </P>
<P>The leadership continues to make periodic efforts to purge both party and bureaucracy of widespread corruption. In February 1994 former Energy Minister Vu Ngoc Hai was convicted of embezzlement in a widely-publicised trial. Hai had been on the CPV central committee until January 1994.</P>
<P>International relations</P>
<P>US-Vietnamese relations reached a watershed in August 1995 with the opening of the US embassy in Hanoi; a Vietnamese embassy was opened in Washington DC at the same time. The opening of the embassy is the result of a slow and cautious improvement in official relations, the pace and scope of which was shaped by Vietnam's co-operation in accounting for US servicemen Missing in Action (MIA) during the Vietnam war.</P>
<P>Vietnam is keen to increase US investment, and US business has long argued that the lack of full diplomatic links (and eventual preferential trade, export financing and other benefits) hindered US commercial prospects in an important emerging economy. </P>
<P>Vietnam became the seventh full member of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) in July 1995. Hanoi welcomed the move as the culmination of a long effort to rejoin the mainstream of the region's economic and political affairs. As the first communist nation to join ASEAN - which was set up in 1967 to counter the threat from communist expansionism in Indochina - Vietnam's entry marks the decline of ideological rivalries in the region and underlines the growing focus on economic co-operation and growth. </P>
<P>Vietnam is actively supporting plans to develop the Mekong river sub-region. The development of the area will create opportunities for foreign investors to participate in major regional infrastructure projects backed by international aid. The four lower Mekong countries (Cambodia, Laos, Thailand and Vietnam) signed a draft agreement in November 1994 setting up a permanent Mekong Commission to co-ordinate sustainable development plans.</P>
<P>Relations with China</P>
<P>Hanoi believes that ASEAN membership will give added diplomatic leverage in territorial disputes with China and other nations over the Spratly Islands (South China Sea), which are believed to lie over significant oil deposits. Chinese-Vietnamese relations were normalised in 1991, but the dispute over the South China Sea, as well as that over the Tonkin Gulf, cause occasional tensions. However, while occasional close manoeuvring by rival Chinese and Vietnamese-backed exploration vessels are possible in the area, both sides wish to avoid direct naval confrontation.</P>
<P>The disputes can affect foreign business. In May 1993 a Chinese seismic survey vessel entered a Vietnamese offshore exploration zone in the South China sea which was being surveyed by British Petroleum (BP) vessels, temporarily disrupting operations. In May 1994 China protested against Vietnam's award of a contract in the Blue Dragon (Thanhlong) exploration bloc to US Mobil Oil Corp and a Japanese partner. The action followed Vietnamese protests in May against US company Crestone's operations in a disputed bloc awarded to Crestone by China in 1992. The potential threat to oil exploration operations in the Spratlys remains unresolved, but the risk stems more from the harassment of survey vessels in disputed areas rather than attacks or seizures of assets.</P>
<P>THREATS TO SECURITY </P>
<P>Opposition elements</P>
<P>Inflation and unemployment have risen as the economy undergoes a painful period of transition. Economic hardships exacerbate latent political dissent, especially in the south. </P>
<P>Dissident exile groups are accused of attempting to foment rebellion and popular unrest. Police declared a security alert in Ho Chi Minh in March 1993 after discovering a plot by a US-based Vietnamese exile group to plant bombs in public places in the city. The apparent aim of the plot was to create an impression of disorder in a bid to slow down the normalisation of relations with the US. Eighteen people were arrested and a Vietnamese-born US national was jailed. In September 1992 a US-based former South Vietnamese air force officer hijacked a Vietnamese Airlines aircraft from Bangkok (Thailand) and threw pamphlets over Ho Chi Minh. He was arrested after parachuting from the aircraft. Dramatic gestures of this sort remain rare.</P>
<P>Crime </P>
<P>Crime is on the increase, especially in Ho Chi Minh. Worsening economic conditions and rising unemployment have encouraged pickpocketing and burglary. Police in Hanoi launched a campaign in April 1994 against theft and robbery after 200 cases were reported between February and April, some involving foreign residents. Nevertheless, although official corruption, black marketeering and smuggling are commonplace, levels of crime (particularly violent crime) remain low compared to many Western countries. The police take a hard line with regard to crimes against foreigners. </P>
<P>POLITICAL CLIMATE FOR FOREIGN BUSINESS </P>
<P>It is a government priority to encourage and reassure foreign business. Vietnam's restoration of amicable relations with the international community was prompted by a desire to encourage large-scale foreign investment. US investors have to fight to gain entry alongside well-established Asian (especially Hong Kong and Taiwanese) and European competitors. Nevertheless, prospects for US firms are good, particularly in the areas of oil and gas, property, banking, construction, agricultural equipment, manufacturing and consumer goods. Foreign investment is encouraged in all sectors, with tax breaks in priority areas. Companies are authorised to repatriate profits, capital and savings. </P>
<P>However, widespread corruption, the lack of a codified body of commercial law, an antiquated banking system and severe infrastructural deficiencies present significant difficulties, and there is concern over the potential for copyright infringements in the emerging Vietnamese market. In addition the extensive power of provincial administrations, which are often dominated by local party 'godfathers' and their patronage networks, can present serious difficulties. These committees have extensive influence to help or hinder projects in their area. With the commercial regulatory code still evolving, provincial authorities can at times ignore commitments made by the central government. In addition, in collusion with local joint-venture partners, they can demand previously unknown 'taxes' for apparent regulatory violations.  </P>
<P>Potential investors must be aware that the economy is still in a process of transition, that commercial laws and regulations are evolving and that, if relations with local joint-venture partners break down irrevocably, fair and impartial arbitration is less likely than official 'harassment'  - especially at the provincial level.</P>

<h2>What the repost says</h2>
</center>
<a name="1">&nbsp;</a>
<H3>In 1996 there will be much to feed executives' concerns.</H3>
<H4>The world is not necessarily a riskier place, but the issues confronting business are more diverse and potentially more complex than ever before. The IRB survey identified political instability and inadequate legisaltion as the two greatest threats to business in emerging markets. Both will be on the agenda in 1996: impending major elections will challenge established political orders, and companies will have to deal with piecemeal reform and arbitrary rulings. </H4>

<a name="2">&nbsp;</a>
<H3>Rigid ideology has lost its appeal, but idealism has not.</H3>
<H4>Companies will therefore be under greater public scrutiny than ever, not only in their own country or areas of operations overseas, but across the globe. Business faces demands which go beyond legislation and beyond frontiers. On issues such as the environment and labour conditions, companies can no longer rely solely on regulatory and scientific approval. Instead, they must win public acceptance of their licence to operate.</H4>

<a name="3">&nbsp;</a>
<H3>The collaspse of communism has had many unpleasant side-effects.</H3>
<H4>Corruption and crime have flourished, and (in terms of immediate economic rewards) relatively few people have benefitted. This inevitably influences election results: former communists have returned to power in Poland, and may well do so in Russia after presidential elections in June 1996. Although socialist administrations will not completely reverse the process of economic liberalisation, they may slow or distort reforms in the interests of local insiders.<BR>

<a name="4">&nbsp;</a>
<H3>1996 will also see continued ethnic and religious resurgence.</H3>
<H4>Communal violence will occur in many developing countries, not only in eastern Europe but also in places such as Asia. Ethnic violence claimed some 2,000 lives in Karachi in 1995, inflicting direct physical and financial losses on locally-based companies. Although religious enthusiasm is often seen as a problem for international business, it is rarely a threat unless combined with wider forces such as nationalism or political disillusion. However, exclusive religious sects bent on apocalyptic violence are likely to proliferate as we approach the millennium.</H4>

<H2>BUSINESS SECURITY OUTLOOK</H2>
<H3>The World in 1996</H3>
</center>
<HR noshade>
<H3>'LETTER FROM THE EDITOR'</H3>
<P>Business Security Outlook provides an extensive overview of the year ahead for international business. Its emphasis is on assessing global and regional trends rather than forecasting developments in individual countries, though sometimes the two cannot be separated. By looking at the broader picture', Business Security Outlook represents a first step tomore detailed analysis on specificcountries, sectors and issues.</P>
<P>Business Security Outlook is divided into six main parts - one dealing with global issues, and five regional sections examining political and security risks in Africa, Asia, the Americas, Europe and the former Soviet Union, and the Middle East and North Africa. 'Global Issues' introduces our main themes, which this year include:</P>
<ul>
<li><em>an analysis of new business frontiers</em>
<li><em>a review of crime, corruption and political instability in former socialist countries</em>
<li><em>and an analysis of the ethnic, religious and environmentalist allegiances which will influence the security outlook in 1996 and beyond.</em> 
</ul>
<P>Each regional section begins with a chart assessing political and security risks in major countries. <A HREF="risklev.html">Risks</A> are rated according to a four-point scale (Insignificant-Low-Medium-High). The charts also contain a new feature - notes on the environment for business in each country. These notes not only examine how risks may change in 1996, but also assess wider business issues such as the helpfulness of the bureaucracy, the incidence of corruption, and local attitudes to foreign trade and investment.</P>
<P><em>Business Security Outlook</em> does not claim to be comprehensive. We have not tried to include articles on every country, but have instead drawn on Control Risks' collective experience to identify the topics we expect our clients will want us to address in our online services (<em>Security Forecast</em> and <em>Travel Security Guide</em>) and consultancy in 1996. <em>Business Security Outlook</em> provides a preview.

<H3>Definitions of political risk</H3>
</center>
<H4>INSIGNIFICANT</H4>
<P>The government is stable and there is a high degree of political continuity. There are no significant extra-constitutional threats to the authority of the government. Examples: Austria, Singapore.</p>
<H4>LOW</H4>
<P>The political system is well-established. Any changes of government are likely to take place through due constitutional process. However, internal political disputes may lead to sudden changes of leaders and therefore a lack of political continuity. Examples: most western European countries.</p>
<H4>MEDIUM</H4>
<P>The government's authority is secure in the short term, but political and state institutions are weak or evolving. In some Medium risk countries there is a significant threat of military or other extra-legal intervention. Examples: Pakistan (except for Baluchistan, Sind and NWFP tribal areas where the central government has little effective control and which are rated as High), Venezuela.</p>
<H4>HIGH</H4>
<P>Political institutions are highly unstable, and the government may be ousted by non-constitutional means. In extreme cases the country is already in a state of anarchy or civil war. Examples: Cambodia, Afghanistan, Haiti.</P>
<center>
<H3>Definitions of security risk</H3>
</center>
<H4>INSIGNIFICANT</H4>
<P>Virtually no politically-motivated violence, and a low level of violent crime. However, isolated attacks by foreign terrorist may occur. Example: Switzerland.</p>
<H4>LOW</H4>
<P>Occasional violence perpetrated by terrorists or criminals. This affects companies or individual members of their staff only infrequently. Examples: Germany, China.</p>
<H4>MEDIUM</H4>
<P>Internal unrest or violence frequently perpetrated by terrorists or criminals. This occasionally affects companies or individual members of their staff, but there is no sustained threat directed specifically against foreign companies. Examples: India (except Kashmir, Assam, Manipur and Nagaland which are High), Peru.</p>
<H4>HIGH</H4>
<p>
Either: The government is unable to maintain law and order. In extreme cases conditions verge on war or civil war.<br>
Or: There is a sustained campaign specifically directed against the personnel and property of oil and gas companies.
</p>
Examples: Liberia, Zaire.</P>

<H3>The World in 1996</H3>

Advice and opinions given represent the best judgement of the Company but, subject to section 2 (1) Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977, the Company shall in no case be liable for any claims, or special, incidental or consequential damages, whether caused by the Company's negligence (or that of any member of its staff) or in any other way.</H4>

</center>
<HR noshade>
<H3>INTRODUCTION</H3>
<P>Political instability and inadequate regulatory infrastructures are the main threats to businesses operating in emerging markets. Leading companies in the UK and the US interviewed in late 1995 by the Industrial Research Bureau (IRB) on behalf on Control Risks believe such issues pose greater risks than crime and corruption, which have traditionally been business' greatest fears. The <A HREF = "graphs/bsograph.html">graphs</A> in this section illustrate perceptions reflected in the survey.</P>
<P>In 1996 there will be much to feed executives' concerns. The world is not necessarily a riskier place, but - as we shall show - the issues confronting business are more diverse and potentially more complex than ever before.</P>
<P>Impending major elections, together with wider social and economic forces, will challenge established political orders. Opportunities will continue to outstrip legislation in many parts of the developing world, forcing companies to deal with piecemeal reform and arbitrary rulings.</P>
<P>International business will also be under greater public scrutiny than ever in the next decade. On issues such as the environment and labour conditions, companies can no longer rely solely on regulatory and scientific approval. Instead, they must win public acceptance of their 'licence to operate'.</P>
<H3>Business opportunities in an age of uncertainty</H3>
<P>The year will see Presidential elections in Russia and the US, as well as parliamentary elections in countries as diverse as India, Iran, Israel, Nicaragua and Zambia. There will also be elections for the general-secretaryship of the UN and, although the health of Chinese paramount leader Deng Xiaoping defies conventional medical prognosis, 1996 may yet prove to be the year when he too finally passes from the scene. By the end of the year more than half the world's population may find itself under new political leadership.</P>
<P>The appointment and replacement of world leaders demands careful analysis, and this is included in the regional sections of this report. But individuals - however powerful - will have only a limited impact on the global environment for business. The key themes for 1996 go beyond the political. They include intensifying commercial competition, accelerating social and technological change, and deepening uncertainty on all fronts. Demographic pressures and technological innovations are facilitating the dispersal of manufacturing from richer but more expensive OECD countries to cheaper developing nations. While Western Europe and Japan are experiencing a greying of the population, emerging markets boast a preponderance of young people - for example, 54% of the population of Latin America is under 24. Most of the 90 million people born in 1996 will come from the developing world.</P>
<P>These factors raise a series of questions which form the main themes of Business Security Outlook. What are the politics of the generation now reaching adulthood? Will these politics be new, or will they be a repackaging of old ideas? To what extent will improved communications create a genuinely global constituency? Or will there be a retreat into regional, ethnic and religious particularism? What role will business play in shaping views? To what extent will company policies be shaped by hitherto unknown external pressures?</P>
<P>Our overall thesis is that rigid ideology has lost its appeal, but that idealism has not. This idealism is expressed in various ways: religious, nationalist and environmentalist. Companies will be under greater public scrutiny than ever, not only in their own country or areas of operations overseas, but across the globe.</P>
<H3>New business frontiers</H3>
<P>In the last five years large numbers of Western businesses have expanded into previously closed or restricted areas. This trend is certain to continue, but certain types of Western investment will remain politically sensitive.</P>
<P>The mining industry is a particularly dramatic example of Western commercial expansion. Since 1990, several countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America have gone out of their way to attract international mining companies - most recently Kazakstan, which has revised its regulations on the production of gold. Companies which had previously confined operations to North America have diversified abroad in great numbers. Similar expansion can be seen in telecommunications in countries such as India, Mexico and Brazil. </P>
<P>Investors need to assess not only whether this new willingness to accommodate foreign companies will last, but also the extent to which optimism runs ahead of reality. Executives polled by the IRB said that inadequate regulatory infrastructures posed a serious threat to business in emerging markets: out of ten categories of risk, US companies rated legal inadequacy as the biggest threat, and British companies put it second only to political instability.</P>
<P>However, companies must also balance immediate drawbacks against long-term prospects. For example, business in the Philippines must contend with nationalist feeling (as much among the elite beneficiaries of protectionism as among the dwindling left). Nonetheless, President Ramos is expected to extend and consolidate his liberalising reforms. Similarly in India, where the Maharashtra state government's decision to cancel the Enron power project in August 1995 cast doubt on the country's commitment to foreign investment. However, the two sides are now renegotiating, and the reforms of the last four years will not be reversed after 1996's elections - even if the ruling Congress party does (as widely expected) lose ground. There may be delays and setbacks, but the overall direction of policy in these countries is unlikely to change.</P>
<P>Nevertheless, the oil, gas and mining industries will remain politically sensitive: they are vulnerable to accusations not only of environmental damage but alsoof stealing the 'national patrimony'. Consumer and leisure industries may be controversial for different reasons, as they can be perceived as competing with local firms without offering any unique technological benefit: Indian nationalists argue that their country needs 'computer chips, not potato chips'. In a market as potentially lucrative as India's (in terms of opportunity, it scored more than six out of ten in the IRB survey), foreign investors ignore such attitudes at their peril.</P>
<H3>Moving into former socialist economies</H3>
<P>In former socialist economies, the issue typically is not so much whether there will be a capitalist system in ten years' time as whether the economy will truly be open.</P>
<P>The extent to which former socialist nations complete the transition from command economy to free market system remains unclear. That the process is now irreversible is beyond debate. However, the jury is still out when it comes to gazing ten years down the road.</P>
<P>For example, what will happen to Russia, which is expected to reverse its economic decline in 1996. Will it be a truly capitalist country, will its economy be a distorted system centred on a limited group of powerful lobbies vying for a slice of a stagnant economic pie, or will these lobbies develop a structure of 'crony capitalism' and divide the spoils between them? </P>
<P>Business is undecided: although participants in the IRB survey believe that risks currently outweigh opportunities in Russia, the two are seen as relatively likely to even up in the coming years. The survey's results also reflect economic regeneration in eastern Europe, where opportunities are seen as far outweighing risks - a situation which executives believe will become even more pronounced over the next five years. </P>
<P>In terms of immediate economic rewards, however, the collapse of communism has benefited relatively few people. Adaptable young people who have rapidly learnt the language of Western business have been the 'winners': most other people (especially those over 40) have so far been the 'losers'. This inevitably influences election results. Former communists adopting the banner of social democrats have returned to power in Poland, a pattern which may well be repeated in Russia after presidential elections in June 1996. Although socialist administrations will not completely reverse the process of economic liberalisation, they may slow or distort reforms in the interests of local insiders.</P>
<H3>Containing Corruption</H3>
<P>In China, as in many other developing countries, corruption is one of the main problems for Western companies as the restraining influence of the socialist power structure declines. Due diligence checks on potential business partners will be one of the most crucial factors when considering investment: more than 90% of companies polled by the IRB recognise the importance of due diligence.</P>
<P>With a 1.5 opportunity-risk rating (see attached chart), China is seen as one of the most potentially rewarding of emerging markets. However, executives are concerned about the dangers of corruption, which they rate as third in the list of threats to business. The Chinese government itself recognises that corruption is one of the main threats to social and political stability (though it appears willing to tolerate and even condone the activities of 'patriotic' triads in Hong Kong). </P>
<P>In terms of business conduct, there are many grey areas, and exchanging favours may be a legitimate part of relationship-building. It may not be strictly necessary to arrange a business meeting in Hong Kong rather than in some mainland city, but Chinese business partners (and their wives) will appreciate a business trip with expenses paid and ample opportunities for shopping.Such scenarios may be increasingly commonplace, but it would be a mistake to shrug off the corruption issue as a matter of differing cultural perceptions. </P>
<P>Companies which give in to demands for bribes may find themselves facing higher and higher demands, just as with any other kind of extortion. Demands for greater transparency in international financial transactions are becoming more common, and the communications revolution means that the evidence of corruption will be broadcast in the international media more quickly - particularly if there is a change of regime in the host country. </P>
<P>Many business people argue that competitive pressures leave them with no choice but to conform, but in 1996 (as before), companies may attempt to circumvent the problem by actions such as publicly refusing illegal payments or skilful diplomacy. US oil companies operating in the rural areas of Pakistan have learnt that sponsorship of schools or dispensaries reduces the security budget and the risk of local 'feudal' leaders demanding illegal payments.</P>
<H3>Crime</H3>
<P>Like corruption, rising crime rates are an unpleasant by-product of political transition from authoritarian systems of government. Organised crime is becoming more sophisticated and more international. Companies should not be deterred by crime, but they must devise strategies to deal with it. Many executives already recognise the gravity of the problem: 40% of US respondents to the IRB poll feel that crime will pose an increasing threat to business over the next five years.</P>
<P>The crime problem has several aspects. The most obvious is a sharp increase in muggings and robberies in cities which formerly were largely free of street crime. Some eastern European observers have argued that current crime rates are far from exceptional by world standards, and that their societies are simply returning to a degree of 'normality' - in crime and in other areas - after a period of abnormal repression. Even if this argument is accepted, there is no denying the heightened sense of insecurity in the former Eastern bloc. Similar considerations apply in South Africa, where political transition has been accompanied by spiralling rates of violent urban crime.</P>
<P>The second aspect is the increased prominence of organised crime. Again, Russia provides one of the starkest examples - advice on reducing the risks presented by extortion threats is one of the staple activities of Control Risks' Moscow office - though the problem is endemic throughout much of the former Soviet bloc. Organised crime groups are also becoming increasingly sophisticated, not only in the former Soviet Union but also throughout Africa (where Nigerian fraudsters have extended their tentacles) and South America (where Colombian drug cartels are regrouping after the break-up of the Cali cartel).</P>
<P>Advanced technology provides new opportunities for transnational theft. In August 1995, 24-year-old Vladimir Levin was arrested in Britain after using his computer in St Petersburg to steal $2.8m from Citibank accounts in the US. The frequency and speed of computer financial transactions will ensure that cyber-crime' becomes a growth area in 1996; however, a concerted fight by police and banking authorities is also forecast.</P>
<H3>Ethnic resurgence</H3>
<P>The resurgence of fierce ethnic and communal conflicts in former Yugoslavia and the Caucasus is another by-product of political transition. Communal violence will be a continuing trend in many developing countries.</P>
<P>At first glance, this ethnic resurgence sits uneasily in the modern political world: such conflicts represent increasing particularism at a time of growing globalisation. However, it can be explained at least partly in terms of insecurity. In times of confusion, people look to shared identity as a source of security. Nationalism (where the nation is represented by an ethnic group, as in Serbia), can fill the vacuum left by the collapse of ideology.</P>
<P>Karachi is repeatedly paralysed by strikes: there were 22 in the first ten months of 1995, each one costing the city some US$33m. Ethnic strife has inflicted direct physical and financial losses on locally-based companies, some of which have tried to adapt by employing informal quotas of people from specific communities. </P>
<P>Demands for such quotas are particularly common at mining sites in Papua New Guinea, a country where ethnic and linguistic diversity is especially pronounced. Problems arise, and the risk of violence increases, when the villagers living near remote mining sites lack the skills required for employment. This has been one of the most longstanding sources of friction at the problematic - but lucrative - Ok Tedi mine near the Indonesian border.</P>
<P>Strengthened local identity is reinforcing regional divisions in ethnically diverse countries. Shiv Sena, a coalition partner in India's Maharashtra state government, influenced the cancellation of the Enron contract. Shiv Sena's policies and slogans keep shifting, but one of the most important has been 'Maharashtra for the Maharashtrans'. Regional activists are becoming more powerful than before in many other countries too, and companies will need to accommodate their interests as well as those of the national government.</P>
<H3>Religious resurgence</H3>
<P>Religious resurgence is another aspect of the widespread search for certainty - whether spiritual or social. Religious resurgence is often seen as a problem for international business, which generally likes to think of itself as secular (though individual business leaders may be enthusiastic patrons of religious organisations). However, religious enthusiasm is rarely a threat, except where it combines with wider forces (such as nationalism or political disillusion) to destabilise society. Sensationalist media reports tend to exaggerate the threat from religious movements - a fact seemingly recognised by IRB respondents, who feel religious extremism to be less of a threat than many other issues.</P>
<P>Universalist ideologies are often most potent when combined with a form of nationalism: classic examples include Irish and Polish Catholicism, Iranian Islam, Sinhalese Buddhism and Vietnamese communism. Today's radical Muslim youths may be covert consumers of Coca-Cola or connoisseurs of CNN, but they will be no more tolerant of other religions than their forebears. Religious leaders - particularly in the West - may be encouraging ecumenical dialogue, but at street level greater familiarity with other faiths may not inspire greater respect for them.</P>
<P>As we approach the millennium, exclusive religious sects are likely to proliferate. Aum Shinri Kyo's gas attack on the Tokyo subway in March 1995 points to the acute dangers of distorted religiosity. Messianic cults are all the more dangerous because they answer to no earthly constituency, and may believe violence and destruction to be of no consequence in the face of an impending apocalypse.</P>
<P>Companies win credit when they respect and accommodate the beliefs of their employees - for example, by allocating prayer rooms for devout Muslims, or by establishing special accounts conforming to Islamic prescriptions.</P>
<H3>Environmental activism</H3>
<P>Pressure on business from environmental activists is set to increase in 1996 and beyond: the IRB survey identified environmentalism as the fastest-growing issue for companies operating in emerging markets. NGOs in developing countries will co-ordinate with their counterparts in the West to campaign against companies perceived to be damaging the environment - even though developing countries' governments may be less concerned about such issues. Successful companies will build environmental issues into every stage of their decision-making structure rather than treating them in isolation.</P>
<P>The rise of global environmental activism in the past five years has left international business with nowhere to hide. Companies are increasingly perceived as accountable to a constituency far wider than merely their shareholders and the relevant authority. Businesses can therefore no longer rely solely on regulatory and scientific approval. Instead, they must win public acceptance of their 'licence to operate'. </P>
<P>Those who do not gain such acceptance risk condemnation on a worldwide scale. For the impact of environmental degradation is truly a global issue. Advances in technology have allowed Western pressure groups to co-ordinate their activities with counterparts in developing countries, where they are increasingly managing to fuse the issues of local economic advancement and environmental activism. Business therefore faces demands which go beyond legislation and beyond frontiers. </P>
<P>Tighter environmental regulation at home has helped prompt the expansion abroad of North American and European mining companies. Many of the new host governments are less stringent in their enforcement of environmental regulations than their Western counterparts. However, this may not remain the case for long, and already Western investors cannot afford to allow their standards to slip in developing countries. Environmental disasters such as the alleged pollution of the Essequibo river in Guyana by cyanide from a gold-mining operation receive worldwide publicity.</P>
<P>Environmental issues challenge the existing international political framework because solutions to problems such as global warming are beyond the capacity of individual governments. International environmental initiatives - such as the Montreal Protocol on the phasing out of CFCs - are under way, but progress is slow. The World Trade Organisation is expected to report in 1996 on integrating environmental standards into international free trade.</P>
<P>The burden of environmental progress will therefore increasingly fall on business. This is not necessarily a negative force, since it gives industry the spur to innovate. Corporations can gain a significant advantage over their competitors if they conduct themselves in an environmentally-friendly fashion, or at least mitigate any environmental damage which their activities cause.</P>
<P>We expect the most successful companies to be the ones which anticipate the environmental standards and expectations of the future, and do not just 'make do' in the short term.</P>
<H3>Military intervention and sanctions </H3>
<P>The international community has yet to find a generally accepted way of dealing with 'rogue' states such as Iraq, Libya and North Korea and of weak states such as Somalia, Rwanda, Liberiaand Sierra Leone, where fierce internal rivalries lead to a collapse of central government authority. One strategy is to impose economic sanctions against such states, and this may create problems for international businesses. The executives who played down the threat from sanctions in the IRB survey (British respondents felt it the least serious danger to business in emerging markets, and US executives rated it the third lowest) may yet find themselves wide of the mark.</P>
<P>It is generally deemed unacceptable for irresponsible regimes to acquire weapons of mass destruction or to engage in mass killings of their own subjects. However, there is a marked lack of consensus on the mechanisms for international intervention. Who has the right to decide whether to intervene. Who should bear the cost? And what happens to business caught in the middle?</P>
<P>Economic sanctions are often seen as a '<BR>
middle way' between ineffectual diplomatic protests and open conflict. The US in particular has a tradition of imposing unilateral sanctions on governments which it considers unacceptable: senior Congressmen are currently arguing for a tightening of existing US unilateral sanctions against Cuba and Iran, and the possible imposition of sanctions against Burma and Nigeria.</P>
<P>Such sanctions put US companies at a potentially massive disadvantage - President Clinton's trade ban on Iran in March 1995 forced Conoco to withdraw from a major oil contract, which was quickly snapped up by the French firm Total. Investors' home governments may therefore prove a more potent source of political risk in 1996 than the host country - even when the host country is Islamic and, at least notionally, revolutionary. </P>
<P>Multilateral sanctions are generally more effective than unilateral ones, but harder to achieve. The US is no longer the world policeman with the power to arrest offenders unilaterally. Rather, it has become the world sheriff, which has to raise a posse of other countries to pursue offenders. However, it is notoriously difficult to achieve agreement on such issues, and in any case the UN Charter permits sanctions only in cases where the offending country poses a plausible threat to international security. There is therefore little prospect of UN sanctions against Nigeria.</P>
<P>Since the US therefore has no prospect of achieving multilateral sanctions against Cuba or Iran, its companies may continue to lose out - prompting Congressional pressure for new legislation making it possible to sue foreign companies which trade with the country under US sanctions and with the US. This issue is likely to create friction between the US and its European allies - and their companies - in 1996.</P>
<H3>Constructive engagement and commercial diplomacy</H3>
<P>The difficulties involved with military intervention, and the mixed record of economic sanctions, has raised interest in the possibilities of positive sanctions' or constructive engagement', a phrase popularised during the South African debate in the 1980s. Rather than simply penalising delinquent governments, is it possible to offer them positive incentives to change? If so, can international companies play a constructive role?</P>
<P>One of the problems with constructive engagement is that it is often regarded as a form of appeasement, all 'carrot' and no 'stick'. This has been a common Western criticism of the ASEAN countries' approach to Burma, a country which has been condemned for human rights abuses in five successive annual UN General Assemblies. In the US, the state of Massachusetts and several city administrations have announced a boycott of all companies operating in Burma, accusing them of collaboration with an illegitimate regime.</P>
<P>Such charges would be easier to rebut if it could be established that international companies play a positive diplomatic role in offending countries'. But this goes against the instincts of most commercial managers, who see themselves as 'apolitical': if they engage in diplomacy at all, they wish to do so quietly and without fanfare. However, it is becoming increasingly difficult for businesses investing in controversial countries to distance themselves from wider political considerations. Companies currently in Nigeria, for example, cannot help but become actors in the internal political debate, whether they like it or not. </P>
<P>Yet there are many cases where business has played a positive role in promoting political transformations. One example is South Africa, where white business leaders were among the first members of the establishment to establish contact with the ANC (well before Nelson Mandela's release). The close relations which top ANC officials continue to enjoy with white executives - and President Mandela's willingness to retain white financial officials in his cabinet - have been instrumental in attracting foreign investors to South Africa.</P>
<H3>Conclusion</H3>
<P>If the late 1980s was the era of rapacious self-interest, the late 1990s will be the era of unprecedented accountability. It will become increasingly difficult for international companies to remain aloof from outside forces. They will have to try harder than ever before to keep their feet on the shifting sands of international and internal politics, accommodating the interests of a body politic which encompasses not only governments but also interest groups and the public at large. 'Ethical scanning' is therefore no longer an optional extra. It may well prove the key to commercial success. </P>

<H2>What we said last year</H2>
<H3>Africa</H3>
<H4><em>what we said</em>: &quot;In 1995, many of the continent's long-running wars will wind down, and the risk/return ratios for foreign investors will be more favourable. Companies will find that most African countries are keener than ever before to ensure adequate operating environments for business - though crime will remain a major issue.&quot;</H4>
<H4><em>what happened</em>: Ceasefires held in both Angola and Mozambique. Many Western corporate strategists were surprised to find how eager governments were to attract foreign investment: for example, mining investment regulations were revised and liberalised in Burkina Faso, Cote d'Ivoire, Mali, Niger and Tanzania. Several countries (including Uganda) also launched drives against corruption. However, the end to war had a less savoury flipside: a combination of cheap arms and unemployed soldiers helped to push crime rates up, particularly in large cities</H4>
<H3>France</H3>
<H4><em>what we said</em>: &quot;French hostility to the Algerian Islamic extremist opposition could prompt retaliatory violence in France - particularly Paris.&quot;</H4>
<H4><em>what happened</em>: The Algerian extremist Armed Islamic Groups (GIA) claimed responsibility for a bombing campaign which began in July 1995. By October, nine attacks had taken place (seven in Paris and two in the Lyons area), killing seven people and injuring more than 150. The campaign followed the GIA hijack of an Air France airliner in late December 1994 - days after BSO 1995 had been published.</H4>
<H3>Poland</H3>
<H4><em>what we said</em>: &quot;President Lech Walesa is increasingly isolated. Walesa wants to introduce a largely Presidential system (as in France), while parliament wants a German-style parliamentary system. Hopes of resolving this constitutional dispute before the November 1995 Presidential elections have faded. Walesa is unlikely to win a second term in office.&quot;</H4>
<H4><em>what happened</em>: Infighting between Walesa and Poland's coalition government continued as predicted, with Walesa on occasion threatening to dissolve parliament and opposing two Prime Ministers (Waldemar Pawlak and his successor Josef Oleksy). In Presidential elections in November 1995, Walesa was defeated by former communist Aleksander Kwasniewski</H4>

<h3><a name="purpose">Background of the Rockland Online
Directory</a></h3>

The Rockland Online Directory was created by Mary Diffley, Drew
Morone and Klaas deWaal of the United Computer Specialists, Inc.
(UCS)
because of their belief in, and participation in a community-wide
initiative called the Rockland County Computer and
Telecommunications Initiative (CATI).  CATI is a coalition
organized by Harriet Cornell, Rockland Legislator, which consists
of representatives from school districts, libraries, social
services, non profit organizations, businesses, parents and
government in Rockland.
<p>
The inspiration for CATI sprung from a commitment to Internet
education and community Internet presence demonstrated by Mary
Diffley, CATI coordinator.  Response to her previous projects, <a
href="#govt"><i> Rockland Government</a> (on the Web),<a
href="#training"> Internet Training Courses</a>, </i>and her
weekly column <a href="#user"> <i>User Friendly </a></i> was
great,
identifying a need for a the formation of a countywide initiative
to introduce the Internet and other new technologies to the
community.  
<p>
UCS will continue in their community
service to organize a comprehensive, interactive Internet
Directory for the community of Rockland through the Rockland
Online Directory.  It is the intent of UCS to maintain and manage
the Rockland Online Directory and to formally offer it's contents
to a non-political, non-biased Rockland County organization whose
mission is to truly service the needs of the electronic community
represented by
county, town and local governmental units, non-profit
organizations, educational instutions, businesses and residents.
<p>
<h3><a name="service"> A Community Perspective</a></h3>
The Rockland Online Directory is designed as a comprehensive
online service directory for the community of Rockland County,
New York.  The Directory was constructed with the belief that a
unified directory structure for Rockland County on the Internet
will enrich the
community as a whole, save duplication of effort, create a sense
of
community and morale and make Rockland visible to  the world
through the valuable use of the World Wide Web. 
  With this
Online Directory, Rockland services can be easily found in one
centralized place.
<p>
The Rockland Online Directory is friendly and easy to navigate. 
Home pages for
many libraries, schools,  colleges, non-profit organizations
and businesses now have a home in the Directory and can be easily
accessed.  The Rockland Online Directory merely compiles Internet
addresses and points users to other areas on the World Wide Web
where the sought information can be found, specifically
information pertinent to Rockland County. UCS is committed to
assisting local organizations in using the Internet to publish
information about their services, while assuring that the public
has access to valuable community information. 
<p>
With regard to information development, UCS will develop limited 
information as an incentive for users to use the Directory. 
Ultimately, all the information will reside outside the Directory
on various servers around the World Wide Web. Feel free to <a
href="http://www.roldirect.com/submit.htm"> submit </a> a listing
and
ideas to the Rockland
Online Directory.

<h3><a name="location"> Location and Maintenance of the
Rockland
Online Directory</a></h3>
The Rockland Online Directory is stored on a computer hard drive
which is the
possession of UCS.  The
computer is connected to the Internet and is a designated World
Wide Web Server.  The Internet address for the Rockland Online
Directory is 
http://www.roldirect.com, an address registered by UCS, Inc. 

<h3> <a name="investment">An Investment In The
Community</a></h3>
An investment of approximately $70,000 in equipment and services
during the first year of operation has been donated by UCS to
maintain the Rockland Online Directory as a community service. 
Community service organizations are encouraged to get involved in
the Rockland Online Directory through interaction with the
Rockland community through the <a
href="http://www.roldirect.com/people/lead.htm"> Community
Leaders Mailing List </a> as well as through the creation of
World Wide Web Pages.  Contact your local
service provider for information about Web Page creation, or
contact UCS at <a href="mailto:info@ucs.net"> info@ucs.net</a>
<p>
<h3><a name="work">A Work In Progress </a></h3>
The development of the Directory is a work-in-progress 
The mission of the Rockland Online Directory is to create an
electronic community, preventing duplication of effort and
bringing together the various entities and organizations within
Rockland County. It is important that community members and
representatives of community organizations take the initiative to
get involved in the Rockland Online Directory.  Your input is
valuable and needed to make the Directory a success.

<h3>Early Morning at the Hook; Upper Nyack, NY (1992)</h3>
Hook Mountain is one of the most prominent and well recognized
landscapes in Rockland County and the Hudson River Valley.  It
has been the subject of inspiration for artists over the years
including Edward Hopper, who was born in Nyack and did a painting
of the Hook around 1990.  During the mid- 1800's, Hook Mountain
was quarried for trap rock.  Concerned citizens convinced New
York State to purchase the area as a park in 1917, but the quarry
was allowed to continue there until 1923.  This photograph was
part of a documentary of the Hudson River titled "One Day In The
Life Of The Hudson".<p>

<h3>Entering The Hudson Highlands; Bear Mountain (1992)</h3>
The historic Hudson Highlands constitute on of the oldest land
masses in North America and probably one of the most picturesque
topographic features of the eastern states.  Storm King, Bear
Mountain, Breakneck and Dunderberg are a few of the well known
ridgelines which extend over one thousand feet above the Hudson
River.  The highlands were probably once more than 10,000 feet
high but have since become rounded as their size has steadily
eroded away over the last 650 million years.<p>

<h3>Early Spring on Gate Hill; Stony Point, NY (1991)</h3>
Spring comes to the foothills of Harriman State Park, this house
is tucked away in the rural countryside and is reminiscent of
home styles that are native to northern Rockland County.  The
peace and solitude found on a country road and the mountains of
the Hudson Highlands create a scene that makes this area truly
unique.<p>

<h1> History of the Internet </h1>

<UL>
<LI>The Internet began as an experiment by the U.S. Government to
connect mainframe
computers across the country for safe and efficient transfer of
intelligence data
<p>
<li>In 1968, when 4 mainframe computers successfully transmitted
data, the Internet was born
<p>
<li>Once the network protocol (a standardized technology) was
established, 
the many more computers connected to the growing network
<p>
<li>Throughout the 70's and 80's the Internet was used mostly by
Government; Universities; Research Institutions; Big Corporations
<p>
<li> Due to the proliferation of personal computers, the Internet
is now available to everyone
</ul>
<hr>
<h1>The Internet: An Inter-networking of computers</h1>
 
<ul>
<LI>A collection of Local Area Networks (LAN) into a larger Wide
Area Network
(WAN)
<p>
<LI>The proper name for a certain inter-network of computers
around the world 
</ul>
<hr>
<h1>The Internet has recently been referred to by other names
</h1>

<ul>
<LI>"Cyberspace"
<p>
<LI>"The Information Superhighway"
</UL>
<hr>
<h1>Who controls the Internet?</h1>
<ul>
<LI>No one and everyone.
<p>
<LI>The Internet consists of thousands of  independent networks,
each with their own administrative authorities 
<p>
<LI>The general direction of the Internet is organized by
the<em>Internet Society</em>
</ul>

<hr>
<h1>Why is global networking so valuable? </h1>
<LI>Instant access to huge databases of information scattered
around the world.  This information is developed by researchers,
educators, businesses, governments, organizations and
individuals.
<p>
<LI>Business owners and managers find peers involved in similar
work and share and communicate new ideas over the Internet
<p>
<li> Students and educators collaborate on projects over the
Internet.
<p>
<LI>The Internet is a cost-effective and quick way to transfer
documents and files to remote locations - quicker and less
expensive than courier services or even fax
</ul>
<hr>
<h1>Who Uses the Internet?</h1>
<ul>
<LI>An estimated 50-70 million users - growing every day!
<P>
<LI>Estimates of over a hundred million regular users in 10 years
<p>
<LI>The U.S. ranks as the biggest user of the Internet 
<p>
<LI>The commercial sector of the Internet the most rapidly
growing area
<p>
<LI>The Internet is still one thirds a research and educational
network 
</ul>
<hr>
<h1>Internet eMAIL</h1>
<p>
Internet eMAIL is in some ways similar to sending mail through
the
postal 
system. A message is addressed, then delivered. However, that's
where the 
similarities end. For example, eMail is sent directly from your 
computer screen, and delivered almost instantaneously. And, of
course, 
you can't send parcels through e-mail!

<p>
Internet eMAIL addresses are in the following format

username@organization<br>For example<br>
mary@newdirection.com<br>
<br>
Where "mary" is the username, and "newdirection.com" is the
organization.<br>
<br>
Within the organization:<br>
<ul>
<li>"COM" stands for "commercial" entity
<li>"EDU" stands for "educational" entity
<li>"GOV" stands for "governmental" entity
<li>"ORG" stands for "organizational" entity
<li>"NET" stands for "network" entity
</ul>
<p>
eMAIL allows you to communication with people when it's
convenient
for you. 
eMAIL allows you to send a single message to multiple people with
one click
<hr>

<h1>Internet Newsgroups</h1>
<p>
Internet Newsgroups are topical discussion areas where people
carry on
dialogues. You can read messages from different users and respond
to them.
<p>
The major benefits of Newsgroups are:<br>
<ul>
<li> Find information on a given topic
<li> Connect with people of similar interests
<li> Get feedback from the group to help solve problems
</ul>
<hr>
<h1>The World Wide Web</h1>
The World Wide Web is the fastest growing facet of the Internet. 
The "WWW" is a collection of computer servers that host hypertext
documents
that are stored on computers world wide. A hypertext document is
one that 
contains embedded objects that link you to other documents,
multi-media 
objects such as images and music, and downloadable binary files,
such as 
software programs, and archived data.
The "web" makes it easy to navigate resources on the Internet,
because 
of its intuitive interface, and the incorporation of standard
Internet 
server protocols, such gopher and FTP. Protocols that in the
past,
have 
had primitive, difficult to use interfaces.Anyone with a
standard computer system and a modem, can access The
World 
Wide Web, however, to fully enjoy all of its features, it is
suggested 
that you have at least a 386 PC with 8 megs of RAM, running
Windows, or a 
similarly configured Macintosh computer.
<p> Lets "jump" to the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov"> White
House</a> (don't forget to come back!)
<p>
<h3>How do people access the World Wide Web?</h3>
People access information on the WWW either throug a dedicated 
network connection, or by using a standard telephone line, a
modem
and 
any type of personal computer. Commercial online services such as
America
Online, CompuServe and Prodigy all offer access to the WWW.

<h3> Hardware Requirements</h3>
Just about any computer will allow access to the World Wide Web.
However, to get the full impact you need more power.<p>
The suggested requirements are: PC- 386 w/8 megs RAM, running
Win.
3.1 or  better<p>
 MAC- 68000 cpu w/8 megs RAM or better.

<p>
<h3> Software
</h3>
In order to access the internet, communications software which
allows your computer to transmit data over telephone lines is
necessary. 

To get the full benefit, you will need to run the same
communications network protocol 
on your computer, that all the computers on The Internet run
..TCP/IP.<p>
On the PC, you have many packages to choose from:<p>
Internet in a Box, Netscape Navigator Personal Edition, Trumpet
Winsock...<p>
For the MAC there is:<P>
MacTCP or OpenTransport WITH..MacPPP, FreePPP, MacSLIP, InterSLIP

FreePPP, etc..<p>

In addition, web browser software is needed to access the World
Wide Web.  The most popular browser is Netscape. 
<p>
<h3> Internet Access providers
</h3> 
Before any of the big on-line services got into providing
Internet 
access, there were many small systems that were providing it
first.
Now 
however, you will find a large array of Internet providers to
choose from  including the commercial on-line services like
Prodigy, AOL,
Compuserve, etc..<P>They all provide a certain level of Internet
Access, some more than
others. The pro's are that these services are easy to set up and
use, the 
cons are that they tend to be expensive, you are limited to their

browsers, and the service tends to be mediocre.<p>The regional 
ISP's (Internet Access Providors) like, Panix, Westnet,
TZ-Link, Pipeline, etc.. give you the most complete Internet
Access.
<p> The pro's are 
that they are usually run by very knowlegable and competent
people,
who 
give personalized service. The con's are that because they offer
such 
open access to Internet Services available,  new users may get
overwhelmed.

<hr>
<h1>What's all the business hype about?</h1>
There is unlimited potential for businesses of any size.  The Web
offers:
<ul>
<li>     A captive, affluent and diverse group of over 50 million
people   
<li>       Businesses all over the world are marketing their
goods and
services to their target
     audiences using the WWW  
<li>  The use of graphics and text help portray a company s image
in a WWW advertisement  
 <li>     The cost for reaching this huge market of potential
customers through the Internet is
     minimal compared to any other form of advertising 
    <li>   A WWW advertisement can be used to gather information
about
a prospect (surveys,
     feedback, lead generation) and to take on-line orders with
minimal human interaction

Dear Friends,
<p>
Choosing where you work is an important decision. So, if you're
looking for a new location for
your business, we invite you to explore Rockland County, where
New York City meets the
Hudson Valley. Consider our advantages.
<p>
There's the County's strategic location.  Rockland is a integral
part of the New York
Metropolitan Area, the largest and most vital market in the U.
S., and our transportation system
provides swift, efficient access by road, rail and air to every
important market in the U.S. and
abroad.
<p>
There's a variety of commercial real estate.  The County is home
to dozens of office parks,
corporate campuses and industrial facilities adaptable to any
business need.  Our businesses, large
and small, many of which are international in scope, have chosen
to participate in Rockland's
future, contributing to its growth and vitality.
<p>
Our local governments know that a strong economy is critical to
our future.  They are committed
to making Rockland more business-friendly by expediting permit
procedures, holding the line on
taxes, and encouraging public/private partnerships to ensure that
we retain and attract business
and jobs for the County.
<p>
Most importantly, Rockland offers an enviable quality of life. 
There are excellent education
facilities, from preschool through post graduate, and a plethora
of programs for adults.  A diverse
mix of affordable and luxury residential real estate is a
Rockland trademark.  Outstanding health
care, award winning visual, performing and literary arts, an
abundance of recreational
opportunities and a wealth of community spirit distinguish
Rockland from the average suburb.
<p>
The advantages are all here, and the Rockland Economic
Development Corporation can help you
to realize them.  We're the one-stop shopping center for any
business planning relocation or
expansion. Come, consider Rockland. You'll be glad you did.
<p>
     
Sincerely,
<p>

<h3><i>Right Near the Big Apple is a Real Plum</h3></i>
</center>              
It's called <b>Rockland County</b>, and it's only 15 miles north
of the
George Washington Bridge.  Most important, it's the least
expensive place to do business in the New York metropolitan
beltway.
<p>
You'll find plentiful commercial land and buildings at
surprisingly affordable prices.  We offer attractive tax
abatements and our utility rates are low in comparison with our
metropolitan neighbors.
<p>
 Rockland has a young, educated labor pool that wants to work
right here.  Plus wide-open major highways, proximity to four
international airports and existing infrastructure.  Add in
superior schools, a wide variety of inviting homes, 30,000 acres
of parklands, rich history and culture - and you've got an
unbeatable environment for family living.  Right on top of New
York City.
<p>
For more information, or to arrange a visit, please call the
Rockland Economic Development Corporation or e-mail <a

<b>
<a name="what">WHAT</a> IS THE COUNTY OF ROCKLAND INDUSTRIAL
DEVELOPMENT AGENCY?</b>
<p>
The IDA is a public benefit corporation organized under State Law
(Gen. Mun. Law, Art. 18-A,
and Sec. 925-1, Ti. 2) to stimulate desirable economic
development in Rockland County by
arranging long-term financing at lower interest rates through the
issuance of tax exempt and
taxable bonds.  These bonds are issued for sale to individuals,
banks, funds or other financial
institutions.  Agency members are appointed by the County
Executive and confirmed by the
County Legislature.
<p>
<b><a name="advantages">ADVANTAGES</a> OF IDA FINANCING</b>
<p>
As a property owned by a public benefit corporation, facilities
financed by IDA are exempt from
New York State mortgage tax.  The facility may also be exempt
from sales on materials used in
its construction and from Capital Gains Transfer Tax.
<p>
IDA generally finances projects at lower interest costs.  In the
case of taxable bonds, lower
interest rates result from the use of commercial paper by
underwriters who purchase the
issues from the agency or a direct placement by the bank to the
purchaser (bypassing underwriter).
In the case of tax exempt bonds, IDA lower interest rates result
from the tax-exemption. The
agency may also provide longer term financing; and can provide up
to 100% financing of all costs
including most fees and expenses.
<p>
The interest rate on IDA financing is determined by the
feasibility of the project, the credit-worthiness of the firm,
and the levels of interest rates generally.  For tax-exempt
bonds, cost
savings as a result of financing through the IDA can be 70%-85%
of interest rates for taxable
bonds.
<p>
<b><a name="bonding">THE BONDING</a> PROCESS</b>
<p>
Taxable and tax-exempt securities are issued in the name of the
IDA and the monies thus obtained
are used by the applicant firm to build or purchase.
<p>
Bonds are tax exempt because they are issued by a public agency
to finance a Legislatively defined
public purpose, but the project must satisfy requirements of the
tax law to qualify for the tax
exemption.  As a facility owned by a public benefit corporation
to serve a public purpose, they
are exempt from property taxes.  However, payments in lieu of
taxes (PILOT) will be made by
the firm to the various taxing jurisdictions in which the
facility is located.  Contractual agreements
for "In Lieu of Tax" payments are made between the firm and the
taxing jurisdictions (municipal
governments, school districts and county government).  These
payments are equal to the amount
which the facility would have paid if it was not owned by the
IDA.
<p>
It is the firm's responsibility to locate bond buyers.  The IDA
serves as a conduit for taxable or
tax exempt funding, but it is up to the firm to locate the
lender(s) who will buy the bonds; an
underwriter who will publicly offer the bonds; and, if
applicable, a bank that will provide a letter
of credit to secure the bonds.  The bonds are repaid by lease
payments made by the firm to the
IDA for the facility sufficient to amortize the bonds.  The bonds
are secured by the credit of the
firm for which the bonds are issued plus any other security which
may be required by the bond
buyer.  The bonds are non-recourse special obligation bonds and
are not the obligation of
Rockland County and are not payable from any public monies.  The
County of Rockland IDA
owns the facility for the term of the bonds.  When the bonds have
been retired the firm using the
IDA financing will purchase the facility back from the IDA for as
little as $1.00.
<p>
<b><a name="types">TYPES OF BONDS</b></a>
<p>
<dl>
<dt><b>1. Taxable Bonds:<p></b>
<dd> A.   Eligible Projects:<p>

   <dd>       Industrial, manufacturing, warehousing, commercial,
real estate development, and
          research facilities, as well as projects related to
pollution control, waste disposal
          and environmental protection are eligible.  Financing
is only available for the
          following types of activities:  Purchase of land,
building of new structures,
          acquisition and renovation of existing structures and
purchase of machinery and
          equipment.  In the case for taxable bonds, funding may,
in certain cases, be used
          to refinance existing debt.  There is no limit to the
size of a taxable IDA bond
          issue.  Generally, $4 million minimum is considered to
be cost effective).<p>

  <dd>   B.   Costs:<p>

     <dd>     IDA fees for taxable bonds include a $2,500
application
fee, a 1% less $1,500
          financing fee as appropriate, a $1,000 annual
application renewal fee, and a project
          modification fee of $2,500 per change or modification. 
Bond counsel fees for bank
          purchase financing usually range between $5,000 -
$11,000 payable at closing,
          depending on the size and complexity of the issue. 
They may be higher for public
          offerings and credit enhanced deals.  Agency counsel
fees range between $2,000 -
          4,000 and are payable at closing.<p>

<dt><b>2.   Tax Exempt Bonds:<p></b>

    <dd> A.   Eligible Projects:<p>

       <dd>   Manufacturing projects, as well as projects related
to
pollution control, waste
          disposal and environmental protection are eligible. 
Financing is only available for
          the purchase of land, building of new structures,
acquisition and renovation of
          existing structures and purchase of machinery and
equipment.  Tax rules limit
          purchasing existing facilities without substantial
renovation (15% for real property
          and 100% for used equipment). Funding cannot be used to
refinance existing debt.
          There is a limit to the size of the IDA tax-exempt bond
issue for private for profit
          firms such that the firm cannot spend more that
$10,000,000 on capital
          expenditures in the municipality where the project is
located over a six-year time
          period.  This period is measured three years in either
direction from the date of
          bond issue without causing the bonds to lose their tax
exempt status.  Thus, tax
          exempt issues are effectively limited to under
$10,000,000, except that the capital
          spending does not apply to pollution control and solid
waste facilities.  Note:  If
          the bond issue itself is $1,000,000 or less, the
capital spending limit does not
          apply. In addition, this limit does not apply to
certain types of facilities, such solid
          waste, water or sewage, or to not-for-profit
organizations.<p>

<Dd>B.   Costs:<p>

   <dd>  IDA fees for tax-exempt bonds include a $2,500
application
fee, a financing fee of 1% less
     $1,500 of the bond issue at closing subject to the arbitrage
restrictions of the Internal
     Revenue Code, a $1,000 annual application renewal fee and a
project modification fee of
     $2,500 per change or modification.  Bond counsel fees for
bank purchased financing
     usually range between $11,000 - $25,000 payable at closing,
depending on the size and
     complexity of the issue.  They may be higher for public
offering and credit enhanced
     deals.  Agency counsel fees range between $3,500 - $6,500
and are payable at closing. 
     Other fees negotiated with the lender include financing fees
(letter of credit costs),
     remarketing fee, if applicable; a letter of credit fee, if
applicable; a commitment fee, if
     applicable; and, purchaser counsel fees. 
</dl>
<p>
<b><a name="svcs">SERVICES/DOCUMENTATION:</b></a>
<p>
The main types of lenders are banks or consortiums of banks,
insurance companies or other
financial institutions or the general public:  In short, any
lender interested in tax exempt or taxable
securities.
<p>
A number of individuals or firms are generally involved in IDA
financing, in addition to the IDA
and the firm:  the Legal counsel to the IDA (who represents the
IDA in negotiating with the firm);
the IDA bond counsel (who is the attorney to the transaction and
passes on the validity of the
bonds, as well as prepares basic documentation and offers an
opinion on the exempt status of the
bonds); the trustee (who handles the flow of funds [lease
payments, debt service] for IDA) and
its counsel; and, the underwriter (who prepares and places
issues) and its counsel.
<p>
The following basic documentation will be needed for IDA
financing:  Lease agreement between
the IDA and the firm, the indenture between the IDA and trustee,
the bond purchase agreement
among firm, IDA, and purchasers, use of proceeds agreement,
mortgage payment in lieu of tax
agreement, offering document, if bonds are publicly marketed, and
other documents necessary to
close the transaction in compliance with federal and state law as
well as lender requirements.
<p>
<a name="lease"><b>STRAIGHT LEASE PROGRAM</a></b><br>
The Straight Lease Program is a mechanism which is allowed under
the 1993 Legislative amendments to the New York State Industrial
Development Agency Act.  Essentially this is a form of "financial
assistance" by which tax exemptions are provided by an IDA taking
title to or an interest in property without any related issuance
of IDA bonds. The company gets the benefit of the property by
leasing it back from the IDA for a nominal sum. The benefit for a
company is in the exemption from sales tax on equipment purchase
and on mortgage recording tax.  There is also less paperwork.
<p>
<b>Fee Schedule</b><br>
Financing Fees:<br>
Application fee: $2,500 due at time of application.
Non-refundable. Amount is deducted from Closing Fee.
<p>
Predevelopment fee: .1% of the project amount. Non-refundable.
Amount is deducted from the Closing Fee. (Where financing is
obtained, the project amount is the portion of the
financing for eligible costs. Where the project is self-financed,
the project amount equals 90% of the total project cost including
soft costs.)
<p>
Closing fees: Up to and including $5 million in project amounts,
fee is 1% of the project amount.  For project amounts in excess
of $5 million, fee is 1/2% of the excess of the project
amount.  
<p>
<b>Bond Counsel fee:<br></b>
Fees will generally range between $12,500 and $17,500, depending
on the complexity of the issue.
<p>
<b>Local Counsel fee:<br></b>
Fees will generally range between $5,000 and $10,000, depending
on the complexity of the issue.
<p>
<b>Annual Compliance fee:</b><br>
$500

<h2>Capital Access 
Program</h2>

<center>
<h2>                       PROGRAM DESCRIPTION   </h2></center>  
<i>The Capital 
Access Program</i> 
is based on a risk pooling concept. It is an approach that is     
fundamentally different from the traditional type of insurance or 
guarantee program, which     guarantees a percentage of a loan on a 
loan-by-loan basis. Instead, the Capital Access Program is     based on 
the portfolio.  <p>
   For each bank participating in the Capital Access 
Program, a special reserve fund is established     to cover losses from 
a portfolio of loans that the bank makes under the program. This special 
    reserve fluid is owned and controlled by the state but is earmarked 
for and established at the     bank. Thus, each participating bank has 
its own separate reserve. A bank can withdraw fluids     from the 
reserve only to cover losses on loans made under the program     

<p>
</ul>
When a 
bank makes a loan under the program, the borrower pays a one-time 
premium charge     into the reserve. The state then matches the total of 
the borrower's payment. The borrower's     premium payment is one of the 
terms of the loan to be worked out as part of the private     
transaction between the bank and the borrower. (The premium payment, and 
other up-front     expenses, may be financed as part of the loan).     
<p>
If a bank develops a portfolio of loans under the program, it might have 
a reserve equal to (for     example) ten percent of the total amount of 
that portfolio. In such a situation, the bank could     sustain a dollar 
loss rate of up to ten percent on that portfolio and still be completely 
covered     against the loss. This gives the bank the ability to absorb 
a higher loss rate than it could tolerate     on its conventional loans. 
However, the bank must still be prudent, since it is completely at risk  
   for any losses that exceed the coverage provided by the reserve.  
<p>

Because of the payments that need to be made into the reserve, a loan 
under this program is     likely to be a little bit more expensive than 
a conventional bank loan. The key point is that the     program will 
provide access to financing for many companies that cannot qualify for   
  conventional bank financing. Financing under the Capital Access 
Program is likely to be much     less expensive for the company than 
alternative non-bank sources of financing (if any are     available).<p>    
<b>Businesses Deal Directly With Participating Banks.</b><br>    
It is important to emphasize that a loan under this program is a private 
transaction 
between the     bank and the borrower. The state plays no role in the 
decision by the bank regarding making the
loan, or in setting the interest rate, fees, duration or other terms or 
conditions of the loan. Although the program assists banks that wish to be 
more aggressive in taking more risk than normal, it is still the bank that 
bears the risk of the loan and is responsible for the decision making. No 
individual or agency, private or public, may influence the bank's 
decision.<p>
<b>Flexibility And Lack of Bureaucracy</b><br>
The program is characterized 
by its flexibility and its total lack of bureaucracy. The bank 
simply makes the loan, and then files a one-page loan filing form with the 
state within ten days after the loan is made. Loans can be long term or 
short term, term loans or letters of credit. Once a loan is made under the 
program, the bank has flexibility to recast, extend or refinance the loan 
to address the needs of the business. Claim procedures are equally simple. 
Reports from the banks are kept to an absolute minimum. Interest earned on 
reserve accounts can be added to the reserve, but can be "swept" back 
periodically to the original cap fluid, to offset expenses and add to the 
life ofthe fund. <p>
<b>
Eligible Uses </b><br>
Program eligibility is very broad based, and 
with a few exceptions encompasses any business located in New York that 
satisfies the bank's criteria, One restriction is against using 
the program to finance "passive" or investment/speculative real 
estate.<p>
All banks, savings banks, cooperative banks, trust companies and 
savings and loans with either state or federal charters may participate, 
as long as the principal office is in New York.

<h2>   GOVERNOR PATAKI ANNOUNCES WESTCHESTER-ROCKLAND                   
SMALL 
BUSINESS INITIATIVE </h2></center>    
Governor George F. Pataki announced 
today the 
establishment of the Westchester Rockland Capital Access Program (CAP), 
the first joint county loan program in NewYork State, bolstered by a 
State funded $750,000 Loss Reserve Account (LRA)+ Charles A. Gargano, 
Chairman and Commissioner, Empire State Development (ESD), 
presented details of the proposal on behalf of the Governor, at an event 
with Westchester County Executive Andrew P. O'Rourke and Rockland County 
Executive C. Scott Vanderhoef   <p>
  Governor Pataki said, "Westchester and 
Rockland's small businesses are vital components in New York's ongoing 
economic renewal. I am commited to doing what we can to build a business 
climate in these counties that will foster growth for generations to come. 
This area is a great place for companies to come and grow, a place 
where entrepreneurs know that they can build a future." 
<p>
    The CAP will 
provide small businesses greater access to capital and enhance the ability 
of banks to make business loans. The LRA is designed to cover a 
reasonable percentage of losses in a given bank portfolio and encourage 
the banks to make more loans. Gargano presented a check for $750,000 for 
the LRA to County Executives O'Rourke and Vanderhoef.     
<p>
Chairman Gargano 
said, "The CAP program is another example of the Pataki Administration's 
continuing efforts to encourage private sector investment and create jobs. 
The CAP will fulfill one of the most frequently cited needs of small 
business -- greater access to capital. Small businesses have accounted for 
the vast majority of the new business in the Westchester-Rockland area. 
The success of these entrepreneurs will foster New York State's continuing 
economic resurgence."     
<p>
Westchester County Executive O'Rourke said, 
"The need for capital is a hurdle every small business faces. This new 
program will address the needs of many people who currently fall through 
the cracks, and make new jobs possible throughout both our counties." 
<p>
 Rockland County Executive Vanderhoef said, "This program is 
characterized by its flexibility and lack of red tape. The loan is a 
private transaction between the bank and the borrower. Loans can be long 
or short term, or letters of credit."<p>    
 To lessen the bureaucracy, the 
State funded LRA and the CAP will both be administered by the Westchester 
County Association, headed by President Lawrence F.Dwyer, Sr. and the 
Rockland Economic Development Corporation (REDC), headed by President 
Holly Freedman. Each participating bank will deposit a portion of the LRA 
so that each bank has its own reserve, and can withdraw these earmarked 
fluids only to cover losses on loans made under the program.

<center><h2>Fujitsu Announces New Location in Rockland</h2></center>
 Pearl River, WY-- Fujitsu Network Transmission 
Systems, Inc. (FNTS) announced the       establishment of a 35,000 square 
foot development center in Rockland County that will create       250 new 
highly skilled engineering jobs in the region. Fujitsu Limited, the 
parent company of       FNTS, is a multi-billion dollar leader in 
telecommunications, computers and microelectronics.       The new 
development center-- located in the heart of the Tri-State region's 
technology belt at       Two Blue Hill Plaza, a 1.2 million square foot 
complex in Pearl River --is FNTS's fourth major       U.S. facility. FNTS 
also operates development centers in Texas, California and North 
Carolina.         <p> FNTS Vice President of Engineering Carl DeWilde 
confirmed that the region's wealth of       engineering talent, and 
Rockland's in particular, helped draw Fujitsu to Rockland County. 
"We       look forward to drawing from this pool of prospective 
employees. The area's quality of life,       coupled with the 
significant employment opportunities Fujitsu offers, will help attract 
the       experienced people we need to strengthen our position as a 
leading developer of       telecommunications products and 
services."<p>          Rockland County Executive C. Scott Vanderhoef was 
elated when he learned of the decision,       "I am very proud that 
Rockland County has attracted Fujitsu on the basis of our quality of 
life.
We congratulate Rockland Economic Development Corporation (REDC), Orange 
and Rockland Utilities, Inc. and Empire State Development for working as a 
team in making this happen."  Engineers at the Northeast Development 
Center will work with their counterparts at Fujitsu's Texas, California 
and Japan facilities to develop Fujitsu's next-generation network 
management systems and synchronous optical network (SONET) transmission 
equipment, a standard for fiber-optic transport of voice, video and data 
signals. <p> Fujitsu transmission equipment enables telephone companies to 
construct digital fiber-optic networks that can simultaneously carry more 
than 32,000 data streams (such as telephone conversations), with the 
capacity for more than 129,000 by end of 1996. The Northeast development 
center will also coordinate with Fujitsu's switching development center 
in Raleigh to develop integrated transmission and switching technology for 
local and long distance telephone carriers. <p> Larry Brodsky, President and 
C0O of Orange and Rockland Utilities, Inc., said, "O&R pursued Fujitsu 
because they are a quality high-tech company.  We worked closely with REDC 
to attract Fujitsu since we share a common goal to expand the local 
economy. We are pleased that Fujitsu recognizes Rockland as a good place 
to do business and O&R as a reliable energy supplier."<p>  In addition to 
Fujitsu personnel, the site selection team included Maryann Small, 
REDC;Michael Crimi, O&R; Sean Mathews, Empire State Development 
Corporation; Jacquelyn Rowe,Cushman & Wakefield; and the Robert Martin 
Company.<p>   Jack Holt, REDC Chairman, said, "The location of Fujitsu's 
northeast headquarters in Rockland County is a testament to the diligence 
and hard work of REDC and Orange and Rockland Utilities, Inc. REDC is 
accomplishing its goals of attracting and retaining businesses inthe 
County."

<hr>
In addition to voter information, the League of Women Voters actively participates
in political activities, although always on a nonpartisan basis.  We don't support
candidates, but we lobby for passage of legislation on the local, state and national
levels.  First, we study the issues and determine our positions on the issues.
<p>
<h3> Join Our Study Groups</h3>
This year, we are looking into the ways in which New York State finances public
education (K-12) and how the funds are distributed; ways to protect the
watersheds which provide drinking water in New York State; and on the local level,
the quality of drinking water in Rockland County and transportation issues which
affect commuters in  our county.
<p>
<h3> Come To Our Candidates Nite</h3>
The Rockland LWV will hold a debate among candidates for the offices of District
Attorney and Sheriff on Wednesday, October 25, 1995 at 7:00 pm in the
Clarkstown Town Hall, 10 Maple Avenue, New City.
<p>
We welcome your interest and participation.  Call LWV phone 354-2411 for 
information.

<em><strong>We study and take action on many issues including:<br>
* Voter Advocacy Issues<br>
* The Environment<br>
* Ethics in Government<br>

Think About ... <em><strong>Who We Are</em></strong>
<p>
The League of Women voters is a grassroots organization of women and men, 
working and retired, professional and skilled,  homemakers and parents.  Our
mission is to  help every citizen have a voice in government ...a voice which is the
foundation and strength  of a democratic nation. The League is, first and  foremost,
an advocate for the voter.  We seek to  address the lack of voter participation in
the  election process.
<p> 
Founded in 1919, the League is nonpartisan and does not support or oppose
any candidate or political party. The League encourages citizens to play an
informed and active role in government At the local, state and national levels, the
League works to influence public policy through education and advocacy.
<p>
We are political, lawmakers at every level of government listen to the League. They
know that the League represents the citizens who vote and who care enough about
the issues to become informed.
<p>
Think About ...<em><strong>What We Do</em></strong>
<p> 
We take action on the environment, court reform, child care, women's rights, civil
liberties, housing, tax reform, ethics in government, international affairs, education,
welfare reform, pay equity and advocacy for the voter.  Our positions are based on
the informed opinions of our membership after thorough study.  We also direct our
volunteer  efforts toward encouraging our fellow citizens  to participate and vote,
and in giving them the information they need to vote wisely.
<P>
In our 74 year history we have demonstrated an expertise in educating voters,
studying and acting on important issues, training members for leadership roles, and
providing nonpartisan information on candidates.
<p>
Think About Yourself...<em><strong>And What You Can
Gain</em></strong>
<p>
Sharpen your skills in leadership, public relations, lobbying, public speaking,
writing...whatever challenge you choose.  The League offers skills enhancement
and professional growth opportunities.  Valuable contacts are made in league. 
Many members hold elective office and appointed government positions as a result
of their experience in the League. Members find their League accomplishments a
valuable addition to their resumes.
<p>
Think About...<em><strong>The Tough Decisions</em></strong>
<p>
When important League decisions must be made, your opinion counts.  Help
choose which issues the League will study and help decide what action the League
will take.
<p>
Think About...<em><strong>Becoming a Force for Change</em></strong>
<p>
Be among those who make things happen in your community.  As a league
member, you receive information putting you "one step ahead" in making the
important decisions you face as an American citizen.  We offer sound, reasonable
solutions to today's most challenging problems.
<p>
Think About..<em><strong.Joining the League</em></strong>
<p>
Your membership gives us the strength we need to affect public policy.  And, if
you don't have time right now to participate in League activities, you can still be a
part of our work.  By joining, you are increasing the League's impact on decisions
made by local and state governments and in Washington D.C.

I am happy to report that the Archives was awarded two grants for
microfilm
preservation of historical books and documents.  The New York
State Discretionary
Grant Program for Conservation and Preservation of Library
Research Materials
awarded us $21,047 for preserving tax rolls and naturalization
and marriage books
from 1857 through 1935.  The Archives was one of only 40
institutions to receive
funds for 1994/95.  The State Archives and Records Administration
Local
Government Records Management Improvement Fund awarded Rockland
County
$47,232 for preservation of vital and historical records from
1798 through 1993. 
Preservation of the collection, which covers records of five
County agencies, will 
protect books and papers essential to government operations and
research.

an Archives/Records Center for Rockland County.  Ourcurrent
system of storing
over26,000 boxes of records in over 38 County government
locations is inefficient
and wasteful.  Historical records from 1798 and vital records
needed to run County
operations are stored in basements, vaults, and garages that are
potential fire
hazards and lack security and the proper temperature and humidity
conditions.  The
County can realize major efficiencies by consolidating all
inactive records under one
roof.  This will be our big challenge for the foreseeable future.
<p>
Special thanks go to the following people who have generously
contributed their
time to archival or records projects: Harrison Pollets and Joseph
Brooks, who
diligently index and organize archival court records and maps as
part of the
Rockland Senior Volunteer Program.  Frank Smith Schnell, the
"Chronicler," who is
developing historical tidbits from the Proceedings of the
Rockland County Board of
Supervisors from 1798 through the twentieth century.  He has
completed Book 1
of these tidbits, which covers the minutes from 1798 to 1900. 
We'd like to
publish this book in the near future.  Roger Watkins has also
done an excellent job
entering data of the 1855 State Census for Haverstraw as part of
the Social
Service Public Work Program.
<p>
Finally, I would like to applaud the efforts of Lynn Nannariello,
whose research and
writing brings us this newsletter, and thank Tony Scaringi, Terry
Hall, and the staff
of the Hospital Reproduction Department for publishing and
printing this newsletter.

In 1800, when it was only a few years old, Rockland County had a
population of
6,353.  Of the County's four townships, Ramapo had the highest
population
1,981.  By 1870, Rockland had five townships and Orangetown had
become the
County's most populous township with 6,810 residents.  Orangetown
continued to
be the township  with the highest population for nearly a
century.  Ramapo took
the lead again in 1970 with a population of 76,702 and remained
Rockland's
largest township in 1980 and 1990.
<p>
<strong>Decade of decline. </strong> With the exception of the
period from
1910 to 1920, Rockland County's population has increased every
decade since
1800, when the first federal census was taken.  Between 1910 and
1920, County
population dropped from 46,873 to 45,548.  The town of Stony
Point experienced
the greatest loss,with a 12.1% decrease.
<p>
A flu epidemic was partially responsible for the County's
population decline.  In late
1918, the United States was hit with an epidemic of Spanish
influenza.  It first
appeared in Boston and by mid-October, according to The New York
Times, had
"reached epidemic proportions in practically every State in the
country..."
<p>
The Surgeon General, Dr. Blue, favored closing churches, schools,
theatres, and
public institutions to prevent spread of the disease in
communities where flu
existed, reported the Times.  Dr. Blue noted that "in some States
the State Board
of Health has this power, but in many others it is a matter of
municipal regulation."
Some parts of Rockland County appeared to heed the Surgeon
General's advice. 
According to the Oct. 19, 1918 issue of the Nyack Evening
Journal, Suffern had
closed all schools, churches, lodge rooms, movie theatres, and
public meeting
halls, and in Spring Valley the Board of Health ordered all
schools, Sunday schools,
and theatres closed until further notice.  At this point, said
the Joumal, the Boards
of Health of the Nyacks predicted that there were 800 flu cases
in the Nyacks.
<p>
By the end of October 1918, the epidemic began to wind down in
some parts of
the
country.  According to reports received by the Public Health
Service from 44
states, said the Times on Oct. 25, there were a reported total of
296,275 influenza
cases, 48,328 pneumonia cases, and 16,174 deaths.  Nearly a month
later, the
Nyack Evening Journal noted that flu cases in Nyack totaled 686,
"or fourteen and
seven-tenths of the estimated population."  According to Dr. C.D.
Kline, health
officer, this was a high percentage.  Dr. Kline said there were
nine deaths from
influenza and six deaths out of 60 cases of pneumonia.
<p>
In addition to the flu epidemic, Rockland's population declined
during this decade
because many young people moved out of the County.  They didn't
find farming
sufficiently rewarding for the amount of work it required and
local businesses and
industry didn't provide the jobs needed.
<p>
<strong> Greatest growth. </strong> Rockland County saw its
greatest period
of growth between 1950 and 1970 when the population jumped from
89,276 to
229,903.  From 1950 to 1960, County population rose from 89,276
to 136,803, a
53.2% increase.  During this decade, Clarkstown was the township
that saw the
greatest population growth--from 15,674 to 33,196, a 11 1.8%
increase.
<p>
The opening of the Tappan Zee Bridge and the New York State
Thruway from
Suffern to Yonkers during  the 1950s greatly contributed to this
population boom. 
The Dec. 15, 1955 issue of The Joumal-News noted  that these
openings brought
the County "within easy commuting range of metropolitan New
York,"
Assemblyman Robert Walmsley, who gave the principal address at
the local
opening ceremonies, noted that:
<p>
<em> In place of an infrequent ferry with limited facilities the
bridge assures us of
unrestricted passage to the other shore in a minimum of time.  We
will no longer be
ice-bound or storm-bound by the great river- we will no longer be
compelled to
travel miles to the north or to the south to reach the eastern
shore. </em>
<p>
From 1960 to 1970, Rockland's population increased 68.1%,
surpassed in the
neighboring counties only by Putnam County with a population gain
of 79%. 
During this time period, Orange County's population increased
only 20 .6%, while
population in Bergen County and Westchester County rose only 15%
and 10.5%,
respectively.  Much of Rockland's expansion during this decade
can be attributed
to people moving here from New York City, communities in
Westchester County,
and some counties in New Jersey.  Of Rockland's five towns,
Ramapo acquired the
most new residents--41,638--a 118.7% increase. 
<p>
From 1970 to 1980, Rockland County's population increased 12.9%.
From 1980
to 1990, however, County population rose only 2.3%, from 259,530
to 265,475. 
The Rockland County Planning staff predicts that from 1990 to
2000, County
population will rise from 265,745 to 273.000, a 2.8% increase,
and from 2000 to
2010, from 273,000 to 285,000, a 4.4% increase.
<p>
Here is a look at the population of Rockland County and its
townships over nearly
two centuries.

<h1>Revolutionary War Pensions</h1>
The United States Congress in 1818 and 1820 appropriated money to
pay pensions
to Revolutionary War veterans.  These ex-soldiers were required
to take an oath in 
open court (in this case, the Rockland Court of Common Pleas) as
to their year of
enlistment, unit of service, time served, and property owned,
both real and
personal.  They also had to swear that they hadn't reduced their
holdings to qualify
for the federal pension; evidently there was a means test.
<p>
An examination of 23 depositions from the Rockland County
Archives made by
veterans to qualify for a pension shows that four of the veterans
were 16 years old
or younger.  Among these were Michael Trout of Haverstraw, who
was 13 when
he
enlisted in the Second Regiment of Continentals as a fifer.
Thirteen veterans were
illiterate, and almost all of them were desperately poor.  Five
owned some real
property worth from $114 to $988.  Sixteen listed personal
property with values
estimated by the court ranging from $7.50 to $126.00. One
applicant claimed
that, other than the clothes on his back, he owned "two
earthenware jugs and one
pail." No value was put on this meager estate.
<p>
Although the depositions were generally sworn by the applicant
and certified by the
court clerk, Robert Allison of Haverstraw had his service
attested by none other
than the Secretary of War, John C. Calhoun.
<p>
<h1> Rockland County's Largest Library</h1><br>
When Finkelstein Memorial Library in the village of Spring Valley
first opened in
1917, it was located in a room next to a hat store on Main Street
and loaned out
48 books.  Today Rockland County's largest library occupies a
46,200 square foot
building on the corner of Chestnut Street and Route 59 and
circulates over
220,000 books.
<p>
<strong>Citizens start library. </strong> A small group of
citizens organized the
Spring Valley Free Library in April  1917 because ft believed the
community
urgently needed a library, Mrs. Sophie Scoft, a hat shop owner, 
served as the first
librarian at a salary of $7 a month.  When someone wanted to
borrow a book,
Scoft had to  leave her millinery customers to take care of her
library customers.  
The library was open from 3 to 6 and from  7 to 9 every day
except Tuesday.  By
March 191 8, the library had increased the number of its books
from 48
to 809.
<p>
The library changed location frequently, depending on
contributions and fundraisers
for its existence.  In 1921, the Board of Trustees asked for and
was granted a
$300 appropriation from the village.
<p>
<strong> Permanent home. </strong> The library found a permanent
home in
1941 when the Finkelstein family of Spring Valley erected and
furnished a building
on the corner of Madison Avenue and Central Avenue (now Route 59)
in memory
of Joseph Nathan Finkelstein.  Finkelstein, who lived in the
village for 25 years,
was very active in civic affairs and well known in the community
as a
philanthropist. 
<p>
A dedication ceremony was held on a Sunday afternoon in June
1941.  Guy P.
Rigaud, Superintendent of Schools, was chairman of the
ceremonies.  Among those
giving acceptance speeches were Pincus Margulies, Supervisor of
the Town of
Ramapo, and George Zeissner, Spring Valley's mayor.
<p>
The red brick, Williamsburg Colonial style building, occupying
1,000 square feet of
space, had a main reading section with a fireplace, a children's
section, and
librarian's quarters.  The basement contained a meeting room with
the capacity for
100 people and a kitchen.  In July 1945, the insttution's name
was officially
changed from Spring Valley Free Library to Finkelstein Memorial
Library.
<p>
<strong>Expansion.</strong>  As the population and its needs
grew, so did the
library.  In the spring of 1960, a children's wing funded by the
Finkelstein
Foundation was added to the north end of the original building. 
In 1969, the library
expanded by 13,000 square feet with an addition financed by a
bond issue.  
Ramapo voters approved a 29,000 square foot addition to the
library that was
completed in 1987.  This addition became the library's new main
wing.
<p>
<strong>More than a book lender.</strong> Finkelstein Memorial
Library has
come a long way since its humble  beginnings next to the hat
shop.  It has become
more than just a place for people to take out books, In addition 
to its 220,000
volumes, the library circulates 2,200 videos, 1,300 compact
disks, and 600
journals and  periodicals.  The library also makes available
records and
books-on-tape, as well as specialized resources  such as
corporate annual reports
and a referral file on local organizations.  There are two
computers for public  use.
<p>
Since at least the 1960s, the library has had a local history
secton.  When the new
wing was added  in 1987, a room was set aside for this purpose. 
The room
contains books published about Rockland County's  history, as
well as a clipping
file from local newspapers.
<p>
The library also offers programs of interest to the community,
such as film
festivals, art exhibits, and  lectures on topics ranging from
astrology to how to
conduct a job search to local history.

<center><h2><a name="summer"> TURNPIKE TALES </h2><h3></a>        
                  By LYNNN 
NANNARILLO</h3>
</center>
Route 59 is a major Rockland County road that runs from Nyack to
Suffern 
and is flanked by     numerous businesses, including a major
shopping 
mall. It's a frequently congested road, making it     an on-going

source of irritation to Rockland County residents. On an average
day, 
28,500 vehicles     cross the intersection of Route 59 and
Middletown 
Road, 24,400 traverse the intersection of 59 and     Route 304,
and 
23,900 vehicles pass through the 59 and New York State Thruway 
intersection in     Spring Valley. Traffic volume on Route 59 has

increased so much that part of the road is being     expanded
from 
four to six lanes. Rut the busy road we know today wasn't always
so. 
Its forerunner     was a road called the Nyack Turnpike that can
be 
traced throughout about half of today's Route 59.     The
turnpike 
was orginally designed as a through road to link the eastern and 
western parts of the     County and was traveled over by horse,
mule 
and ox drawn wagons and carriages.     Those traveling 
the turnpike were required to pay a toll. And although these 
nineteenth century     travelers didn't have to contend with
today's 
traffic, there were those who thought it an inconvenience     to 
have to stop their horses to pay a toll.<p>

Broadway in 
present day Central Nyack. John V.Baker and his Cherokee Indian
wife collected 
the tolls. The toll ratio sign is to the left of the door</i>
<p>
<b>More direct route needed.</b> 
The decision to build the Nyack Turnpike 
sprang from a need to find a more practical way to transport
manufactured 
goods from Ramapo in the western part of Rockland County to the
Hudson 
River on its east side.<p>
  By 1800, a manufacturing center had begun to 
develop in the Ramapo Mountain pass because of the area's water
power 
and hardwood supplies. Within 15 years the area's output had
grown 
considerably. Among the businessmen with plants located there,
were J.G. 
Pierson, a nail manufacturer, and Jacob Stoat, a producer of
cotton 
cloth.  <p>
In order to sell their goods, these manufacturers needed to 
transport their products across the County to the Hudson River
for 
shipment. This meant Carrying their wares in carts pulled by
horses or 
oxen, which were scarce, over poorly developed roads that were at
the 
mercy of changing weather conditions. Some large companies had to
send 
their products to Haverstraw's port by a road running near the
present 
location on Route 202. To increase their profits and to compete
with 
companies in less isolated areas, the Ramapo manufacturers needed

a well-constructed road that would more directly take them to the

river.  <p>
Such an undertaking would need to be carried out primarily by 
private individuals. According to Carl A. Nordstrom in his book
<i>
Of Shoes and Ships, and Sealing Wax...,</i>although local
government was 
primarily responsible for maintaining existing roads,  its
members "were 
not inclined towards making large expenditures of tax moneys for 
the benefit of alien manufacturers." He adds that"These local 
governments resisted the impulse to spend funds to provide for 
the construction of roads and bridges suiting the special needs
of 
Ramapo manufacturers." <p>
<b>Nyack vs 
Haverstraw.</b> Although the roads from Ramapo to Haverstraw
provided the 
shortest route for the manufacturers to transport their goods to
the 
river at this time, they did not provide the most direct means of

doing so. In addition, these roads were poor and the river 
conditions were unpredictable.  <p>J.G. Pierson, the nail
manufacturer, 
thought that finding an easier and more predictable route to the
river 
made beter business sense. At the same time, members of the Nyack

Community were coming to the realization that their town 
could benefit by becoming a shipment port for Rockland County.
Pierson 
and the community joined forces and came to the conclusion that
the 
answer lay in enacting legislation that would create a turnpike
road 
that would run from the Orange Turnpike in Suffern to the river
in 
Nyack.<p>
  A petition dated Dec, 21,1813 and signed by 46 people, 
including the Smiths of Nyack and the Piersons of Ramapo, was 
submitted to the New York State legislature for a charter to
build 
the turnpike road. 
<p>
 Haverstraw residents protested the building of such 
a road knowing that Nyack's gain would be their loss. As a
result, a 
rivalry developed between the towns. <p>
 According to Frank Bertangue 
Green in <i>The History or Rockland County</i>, this war between
the towns 
greatly influenced County politics. Ploys used by one or both
sides 
included influencing commissioners, making court appeals, and 
the election Of Assembly members.  <p>
Proponents of the Nyack landing 
pointed out the advantages of building the new road. Nyack was
closer 
to New York City than Haverstraw, The depth of the water at the
Nyack 
landing was greater than that at Haverstraw and boats could leave

without being subject to the stages of the tides or the icing 
experienced in Haverstraw.<p>

<p>
<b>Legislation passes</b> Although the proposed legislation was
defeated 
during 
the tenure of General Peter S. Van Orden, who was the Assemblyman
from 
Rockland County from 1809 to 1816, it was passed on April 17,1816
during 
the first term of his successor, Cornelius A. Blauvelt.
<p>
 According to the 
law, the turnpike road would  
<ul>
 begin at the cross road near Nyack   
landing in Orange town, in the   County of Rockland, between the  
houses 
of Teunis Smith and Peter   Smith; running thence westerly  
along the 
old road, until in front of   said Peter Smith's dwelling house,  
 and 
from thence the most direct    and convenient route to the orange 
 
turnpike road, and to pass in front of    the dwelling house of
John 
Suffern,    in the town of Hempstead..
</ul>

The law also provided that 
commissioners Jeremiah H. Pierson, John E. Meyres, and Teunis
Smith could 
receive subscriptions for 700 shares of stock at $25 a share. 
<p>
<b>Bumpy road.</b> 
The road to building the Nyack Turnpike did not however, run
smooth. For 
six years, the road's opponents fought the legislation, stalling
its 
commencement. On April 23, 1823, legislation was passed
appointing Andrew 
Suffern, William Yowry,and Teunis Smith as commissioners. Under
the law, 
the commissioners were to begin laying out the road by June 1. On

Feb.28, 1824, this law was amended in response to "inhabitants,
living on 
and near the said highway" who were "dissatisfied with the laying
out of" 
the road to allow the commissioners to make any alterations they
deemed 
necessary. Under the 1824 law,Roger Parmely and George Kyles were

also appointed commissioners.
<p>
During the next two years some surveying of the road was done. In
1824 and 
1826, the section or the road running through the Nyack swamp was
filled 
in. By 1825, some sections of the road in Ramapo were already in
use. 
Legislation passed on April 17, 1826 required the commissioners
to resurvey 
and alter the road and correct any errors that may have been made
in the 
previous survey. In that same year, lands along the turnpike
route in 
Clarkstown and Ramapo were condemned and paid for by the
supervisors. But 
the $1,100 total cost of the lands taken was charged to the two
townships.
<p>

<b>Law brings resolution.</b> The question of whether or not to
build the 
Nyack Turnpike was resolved with passage of "An act to improve
the State 
Road from Orange Turnpike to Nyack in the County of Rockland" on
April 20, 
1830. <p>
 Under the law, Jeremiah H. Pierson, Edward Suffern, Lucas Acker,

Isaac Lydecker, John Green, Teunis Smith, and Peter Smith were
appointed 
trustees responsible for supervising the construction, repair,
and 
improvement of the Nyack Turnpike. They were also to appoint toll
gatherers 
and a clerk and determine where to place the road's one full
toll-gate or 
two half toll-gates  
<p>
Trustees were required to take an oath of office and 
to execute a bond with two or more securities, both of which were
to be 
filed with the County clerk's office. The County board of
supervisors 
would determine compensation for their services, which would be
paid out 
of the tolls collected.
<p>
The trustees were 
allowed to improve or alter the road as they saw fit. These
changes had to 
be recorded in the trustees' book, kept by their clerk. The clerk
had to 
notify, in writing, anyone through whose lands these alteration
swould be 
made. No change,  however, could be made that would go through a
garden, 
orchard, or building.<p>
 The law also specified that   
<ul>It shall be the 
duty of 
the..,   trustees, previous to the erection of any gate, so to 
construct,   repair and improve the.. road,   that all standing
timber 
shall be   cut down to the width of the said   road, twenty feet
of 
which,   exclusive of the ditches to be   made on each side
thereo, 
shall   be cleared of all stumps, roots,   stones or any other 
obstruction   whatever, when practicable;   end soil of said road
shall 
be   well compacted together, and   faced with gravel: of a depth
not   
less than six inches, where   required, so as to secure a firm  
and even 
surface, rising in the   middle by a gradual arch.
</ul>
Toll money was to be 
used to maintain the road and to pay annual interest on any money
borrowed 
or compensation for labor performed on the road. Any money left
over was to 
be used to pay the principal of the money borrowed and labor
performed.

</i>
<p>

If a judge of the court of common pleas was notified in writing
that the 
road needed repair and agreed that the road needed to be fixed,
the judge 
would send a written notice to the toll keeper of the gate
closest to 
the repair site. The judge would also order that the gate be
opened and 
that no tolls be collected until the toll keeper received a
certificate 
from two judges stating that the road had been sufficiently
repaired. 
<p>
 For 
those living near the road, the trustees could commute toll
payments for 
a one-year period, renewable annually. (Legislation passed on
April 12, 
1855, however, allowed trustees to collect tolls from individuals
living 
within one mile of the gates.)  <p>
There was a $25 fine for breaking down the 
toll gates, spoiling any part of the toll road or passing through
the 
gates without paying the toll. There was a fine of up to $10 for
bypassing 
the tollgate to avoid paying the toll. The trustees were to use
the fines 
to improve and repair the road. Toll collectors who unreasonably
delayed 
travelers or tried to collect tolls higher than those stipulated
by the law 
were liable for a $5 penalty that the detained traveler could
recover in 
court. 
<p>
 The trustees were to keep an account of all the tolls collected 
and of all money spent and labor performed. Each year a copy of 
this account was to be sent to the state controller and the clerk
of the 
County board ofsupervisors. (Findings from some of these reports
are 
reproduced on page 8.) 
<p>
 Toll gatherers were required to take an oath of 
office and file it with the clerk of trustees. Trustees could
build or 
rent houses for toll collectors.   
<p>

<b>Road Improvements.</b> Completion of 
the turnpike shortened the time it took to 
travel cross County. Before the road was 
built,people traveling from Nyack to Suffern had to either go
south 
through Orangeburg and Pearl River or north through Valley
Cottage 
and Bardonia. (Both of these routes ran along the present road
alignment 
between Nyack and Route 303 that follows the course of a
prehistoric Indian 
path.) The turnpike also made travel easier. Before it was built,

horsesand riders had to contend with roads covered with roots and
rock. 
Travelers were also at the mercy of the seasons and the weather. 
Springtime, notes Green in <i>The History of Rockland County</i>,
could find 
horse 
and rider wading through the mud.  
<p>
The opening of the road also played 
amajor part in Nyack's growth. The swamp that had once cut Nyack
off from 
the rest of the County was no longer an obstacle. Easier access
to the 
village brought more business and more inhabitants. A 1796 
Orangetown assessment roll listed less than a dozen taxable Nyack

residents. By 1830 Nyack's population had grown to about 300, and
by 1880 
it had reached at least 4,000. 
<p>
 A swamp known as the Bears Nest, located 
west of Spring Valley, was another obstacle that was overcome.
When 
several prominent citizens measured the swamp's depth, they found
it to be 
a "bottomless morass, containing...fnghtful quicksands." As a
result, the 
builders laid out the turnpike south of this spot. (A decade
later, 
however,the Erie Railroad was run through the Bear's Nest. And in
1871, 
the Alturas Road Company built a road through the swamp from
Monsey.) Part 
of the southern detour still exists today and is known as the Old

Nyack Turnpike.  
<p>
<b>Charter renewal. </b>On June 18,1853, the turnpike charter was

renewed for 21 years. On April 12,1873 the charter was renewed
for
another ten years. Under the 1873 legislation the road's trustees
were to 
be appointed for a one-year term of service. At the end of each
term their 
successors were to be appointedby the County judge with the
Orangetown 
and Clarkstown supervisors. In 1883, the charter was renewed for
another 
decade. 
<p><center>
<img src=income.jpg></center>
The prospect of the charter's expiration in 1894 created a debate

on whether or not it should be renewed for another ten years. Two
petitions 
were circulated. One was for the charter renewal. The other was
against the 
renewal and for making the turnpike a state road.<p>

According to an article in the Jan. 14,1893 Rockland County
Journal, the 
turnpike's annual maintenance cost ranged from $1,000 to $2,000
and was 
covered by the tolls collected. If the charter wasn't renewed or
the road 
wasn't adopted as a state highway, Clarkstown would become
responsible 
for maintaining the turnpike. In such an event, said the Journal,
some 
people feared the road would be neglected. The article noted
however that 
it wasn't the money they had to pay that bothered most of the
toll's 
objectors so much as the annoyance of having to stop their
horses. <p>

 In an 
article in the Journal about a week later, a gentleman responded
to this 
objection by saying, " 'People talk now about the inconvenience
of stopping 
at the toll gate as they go along. Well, the inconveniencs
ofdriving 
through mud up to the hub wheels will be much greater if the toll
gate is 
removed.'"<p>

The turnpike did become a toll-free 
road in 1893. In 1894 the board of Supervisors
made it part of the County road system. And according to George
H. Rudke in 
Historical Miscellanies Vol. II, the road was much improved under
County 
management, On July 14, 1911, the road became a state highway 
The opening of the Nyack Turnpike is commemorated at its first
milestone 
from Nyack by a monument in which 
the orignal red sandstone milestone is embedded, A tablet on the
monument, 
which was erected by the Rockland County Society, states that "At
this 
place, the modern throughfare follows the course on an Indian
path of 
prehistoric days."<p>

Scheibner</h2></center>                   
Thanks to the efforts of County Clerk Edward Gorman, $1.9 million
was 
approved forthe building of a Records Center and Archive. 
The building will be used to store over 30,000 cubic feet 
of Rockland County books and records while housing over 
4.000 cubic feet of historical records going back to 1798. 
After an extensive selection process,  Facilities 
Managemcnt chose Jan Degenshein, a highly qualified architect, to

develop  plans for the building, which should be 
completed in late 1997.                <p>   
I'm also happy to report that 
the Archives was awarded two State grants for microfilm           
     
preservation of histoncal and vital books and records. The State
Library 
awarded                 $24,834 for completing Tax and Assessment
rolls 
from the 1920s to 1940 and another                 $63,282 for a

<hr>
<B>General Meeting to Focus on Choices for National Program 
Planning</B><br>
At our very important general meeting on Saturday morning, February 24 
(see details above), we will be discussing what program or programs we 
want the National League to focus on for the next two years.
National Leagues Board of Directors has taken the unprecedented step of 
proposing that the "Initiative to Renew Democracy" be the sole focus 
for the 1996-1998 biennial. Details of the LWVUS proposal appear on 
page 2.<p>
Our local League has the choice of supporting this proposal, or 
proposing  alternative programs. If we support an alternative, we would 
have to state what problem needs to be addressed, the unique role that 
League can apply in resolving the problem, and a description of some of 
the specific actions League can take to address the problem.
For example, the 1994-1996 National Program covered four areas: 
Government, International Relations, Natural Resources, and Social 
Policy. Under Social Policy the goal was to promote social and economic 
justice, secure equal rights for all, achieve universal health care 
coverage at reasonable cost, promote the well being of children, and 
combat discrimination, 
poverty, and violence. The four 1994-1996 Issues for Emphasis were 
health care, early intervention for children at risk, crisis in the 
community, and opening government to citizens.<p>
In preparation for the planning meeting, members of your League have 
been interviewing local leaders about the countys needs and what they 
think would connect citizens with their communities and the political 
process. <p>
<i>Come to the February 24 meeting and take part in planning Leagues role 
for the next two years.</i><p>
<hr>
<B>REBUILDING CITIZEN CONFIDENCE IN GOVERNMENT:<BR>
A CHALLENGE UNIQUE TO THE LEAGUE OF WOMEN VOTERS<BR>
</b>
"What is the greatest chalenge now facing our nation and our community? 
What role will the League play in addressing this challenge?"<p>
These are aoming the questions that we will be discussing at our 
upcoming program planning meeting as we decide what we think should be 
the focus for the League nationwide during the 1996-98 biennium.<p>
Lending urgency to our discussion is the growing evidence that our 
democratic system is in crisis. Frustration with government is 
mounting, and many citizens seem to have lost sight of their role in 
the governing process. Excessive partisanship dominates public policy, 
debate, and extremist rhetoric endangers our search for the common 
good--no matter which party is in power.<p>
<b>A Proposal for Our Consideration</b><br>
In response to this challenge, the LWVUS board is taking the 
unprecedented step of proposing that an Initiative to Renew Democracy 
be the sole focus for the League's national program for the next two 
years.<p>
The board believes that the League is uniquely qualified and trusted 
to help rebuild our political and civic infrastructure. And only by 
restoring citizens' faith in government can we make real progress on 
issues addressed by League positions on the environment, social policy 
and international relations.<p>
The Initiative to Renew Democracy would include both legislative work 
aimed at restoring confidence in the political process and educational 
projects designed to engage more citizens in civic life.  Possible 
activities might be:<br>

<ul>
<li>Advocacy campaigns for legislation to strengthen democracy and the 
voice of citizens in chaping public policy, such as campaign finance 
reform.
<li>Public jornalism projects that would link Leagues with media 
partners interested in providing citizen-oriented news coverage to 
stimulate increased civic participation
</ul>
<b>What Will Be Our Recommendation?</b><br>
The LWVUS board is looking for input.<p>
<ul>
<li>What do we think our community and our country need from the League 
right now?
<li>Do we believe that a campaign to renew democracy is the best way 
for the League to pursue its mission in the coming two years?
<li>If we agree that such a campaign should be the League's nationwide 
focus, what kinds of activities do we think would be most effective at 
strengthening democracy in our community and in the nation.
</ul>
We hope you join us for this important discussion. Your ideas are 
needed!<p>

<b>LWVRC and Journal-News To Push Citizen Participation in 
Government</b><br>
The <i>Rockland Journal-News</I> has invited LWVRC to join in a year-long 
program that aims to increase citizen participation in local 
government. By encouraging people to use the power of their votes, to 
run for local office, and to serve on community boards and committees, 
we hope to increase awareness and interest in revitalizing government 
at different levels. Progress reports will appear in future issues of 
the Newsletter.<p>
On another front, the LWVNYS is inviting high school juniors and 
seniors to attend the 8th Annual Student Legislative Conference in 
Albany March 25-26. LWVRC is sending applications for this event to 
public and private high schools throughout the county to encourage 
local student participation. 	Many of these students may turn out to 
be future legislators.<br> 
<i>Marilyn Cohen- President </i><p>

<b>Vanderhoef Views the State of the County</b><br>
 Four LWVRC members saw 
Rockland County Executive C. Scott Vanderhoef present his view of the 
Countys future in his State of the County address to the County 
Legislature on Tuesday, February 6.<p>
Vanderhoef noted that the county faces serious challenges in the 
future. While he supports efforts "on all levels of government to 
reduce expenses and cut taxes, those changes must be planned and 
executed with care and compassion," he said. <p>

<i>Consolidation and Taxes</i><br>
Stating that he had charged his commissioners and department heads to 
find ways to consolidate services, agencies, and departments across the 
board, Vanderhoef proposed two major consolidations: (1) a 
consolidation of the fiscal and operational functions of the 
Departments of Health, Mental Health, and Social Services into a new 
Department of Health and Human Services, and (2) a Department of 
Citizen Services that would serve county citizens or external customers 
in such areas as consumer protection, parks, human rights, veterans 
affairs, and traffic safety, among others.<p>
Vanderhoef  has also asked all commissioners to reduce spending during 
the 1996 fiscal year by 2% and to "enhance revenues" by picking up an 
additional $1 million in new revenue from "nonlocal share sources." He 
would like to eliminate the current sales tax revenue sharing program, 
which splits county sales tax receipts with towns and villages.<p>

<i>Plans for the Future</i><br>
Vanderhoef announced that Rockland County has been designated by the 
U.S. Census Bureau as one of four counties in the nation selected for 
special midterm measurement in 1996 for its American Community Survey. 
The statistics gathered through this survey could, Vanderhoef 
explained, be used to help prepare a Comprehensive Land Use Master Plan 
for Rockland. He has asked Commisioner of Planning James Yarmus to 
present such a plan by 1998. The Commissioner will also begin working 
on a Transportation Action Plan.<p>
Vanderhoef also outlined plans for the development of a facilities 
master plan, a management information services (MIS) technology 
upgrade, a new courthouse, and relocation of the county clerks office 
and the highway department. He also urged "swift Legislative approval 
of a dormitory-style modular addition to the county jail."
In addition, Vanderhoef called for a year-long series of 
intergovernmental studies and public discussions with leaders at all 
levels of local government to explore "where we can creatively partner 
to provide more efficient services and reduce costs." Among the 
projects high on his agenda are a District Court System to replace the 
existing 21 Justice Courts on the village and town level, cooperative 
service arrangements among county school districts, intermunicipal 
agreements with the towns for maintenance and plowing of all roads, 
simplication of permit procedures, consolidation of the countys five 
sewer districts, and establishment of the office of County Assessor.<p>
Among government reforms Vanderhoef advocates are revision and updating 
of the County Charter and the Administrative Code and the setting of 
term limits for the County Executive and County Legislators.He believes 
it is time for reapportionment and campaign finance reform. He also 
supports affordable housing, crime prevention programs, and 
improvements in the Transport of Rockland bus system. In addition to 
continuing his Total Quality plan, he would like to begin implementing 
a pay equity plan for county employees by 1997.<br>

The average family uses 5% of their water for personal hygiene. When 
using the sink, conserve water by not letting the faucet run while 
brushing your teeth or shaving.<br>

<hr width=100>
<b>Water Study Group Responds to State Questions</b>
The Water Study Group has been busy compiling answers to questionnaires 
sent to us by the State League, which is gathering material to 
formulate consensus questions on the need for watershed protection and 
measures to attain it.<p>
To get answers to the extensive questionnaires, we conducted personal 
interviews with Thomas Micelli, Director of Environmental Public Health 
of the Rockland County Health Department, and with Rich Henning, Public 
Relations Officer of United Water Company. Both men were most 
cooperative and generous with their time and they answered our 
questions in great detail.<p> 
Jodi Raque, environmental engineer for Avon Products, also invested a 
great deal of her time and effort filling in the questionnaire for 
local businesses. And Pat Ferracane, Water Program Specialist of the 
State Department of Environmental Conservation sent us reams of 
information on state pollutant discharge elimination permits.<p>
This gathering of facts about drinking water in the county has been a 
remarkable learning experience. We hope our enthusiasm for achieving 
and maintaining pure water for future generations will spill over to 
you like the proverbial clean water that must spill endlessly from our 
taps.<br>

<center><b>CALL FOR "STUFF"</b>

</center>
On Sunday, May 5, 1996, the LWVRC will participate in the 2nd Annual 
"Stuff  Day" in Suffern. The League will have a sales space in the 
municipal parking lot opposite the Post Office. This is an effort to 
recycle things you would like to get rid of  that others might want and 
to earn some funds for our League. 
Please make every effort to search out the "stuff" you no longer use or 
need.<br>

   NOTES FROM THE ARCHIVIST<br>
August, 1989
It gives me great pleasure to present "It's About Time", an
Archival newsletter on the history of Rockland County; its
people, culture and government through the ages.  In addition to
documenting Rockland's rich historical tradition prior to 1798,
when Rockland be- came a county, we plan on giving you histories
of government programs such as the evolution of Alms House,
Social Services, and other such histories including, but not
limited to, Public Health Services, County roads and highways,
and Law enforcement.
<p>
Our first issue includes a most informative article written by
Barbara A. Conklin who did an excellent job researching the
history and events leading up to Rockland's split from Orange
County in 1798.  Lauren Filor has completed an interview with the
late Dr. Robert L. Yeager which has been published by our office.

She writes her observations related to that memorable experience.
<p>
Along with historical pieces we will include selected
articles on Achives and Records Management.  We will
also bring to your attention individuals and groups that
have contributed to county government.
<p>

We hope that you enjoy this issue and we look forward
to presenting other issues through the course of the year.
<p>
PETER J. SCHEIBNER, COUNTY ARCHIVIST
<p>
FROM ORANGE TO ROCKLAND<p>

Orange County was formed in 1683.  It consisted of a few
Dutch families who settled along the Hudson River
shore.  Later the area west of the Ramapo Mountains
began to attract pioneers.  These people along with the
people living on the southern side of the mountains were
Orange County residents.  However, the mountains were
a barrier between them.  They were considered almost
impassable.
<p>


There was so much difficulty in communication between
the two parts of the county that it tended to separate
them.  The difficulty in communication led to the holding
of County Courts at Tappan and Goshen.
Courthouses and jails were erected in both places.  The
Board of Supervisors met for many years in the southern
part of the county.  Eventually the meetings alternated
between New City and Goshen.  In 1699, Orange was
granted its own member of Provincial Assembly, Abraham Gouveneur.

A census taken in 1702 listed families
who were land owners and included the number of
children in the family and ho,, many slaves.  There were
54 men, 40 married women, 57 boys, 85 girls or unmarried women
and 33 slaves.
<p>


John DeNoyelles, a young Frenchman retired from British Army
Service, settled in Haverstraw in about 1759.
At age 25 he as engaged in business as a general store
keeper.  He became an extensive land owner in Orange
County South of the Mountains.
<p>
Mr. DeNoyelles was elected to represent Orange County
in the General assembly of the Province of New York.
He took his seat April 4, 1769, and was active until his
death.
<p>
 In 1772 John DeNoyelles introduced legislation which
 would h"e permitted the election of assemblymen independently
from each side of the mountain.  This was
 unsuccessful.  John DeNoyelles was the fore under of
 efforts in 1774 to divide Orange County.  He gave a
 speech on February 22, 1774 before the council, debating that
the county should be divided into two counties. When  Mr.
DeNoyelles finished speaking, rebuttals were  made, (see Debates
on Dividing Orange County, 2-22-1774 this issue).  The county had
ot been divided.  Mr. DeNoyelles died in 1775, before his mission
had been  accomplished.
<p>
The Revolutionary War began and it took precedent o,e,
a county separation, so the subject was set aside.  After
the War.  New York's increasing population and the
changes in its distribution forced government to create
17 new counties.  This made it easier to form that d'@strict
which had always been -known as "Orange County South
of the Mountains" into one of the new counties. It did
not receive opposition because there were other changes
going on in many areas.
<p>
The act dividing the County of Orange - creating Rock-
land was passed February 23, 1798.  This separation
carne 24 years after the death of John DeNoyelles, who
was actively trying to achieve this separation.  Also in
1798, the county seat was moved from Tappan to New
City.
<p>
Its new name " Rockland " is said to have come from
the magnificent escarpment of trap rock which borders
the shore of the Hudson River.
<p>
Rockland County soon began to achieve some unity.  Its
nearly 5,000 'inhabitants were able to act in their com-
mon interests which were different from those who were
North of the Mountains.  Upon separation from Orange,
Rockland had four, townships; Orangutan, Clarkstown, Hempstead
and Haverstraw.
<p>
John Suffern was Rockland's first County Judge.  He was
in office from 1798 to 1806.  During the first ten years of
Rockland county's existence, court business was very
light.
<p>
The first meeting of the Board of Supervisors of Rock-
land County was held on May 29,1798.  The Supervisors
were,
James Pery of Oangetown, Claus R. Van Houten of
Clarkstown, James Onderdonk of Hempstead and Peter
DeNoyelles of Haverstraw.
<p>
Procedings: ( Of First Board of Sup.  Meeting )
<p>
There was a canvas of votes: "Benjamin Coe, Hath the
Greatest number of votes to represent the county in the
assembly  ......
<p>
It was decided that James Perry & Claus Van Houten
would be the supervisors of Rockland County to meet the
supervisors of Orange County, etc.
Simon Van Antour was appointed County Treasurer.
David Rye was appointed, "Clerk of the Board of
Supervisors during the pleasure of said Board."
And so Rockland County had its start.
<p>

<p>

      DEBATES
on dividing ORANGE COUNTY
<p>


Mr. Brush being in the Chair, the House, according to the
Order of the day, proceeded to the consideration of the
Bill, for dividing Orange County, whereupon John
DeNoyelles, Esq., delivered himself as follows:
<p>


"Mr.  Corrnan, If any weight is to be given to the
number or of petitioners, I beg that they may be added,
      d then I shall say a few words to the Committee.
 Gentlemen, -this Bill is not a new matter, but it has been
 a great while in agitation. It Was five years ago, ever
 since I had the honor to he a member of this Cure.  I
 mo,ed for this bill because I thought it would be for the
 advantage of my constituents, and - indeed for the
 County in general.  When I first mo-,ed for this bill, there
 was a petition for a copy of that bill - and it was granted
 them, Now for the use that has been made of that bill to
 get people to sign petitions against it.  I am sure it was a
 mistake in that bill - because I know it was my opinion,
 and I believe the sentiments of this House, that a West
 line would split the mountains; for I am sure that bill was
 to split the mountains, - and we thought it would split the
 mountains. - But there was a mistake, for now a South
 West line will do better in the people believe that this line
 would cut off a great many poor, and some older folks.
 I come here as the representative of that County, for the
 good of the public.  For my part I have no business to ran
 about with petitions to get people to sign about a thing
 that is for the public - if it was a private matter, then
 indeed it would be another thing.  But, however - I can
 assure this House, or this committee, upon my Honor,
 that the people of the county do deserve to have it
 divided.  For in that county the representatives have bee.
 sent one on the North side, and one on the South side of
 the mountains, by prescription in a manner, if a Body
 may be allowed to speak by comparison - For indeed, I
 don't know whether Prescription will apply to this
 Country; not yet however, - but then it has been the
 constant usage. for the South side was settled first, and
 was a County long before the North side was any County
 at all - Indeed the County was there, but then it's all the
 same thing, there was no people in it.
<p>


Well then.  Whenever there come inhabitants on the
North side of the mountains, the people of the South side
divided the representation with them.  For you they
would put in boat members, yet they would not do any
such thing - for they were more generous than that: For
they said.  You choose one member for yourselves, for
we don't know your wants nor necessities.  Well then,
this has been the system all along, until the election
before the last.  But when the North side find out they
have the majority, then they take the ungenerous advantage to
send both members.  The South side then perceive
this advantages and it is high time they thought to put
some remedy to this inconvenience.  Well then, I was
desired by them -, and I mo,ed for a bill, that each side
of the mountains should choose his own member.  Then
the very people that is now against this bill the say-
why don't you divide your county?-This House was
then of opinion that this measure was unconstitutional,
and there was nothing like it in England.  For my part I
perceive the weight of this objections And They tell me
- why don't you divided your County?  When I went
home, I consulted my constituents.
<p>


 They then desired me to di,,ide the County.  But I put
 them off from time to time, until there was a favorable
 opportunity.  The last sessions when I mo,ed for this bill
 Mr. Gale promised me on his Word of Honor that he
 would go home and consult his people about this matter.
 And so was I too.  Well,- I went home accordingly, and
 I can declare all the people I saw, ( I saw a great many,
 but not eery body, because I did not go about for that),
 indeed I had but three days to go up there and come back
 again- But all I did see they was all for dividing the
 County.  When I came back, - Mr. Gale, I don't know
 what was his reason, he never said anything about it.
 Well then.  Now this sessions I move for the bill - for
 last sessions I should ha,,e mo,ed for another bill, if it
 had not been for this.  For there is other Inconveniences
 in the County besides this.  For we can't get a Bail-Piece,
 nor a Mortgage recorded,without riding forty or some-
 time fifty miles, according as the distance is; and
 sometimes we come quite down to this City, for our
 Clerk is very often in this City, and these things is a great
 inconvenience.  And I should ha,,e brought in a bill to
 remedy this inconvenience, only I thought it would be
 best to do both at once. - And so I ,as deprived of this
 bill at that time.  And now it is still the sentiments of them
 people that the County should be divided.  Thee ,as a
 great deal of art used to get them petitioners to sign the
 petitions.  And there is se,e,al of them that has signed
 against dividing the County, that as signed for it too.  I
 had not any time to examine all them petitions.  Indeed
 it could not be done without they was alphabetically
 detested.  And this I had not time to do.  And I applied
 to Mr. Bancker, and he was unfortunately employed in
<p>
    other affairs; but here is one I ha,,e compared, and there
    is three, six, nine, twelve, fifteen eighteen of them who
    has assigned against the bill, has signed for it too.  As I
    ha,,e some character and am in some public character.  I
    thought it was best not that this House should be satisfied
    this was the sentiments of the people.  So I ha-,e written
    a letter to the Chief Judge of the county about this matter.
    And to the Justice.  Indeed to all the Justices.  But one of
    them is not there.  He is gone to Albany, so they can be
    e,,arnined.  As to them petitions they say the bill is
    destructive, and the bill is destructive, but they give no
    reason why the bill is destructive; therefore, as the
    committee has heard them, and last time I gave my
    reasons for the bill, so I shall not say any more about it,
    unless some new matter should be offered."
<p>


 "This is effort of genuine attic eloquence, being performed with
that great vehemence, energy, and propriety
 of voice and action, peculiar to himself, and for which he
 hath obtained so much reputation and regard, from those
 who have judgment and spirit to perce'@,e and espouse
 the true interest of the colony; Mr. Gale (at the instigation of
the city members, as is supposed) mo,,ed for the
 rejection of the bill.  Mr. Clinton then seconded his
 motion, and made use of several weak and malicious
 arguments against it.  The purport of them was; That
 since the far greater part of the County petitioned against
 the division, their voice ought to be attended to.  That the
 inconveniences the County labors under, (if any there
 be), may be remedied without the interposition of the
 Legislature.  That to di-,ide a district already to small and
 inconsiderable, is improper; and there by to double their
 representation who now pay the smallest portion of
 ta.es, is absurd.  That to leave such mountains between
 two counties, will much impede their cultivation, reduce
 the Highway through them, to its ancient state, when in
 fact it was impassable, and encourage the lawless and
 profligate, to resort thither."

<p>

And that from the -various connections and dependencies
of the perspective inhabitants, to the northward and south-
ward of the mountains, it would generally happen, that
no impartial jury could be obtained in either of the new
counties, for the trial of any cause whatever.

<p>

Mr. Thomas made use of his old argument, the question!
The question!  And on a division, the majority, to their
immortal Honour, had spirit enough to vote for the bill,
not withstanding it hath been asserted, that undue influence was
used with them.
<p>


I have had the honor of meeting with Mr. Dan
DeNoyelles of Garnerville.  It was his courtesy that
allowed me to photograph the original of this document.
(John DeNoyelles is his ancestor.) It is not written here
in it's original form, I have tried to make it more easily
readable by spelling most words correctly etc.
<p>


A CONVERSATION
       WITH ....

<p>
 I had the pleasure of conducting an oral history interview
 with the late Dr. Robert L. Yeager on July 14,1988.  Dr.
 Yeager, a pioneer in health care for the chronically ill,
 was a most interesting candidate for an oral history.  He
 spoke briefly of his life prior to contracting tuberculosis;
 of his schooling and of his dreams of becoming a doctor.
 When it was discovered that Dr. Yeager did have tuberculoses; he
was sent to Trudeau Sanatorium in Saranac
 Lake, New York.  It was here that Dr. Yeager gained
 great knowledge in treating chest and pulmonary diseases.  When
the opportunity arose for Dr. Yeager to
 mo,e to Rockland County and head the Summit Park
 Hospital, he gladly accepted the position.  Years passed
 and a cure for tuberculosis was discovered.
 Summit Park Hospital was threatened with closure.  Dr.
 Yeager, along with many others - doctors and politicians
 alike; did not want to see this happen.  Under his tutelage,
 Summit Park Hospital became a chronic-care facility for
 long-term illness patients.  To honor Dr. Yeager, the
 Summit Park Hospital was re-named The Dr. Robert L.
 Yeager Health Center on February 22, 1987.
 A transcript of this interview is available to the public by
 contacting the Office of Records Management/Archives
 at 354-0200, e.t. 2956.

<p>What is the Office of Records Management
             and Archives?

<p>
The Office of Records Manageme.t aiid Archives is an
office under the jurisdiction of the County Executive.  It
was established in June of 1987 with the appointment of
Peter J. Scheibner as first County Archivist.  The office
is responsible for developing and implementing policy
and procedures related to record keeping, retention and
disposition, micrographics, filing and retrieval, vital
records protection and security, systems analysis, historical
document collection and preservation.  To date,
we ha,e sa,ed the County over 50,000 in space usage,
through authorized records destruction.  We are currently in the
process of developing a comprehensive data
base of all county department records.  This will lead to
streamlined improvements in record keeping and information
management.  In 1989 ,e will be implementing
a ,total records protection (microfilm) program for a
number of depatments while also establishing a computer output
microfiche system.  A confidential records
destruction initiative through document shredders and
shredder-bailers will also be forthcoming.  From an
archives perspective we have inventoried several collections of
extremely valuable historical records (Board of Supervisors
minute books, original Township Real Property Tax books 1860 -
current, Treasurer's Reports from the mid 1800's etc.) We have
also instituted an oral history project whereby we interview
individuals having a wealth of information and knowledge related
to county government and history.
<p>


THE PREMIER FILING AND INDEXING SYSTEM
<p>
      I have a system of filing that's all my own
      and it can't be explained and it can't be shown.
      I file by number, I file by letter,
      I file by ways that are ten times better.
<p>


I file by subject, I file by date,
I file by city, I file by state.
I shun the title and I scow conventions,
My filing system has four dimensions.
<p>


I regard "'In re" at the top of a letter
as something to make it balance better.
I pay no attention to underlining
and seldom to the person signing.

<p>

I have all the names of the company officials
neatly arranged by their middle initials.
But client's letters I have filed instead
by the color and size of their letterhead.
<p>


Reports, by my good reason,
instead of by month, I file by season.
and for things I consider extraneous,
three large drawers I label "miscellaneous".
<p>


They can't fire me, though I'm often late
and I lunch from eleven 'tail two.
I leave at four, if I have a date
and there is nothing they can do.
<p>


Or if I forget to come to work at all,
they have got to take it smiling,
you see I have them backed against the ,all,
for I do all the filing!
<p>

<CENTER><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><STRONG>Case Studies Involving Contractors</STRONG></CENTER>
<BR>
<A HREF=conexp.htm>(Go to - List of Exposures)</A><P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">In the following case histories,
environmental exposures take a variety of forms. But two factors
are common to all of these examples: None of the contractors were
remediation contractors nor were they covered by environmental
insurance at the time of the exposure, and ALL have suffered,
or will suffer, <I>significant</I> financial loss due to unprotected
liabilities.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<A NAME="civil"></A>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><STRONG>Mold Growth In HVAC System</STRONG><BR>
</FONT>
<P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">A mechanical contractor installed
a heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system in
a new commercial office building. After three years, mold and
mildew growth caused the release of airborne bacteria throughout
the entire building resulting in poor indoor air quality. Claims
against the contractor for bodily injury and loss of property
use exceeded $500,000. In addition, the contractor was responsible
for decontaminating the HVAC system.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>

<A NAME="excav"></A>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><STRONG>Contaminated Soil</STRONG><BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">An excavation/grading contractor
unknowingly spread petroleum contaminated soil across a project
site during fill operations for a housing project. The contractor
was named in a lawsuit for exacerbating the extent of contamination.
After lengthy deliberations, the contractor was eventually removed
from the lawsuit. However, he had invested $250,000 in his defense.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><STRONG>Costly Cleanup</STRONG><BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">An excavation contractor stockpiled
soil on an adjacent property. The scope of the project included
excavation of 357 feet of trench for one week at a cost of roughly
$30,000. Prior to completion of the work a dioxin was discovered
in the soil. The US Environmental Protection Agency investigated
the situation and issued an administrative order finding the contractor
and their client responsible for contamination of the adjacent
property. Government-mandated cleanup costs exceeded $250,000.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<A NAME="highway"></A>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><STRONG>Damaging Dust</STRONG><BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">A highway/bridge contractor was subject
to a $300,000 property damage claim for dust generated by a subcontractor
performing abrasive sandblasting of a bridge in a residential
area. Lead paint chips and dust became airborne and migrated onto
residential properties, requiring cleanup.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><STRONG>Claim Denied</STRONG><BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">An asphalt paving contractor was
subcontracted to pave a parking lot for a new commercial structure.
At the end of the day, the tack coat was sprayed onto the sub-base
prior to paving. During the evening, a major thunderstorm caused
the tack coat to wash off and flow into a nearby stream. The general
contractor was responsible for cleanup costs which exceeded $200,000.
To recoup these costs, the general contractor withheld the subcontractor's
payment. In turn, the subcontractor filed a claim with its insurance
company to recover lost revenue. The insurance company denied
reimbursement based on the absolute pollution exclusion under
the general liability policy.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>

<A NAME="general"></A>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><STRONG>Vapor Cloud</STRONG><BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">A general contractor dropped a piece
of heavy equipment from a crane onto a pipe leading to a hydrofluoric
acid tank. Acid was emitted into the surrounding atmosphere, creating
a vast vapor cloud. Approximately 3,000 residents were evacuated
and 1,000 were treated for respiratory injuries. The court entered
judgment holding the contractor 95 percent liable for the accident.
Over 4,500 claims have been filed in excess of $23,000,000. The
claims include bodily injury, property damage, lost profits and
emergency response costs.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><STRONG>Fumes Damage Fixtures</STRONG><BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">A general contractor performing
concrete etching in a commercial building used muriatic acid.
The highly-corrosive fumes from the acid were released into the
building. Over $75,000 in property damage to chrome fixtures resulted
from the fumes.<BR>
</FONT>




<A NAME="util"></A>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><STRONG>Backhoe Hits Gas Line</STRONG><BR>
</FONT>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">A utility contractor was working
on a $500,000 sewer rehabilitation project. During excavation
of a trench, the bucket of a backhoe hit a natural gas line. This
forced evacuation of the immediate area, including a small stripmall. Store owners filed loss of business claims against the contractor
which exceeded $75,000. The contractor's general liability
insurance carrier denied the claims based on their policy's
absolute pollution exclusion.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>

<I><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The examples above are intended
to illustrate the wide variety of environmental exposures faced
by institutions, business and industry and the many ways in which
those exposures can arise. Insurance coverage in any particular
case will depend upon the type of policy in effect, the terms,
conditions and exclusions in any such policy and the facts of
each unique situation. No representation is made that any specific
insurance coverage would apply in the above examples. Please refer
to the individual policy forms for specific coverage details.

<CENTER><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><STRONG>Case Studies Involving Contractors</STRONG></CENTER>
<BR>
<A HREF=conexp.htm>(Go to - List of Exposures)</A><P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">In the following case histories,
environmental exposures take a variety of forms. But two factors
are common to all of these examples: None of the contractors were
remediation contractors nor were they covered by environmental
insurance at the time of the exposure, and ALL have suffered,
or will suffer, <I>significant</I> financial loss due to unprotected
liabilities.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<A NAME="civil"></A>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><STRONG>Mold Growth In HVAC System</STRONG><BR>
</FONT>
<P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">A mechanical contractor installed
a heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system in
a new commercial office building. After three years, mold and
mildew growth caused the release of airborne bacteria throughout
the entire building resulting in poor indoor air quality. Claims
against the contractor for bodily injury and loss of property
use exceeded $500,000. In addition, the contractor was responsible
for decontaminating the HVAC system.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>

<A NAME="excav"></A>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><STRONG>Contaminated Soil</STRONG><BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">An excavation/grading contractor
unknowingly spread petroleum contaminated soil across a project
site during fill operations for a housing project. The contractor
was named in a lawsuit for exacerbating the extent of contamination.
After lengthy deliberations, the contractor was eventually removed
from the lawsuit. However, he had invested $250,000 in his defense.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><STRONG>Costly Cleanup</STRONG><BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">An excavation contractor stockpiled
soil on an adjacent property. The scope of the project included
excavation of 357 feet of trench for one week at a cost of roughly
$30,000. Prior to completion of the work a dioxin was discovered
in the soil. The US Environmental Protection Agency investigated
the situation and issued an administrative order finding the contractor
and their client responsible for contamination of the adjacent
property. Government-mandated cleanup costs exceeded $250,000.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<A NAME="highway"></A>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><STRONG>Damaging Dust</STRONG><BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">A highway/bridge contractor was subject
to a $300,000 property damage claim for dust generated by a subcontractor
performing abrasive sandblasting of a bridge in a residential
area. Lead paint chips and dust became airborne and migrated onto
residential properties, requiring cleanup.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><STRONG>Claim Denied</STRONG><BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">An asphalt paving contractor was
subcontracted to pave a parking lot for a new commercial structure.
At the end of the day, the tack coat was sprayed onto the sub-base
prior to paving. During the evening, a major thunderstorm caused
the tack coat to wash off and flow into a nearby stream. The general
contractor was responsible for cleanup costs which exceeded $200,000.
To recoup these costs, the general contractor withheld the subcontractor's
payment. In turn, the subcontractor filed a claim with its insurance
company to recover lost revenue. The insurance company denied
reimbursement based on the absolute pollution exclusion under
the general liability policy.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>

<A NAME="general"></A>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><STRONG>Vapor Cloud</STRONG><BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">A general contractor dropped a piece
of heavy equipment from a crane onto a pipe leading to a hydrofluoric
acid tank. Acid was emitted into the surrounding atmosphere, creating
a vast vapor cloud. Approximately 3,000 residents were evacuated
and 1,000 were treated for respiratory injuries. The court entered
judgment holding the contractor 95 percent liable for the accident.
Over 4,500 claims have been filed in excess of $23,000,000. The
claims include bodily injury, property damage, lost profits and
emergency response costs.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><STRONG>Fumes Damage Fixtures</STRONG><BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">A general contractor performing
concrete etching in a commercial building used muriatic acid.
The highly-corrosive fumes from the acid were released into the
building. Over $75,000 in property damage to chrome fixtures resulted
from the fumes.<BR>
</FONT>




<A NAME="util"></A>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><STRONG>Backhoe Hits Gas Line</STRONG><BR>
</FONT>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">A utility contractor was working
on a $500,000 sewer rehabilitation project. During excavation
of a trench, the bucket of a backhoe hit a natural gas line. This
forced evacuation of the immediate area, including a small stripmall. Store owners filed loss of business claims against the contractor
which exceeded $75,000. The contractor's general liability
insurance carrier denied the claims based on their policy's
absolute pollution exclusion.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>

<I><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The examples above are intended
to illustrate the wide variety of environmental exposures faced
by institutions, business and industry and the many ways in which
those exposures can arise. Insurance coverage in any particular
case will depend upon the type of policy in effect, the terms,
conditions and exclusions in any such policy and the facts of
each unique situation. No representation is made that any specific
insurance coverage would apply in the above examples. Please refer
to the individual policy forms for specific coverage details.

The College of Tropical Agriculture and Human Resources (CTAHR) was
established with the founding of the University of Hawai'i in 1907. CTAHR
is a leading academic institution in tropical agriculture, food science and
human nutrition, and human resources. Hawai'i's unique geographic location,
ecological diversity, and multi-cultural population provide students with a
living laboratory. The college is the locus of educational opportunities
for students preparing to become tomorrow's scientists, business leaders,
family development specialists, fashion designers, nutritionists, and
policy makers.

The College of Tropical Agriculture and Human Resources is unique in having a history that precedes the founding of the University of Hawaii itself.  In 1887, the U.S. Congress passed the Hatch Act which established Agricultural Experiment Stations at each land grant college.  These research facilities would eventually operate in all 50 states.  The Hawaii Agricultural Experiment Station (HAES) was founded in 1901 and was the forerunner of the Hawaii Institute of Tropical Agriculture and Human Resources (HITAHR).<P>

The University of Hawaii at Manoa began in 1907 as a land-grant College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts. Its first president was John Gilmore, an agronomist, who pointed out that although instruction was the primary purpose of the college, research was needed as the basis for applying knowledge to community needs.  In 1911, the College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts was renamed the College of Hawaii.  The following year it graduated its first class of four students, and three of the four earned degrees in general agriculture, agricultural engineering, and household economics.<P>

The Cooperative Extension Service was created in 1914 by Congress to communicate the findings from experiment station research to people who needed them.  During this period, one of HAES' projects involved the importation of napier grass to add to the scanty pasture resources of the Territory of Hawaii and also the development of other varietal grasses.  These initiatives were important to the expanding dairy industry and the latter proved crucial when the napier grass fields were later ruined by disease.  HAES researchers also individually assessed more than 11,000 seedling macadamia nut trees; propagating and selecting for quality.  Like many agricultural industries in Hawaii, the success of the present macadamia nut industry is built on CTAHR's early basic work.<P>

When the U.S. entered World War I, the visibility of HAES grew because of its persistence in emphasizing diversified agriculture (despite pressures to focus on sugar and pineapple) and its role in the production of food for an isolated group of islands.  It also supplied advice, seeds, and plants to the military and fostered "emergency war gardens" for Hawaii's citizens.<P>

In 1938, HAES officially became the research arm of the college.  The work of the college's home economists, particularly as it related to the nutritional value of Hawaiian fruits and vegetables, proved extremely valuable to the people of Hawaii and elsewhere.<P>

During the early l940's, the college's activities were dominated by the war effort.  The Extension Service made 43,000 farm and home visits and conducted more than 3,000 meetings-as President Sinclair commented, "...possibly no branch of the university was better prepared than the Extension Service to assume emergency duties."  Immediately after the war, the college expanded its international activities and its faculty were in Okinawa, Guam, and other Pacific Islands as advisors bearing seeds and plants.  This work resulted in restoration of devastated lands and continuing goodwill for Hawaii and the University of Hawaii.  n 1949, President Sinclair reported that the 'naturals for Hawaii' insofar as the University's emphasis was concerned were: tropical agriculture, marine biology, and Pacific and Asian cultures.  At the top of the UH needs list was the means to develop economic studies of flowers, foliage, and tropical fruits.  A catalogue of land and water resources was another priority, as were land use studies.<P>

The enlarged base of economically viable crops and systematic assessment of natural resources that exists in Hawaii today can be traced to work undertaken during this period.<P>

In the 1950's, HAES listed among its achievements: increased coffee yields from a new pruning system researchers had designed; development of frozen passion fruit juice for the beverage trade and ice cream manufacturers; and perfection of a cylinder husker for macadamia nuts.  In the 1960's, the College of Agriculture was renamed the College of Tropical Agriculture, and in the 1970's, HAES became the Hawaii Institute of Tropical Agriculture and Human Resources in the College of Tropical Agriculture and Human Resources.  Research, formerly administered through HAES, and extension, administered under the Cooperative Extension Service, were integrated under HITAHR.<P>

<B>
Degrees Offered: BS in agricultural and resource economics, MS in agricultural and resource economics, PhD in agricultural and resource economics.<br>
<br>
The Academic Program<br>
<br>
Agricultural and resource economics (AREC) deals with the practical application of economic theory and analytic methods to diverse aspects of the commercial food and fiber industries. Analysis of public sector projects and domestic and international policies in agriculture and resource use is also involved. Students study production and agribusiness management; marketing and market organization; economic development, trade, and agricultural policy; and resource use, development, conservation, and quality.<br>
<br>
AREC provides undergraduate students with a well-rounded education and the flexibility to tailor programs to match students' interests. The graduate programs are rigorous in economic theory, quantitative methods, and the application of learned theory and methods to AREC fields or areas of concentration. AREC graduates find employment in the private sector and in government and academic institutions.<br>
<br>
Undergraduate Study<br>
<br>
Bachelor's Degree<br>
<br>
Concentrations available within this curriculum include: agribusiness, natural resources, fisheries and aquaculture economics, and general agricultural economics in preparation for graduate work. Students and their adviser will develop an appropriate plan of study.<br>
<br>
Requirements<br>
<br>
   * ACC 201<br>
   * AREC 210 or MATH 205<br>
   * ECON 300 and 301<br>
   * ENG 210 or 309<br>
   * 18 upper division AREC credit hours, including AREC 310 and at least one 400-level AREC course.<br>
<br>
Graduate Study<br>
<br>
The department offers MS and PhD degrees in the general areas of production and agricultural systems, agricultural marketing, resource economics, and international agricultural trade, development, and policy. A PhD program in agricultural systems analysis is also offered in cooperation with faculty in the biosystems engineering department.<br>
<br>
The department maintains close relationships with the UH Manoa Water Resources Research Center, the Sea Grant College Program, and the Department of Economics, as well as the East-West Center. Graduate students have considerable latitude for designing programs of study, generally focusing on issues important to Asian and Pacific Basin countries.<br>
<br>
Complete details on graduate programs, as well as financial aid available to prospective students are outlined in a brochure available upon request from the department. Please send all inquiries to: Department of Agricultural and Resource Economics, 3050 Maile Way.<br>
<br>
Master's Degree<br>
<br>
Undergraduate preparation for admission to the MS program includes courses in intermediate micro- and macroeconomics, statistics, calculus, computer programming, and operations research.<br>
<br>
Graduates with MS degrees have found employment in government and international agencies, agricultural extension services, financial organizations, and agribusiness firms.<br>
<br>
Requirements<br>
<br>
Prospective MS candidates may select either the Plan A (thesis) or Plan B (non-thesis) program. The Plan A program requires 25 credit hours of course work and 6 credit hours of thesis. The student must pass an oral exam in defense of the thesis.<br>
<br>
Plan B requires 34 credit hours of course work, of which 18 credit hours must be from courses at the 600 level or above. A scholarly paper and a written comprehensive exam, followed by an oral exam, are required. The scholarly paper should reflect the candidate's substantive analysis of a subject in the field of agricultural and resource economics. The written exam covers materials from the core courses.<br>
<br>
All students pursuing the MS are required to take a core of courses, including AREC 458, 627, 628, 626, and 705 and ECON 607 and 627.<br>
<br>
Doctoral Degree<br>
<br>
Applicants with a master's degree in either agricultural economics or a closely related field with no undergraduate deficiencies will be considered for admission to the PhD program. Students currently enrolled in the MS program, upon successful completion of 12 credit hours of graduate course work, may petition for admission to the PhD program. Students with outstanding undergraduate records (minimum GPA of 3.3) in agricultural and resource economics or a closely related field with no undergraduate deficiencies may also gain admission to the PhD program. Applicants for the PhD program must have completed all courses required for admission to the master's program.<br>
<br>
Employment opportunities for PhD graduates include private and public research organizations, and university positions in research, teaching, and extension.<br>
<br>
Requirements<br>
<br>
Students in the PhD program must take AREC 626, 634, 624, 629, 630, 636, 637, and 705; ECON 627, 606, 607, and 608; and two graduate courses in a specialized area.<br>
<br>
PhD students must pass a written comprehensive exam based on core courses (see departmental brochure for details). They must also pass an oral comprehensive exam, write an acceptable dissertation based on original research, and defend it in a public examination before being awarded the PhD degree.<br>

Short History of the Development of the Department of Agricultural and Resource Economics in the College of Tropical Agriculture & Human Resources at the University of Hawaii at Manoa<br>
<br>
by Perry F. Philipp, with input by Frank S. Scott<br>
<br>
        Work in the field of agricultural economics in the College of Tropical Agriculture and Human Resources of the University of Hawaii began shortly before World War II as an Agricultural Economics Project of the Agricultural Extension Service under the direction of Ralph Elliott.  The activities of the extension agricultural economists involved farm management, cost of production and marketing of products of diversified agriculture, both within the Territory and for export.<br>
<br>
        During the War, these agricultural extension economists played a major role in organizing the rapid expansion of production and marketing of crops and livestock products for consumption in the Territory.   At the end of the War, the extension economists of the Project, in addition to their previous work, started a crop and livestock reporting service, in cooperation with the Federal Crop and Livestock Reporting Service. They published semiweekly Market Reports, a monthly Agricultural Outlook publication and annual Statistics of Diversified Agriculture in Hawaii. When all these reporting and statistical publications were running smoothly by 1955, this work was transferred to the Territorial Board of Agriculture and Forestry.<br>
<br>
        In 1948, the Hawaii Agricultural Experiment Station started a program in agricultural economic research and the Department of Agricultural Economics was started, including both research and extension in farm management, production economics, consumer economics, and marketing, both locally and for export to the mainland United States.<br>
<br>
        At that time, mainland markets for Hawaiian agricultural products were still completely undeveloped and needed help. The researchers of the new department emphasized market research of such varied products as papayas, macadamia nut products, guava and passion fruit juices, fresh winter vegetables, flowers and foliage and cattle. This was followed up by market development. Department personnel was stationed on the West Coast, acquainting the general public with these new products and teaching the retail and wholesale trade, how to handle fresh tropical products. Several of to-days export industries owe much of their development to the initial research in the Department. This was followed up by extension work, especially in organizing production and marketing cooperatives and other industry organizations. <br>
<br>
        About 1950, Department members started teaching undergraduate courses in farm management and marketing. In 1955, the Department began a B.S. program in agricultural economics.  In 1959, it started an M.S. program.  In 1962, the Ph.D. program was initiated, several years ahead of the Ph.D. program in the Department of Economics at the University of Hawaii.  By 1967, the Department of Agricultural Economics had 70 graduate students, of whom about 1/2 were M.S. and 1/2 Ph.D. students. By 1978, Ph.D. students had become more important, with 53 in attendance, while M.S. students numbered 17. The Department had become one of the larger ones in the number of Ph.D.'s awarded per year by Agricultural Economics Departments in the U.S.  Many of the Department's graduates to-day have important positions in Hawaii, the mainland United States and in the Pacific and Asia. <br>
<br>
        The Department played a major role in the establishment of the East-West Center at the University of Hawaii and has trained many East-West Center students.  Many of the Department's researchers have worked closely on projects with East West Center scientists.  The Department's members helped in the development of agricultural economic institutions abroad, mainly in Asia.  For example, Professor Peters played an important role in establishing the Department of Agricultural Economics at Kasetsart, Thailand's major agricultural university. <br>
<br>
        Several colleges other than College of Tropical Agriculture and Human Resources use the service courses given by the Department of Agricultural and Resource Economics. For example, the Colleges of Social Science and Business Administration depend on the Department's course in calculus for their students.  Other service courses are offered by the Department such as in intermediate statistics and computer science. <br>
<br>
        Over the years the Department broadened its studies in line with the discipline to address new policy issues facing the State of Hawaii, such as land and water use, energy, and environmental quality.  The departmental name was officially changed to Agricultural and Resource Economics in 1972 to reflect this growth. <br>

<DL>
<DT><H2><I>About Recipe Manager</I></H2>
<DD>
    Recipe Manager is a subset of the Database
    Management component of the Recipe-Based Diet Planning
    Modelling System.  The modelling system was developed to
    facilitate the execution of a mathematical programming model for
    deriving nutritionally adequate diets with minimum cost or
    minimum time.  The full system is designed primarily for on-going
    research use, and it is rather demanding in terms of both hardware
    and software requirements for implementation.  Hence, it is deemed
    to be unsuitable for general uses.  Readers interested in the full
    system are referred to Leung et al. (1992, 1994).  Recipe Manager,
    however, is a stand-alone run-time component of the larger
    modelling system and can be used on any IBM-compatible
    microcomputer under the Windows environment.  This module can
    be used by nutritional professionals or others for nutrition education
    and diet planning.<P>

    Recipe Manager provides an interactive environment for users to
    search for recipes using six types of selection criteria: recipe type,
    main dish food category, ethnic food group, preparation and
    cooking time, cost, and nutritional or RDA goals.  Recipe type
    includes appetizer, main dish, side dish, dessert, breakfast, and
    beverage.  For main dishes, the user can select any combination of
    beef, pork, lamb, poultry, seafood, or vegetarian recipes.  The user
    can search for recipes from 23 different ethnic categories.  The user
    can select less than, greater than, or equal to a certain amount as
    desired for preparation time, waiting time, attentive cooking time
    and/or inattentive cooking time.  Preparation time is defined as time
    necessary to gather, measure, and combine ingredients before
    cooking.  Waiting time is defined as unattended time necessary for
    ingredients beforc cooking or serving, such as marinating meat or
    allowing bread to proof.  Attentive cooking time is defined as time
    when the cook is actively involved in the cooking process.
    Inattentive cooking time is defined as the time when the cook could
    be absent or accomplishing other tasks during the cooking process.
    The cost can be set as less than, greater than, or equal to a certain
    amount per recipe or serving.  The user can search for recipes which
    satisfy certain user-specified nutritional goals or, alternatively, the
    user can search based on a user-specified percentage of the RDA
    goal for the desired age and gender category.  For example, the user
    could search for Chinese and Korean main dish recipes using beef
    or pork that cost less than $1.50 per serving, take less than 30
    minutes to prepare, and have less that 15 g of fat and 300 mg of
    sodium per serving.<P>

    Currently, the database contains 895 recipes generated from 606
    food items.  The recipes were gathered from the Hawaii 4-H youth
    program collection of popular local recipes, recipes developed by
    the University of Hawaii Cooperative Extension Service's
    Expanded Food and Nutrition Education Program (EFNEP), and
    other cookbooks.  Prices for the food items necessary to prepare the
    recipes were provided by Foodland Supermarket, Ltd. during the
    last quarter of 1993.  Times associated with preparing and cooking
    a recipe were estimated by a team of people familiar with the
    particular recipes and were standardized across ethnic types.  The
    daily RDAs were taken from the U.S. Food Nutrition Board of the
    National Research Council (1989) and the Nutritionist IV program.<P>

Public interest in food science and human nutrition has never been greater than it is today.  People want easy-to-prepare, good-tasting, and healthful foods.  They want to know what is in the foods they eat, and how food components could promote or harm their health.  These are the challenges for food scientists, human nutritionists, and dietitians.  The University of Hawaii at Manoa (UHM) is in the center of the Pacific and offers a unique multi-cultural perspective to meet these challenges.

In the Territory of Hawaii, 4-H began under the auspices of the Federal Agricultural
Experiment Station and leadership of Frederick G. Krauss, Harvey F. Wiley and Mabel
Greene.  It was launched in 1918 with a 31-member pig club on Maui.  In 1923, Miss 
Greene integrated the 4-H club work with the public schools with teachers who were
trained in agriculture and home economics.<P>

By 1926, there were 4-H clubs on Oahu, Hawaii, and Kauai.  That year, the Pollyanna
4-H club of Honolulu exhibited in Chicago and won a national prize.  It was the first
time a club had participated from such a "distant place" as Hawaii<P>

In the decades which followed, 4-H clubs in Hawaii played important roles in major
events of their times.  During the 1930's Depression, groups of older boys and girls
organized into junior farm and home demonstration clubs.  During World War II, 4-H
clubs developed horticultural practices such as grafting macadamia nut trees and
coffee plants.<P>

After the war, the beef calf program made its debut, financed by Bank of Hawaii.  
Under this arrangement, loans of up to $125 for the purchase of beef calf were offered
by the bank to qualified 4-H club members.  Another major activity was collection 
and sale of pasture grass and legume seeds.<P>

As the decades passed, the 4-H broadened its scope, thanks to increased public funding
through the Extension Service, assured by acts of Congress.  In 1927, both the 4-H
motto, "To  make the best better", and the four-leaf clover emblem were approved.  By
1977, the 4-H council had been created by a merger of the 4-H Club Foundation and 
National 4-H Service Committee.<P>

Meanwhile, programs were evolving in line with the needs of youth in a changing 
society.  During the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, increased emphasis was given science,
work with low-income people, minorities, and urban youth<P>

<A NAME="early"><H2>Early History of 4-H Club Work</H2>
Boys and girls 4-H club work was started in Hawaii in 1918, during the first world 
war.  The slogan "Food Will Win the War" was used, and Hawaii's boys and girls
joined in with adults to grow food<P>

Club work became a part of the Agricultural Experiment Station of the Departmment of
Agriculture in 1923.  Miss Mabel Greene was appointed Territorial 4-H Club Leader to
do the work in Hawaii<P>

In 1926, when the Smith-Lever Law was amended to provide funds for the Territory of Hawaii,
the Copperative Extension Service at the University of Hawaii was established.  Miss
Mabel Greene then became Hawaii's firts home demonstration agent.  She was assigned to 
do Extension work on the island of Oahu.  During 1928 and 1929, 4-H Clubs were organized
on the four major islands.<P>

<A NAME="first"><H2>First 4-H Conference</H2>
The first conference was called the Territorial 4-H Club Week.  It was held on the Manoa
campus of the University of Hawaii, June 16-20, 1930.  At this gathering, there were in 
attendance eight boys and eight girls from the island of Hawaii, four boys and four girls

each from the Islands of Kauai, Maui, and Oahu.  Eleven adult leaders chaperoned the
group.<P>

Yearly conferences continued for two years.  The next conference was held June 10-14, 1939
with a total of 120 4-H club members and 17 leaders in attendance.  The boys were housed 
in the Mills Building and the girls in the Kawaiahao Building at the Mills School, presently
known as Mid Pacific Institute.<P>

<A NAME="4-h_ahaolelo"><H2>4-H Ahaolelo</H2>
No additional conferences were held until 1947, when the name "Ahaolelo,"--a Hawaiian word
meaning "to come together for a meeting,"--was adopted as the offical name of the 
territorial 4-H gathering.  Ninety-nine 4-H member delegates and local club members 
attended.  The 4-H delgates were selected on the following basis of two boys and two girls
from each county plus one delegate per 100 members enrolled and/or major fraction thereof.
Separate enrollment for boys and girls was considered the basis for determining the number
of delegates.  In addition, two club leaders, one for the boys' and one for the girls'
clubs, came from each county as delegates.<P>
The 1949 Ahaolelo theme was "Better Living For A Better World".  Ninety-six members and 
eighteen local leaders were officially registered.  The judging contest was one of the
main events, and the combined boys' and girls' score won Maui judging championship that
year.<P>

<A NAME="gifts"><H2>Gifts to the Alii</H2>
One of the distinctly Hawaiian features of the 4-H Ahaolelo is the annual presentation of 
representative products of the land to persons who symbolize the highest type of leadership 
in Hawaii. This is called the "Gifts To The Alii" presentation. This tradition was started
in 1953 when Governor and Mrs. Samuel Wilder King were recognized. Other recipients are as

<A NAME="conference"><H2>Conference Newspaper</H2>
During the 1930 4-H Club Week, a daily newspaper called the HOIKI PU KA LA meaning daily 
report was published. It continued to be published in 1931 and 1932. No conference paper was 
issued until 1955 when the publication was called NUUAHOU AHAOLELO. It meant 'news of the 
Ahaolelo.' It was discovered that the first word was misspelled, so before the conference 
ended the name was changed to HUHOU AHAOLELO.  Molokai submitted the name. The newspaper was 
not resumed in 1956 but in 1957 it was published issuing only a single edition. In 1958 three 
issues were printed.<P>
In 1959 it was a daily during the 4-H Ahaolelo. 4-H reported from each county met each day 
with the Extension editor and published a very creditable paper. There was no news paper 
during the 196O Ahaolelo. During 1975-78, a daily paper, KA LEO O'AHAOLELO was published. No 
newsletters have been printed since.<P>

<A NAME="tree"><H2>Ahaolelo Tree Planting Ceremony</H2>
Although the tradition of tree planting during the 4-H conference was started in 1947, it was 
not until 1953 when trees were planted in memory of some person or persons. It was then that a 
group of five Samoan coconut trees were planted in memory of Richard Sumida and his family.<P>
Trees planted by 4-H members during the past years are:

<A NAME="annual"><H2>Annual Leaders Meeting at Ahaolelo</H2>
The Territorial 4-H Leaders' organization was organized on a trial basis during the 1953 
Ahaolelo. In order to put it on a permanent basis, Mrs. Florence Jurgemeyer, president, 
called a special meeting of the representative of county councils in June 1954. As a result of 
this, the first meeting of the leaders was held during the 1954 Ahaolelo when new officers were
elected. Toshimasa Tando of South Oahu was chosen president in 1955 and the leaders met during 
Ahaolelo until 1961.<P>
Through funds made available by the Sears-Roebuck Foundation, western division, outstanding 
4-H leaders were able to attend the National 4-H Congress held annually in Chicago.<P>
In 1953, Mrs. Mary Lee, a lO-year club leader from Molokai had the honor of being the first 
leader-delegate to the Congress. Other recipients were:

Two Territorial-wide 4-H club conterences were held from July 1, 1947 to June 30, 1948. During 
the 1947 conference the delegates decided to form a territorial organization of 4-H clubs. They 
elected officers and decided that these officers and the county agents draw up the constitution 
and bylaws which may be presented at the subsequent 4-H conference.<P>
Officers elected were: Junko Uyenoyama, President, East Hawaii, Hisao Yamada, Vice President, 
Maui, Amy Nagaue, Secretary, East Hawaii, and Walter H. Murakane, Treasurer, Hilo.<P>
During the 1948 4-H conference which was held June 14-19, a constitutional convention was held 
with President Junko Uyenoyama presiding.  At this meeting a constitution and bylaws were 
adopted. The official name of the organization was the 4-H Club Federation of Hawaii.  Officers 
elected for 1948-49 were Clarence Nihei, President, West Oahu, Norma Ito, Vice President, East
Oahu, Fumie Ouchi, Secretary, South Oahu, and Roy Ganiko, Treasurer East Oahu.<P>
The objectives of the Federation adopted were: "To unite all county 4-H Club Federation into a 
territorial affiliation; to improve the quality of 4-H Club work; to provide opportunities for 
leadership; to encourage 4-H member participation in state and national events; and to assist in
the training and developing of 4-H members as better citizens." Presidents of the Federation in 
the ensuing years were:<P>

<H2>Conservation Awareness Program</H2>

The purpose of the Conservation Awareness Program is to give interested youth an opportunity to learn about, appreciate, and have a greater understanding of Hawaiian soils.  Annual county and state land judging contests are held.  The high 
scoring county team of three and an alternate person then competes in a statewide contest.  The statewide event is rotated among the counties. Hawaii - 1996;  Maui/Molokai/Lanai - 1997; Kauai - 1998; Oahu   1999; Hawaii - 2000, etc.  It is a joint effort of the Cooperative Extension Service, the Soil Conservation Districts and is open to all organized groups of youth 9 to 18 years of age as of April 30.  While FFA and 4-H are the major participating groups, the contest is open to Scouts, Civitans, school science classes, and any other youth groups.  National participants must be 14 years of age.<P>

National competition takes place the last week of April, first week of May in Oklahoma City. Travel and expenses for team and coach are not presently sponsored.<P><P><P><P>

carried out with the support of award donors and other cooperators.  National 4-H Congress is  keyed to the interest of those 
4-H delegates who have achieved high standards of excellence in their 4-H project work.  Congress provides new and stimulating educational and cultural experiences which contribute to personal growth and leadership-citizenship development.  It focuses on public attention on outstanding 4-H members, 4-H values and provides a forum for interaction and exchange of ideas.<P><P><P><P>

have received a blue ribbon award at the respective county 4-H show.  Animals normally enter the fair grounds on Wednesday, and are shown on Friday and Saturday and sold at the 4-H auction on Saturday evening.  Livestock and meat judging usually takes place on Thursday, awards brunch on Sunday and carcass shows within a week at meat packing plants.<P>

Pending the availability of resources, the senior county livestock judging team with the highest state contest score represents Hawaii at the'Western Regional 4-H Livestock Judging contest in Denver, Colorado.  The Hawaii State Livestock Council financially assists to the extent of 1/2 of the total cost.  The county team and the respective county 4-H livestock committee pay the other half.<P>

Complete details of rules, regulations, and type of awards are available in the publication, "Hawaii State 4-H Livestock Show and Sale," available in county and state 4-H  offices.<P><P><P><P>


<A NAmE="ahaolelo">
<H2>4-H Ahaolelo</H2>

Ahaolelo is a Hawaiian word which means "To come together for a meeting".  The name was adopted in 1947 when 99 4-H members and leaders participated in the 4th territorial 4-H Conference.<P>

Although Hawaiian 4-H club work began in 1918 when 31 Maui boys enrolled in the pig project, it was not until 1928-29 when the Smith Lever Law was amended to establish the Agricultural Extension Service at the University of Hawaii in 1930 with 51 members from Hawaii, Maui, Oahu and Kauai.<P>

Conferences were held in 1931 and 1932 and then none until 1947.  By 1958, the number of delegates increased to 212.  The conference expanded to include a delegation of 12 California members and chaperone in 1965 and again in 1967 when 10 members and two leaders attended.<P>
	
In 1968, delegates from Canada, Guam and another delegation from California attended Ahaolelo.  In 1988, Micronesians joined us and in 1989 and 1990, Guam joined us.  Japan's LABO students were part of Ahaolelo in 1991 and 1993.<P>

The 4-H Ahaolelo is rich in tradition.  The week of "coming together" has played an important part in the development of 4-H in Hawaii.  The 4-H Ahaolelo provides opportunities to make friends and exchange ideas.<P>

One of the special Hawaiian traditions of 4-H Ahaolelo is the "Gift to the Alii--recognition of a person who symbolizes the highest type of leadership in Hawaii.  The first presentation of products from each island to the Alii was made in 1953 when Governor and Mrs. Samuel Wilder King were recognized.<P>

Friends of 4-H awards are also presented to persons and companies who have contributed to 4-H over a period of time statewide.<P>

4-H Congress winners are announced at the final banquet.<P>

<p>
<hr><a name="1"></a></p>

<h3>How big does my compost pile have to be?</h3>

<ul>
<li>The compost pile can be as big or as small as you want. If you have
a very small pile, it will not get hot, so the decomposition process will
be much slower. Generally, to get a compost pile to heat up to 140o F,
it has to be about 3 ft. x 3 ft. and about 3 ft. high. </li>
</ul>

<p><a name="2"></a></p>

<h3>What kind of materials should I use in my compost pile?</h3>

<ul>
<li>Almost any kind of organic material can be used in a compost pile:
trimmings from hedges or trees, grass clippings, manures, vegetable waste
from the kitchen, straw, fallen fruit from trees, cut flowers, etc. The
one thing to keep in mind is that the more shredded the material is, the
faster it will decompose. Also materials should be mixed. A thick layer
of grass clippings will prevent air and water movement though the pile,
slow the decomposition process, and may begin to smell with the anaerobic
decomposition. </li>

<p>Do not use pet wastes because of the human pathogens they can harbor.
(It is not wise to depend on the heat of the compost pile to destroy these
pathogens.) Do not use waste meat or fish parts from the kitchen. Their
odors may attract pests such as rats and mice to your compost pile. </p>
</ul>

<p><a name="3"></a></p>

<h3>Should I add a source of nitrogen to my compost pile?</h3>

<ul>
<li>Nitrogen can be added to nitrogen poor organic material to speed up
decomposition. Things like tree limbs, dried trimmings, straw, and saw
dust have low nitrogen levels, and take a long time to decompose. If these
materials are mixed with fresh grass clippings or other green material,
additional nitrogen need not be added. </li>

<p>Sources of nitrogen that can be added include poultry, or steer manures,
and high nitrogen fertilizers. </p>
</ul>

<p><a name="4"></a></p>

<h3>Do I need to contain my compost pile in a bin, drum or some kind of
container?</h3>

<ul>
<li>No. You can just make a pile of material. It may not have the aesthetics
you or your neighbors like, and it may be more difficult to turn. </li>
</ul>

<p><a name="5"></a></p>

<h3>How often do I need to turn my compost pile?</h3>

<ul>
<li>The optimum would be about every two weeks. However, the compost pile
need not be turned at all. Turning just speeds up the decomposition process.
</li>
</ul>

<p><a name="6"></a></p>

<h3>How soon can I use the compost generated from my compost bin?</h3>

<ul>
<li>It depends on several factors: what materials you used, how shredded
they were, how often you turned the pile, how wet it was, how often you
turned it, and what you plan to do with it. If you plan to use it to mulch
around trees or other plantings, you want it decomposed to the point of
not being recognizable as to what the material was. So you can generally
use it fairly quickly. That is also true if you were going to use it as
a soil amendment for a garden, flower bed or tree planting. If you used
a lot of nitrogen poor material, you probably would want to add a source
of nitrogen if your compost is not totally broken down before you plant.
</li>

<p>On the other hand if you were going to use it as a potting soil you
would want it fairly decomposed. In that case you could look at the material.
It should look something like soft soil that can be compressed, but is
somewhat spongy. Individual particles should be no bigger than about a
quarter of an inch. </p>
</ul>

<h3>What is organic gardening?</h3>

<ul>
<li>Organic gardening is a method of gardening that uses no synthetic chemicals
or fertilizers. Everything used comes from a naturally occurring source.
Examples of nutrients would include such things as manures, rock phosphate,
compost, bone meal, ashes, etc. Pest control is maintained by using traps,
predators, parasites, plant extracts, and other naturally occurring material.
</li>
</ul>

<p><a name="2"></a></p>

<h3>How can I control slugs and snails organically?</h3>

<ul>
<li>There are several methods of controlling slugs and snails organically:
prevention, predators, traps, and poisons. Prevention means protecting
plants by placing them in a uninfested area, or on benches that have a
barrier around the legs. (The plants, pots and media have to be free of
all slugs, snails and eggs.) Predators can include ducks, geese, chickens,
other birds, or even cannibalistic snails.</li>

<p> There are a number of traps you can try. One inexpensive plastic bowl
with a snap on lid to keep the bait from the weather, is available in local
garden shops. Traps generally rely on a bait that attracts the snails or
slugs to the trap. Often these baits stuns or intoxicates the slugs and
snails, entrapping them. One simple trap is a plank or board laid flat
on the soil surface. The slugs and snails will hide under it during the
day, when you can come along and collect and destroy them.</p>

<p> Organic poisons often depend on a trap to bring the critters into contact
with the poisons. Alcohol, salt, sulfur and lime have been used. There
a number of formulas for mixing baits. </p>
</ul>

<p><a name="3"></a></p>

<h3>What advantage is there to growing plants organically?</h3>

<ul>
<li>The major advantage is that you are not introducing man-made poisons
and other synthetic chemicals into the environment. That means that beneficial
organisms are not killed by chemicals that are often broad spectrum toxins.
It also means that you, your family, friends, and animals don't come into
contact with these substances.</li>

<p> By not using synthetic fertilizers, you can often avoid the burning
they cause by applying too much. (Some organic fertilizers can cause similar
problems, however.) Also many organic fertilizers are by-products of animals
or composting, rather than the end product of a chemical process. </p>
</ul>

<p><a name="4"></a></p>

<h3>How can I control ants organically?</h3>

<ul>
<li>The trick in controlling ants is to eliminate or destroy the nest or
nests. This is often impossible, because of the difficulty in locating
all of their nests and sometime their location isn't easy to reach. Try
patiently following the line of ants to their nest. Good luck. They usually
build nests in dark places that are undisturbed.</li>

<p> The next best thing is to kill the queen ant that continues laying
eggs that supports the colony. Since she is tended by worker ants and never
leaves the nest, you have to devise a bait/poison that the workers will
take to her. Often this requires mixing a sweet substance like corn syrup
with borax. However, a too toxic mix will kill the workers. Generally a
3 to 5% concentration of borax with syrup will work. Paint the mixture
along the trails or where the ants will find it. You won't see the ants
instantly disappear, because there may be hundreds of worker ants, and
it will take some time for all of them and the queen to die off. </p>
</ul>

<p><a name="5"></a></p>

<h3>How can I control caterpillars organically?</h3>

<ul>
<li>There are many formulations of Bacillus thuringiensis that controls
caterpillars. This bacterium when eaten by a caterpillar, generates a toxins
that attacks the caterpillars gut and kills it. The bacterium and its toxin
is harmless to other insects, as well as mammals, birds, and fish. </li>
</ul>

<p><a name="6"></a></p>

<h3>Is it true that using chicken manure in a large quantity can cause
salt accumulation problems?</h3>

<ul>
<li>Large quantities of fresh chicken manure used over a length of time
may cause a salt build-up in the soil. Use of wood shavings and other green
material incorporated into the soil along with periodic flushing of the
salt by thorough watering will help prevent excess salt accumulation. </li>
</ul>

<p><a name="7"></a></p>

<h3>Could you advise me of some organic fertilizer available for use in
vegetable gardens?</h3>

<ul>
<li>Dried blood, various animal manures, compost, sewage sludge, bone meal,
rock phosphate, fish by products and ash are some of the organic fertilizer
materials available for home vegetable garden use. </li>
</ul>

<h3>How big does my compost pile have to be?</h3>

<ul>
<li>The compost pile can be as big or as small as you want. If you have
a very small pile, it will not get hot, so the decomposition process will
be much slower. Generally, to get a compost pile to heat up to 140o F,
it has to be about 3 ft. x 3 ft. and about 3 ft. high. </li>
</ul>

<p><a name="2"></a></p>

<h3>What kind of materials should I use in my compost pile?</h3>

<ul>
<li>Almost any kind of organic material can be used in a compost pile:
trimmings from hedges or trees, grass clippings, manures, vegetable waste
from the kitchen, straw, fallen fruit from trees, cut flowers, etc. The
one thing to keep in mind is that the more shredded the material is, the
faster it will decompose. Also materials should be mixed. A thick layer
of grass clippings will prevent air and water movement though the pile,
slow the decomposition process, and may begin to smell with the anaerobic
decomposition. </li>

<p>Do not use pet wastes because of the human pathogens they can harbor.
(It is not wise to depend on the heat of the compost pile to destroy these
pathogens.) Do not use waste meat or fish parts from the kitchen. Their
odors may attract pests such as rats and mice to your compost pile. </p>
</ul>

<p><a name="3"></a></p>

<h3>Should I add a source of nitrogen to my compost pile?</h3>

<ul>
<li>Nitrogen can be added to nitrogen poor organic material to speed up
decomposition. Things like tree limbs, dried trimmings, straw, and saw
dust have low nitrogen levels, and take a long time to decompose. If these
materials are mixed with fresh grass clippings or other green material,
additional nitrogen need not be added. </li>

<p>Sources of nitrogen that can be added include poultry, or steer manures,
and high nitrogen fertilizers. </p>
</ul>

<p><a name="4"></a></p>

<h3>Do I need to contain my compost pile in a bin, drum or some kind of
container?</h3>

<ul>
<li>No. You can just make a pile of material. It may not have the aesthetics
you or your neighbors like, and it may be more difficult to turn. </li>
</ul>

<p><a name="5"></a></p>

<h3>How often do I need to turn my compost pile?</h3>

<ul>
<li>The optimum would be about every two weeks. However, the compost pile
need not be turned at all. Turning just speeds up the decomposition process.
</li>
</ul>

<p><a name="6"></a></p>

<h3>How soon can I use the compost generated from my compost bin?</h3>

<ul>
<li>It depends on several factors: what materials you used, how shredded
they were, how often you turned the pile, how wet it was, how often you
turned it, and what you plan to do with it. If you plan to use it to mulch
around trees or other plantings, you want it decomposed to the point of
not being recognizable as to what the material was. So you can generally
use it fairly quickly. That is also true if you were going to use it as
a soil amendment for a garden, flower bed or tree planting. If you used
a lot of nitrogen poor material, you probably would want to add a source
of nitrogen if your compost is not totally broken down before you plant.
</li>

<p>On the other hand if you were going to use it as a potting soil you
would want it fairly decomposed. In that case you could look at the material.
It should look something like soft soil that can be compressed, but is
somewhat spongy. Individual particles should be no bigger than about a
quarter of an inch. </p>
</ul>

<h3>What kinds of culinary herbs can be grown in Hawaii?</h3>

<ul>
<li>There are many. Examples: basil, rosemary, oregano, spearmint, garlic
chives, chives, Chinese parsley (cilantro), parsley, and thyme. Vietnamese
herbs: Ngo gai (Eryngium), lolot, rau ram, rau om, lemongrass, etc. Sage
and tarragon are somewhat challenging to grow well in Hawaii. You can see
these and others at the Pearl City Urban Garden Center, which is open every
Tuesday and the first Saturday of the month from 9:00 a.m. to noon. </li>
</ul>

<p><a name="2"></a></p>

<h3>What is the definition of herb?</h3>

<ul>
<li>There are two definitions in the dictionary: a. A plant that has a
fleshy stem as distinguished from the woody tissue of shrubs and trees.
b. Any of various often aromatic plants used especially in medicine or
as seasoning. The second definition is most applicable to our discussion
of herbs. Culinary herbs refer specifically to those plants used for seasoning
food. </li>
</ul>

<p><a name="3"></a></p>

<h3>What is the estimated farm value of the commercial herb industry in
the state?</h3>

<ul>
<li>According to the Hawaii Agricultural Statistics Service, Hawaii Department
of Agriculture, the farm value of fresh herbs was $1.77 million in 1994.
Remember that this figure is the farm value, not the value of the herbs
after they have been retailed or prepared and placed onto some fancy dish
at the restaurant. </li>
</ul>

<p><a name="4"></a></p>

<h3>Are all of the herbs grown in Hawaii consumed here?</h3>

<ul>
<li>No. Local growers also export herbs to the U.S. mainland. It gets too
cold during the winter in most areas of the mainland to grow cold-sensitive
plants like basil in the field. Vietnamese herbs are also exported. </li>
</ul>

<p><a name="5"></a></p>

<h3>What is the major commercial herb crop grown in Hawaii?</h3>

<ul>
<li>Basil (mainly sweet and Thai types) is the biggest herb crop at over
half a million pounds per year. </li>
</ul>

<p><a name="6"></a></p>

<h3>Where can I get herb seeds and plants?</h3>

<ul>
<li>Garden shops carry many herb seeds and plants. Seeds can also be ordered
by mail through many seed catalogs. </li>
</ul>

<p><a name="7"></a></p>

<h3>What kind of soil and fertilizer is best for most herbs?</h3>

<ul>
<li>Most garden soils that grow good vegetables or flowers will also grow
good herbs. Good drainage is essential for most herbs except for the few
which are aquatic or suited to paddy-type conditions. Good drainage can
be enhanced by growing herbs in raised beds or by amending the soil with
organic matter. As with most plants, extremes in soil acidity or alkalinity
may pose problems. Herbs are considered &quot;minor crops&quot; and their
fertility needs have not been as well studied as with agronomic crops such
as sugar cane and pineapple. However, work on the nutrient calibration
of herbs such as basil is being conducted at the College of Tropical Agriculture
and Human Resources. Many growers, even commercial growers, elect to grow
herbs using &quot;organic&quot; type fertilizers. Many feel that herbs
which are heavily fertilized are usable but their flavor or fragrance will
be reduced. </li>
</ul>

<p><a name="8"></a></p>

<h3>Can herbs be grown in containers?</h3>

<ul>
<li>Yes. Many herbs do very well in pots and containers. Use a porous growing
medium in pots for good drainage and air circulation. Commercial potting
mixes do well. Commonly used and easy to grow herbs for a window sill garden:
sweet basil or bush basil, Thai basil, oregano, garlic, Chinese chives,
chives, spearmint, thyme, and rosemary. If herbs such as basil, oregano,
mint and rosemary are not harvested intensively, prune back the foliage
occasionally to maintain a balance between the foliage and root system.
One pot of each herb will probably be adequate for most households. </li>
</ul>

<p><a name="9"></a></p>

<h3>What other tips can you give about growing herbs?</h3>

<ul>
<li>Keep basil flowers pruned off or harvested to encourage active growth.
</li>

<li>Do not over-water rosemary and tarragon.</li>

<li>Malathion, diazinon and chemical fungicides commonly used by home gardeners,
are not registered for use on herbs. &quot;Organic&quot; type insecticides
such as Safer Insecticidal Soap, MPede, Pyrenone Crop Spray, Pyrellin,
Dipel, Azatin EC, and Neemix can be used on many herbs. Remember to Read
the label and follow directions before using any pesticide.</li>

<li>Remember that no chemical fungicides are registered for use on herbs.
Be conscious about the different water needs of herbs when watering and
grouping herbs in containers. For example: Spearmint likes a lot of water
but rosemary should not be over-watered</li>
</ul>

<p><a name="10"></a></p>

<h3>What are some things which the College of Tropical Agriculture and
Human Resources have done for the herb industry, growers, and consumers?</h3>

<ul>
<li>has surveyed and identified the insect, mite, and disease pests of
herbs in Hawaii </li>

<li>is working on the breeding of Fusarium wilt resistant basil varieties
</li>

<li>is developing plant nutrient management guidelines (nutrient calibration
for basil in Hawaii) </li>

<li>has conducted trials on the use of compost for growing basil </li>

<li>is researching rootknot nematode management methods for basil </li>

<li>has published and disseminated basil publications for commercial growers
and home gardeners </li>

<li>has helped to develop the Farmer-Chef-Wholesaler Source Book </li>

<li>has developed an Herb Production Information Packet for new growers
</li>

<li>has been providing consultations for commercial growers and home gardeners
</li>

<li>has conducted classes on Growing and Using Herbs </li>

<li>has an Herb Garden at the Urban Garden Center which is open to the
public </li>

<li>is developing low-fat herb dishes </li>

<li>has insect, mite, and disease pest information in a data base called
Knowledge Master </li>

<li>has conducted irradiation tolerance trials for herbs </li>

<li>has conducted television presentations for home gardeners </li>

<H3>What are some of the common insect problems of basil?</H3>
<UL>
	<LI>Although over 30 species of insects and mites have been recorded from basil, it is easy to grow basil in the home garden.  Chinese rose beetles, spittle bugs, and slugs may cause occasional problems.  The presence of insects on herbs is a major problem to growers who export basil and other herbs to the U.S. Mainland.  Thrips, leafminers, leafhoppers, and aphids are frequently responsible for noncompliance with strict quarantine regulations.

</UL>
<P>

<A NAME="4">
<H3>What are some of the major diseases of basil in Hawaii?</H3>
<UL>
	<LI>Rootknot nematodes, Fusarium wilt, Colletotrichum leaf spot, and Corynespora leaf spot are some of the common diseases.  No chemical fungicides are registered for use on herbs.  One Cooperative Extension Service - Oahu County project is the development of Sweet and Thai basil varieties resistant to Fusarium wilt.

<P>

<A NAME="1">
<H3>Can I transplant bean plants?  I planted them too close, and wanted to transplant them to another row.  Is this possible?</H3>
<UL>
	<LI>Beans are rarely transplanted because their transplant recovery is slow.  It's faster to plant seeds because within a week they will germinate.

</UL>
<P>

<A NAME="2">
<H3>When is the best stage to harvest bean pods for seeds?</H3>
<UL>
	<LI>Let the bean pods turn brown and dry off of the vine.  Then shell the seeds and air dry a couple of days and store seeds in a refrigerator until planting.

</UL>
<P>

<A NAME="3">
<H3>Can melon fly attack beans and tomatoes?</H3>
<UL>
	<LI>Yes.  Melon flies do attack beans, tomatoes, eggplant, bell peppers, melons, squash, and other cucurbits.  They will attack over 80 different plants.

</UL>
<P>

<A NAME="4">
<H3>Will inoculating the bean seeds with nitrogen fixing bacteria help in the production of the crop?</H3>
<UL>
	<LI>Beans treated with nitrogen fixing bacteria normally will give good growth and good production in soils lacking this bacteria.  Most of our highly acid soils lack this bacteria.

</UL>
<P>

<A NAME="5">
<H3>I've noticed small yellow dots or specks on my bean leaves.  They are quite numerous.  Someone told me that they are caused by a virus.  Is this true?</H3>
<UL>
	<LI>These spots are probably a bean rust disease.  Hawaiian Wonder and Kentucky Wonderpole and most bush bean varieties are rust resistant.

</UL>
<P>

<A NAME="6">
<H3>I've found white pencil spots or dots on my bean leaves.  What's causing this?</H3>
<UL>
	<LI>The white pencil spots or dots may be caused by leafhoppers and are commonly called hopper burns.

</UL>
<P>

<A NAME="7">
<H3>I have lots of stink bugs on my bean vines.  The bean pods and leaves are discolored.  How can I control them?</H3>
<UL>
	<LI>Spraying with diazinon will control stink bugs.  Hand picking the stinkbugs during mid morning will reduce their populations.

</UL>
<P>

<A NAME="8">
<H3>Can beans be grown in the same place for two successive years?</H3>
<UL>
	<LI>Yes.  Beans can be grown in the same place for two successive years.  There after, planting other vegetables in rotation is advisable to reduce insect and disease problems. 

</UL>

</UL>
<P>

<A NAME="bush">
<H2><I>BUSH BEANS</I></H2>
<A NAME="bush1">
<H3>Our bush bean plants are wilting and dying.  I noticed that the stem area is swollen.  Is this a disease?</H3>
<UL>
	<LI>The bean plant is most likely affected with the bean fly larvae.  Spray with insecticides such as diazinon when the plants begin to germinate.  A 7- 10 day spray interval will generally assure you of a healthy growing plant.  Discontinue spraying when first signs of flowering appears.  Crop rotation by planting radishes or lettuce will also help.  As soon as the beans no longer produce pods, remove the plants immediately to reduce bean fly activity.

</UL>
<P>

<A NAME="bush2">
<H3>I would like to plant bush green beans.  Can you suggest a variety to plant?</H3>
<UL>
	<LI>A flat podded variety called Green Crop is commonly planted here in Hawaii.  Bountiful, Bush Romano, and Roma II are other flat potted varieties planted here. Tendercrop, Harvester and others are some of the round podded varieties.  These could be planted year round and requires about 50-60 days till maturity.  For flavorful but delicate plant growth cultivars, try some French filet types.

<A NAME="pole">
<H2><I>POLE BEANS</I></H2>
<A NAME="pole1">
<H3>I've heard about Manoa Wonder and Hawaiian Wonder pole beans bred for some disease resistance.   Could you tell me more about these bean varieties?</H3>
<UL>
	<LI>These two varieties were developed by the University of Hawaii Department of Horticulture for Hawaiian growing conditions.  The Hawaiian Wonder variety is resistant to rust and should be planted if rust is a problem.  The Manoa Wonder is the other variety which is not resistant to rust but is resistant to root knot nematode.  These two varieties do well on Oahu.

</UL>
<P>

<A NAME="pole2">
<H3>I noticed my Lualualei variety pole beans are developing brown rust-like appearance on the leaves.  What can I spray?  Some of the leaves are dropping off.</H3>
<UL>
	<LI>The brown crust like appearance on the Lualualei variety pole beans is more likely a rust. The Hawaiian Wonder variety which is resistant to rust is the suggest variety.  Plow Lualualei variety only during the summer months and avoid watering the leaves in the evening hours.

</UL>
<P>

<A NAME="pole3">
<H3>When do I stake the bean plants with bamboo poles?</H3>
<UL>
	<LI>It is necessary to stake the bean plants as soon as the true leaves and vine begins to form.  Stake the poles about 3" away from the bean plants.  Bamboo poles may be too smooth for climbing.

</UL>
<P>

<A NAME="pole4">
<H3>There are a few string beans on  my vines.  The vines are growing "wild" and beautiful.  Am I watering the plants too much?</H3>
<UL>
	<LI>Beans planted in rich, fertile soil produce lots of vegetative growth.  Using high nitrogen type fertilizer can also cause excessive growth.   Also thin plants to 8 to 12 inches apart.  Excess watering generally does not cause this problem.

<UL>
	<LI>Lima beans can be grown here but are not as popular with the islanders.  It requires 10-15 days longer to mature than the snap beans and does not produce as much.  Many people also frown on the thought of shelling the pods before cooking.  One of the best bush varieties is Fordhook 242.

</UL>
<P>

<A NAME="lima2">
<H3>When do I harvest lima beans?  Must I let the pods dry on the vine?</H3>
<UL>
	<LI>Lima beans are harvested when the pods are still green.  Avoid leaving the pods on the plant to dry.  The beans will swell slightly about 1/8 - 1/4" thick.

<HR>
<P>

<A NAME="1">
<H3>What variety of broccoli is best suited for home gardens?</H3>
<UL>
	<LI>Varieties such as Green Bud, DeCicco, Green Comet, Bonanza, Southern Comet, Packman and Galaxy are best suited for most of our Oahu gardens.

</UL>
<P>

<UL>
	<LI>Broccoli plants should be spaced about 18 inches apart and rows should be about 30 inches apart.

</UL>
<P>

<A NAME="2">
<H3>How do you apply fertilizer to broccoli?</H3>
<UL>
	<LI>Fertilize with a general garden fertilizer such as 10-30-10, applied during transplanting, 3 to 4 weeks after transplanting, and about 10 weeks after transplanting.  Additional nitrogen fertilizer may be necessary since broccoli requires a lot of nitrogen.

</UL>
<P>

<A NAME="3">
<H3>When do I harvest my broccoli?</H3>
<UL>
	<LI>Broccoli should be harvested before any flowers on the head opens.  The individual flowers will slowly open and turn yellow if it is harvested a little late.

</UL>
<P>

<A NAME="4">
<H3>Is possible to harvest the main broccoli head and expect more side shoots to develop, consequently more broccoli heads?</H3>
<UL>
	<LI>Broccoli should be harvested by cutting the stalk well below the head diagonally, with a clean knife.  Avoid breaking them off or cutting the stalk flat since this might cause water to accumulate and harbor organisms leading to rot within the stem.  Lateral shoots will develop and smaller broccoli heads will develop on most early maturing varieties.

</UL>
<P>

<A NAME="5">
<H3>My broccoli fails to form a head.  What's the problem?</H3>
<UL>
	<LI>It is possible that a wrong variety was planted.  Warm season varieties such as DeCicco, Greenbud and Green Comet should do well in the Honolulu area.

</UL>
<P>

<A NAME="6">
<H3>My broccoli heads are only 3 inches in diameter and there are yellow flowers on the head.  What is wrong with the broccoli?</H3>
<UL>
	<LI>Broccoli is ready for harvest when the heads, whether large or small, are well developed, compact and buds unopened.  The appearance of yellow petals (in your instance, yellow flowers) in the head show over maturity.

</UL>
<P>

<A NAME="7">
<H3>Does broccoli need to be blanched?</H3>
<UL>
	<LI>No.  Broccoli does not need to be blanched like cauliflower.

</UL>
<P>

<A NAME="8">
<H3>My broccoli leaves are being eaten by a caterpillar.  They just leave the green midribs.  What's attacking the broccoli and how do I control them?</H3>
<UL>
	<LI>Broccoli leaves are commonly found with cabbage looper and imported cabbage worm eating the leaves.  If you only have a dozen plants or so, you can examine the plants on a regular basis and pick off the caterpillars.  The cabbage worms' color is very similar to the midribs of broccoli, and that is where you can often find them.  If you have more plants or can not find the caterpillars spray or dust with carbaryl weekly, especially treating the undersurface of the leaves.

</UL>
<P>

<A NAME="9">
<H3>Is there a vegetable called Chinese broccoli?</H3>
<UL>
	<LI>Chinese broccoli or Chinese kale is the Kailaan.  The plant is harvested just as the white flower begins to open.  The cultural requirements are similar to broccoli and mustard cabbage.

<H3>When is the best time to plant Chinese cabbage?</H3>
<UL>
	<LI>Chinese cabbages are planted year round at elevations above 1,500 ft. for most varieties.   In general below 2,000 ft. they can be planted only during November-February. For low elevation growing the tropically adapted varieties Tropical Delight, Tropicana, Tropical Pride and Saladeer will produce satisfactorily.

<H3>Why are there no root development on my carrots?  The top grows green and lush but no carrots.</H3>
<UL>
	<LI>The climatic conditions here on Oahu is a little too warm for growing good carrots.  It will not be as sweet as mainland carrots but may have a strong, undesirable flavor.  It is, however, possible to grow carrots but good size root formation will take 3 1/2 - 4 months from planting.  Lush top growth and no carrots usually is caused by over fertilization with commercial fertilizers or animal manures containing high nitrogen.

<A NAME="1">
<H3>Should I remove the side shoots arising from the base of the corn plant?</H3>
<UL>
	<LI>Side shoots are generally removed so that larger ears of corn are produced from the main stalk.
</UL>
<P>

<A NAME="2">
<H3>Only a few kernels of corn have developed on my corn ears.  The kernels are also sporadic on the ear.  What's wrong with the ears?</H3>
<UL>
	<LI>Corn ears with few kernels are caused mainly by poor pollination.  Avoid planting corn in one straight row.  Plant several rows or plant in a concentric circle.  This will insure better pollination.  Also avoid planting corn in an extremely windy area.  Another reason may be because of dry weather, slowing silking after the tassels have shed most of their pollen, thus kernels are not pollinated. 

</UL>
<P>

<A NAME="3">
<H3>How do we determine the proper stage to harvest sweet corn?</H3>
<UL>
	<LI>Sweet corn is harvested about 7O-85 days after planting in Hawaii. It is not easy to determine the proper harvest stage.  Immature ears are tasteless, and over mature ears may be starchy and tough.  Look for the brownish silks which have not yet dried and feel the ear for a well filled tip.  You might peel back a bit of husk looking for yellow kernels.  Using your thumbnail, burst a kernel and if it spatters open, it is the right stage for sweet corn. Some people prefer to harvest at a "soft dough" stage, especially with the supersweet corn.

<A NAME="insects2">
<H3>What are the tiny tannish-brown insects that congregate near the sheaths of the stem of the growing corn plant?</H3>
<UL>
	<LI>The small tannish-brown insects found on growing corn are called plant hoppers. These plant hoppers suck the plant juice of corn and often transmit viruses from one plant to another.  The results are shorter, stunted corn plants with yellow or white streaked leaves and may tassel and fruit at about 2-3 feet tall.  Corn ears will be extremely small and almost unworthy to keep. These affected plants should be destroyed immediately.

<A NAME="insects3">
<H3>The corn plants in my vegetable garden are being eaten up by termites. What can I do about this?</H3>

<A NAME="insects4">
<H3>I have brownish caterpillars in my corn ears.  Are these the corn earworm and if so, how can I control them?</H3>
<UL>
	<LI>These insects are called corn earworm and could be controlled by insecticidal sprays such as carbaryl.  Spray immediately after silks appear at 3-day intervals 3-4 times. Another way to prevent corn ear worm is to drop mineral oil in the ear of the corn.  Also, the tight husked Hawaiian varieties and hybrids do give some control from corn earworm damage.

	<LI>Popcorn can be planted here on Oahu.  Avoid planting in late fall to early spring.  Some varieties include Burpee's Peppy Hybrid and Creme Puff Hybrid.  Note:  Do not plant popcorn and sweet corn at the same time, as cross pollination will cause all sorts of different kernels to develop on the ear.

<A NAME="varieties2">
<H3>I've heard people say plant only University of Hawaii varieties of sweet corn. Can I plant mainland varieties and still have a successful crop?</H3>
<UL>
	<LI>Sure, it is possible, however mainland corn seeds are not resistant to tropical diseases, pests and climate.  If you plan to plant mainland varieties it is recommended that you plant them only for summer.  Some of the varieties include Golden Cross Bantam, Jubilee, Honey, and Pearl.

<H3>I noticed some of my cucumbers with a noticeable depression with a minute hole in the center.  Are these caused by insects?  There is a slight brown discoloration inside the fruit too.</H3>
<UL>
	<LI>This symptom described is caused by melon fly attacking the fruit.  A regular insect spray schedule helps prevent build-up of insects.  Bagging the young fruit soon after pollination with newspaper or brown paper sack may help control melon fly damage.

</UL>
<P>

<A NAME="fruit3">
<H3>Why do my cucumbers taste bitter?</H3>

<A NAME="leaf2">
<H3>My beautiful cucumber leaves have white pencil-like trail lines on them. What do I do with this problem?</H3>
<UL>
	<LI>The pencil-like trails found on your cucumber leaves are caused by leaf miner activity.  These insects tunnel their way through to the two layers on the leaf.  Parasites effectively control leaf miners.  Avoid excess spraying with insecticides such as diazinon, which are quite harsh on the parasites.

<A NAME="1">
<H3>Is the Anuenue lettuce the same as Manoa lettuce?  It looks alike to me.</H3>
<UL>
	<LI>The Manoa lettuce, also known as Green Mignonette, is a mainland variety that does well in Honolulu.  The Anuenue lettuce which has curlier leaves compared to the Manoa lettuce, is a cross between Green Mignonette (Manoa) and Great lakes.  Both of these lettuce varieties do quite well in home gardens.  Another vareity called Manoa Special is a selection of Green Mignonette with a more compact head.

</UL>
<P>

<A NAME="2">
<H3>Why does my lettuce taste bitter?</H3>
<UL>
	<LI>Lettuce grown under high temperatures and slow growth will become bitter. It will do satisfactorily when temperatures are below 75o.

</UL>
<P>

<A NAME="3">
<H3>Many of my young lettuce seedlings are eaten at its base.  The top portion of the seedling is laid on the ground.  What can I do about this?</H3>
<UL>
	<LI>One of the most common pests of lettuce is the cutworm.  To control it, spray the soil with malathion or a similar insecticide before seedlings emerge.  A non-chemical way of controlling the cutworms is to bury a styrofoam cup about 2 - 3 inches in the soil, then planting lettuce transplants into the container. Also you can dig into the soil to find the brownish green caterpillars and destroy them.  

</UL>
<P>

<A NAME="4">
<H3>There are many slugs and snails in my lettuce bed.  Are there any chemicals to control them?</H3>
<UL>
	<LI>Slugs and snails can be controlled by metaldehyde baits or similar baits cleared for vegetable use around the lettuce plantings.  You can also try trapping them or using various organic baits.  The use  of sharp sand around the perimeter of the garden, and copper strips as borders are just a few of the many ways of preventing snails from entering the garden.

</UL>
<P>

<A NAME="5">
<H3>Can I use chicken manure prior to planting my lettuce?</H3>
<UL>
	<LI>Lettuce responds satisfactorily when chicken manure is incorporated into the soil prior to planting.  It does best when there is high organic matter content in the soil.

</UL>
<P>

<A NAME="6">
<H3>Why does my Manoa lettuce fail to form a head?  The leaves are extremely loose.</H3>
<UL>
	<LI>The plants are either too crowded, growing in the shade or lacking fertilizer. Grow in full sunlight, spaced 5-6 inches apart between plants and apply l0-30-10 or 10-20-20 fertilizer at transplanting or thinning.

<A NAME="1">
<H3>Can you plant green onions bought from the grocery store? How long does it take to mature after planting them?</H3>
<UL>
	<LI>Green onions bought from the store can be planted in rich organic soil. They can be harvested after 50 - 60 days after planting.  The entire plant could be harvested or a selected few leaves removed at a time.

</UL>
<P>

<A NAME="2">
<H3>What is rakkyo and how is it grown?</H3>
<UL>
	<LI>Rakkyo is a relative of the onions and is grown similar to the shallots by sprouting bulblet or set.  A single bulb will divide into several tillers and the small bulbs are then harvested.  October - February is the best time to plant.  The single bulblet will divide to form several stalks.  Each stalk will form a bulblet  during July or August and the tops will dry down. It takes approximately 8 - 10 months from planting to harvest.

</UL>
<P>

<A NAME="3">
<H3>The tips of my green onions turn brown.  There are many pencil-like trails on the leaves.  Eventually, the leaves wilt and fall over.  What's causing this?</H3>
<UL>
	<LI>A heavy infestation of leaf miners probably is causing this problem. Avoid regular spraying of an insecticide as this may increase infestation.  Predators and parasites in most cases effectively control this pest.

</UL>
<P>

<A NAME="4">
<H3>Do onions respond to heavy applications of manure?</H3>
<UL>
	<LI>Yes.  Apply well decomposed manure before planting and work into soil.

</UL>
<P>

<A NAME="5">
<H3>Why do the leaves of the green onions bend over?</H3>
<UL>
	<LI>This condition is usually caused by onion moth infestation and in some cases by inadequate complete plant nutrients.

</UL>
<P>

<A NAME="6">
<H3>My green onions fail to divide or multiply.  Am I using the right type of fertilizer?</H3>
<UL>
	<LI>You probably seeded the non-multiplying type of green onion.  The multiplying type of green onion grown locally is planted from divisions (sets).

<H3>Why do my peanut plants fail to develop pods?  I've fertilized them.</H3>
<UL>
	<LI>Peanuts prefer loose sandy soil.  Mound the soil around the plants after flowering.  This loose soil mounded around the peanut plants will aid the pollinated flowers in pegging into the soil, to develop into peanuts.

<UL>
	<LI>The sweet potato weevil is a bluish orange insect and does damage to sweet potatoes.  They bore into the tubers affecting the quality by making the tubers bitter.  It is very important to control this weevil by spraying with an insecticide such as carbaryl.  It is also advisable to start with clean, uninfested cuttings, clean field free of volunteer sweet potatoes and spray the base of the vines regularly, about once in 3 - 4 weeks.

	<LI>Sweet  potatoes can be planted either through the sprouting tubers or slips (tip cuttings of vine about 8 - 12 inches long).  The latter method is generally used.

</UL>
<P>

<A NAME="sweet5">
<H3>Is there a variety of sweet potato called Nancy Hall?</H3>
<UL>
	<LI>Yes, there is a sweet potato variety called Nancy Hall, a baking type with deep yellow flesh.  The Kona B, Iliula and Onolena, all orange-fleshed baking types, are better adapted for local growing.  Most people grow the Okinawa types.

</UL>
<P>

<A NAME="sweet6">
<H3>Are all sweet potato vines edible?</H3>
<UL>
	<LI>Most of the commercial or home grown sweet potato vines are edible.

<A NAME="sweet7">
<H3>I found a large green-yellow caterpillar in my sweet potato patch.  It was about 4 inches long and ugly with brown stripes on the body with a horn at the tail end.  What is it?</H3>
<UL>
	<LI>This large caterpillar is the tomato horn worm.  It is the larva of the Sphinx moth and feeds on many plants.

</UL>
<P>

<A NAME="sweet8">
<H3>The sweet potato leaves have brown rusty spots and are distorted and stunted.  It has affected mainly the new shoots.  What is causing it to become like this?</H3>
<UL>
	<LI>The sweet potato vine distortion is caused by the spot anthracnose fungus which can be controlled by not planting sweet potatoes for a year or two on the same land.  Plant disease-free cuttings.

</UL>
<P>

<A NAME="sweet9">
<H3>I heard that dursban is good to control ants in the sweet potato patch.  Is it safe?</H3>
<UL>
	<LI>Dursban effectively control ants; however, it is not cleared by the Environmental Protection Agency for use on sweet potato.

</UL>
<P>

<A NAME="sweet10">
<H3>No potato tubers have developed within my plantings.  Only vines are growing. Am I not using the right type of fertilizer?</H3>
<UL>
	<LI>Your soil may be too high in organic matter, thus causing excessive vine growth.  10-30-10 or 10-20-20 fertilizer should be used at low rates.  Some varieties of sweet potatoes require vine turning about once a month to prevent rooting of vines wherever they touch moist soil.  Also certain varieties will not produce tubers during the winter season.

<UL>
	<LI>A screen or net above the sprouting plants will prevent birds from attacking your plants.  Occasionally scarecrows, and aluminum pie pans will scare the birds away temporarily.  Placing a Styrofoam cup with a hole cut on the bottom of the cup on top of the plant until the plants are about 4-6" tall may also help.

<A NAME="1">
<H3>My tomato blossoms seem to constantly drop off.  I particularly noticed it  during periods with warm nights.  Do tomatoes prefer a cool climate?</H3>
<UL>
	<LI>Tomato blossoms will set better with cool night temperatures.  It drops its flowers more during warm night temperatures.

</UL>
<P>

<A NAME="2">
<H3>My tomatoes have extensive leaf damage caused by leaf miners.  Can I control these creatures?</H3>
<UL>
	<LI>Leaf miners are difficult to control.  There are biological parasites controlling these leaf miners but it may be necessary to spray an insecticide such as diazinon to control them.  Apply spray at least once in 5-7 days.  Note that applications of the pesticide may also kill the biological parasites.

</UL>
<P>

<A NAME="3">
<H3>There are many small insects clinging on the new shoots on my tomato plants. They are black in color and hardly move.  I can squash them easily with my fingers since they are very  soft.  How can I get rid of these insects?</H3>
<UL>
	<LI>These insects are called aphids or plant lice which suck on plant juice. They also can transmit virus and immediate control is necessary by spraying with an insecticide such as malathion or diazinon.  You might also control any ant activity nearby since ants live symbiotically with the aphids.

</UL>
<P>

<A NAME="4">
<H3>Can I use the plastic vegetable sacks or wax paper bags to bag my developing  tomatoes from melon fly infestation?</H3>
<UL>
	<LI>If bagging is necessary, use cloth bags or paper sack or newspaper instead of plastic bags.  Plastic bags and wax paper bags build humidity within the bag and generally cause fruits to decay.

</UL>
<P>

<A NAME="5">
<H3>What do they mean by indeterminate and determinate varieties of tomato?</H3>
<UL>
	<LI>Indeterminate - the growing point does not end in a flower cluster.  These are the staking or trellising tomatoes.  Determinate - the growing point ends in a flower cluster.  These are the bush type of tomatoes.

</UL>
<P>

<A NAME="6">
<H3>There are many thorny, brownish-black insects on the stems of my tomato and pepper plants.  What are they and how do I get rid of them?</H3>
<UL>
	<LI>The insect attacking your tomato is known as the solonaceous treehopper.  It attacks the stems of tomato, pepper, eggplant, poha and other plants in the same family as tomato.  Spray as little as possible with malathion or diazinon, concentrating mainly on the stems.  Make sure the crop is listed on the pesticide label and follow the directions it gives.

</UL>
<P>

<A NAME="7">
<H3>Should I bag my tomatoes till I harvest them?</H3>
<UL>
	<LI>Recommend that tomatoes remain covered with a bag till harvesting.  This will protect the fruits from melon fly infestations.

</UL>
<P>

<A NAME="8">
<H3>What causes the tomato to crack near the stem end?</H3>
<UL>
	<LI>These are growth cracks which may result when sufficient moisture is not available to the plants at all times during fruit development.

</UL>
<P>

<A NAME="9">
<H3>The blossom end of my tomatoes seem to turn black and rot.  What causes this to happen?</H3>
<UL>
	<LI>This blossom end rot is caused by a lack of calcium in the soils.  Excessive amounts of fertilizer, particularly nitrogen, and insufficient or irregular watering can increase blossom end rot.  Liming the soil will help prevent this problem.

</UL>
<P>

<A NAME="10">
<H3>I noticed that my tomato fruits are yellowish-white in color and are mottled. Also the young leaves have slight black discoloration on them.  Someone told me that this is a tomato virus.  What is this?</H3>
<UL>
	<LI>The description sounds like a spotted wilt virus on the tomato.  Another cause can be from a white fly infestation.

</UL>
<P>

<A NAME="11">
<H3>Can tomatoes be harvested green?</H3>
<UL>
	<LI>Yes, tomatoes may be harvested in the mature green stage when a gel has formed around the seeds.  Since it is difficult to determine this stage, it is best to harvest at the breaking stage when a reddish color appears on the bottom of the fruits.

</UL>
<P>

<A NAME="12">
<H3>What are some of the cherry tomato varieties?</H3>
<UL>

<P>
Project Objectives:<p>
<DL>
	<DD>To develop a kit of resource materials for families, which focus on optimizing the care and development of children from birth to five years of age.<p>

	To bring together information and practice from relevant disciplinary fields and develop
	educational materials which can be understood by and are attractive to families.<p>

	To develop culturally sensitive resource materials that will increase the knowledge of parents and other care givers regarding optimal child care and development.<p>
</DL>

<P>
Methodology:<p>
<DL>
	<DD>An interdisciplinary team is collaborating to develop a comprehensive set of  resource
	materials that are family-friendly and culturally sensitive.  Growth and development, nutrition, health and safety, family life and resource management issues and topics are addressed.  The finished print materials will be capable of high quality, inexpensive reproduction to facilitate wide-spread distribution to participants in targeted programs.  The kits will be translated into three different languages.
	<P>
     	<DD>The project is relying heavily on partnership with parents and community program
	providers to identify priority topics and to assure that materials reflect family and community needs.   Parents (including teen parents and immigrant parents) and family services providers representing a range of ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds participated in focus groups and a survey in the initial stages of the project.  These same families and providers will assist in the field tests of the materials.

<title>Center on the Family:  Family Adaptation to Occupational Loss</title>
</HEAD>

<body>

<FONT SIZE=6><I>Family Adaptation to Occupational Loss</I></FONT>
<HR>

<B>Project Summary</B><P>

In October 1994, the Center on the Family received a grant from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to study the effects of occupational loss on workers and their families.  The study focuses on local families affected by the sugar plantation closings and aims to: 1) describe the extent of economic, personal, and familial changes associated with the closings; 2) identify personal and family resources and coping strategies which serve as protective mechanisms during these times; 3) identify risk factors that render families vulnerable to the pathogenic effects of occupational loss; and, 4) assess community services and benefits available to plantation families.<p>

Interview data have been gathered on 126 families of Hawaiian, Japanese, Portuguese, and Filipino ancestry, from the Hamakua, Hilo Coast and Ka'u communities on the Big Island.  Targets of the study include two adults who are either married or living together as domestic partners, and where applicable, one child, 10 - 18 years of age.  At least one of the adults was employed by a plantation company or had been laid off within 18 months of interview data collection date.<p>

Five broad constructs relevant to family functioning will be assessed.  These constructs are:  1) family economic strain; 2) community risk factors; 3) prior personal and family risk factors; 4) current personal and family resources; and, 5) current personal and family adjustment.  Much of the data were collected using a structured family interview.  Families were also videotaped discussing the effects of the plantation closings on their lives and advice to other families.  Archival data from the medical and school records of participants are currently being collected to measure family risks and adjustment.  Differences between the employed and unemployed groups will be assessed, along with the combined effect of economic strain and community, family, and individual risks and resources on adjustment to occupational loss.<p>

Beginning in the Fall of 1996, findings will be disseminated to families and the communities at town meetings and through printed materials.  Informational pamphlets also be available for families in other communities experiencing the difficulties of unemployment.  Findings will also be presented to researchers, social service providers, and policy-makers at conferences and through professional publications.  The goal is to increase understanding of the difficulties of unemployment, and to provide new insights about the strengths and strategies that families have used to successfully cope with this tragic event.  Findings are expected to help professionals design more family-friendly public policies and better support programs.<p>

Hawai'i Kids Count was established in 1994 to improve the well-being of Hawai'i's
children and their families by increasing public awareness of their condition and serving as a catalyst for positive actions on their behalf.  The strategies employed by the project are:
<ul>
	<li>establishing and maintaining a data base of information which accurately  describe the status of children in Hawai'i;
	<li>monitoring Hawai'i's progress regarding children and families by tracking      key indicators over time; 
	<li>developing and publicizing analyses of specific issues important to Hawai'i's children and families; 
	<li>strengthening the constituency for children through information and training;
	<li>linking with the national Kids Count network, which provides access to resources, technical expertise and knowledge of kids in other states.
</ul>

<p>
The project is directed by a public/private partnership of the Hawai'i Community Services Council, the Governor's Office of Children and Youth, and the Center on the Family of the University of Hawai'i at Manoa.  It is primarily funded by a four-year $400,000 grant from the Annie E. Casey Foundation.

Tests and final<br>
<u>Grade point at end of the semester must be: </u><br>
3.6 and above for an A or 3.5 plus extra credit for an A; <br>
2.6 and above for a B or 2.5 plus extra credit for a B; <br>
1.6 and above for a C or 1.5 plus extra credit for a C.<p>
</ul>
<center><b>Attendance and weekly reflections on caucus</b>  15%</center><p>

Attendance is required. Each day is recorded as follows:<ul>

<li>4.0 for timely presence and active discussion in class and within caucus.
<li>3.0 for timely presence and some discussion
<li>2.0 for timely presence and inactivity or tardy presence
<li>1.0 for phoning, email, or written explanation of absence 
<li>0   for unexplained absence
</ul>
Each student is to enter at least one item and one response for each week 2 through 15 on 
the caucus labelled for that week.
<p>
<center><b>Outline of 7 chapters McClure & Teyber</b>  7%</center><p>

This material should help to illustrate various stressors in a cross cultural context as well as 
solutions to the stressors. Each student must outline each of 7 chapters (3,4,5,7,9,12,13) of the 
McClure & Teyber text and turn this in early or no later than the <b>due</b> date. It is 
always appropriate to stay ahead of schedule. Each summary should include  key  concepts 
of theory and knowledge plus application of the theory to the specific client. Use any 
format that is comfortable and creative for you.
<p>
<center><b>Dynamics in Patterson</b>  2%</center><p>

Trace the dynamics, symptoms or clues for Elena, Ricardo, Terri, Chris, Carlo, and Rosa. 
Write a simple, running commentary which combines your own suspicions as well as 
material from this semester's coursework. Use any format that is comfortable and creative 
for you
<p>	
<center><b>Outline of 6 chapters Sorensen</b>  6%</center><p>

This material should be  helpful in planning for the 2 papers. Each student must outline 
each chapter of the Sorensen text and turn this in early or no later than the <b>due</b> 
date. It is always appropriate to stay ahead of schedule. Each summary should include  key 
ideas and concepts, findings, and/or research methods. Sorensen is the model for each 
research project. Use any format that is comfortable and creative for you.
<p>
<center><b>Two papers</b>   50%</center><p>

Select one family stressor to explore from 1) a child's view, 2) an adult's view. Use the 
Sorensen text as an example of research methods.
<p>
Develop your own research on the family stressor from published data and from your 
independent field research for each paper. Conduct your own research in a responsible 
manner.
<p>
All students are required to participate in the PEER REVIEW sessions for each paper.
<p>
Papers turned in early or on time may be rewritten for a better grade. Attach the original, 
graded paper with each revision.
<p>
Write  at least 10 pages total, 5 for the child's view of the stressor and 5 for the adult's view 
of the stressor. Each paper should use 5 primary sources of published research (5 different 
primary sources for each paper) plus  substantial field data independently collected. Use 
format of the American Psychological Association 4th edition for citations and references. 
Write in third person, scientific language. The Sorensen text is an example of this format. 
<p>
Primary sources are those published in professional journals or books which are written 
and analyzed by the family scientist. The Sorensen text lists a number of references which 
could be starting points for exploration.
<p>
Field data for each paper should include 5 independent interviews, or 20 surveys with a 
simple format, or content analysis of 20 creations of children and adults. These are only 
examples of the kinds of field data a student might collect in order to pursue new knowledge 
on the family stressor being studied. 
<p>
<center><b>Tests and final</b> 20%</center><p>
The first test (10%) is to be a complete statement of family stressor and child's perspective 
chosen for independent research with an outline of methodology and resources. This is a 
<u>plan of action</u> for completing the first required paper. The more detailed the plan, 
the higher the grade.
<p>
The second test (10%) is to be a complete statement of family stressor and adult's perspective 
chosen for independent research with an outline of methodology and resources. This is a 
<u>plan of action</u> for completing the second required paper. The more detailed the plan, 
the higher the grade.  
<p>
The final exam (10%) is a two page <u>comparison and integration</u> of the two research 
papers. The adult and child perspectives should be compared. Implications for future 
research, implications for prevention programming, and/or summary conclusions may be 
involved. This is a final commentary on your own research work, written in formal, 
scientific language, using APA 4th edition format.  It is <b>due</b> no later than the last 
minute of the time assigned for the final exam.
<p>

<center><b>Extra credit</b></center>
<p>
Extra credit may be earned by arranging for a guest speaker, extra video presentation, or 
other activity prearranged with the teacher. Extra credit helps a borderline grade at the 
end of the semester, e.g. 3.5 moves up to an A, 2.5 moves up to a B, 1.5 moves up to a C with 
extra credit.  Automatic extra credit is earned for offering an international perspective on 
any issues, using professional references from another country in another language, or 
including issues and findings from the State legislature or U.S. Congress.
<p>
<center><b>Independent, scholarly work required</b></center><p>
Intellectual honesty and scholarly pursuit as designated in the University policy on 
plagiarism will be followed. Each person is expected to do independent, creative research on 
all assignments.
<p>
	<b>There is no excuse for any assignment being late.  Only a doctor's 
note will be considered for unusual circumstances.</b><p>

Seven papers</B> should address topics which spark your curiosity and inspire
you to seek new knowledge. Topic selections and plans for each paper should
be submitted in writing by the third week on January 29, 1997. This statement
constitutes each student's personal contract for 45% of the course grade.
<BR>
Each assignment requires personal observation and/or interview representing
one of two choices: <BR>
<B>1) Seven stages.</B> Select one stage of human development from any one
of the textbook chapters. Select three topics or ideas from that chapter.
Observe and/or interview a person from that stage of development and look
especially for the three topics or ideas you have chosen. Compare the observation/interview
with what is stated in the chapter and other published research. Do this
seven times.<BR>
<B>2) One stage, seven cultures, races or ethnicities.</B> Select one stage
of human development from any one of the textbook chapters. Select three
topics or ideas from that chapter. Compare the observation/interview with
what is stated in the chapter and other published research. Stay with the
same stage and make each observation/interview with a person from a different
culture, race, or ethnicity. Do this seven times. <BR>
Each paper should be one, typewritten, double-spaced page in length. Each
must be written in consistent, third person, formal perspective. This is
not negotiable.<BR>
Papers turned in early or on time may be rewritten for a better grade. All
rewrites are due as soon as possible but no later than the last day of class.
Submit the original graded paper with the rewrite.<BR>
Use of a personal editor or proofreader will save time and grief. A paper
with more than three typos or blatant grammar or spelling errors will automatically
earn a lower grade.<BR>
Scholarly research of the literature should be integrated. Use the standard
format for citations and references of the American Psychological Association
Fourth Edition. Use the textbook as a model if in doubt. <BR>
	Papers will be graded as follows:</FONT></P>

<UL>
  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000">A <B>C paper </B>covers the basics (stage of human
  development, three topics, one observation/interview) with citations from
  the textbook and a straightforward narrative.</FONT>
  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000">A <B>B paper</B> includes the above and adds at
  least one primary reference from books or professional journals to augment
  the findings. Primary sources are original research by the author cited,
  rather than textbooks or summaries. Newspaper accounts, popular news magazines,
  encyclopedias, or secondary sources can be used, but will not count as
  the additional outside reference because they are not primary sources.
  </FONT>
  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000">An <B>A paper</B> includes above and adds creative
  and scholarly thinking, suggesting new ideas, problems or perspectives.
  These papers have been edited and proofread.</FONT>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>
Attendance is required.</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"> Each contribution
to class discussion adds dimension and content to the course. Practice speaking
up in class. Each day, points are earned as follows:<BR>
4 points - present, participating, actively involved<BR>
3 points - tardy and participating<BR>
2 points - just there or substantially tardy<BR>
1 point - absence accounted for via a handwritten, signed note with explanation.<BR>
0 points - absent and unaccounted for<BR>
<B><BR>
Tests</B> include multiple choice, true/false, matching, and short essay
answer formats. If, for any reason, a student is absent from a test, the
student may take the test later and earn a maximum of one-half credit.<BR>
<B><BR>
Extra credit</B> will help a borderline grade (3.5, 2.5, or 1.5). NO extra
credit will be applied until all required assignments have been completed.
Extra credit can be earned through a) arranging for a guest speaker, b)
making a special presentation on a relevant topic, c) presenting a relevant
video, d) writing an extra paper, e) using research from other countries,
i.e. an international perspective.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Each student should obtain and use an email address.</B> Email will be
used to make course announcements in between each Wednesday class meeting.
Email will also make it easier for students to talk with the lecturere and
teaching assistant.<BR>
<BR>
<B>University policy on plagiarism</B> will be followed. Each person is
expected to do independent, creative research on all assignments and activities.</FONT>

</UL>
There is a bonus of 2 extra credit points for perfect attendance!!
<P>
Participation includes investment and involvement in class discussions, "family" discussions, family projects, and keeping up with text reading (the text material may or may not always be included in class work or lectures, <B>BUT</B> the student is always responsible for the assigned reading).
<P>
Please practice speaking up in class--a necessity as you continue on in whatever career you might choose.  Your input is valuable whether you are agreeing, disagreeing, challenging, questioning, commenting, seeking clarification or  (<B>especially</B>) sharing your personal experiences.  Please be sensitive to those students who are naturally shy and may not feel comfortable competing for attention--in other words, let's hear from everyone, not just a few.
<P>
<B><U>Quizzes, midterm and final exams</U></B> will consist primarily of multiple choice questions but may also contain other forms of questions.  Exams and quizzes cannot be made up except for <B>extenuating circumstances</B> (e.g., illness <B>verified</B> by a doctor). You <B>must</B> contact the instructor <B>prior</B> to the exam or quiz in order to be excused.
<P>
<B>Journals</B>, although not required, are highly recommended for  several reasons:
	<UL>
<LI>reaction/response to handouts (must be comprehensive article--not a poem, cartoon or short article /column.
<LI>extensive comments on text reading
<LI>in-depth reviews of class experiences
<LI>capacious reflections on  class "family" relationships and interactions
<LI><B>earning one (1) extra point (maximum four [4]) each time a journal entry is submitted to instructor periodically throughout the semester.  </B> 
</UL>
<B><U>Survival Cards</U></B>  are 5 X 8 (no other size allowed) index cards on which students make notes on both sides from their daily text reading.  They cannot be used for classroom notetaking and must be turned in at the <U><B>beginning</B></U> of each class period.  Survival cards are a <B>win-win</B> opportunity.  Students are forced to keep up with the course reading, instructor enjoys "prepared" students <B>and students get to use Survival Cards on Midterms and Finals!  </B>  
<P>
There will opportunities for extra credit that can help a borderline grade, <U>but will only be applied after <B>all</B>  required work is completed.</U>   
 <P>
<B>Students are responsible for knowing and understanding the University of Hawaii's policy and expectation regarding academic honesty as published in the General Catalog.   Cheating and plagiarism are serious offenses. </B>

<P>

<B><U>CRITERIA FOR PAPERS</U></B><P>

Writing assignments have a two-fold purpose: facilitate mastery of course content and give students ample writing practice in order to learn/hone skills that will be beneficial in all of life's endeavors.  Writing consists of several in-class and at-home assignments, as well as one short interview/research paper (2 1/2 minimum-3 pages maximum) and an end-of-semester Learning Assessment paper that is an important part of the Learning Log.   Specific topics will be assigned and discussed in class.
<P>
<B>The first paper requires a <U>typed, finish-quality</U> draft (using a pseudonym) to be reviewed by peers</B>.  Exchanging anonymous drafts with other students is an excellent, non-threatening  method of obtaining input on good and bad aspects of a student's paper; in addition, students are exposed to other students' writing styles.  The opportunity for students to have their drafts critiqued, proofread, and edited is an extremely important process toward producing better quality papers.  Accordingly, an <B>on-time draft automatically earns 2 points</B>.   These 2 points count toward the final paper grade of 20 points. Each student's input on a peer's draft is valuable; therefore, attendance is crucial. Students who <B>must</B> miss a draft-review class for <B>extenuating circumstances</B> should notify the instructor prior to class.  Under such circumstances, drafts may still be submitted in absentia for class peer review.
<P>
<B>Late papers are penalized 1 point per day including weekends</B>.   Please see instructor for submission of late papers. 
<P>
Always use double-spaced typing with at least 1" margins-top, bottom, left and right.  A cover page is required and should have the title of the paper, author's name, course name and number, instructor's name and date (a sample will be distributed in class).  Please keep a copy of all submitted writing.  American Psychological Association (APA) writing style is preferred; a handout will be available in class. 
<P>
<B>One  (1) point<U> each</U> will be deducted from the grade for excessive errors in typing, spelling, punctuation and grammar.</B> <U> Proofreading by someone who writes well is important. </U>
<P>
It is strongly recommended that students take advantage of UH writing services (e.g., Critique Lab in Kuykendall).   <B>Your instructor is always ready and willing during office hours and by appointment on Tuesdays and Thursdays to help you with  EARLY drafts.</B>
<P>


<B>Papers are worth 20 points each and will be graded in terms of various factors:</B>
 <UL>
<LI>research involved
<LI>research/method appropriateness
<LI>effort
<LI>thoroughness of search (i.e., success in finding <U>suitable</U> sources)
<LI>depth of analysis and discussion (i.e., thinking)
<LI>comprehensiveness of results
<LI>evidence of learning/understanding
<LI>overall writing quality (i.e., clarity and organization)
<LI>mechanics (i.e., grammar, spelling and neatness)
</UL>
We are working on a point system; the breakdown is as follows:
<P>
<TABLE>
<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD><B><U>19-20</TD><TD WIDTH=5></TD><TD>"Excellent" (i.e., the work far exceeds both the expectations and requirements of the assignment)</TD></TR>

<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD><B><U>14-16</TD><TD WIDTH=5></TD><TD>"Average" (i.e., the work fulfills, completely and in a scholarly manner, the requirements of the assignment)</TD></TR>
<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD><B><U>12-13</TD><TD WIDTH=5></TD><TD>"Below average" (i.e., the work fails to fulfill some requirements of the assignment or was not completed in a scholarly manner, but deserves some credit.</TD></TR>
<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD><B><U>11 or below</TD><TD WIDTH=5></TD><TD>"No credit" (i.e., the work fails to meet requirements) </TD></TR>
</TABLE><P>	 
Questions to consider for students striving to earn the highest grades:
<OL>
<LI>Did I narrow my subject down (i.e., is it appropriate for a paper of this length?)?
<LI>Did I cover my subject adequately?
<LI>Is the writing clear and concise?
<LI>Assuming my readers are totally ignorant of the subject matter, after reading my paper, do they now understand what I was trying to convey? 	   
<LI>Do I have a good introduction and a strong conclusion?
<LI>Did I integrate my personal learning experiences?
<LI>Are all requirements met?
<LI>Did I go beyond the requirements, producing creative, scholarly writing, perhaps suggesting new ideas or an alternative perspective?
<LI>Is my paper free of typos, grammatical errors, and misspellings?
<LI>Did I consult a good writing handbook?
<LI>Did I have my final paper proofread by a good writer?
</OL>
In-class writing and take-home assignments are not graded per se, but are counted toward a student's final grade.  Many of these assignments will be shared in class, and all will be read by the instructor.  Unlike formal papers, students will always be given the opportunity to withhold sensitive writing from peers (and by request from the instructor); however, since this is a "family class," students are encouraged to share openly.  We can all learn from one another.

Two papers</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"> should address topics which
spark your curiosity and inspire you to seek new knowledge. Topic selections
and plans for each paper should be submitted in writing by the third week
on January 31, 1997. This statement constitutes each student's personal
contract for 30% of the course grade. A binder of excellent papers from
past semesters is available for review. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	Each paper should be three, typewritten, double-spaced
pages in length. Each must be written in consistent, third person, formal
perspective. This is not negotiable.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	Drafts of papers may be turned in early for review.
Papers turned in on time in the fifth and tenth weeks may be rewritten for
a better grade. Use of a personal editor or proofreader will save time and
grief. A paper with more than three typos or blatant grammar or spelling
errors will automatically earn a lower grade.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	Scholarly research of the literature must be integrated.
Appropriate citations and references must be included. Use the standard
format for citations and references of the American Psychological Association
Fourth Edition. Use the textbook as a model if in doubt.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	Each assignment requires three personal interviews
representing a different variable - either three generations of people (approximately
20 years apart in age); OR people representing three spiritual or religious
traditions for another paper; OR people representing three ethnicities,
races or cultures for another paper.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	For each paper, pick a topic from the textbook,
select three questions to be asked, identify three respondents, review relevant
literature, collect field data, write a coherent narrative.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	Papers will be graded as follows:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">A C paper covers the basics (topic, three questions,
three respondents) with references to the textbook and a straightforward
narrative.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">A B paper includes the above and adds at least
two primary references from books or professional journals to augment the
findings. Primary sources are original research by the author cited, rather
than textbooks or summaries. Newspaper accounts, popular news magazines,
encyclopedias, or secondary sources can be used, but will not count as the
two additional outside reference because they secondary sources. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">An A paper  includes above and adds creative and
scholarly thinking, suggesting new ideas, problems or perspectives. These
papers have been edited and proofread.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000"></FONT>&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	Cyberspace participation includes the following
activities:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">1) establish an email address</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	1%</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">2) participate in seven caucus exercises and conferences.
These will include interaction with students from FamR 360. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	7%</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">3) make two email contacts with mainland students
who are using the Olson and DeFrain textbook.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">4) make two email contacts with international students
or faculty studying family development issues. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	2%</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">5) find and read two family pages in the World

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	2 %</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">6) make at least one inquiry with the ASK ERIC
project</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	1%</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000"></FONT>&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	Attendance is required. Each contribution to class
discussion adds dimension and content to the course. Practice speaking up
in class.   Each day, points are earned as follows:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	4 points - present, participating, actively involved</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	3 points - tardy and participating</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	2 points - just there</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	1 point - absence accounted for via a handwritten,
signed note to explain the absence or tardy.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	0 points - absent and unaccounted for</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000"></FONT>&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	Tests   With a doctor's note, a test turned in
late earns a maximum of one-half credit. Without a doctor's note, there
is no excuse for a late test.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000"></FONT>&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	Extra credit will help a borderline grade (3.5,
2.5, or 1.5). NO extra credit will be applied until all required assignments
have been completed. Extra credit can be earned through a) arranging for
a guest speaker, b) making a special presentation on a relevant topic, c)
developing an audio-visual component to a paper, d) writing an extra paper,
e) signing up to present primary content from textbook and study guide chapters.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000"></FONT>&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">	University policy on plagiarism will be followed.
Each person is expected to do independent, creative research on all assignments.<BR>

<P>
Project Objectives:<p>
<DL>
	<DD>To develop a kit of resource materials for families, which focus on optimizing the care and development of children from birth to five years of age.<p>

	To bring together information and practice from relevant disciplinary fields and develop
	educational materials which can be understood by and are attractive to families.<p>

	To develop culturally sensitive resource materials that will increase the knowledge of parents and other care givers regarding optimal child care and development.<p>
</DL>

<P>
Methodology:<p>
<DL>
	<DD>An interdisciplinary team is collaborating to develop a comprehensive set of  resource
	materials that are family-friendly and culturally sensitive.  Growth and development, nutrition, health and safety, family life and resource management issues and topics are addressed.  The finished print materials will be capable of high quality, inexpensive reproduction to facilitate wide-spread distribution to participants in targeted programs.  The kits will be translated into three different languages.
	<P>
     	<DD>The project is relying heavily on partnership with parents and community program
	providers to identify priority topics and to assure that materials reflect family and community needs.   Parents (including teen parents and immigrant parents) and family services providers representing a range of ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds participated in focus groups and a survey in the initial stages of the project.  These same families and providers will assist in the field tests of the materials.

<title>Center on the Family:  Family Adaptation to Occupational Loss</title>
</HEAD>

<body>

<FONT SIZE=6><I>Family Adaptation to Occupational Loss</I></FONT>
<HR>

<B>Project Summary</B><P>

In October 1994, the Center on the Family received a grant from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to study the effects of occupational loss on workers and their families.  The study focuses on local families affected by the sugar plantation closings and aims to: 1) describe the extent of economic, personal, and familial changes associated with the closings; 2) identify personal and family resources and coping strategies which serve as protective mechanisms during these times; 3) identify risk factors that render families vulnerable to the pathogenic effects of occupational loss; and, 4) assess community services and benefits available to plantation families.<p>

Interview data have been gathered on 126 families of Hawaiian, Japanese, Portuguese, and Filipino ancestry, from the Hamakua, Hilo Coast and Ka'u communities on the Big Island.  Targets of the study include two adults who are either married or living together as domestic partners, and where applicable, one child, 10 - 18 years of age.  At least one of the adults was employed by a plantation company or had been laid off within 18 months of interview data collection date.<p>

Five broad constructs relevant to family functioning will be assessed.  These constructs are:  1) family economic strain; 2) community risk factors; 3) prior personal and family risk factors; 4) current personal and family resources; and, 5) current personal and family adjustment.  Much of the data were collected using a structured family interview.  Families were also videotaped discussing the effects of the plantation closings on their lives and advice to other families.  Archival data from the medical and school records of participants are currently being collected to measure family risks and adjustment.  Differences between the employed and unemployed groups will be assessed, along with the combined effect of economic strain and community, family, and individual risks and resources on adjustment to occupational loss.<p>

Beginning in the Fall of 1996, findings will be disseminated to families and the communities at town meetings and through printed materials.  Informational pamphlets also be available for families in other communities experiencing the difficulties of unemployment.  Findings will also be presented to researchers, social service providers, and policy-makers at conferences and through professional publications.  The goal is to increase understanding of the difficulties of unemployment, and to provide new insights about the strengths and strategies that families have used to successfully cope with this tragic event.  Findings are expected to help professionals design more family-friendly public policies and better support programs.<p>

Hawai'i Kids Count was established in 1994 to improve the well-being of Hawai'i's
children and their families by increasing public awareness of their condition and serving as a catalyst for positive actions on their behalf.  The strategies employed by the project are:
<ul>
	<li>establishing and maintaining a data base of information which accurately  describe the status of children in Hawai'i;
	<li>monitoring Hawai'i's progress regarding children and families by tracking      key indicators over time; 
	<li>developing and publicizing analyses of specific issues important to Hawai'i's children and families; 
	<li>strengthening the constituency for children through information and training;
	<li>linking with the national Kids Count network, which provides access to resources, technical expertise and knowledge of kids in other states.
</ul>

<p>
The project is directed by a public/private partnership of the Hawai'i Community Services Council, the Governor's Office of Children and Youth, and the Center on the Family of the University of Hawai'i at Manoa.  It is primarily funded by a four-year $400,000 grant from the Annie E. Casey Foundation.

The Corrado is a 2 door Sports Coupe built by VW between 1988 and 1995 
(Available in the US from '90 to '94 and in Canada from '90 to '95). VW 
offered two engines for the Corrado in the North American market: 
1) a 1.8L, 158hp, 4 Cyl. Supercharged 8V engine offered from 1990 to 
1992 (Called the G60) and 2) a 2.8L, 178hp, 6 Cyl. In-line V 
(Called the VR6.  US versions were called SLC models). 
The Corrado is based on the A2 chassis and it is the fastest VW built to date. </FONT></TD></TR></TABLE>

The European market was lucky to get the 2.9l 190hp VR6.  Other European engine
options were a 2.0l 8v 115hp 4cyl and a 2.0l 16v 136hp 4cyl (there were 
some early 16V's with catalytic converters from 1990/1991 that had 129Bhp).<p>

There is an interesting <a HREF="article.html">article</A> that 
you can look at regarding the Corrado when it was previewed before its production and an ad that gives a lot of interesting details on the corrados.<p>

<CENTER><h1> <A NAME="1">Private Corrado Problems Support Lists</A></h1></CENTER>
As with every car (even the awesome Corrado) there are several problems 
or quirks that tend to be common along the entire production line. Below 
is a list of some of the more common problems and a support list to show 
how many others have had the same problem. In addition, there may be a description 
of some of the problems. Use this to help you diagnose and describe your 
problem to your technician. <p> 

These lists are private property and VW has absolutely no infuence or responsibilities associated with these lists.<p>

(For your information: It is required that all new car dealers must, in a 
visable location, have forms for owners to order offical tech bullitins and recall 
information on their specific vehicle. This is an FTC (fed trade commision) 
rule.)<p>

If you have experienced any problems listed below, please follow these directions to help others and yourslef. <p>

<ol>
<li> Call VW of North America and register your problem with 
them. (800 number in your owners manual)
<li> Add yourself, using the form, to the list related to your problem 
<b>once</b>. (These forms and lists are fully automated and not 
controlled. So if you submit twice, your name will appear twice in the 
list. No one is resposible for clean up, so if you want these lists to 
remain legitimate, don't abuse it!) 
</ol>

List of Problems:
<ol>

<li> Fog Lights Crack - all US Corrados (90-94)<br>
- why: due to heat, not rock chips<br>
- solution: VW just replaces them, should be a new design!<br>
<A 
HREF="/~cca-webmaster/cgi-bin/formoutput/support-light.txt">[Get 
Fog Light Support 
List]</A> <A HREF="supportfrm.html">[Add yourself to Support List]</A><br>
<p>

<li> Sunroof Stops Working - all Corrados (90-95)<br>
- why: a popping niose appears and if it is not fixed, it breaks
a clip and later the sunroof gets 
scratched and stops working, and in the end the whole track needs to be 
replaced.<br>
- solution: Fix clip or replace the whole track initially with the new 
re-designed one<p>
Basic adjustments and
correcting a "catching or popping noise" when moving the roof from the closed
position to the rear:<br>

The fix is relatively simple. There is a chrome plated rocker arm on each
side that is visable with the roof in the vent position (up) near the 
rear of
the opening. This rocker arm is spring loaded and has a small peice of what
looks like rubber vacuum hose on the aft end. This rubber peice needs to be
replaced with a slightly thicker wall hose. I use the regular 3mm VW vacuum
hose (the cloth covered stuff). I use a razor blade to cut the hose to length
to avoid damaging the cloth covering, then slide the cut hose on the rocker.
This can be done without any disassembly of the roof.
Obviously if the roof is not moving smoothly or is slow, there is going 
to be a problem.<p>

Corrective repairs on the roof mechanism are limited because is is sold 
as a
unit and most individual parts are not available, at least in the US. The
best I can recomend is to keep the tracks clean and lubricated. We use
silicone spray (recomended by Audi) and brake cleaner to do this. Oils 
tend
to attract dirt and cause to roof to bind, which causes the tilt 
mechanism to
try to raise the roof panel before it is all the way forward, damaging the
paint. Like most things, good maintainance reduces the need for corrective
repairs.

Sun Roof Support 
List]</A> <A HREF="supportfrm.html">[Add yourself to Support List]</A><br>
<p>

<li> Notchy Transmission, Reverse Gear Binding - All G60 (90-92), Early 
VR6 (92)<br>
- why: do not have the clutch with Cd or Ni plated splines (many had 
their 2nd gear syncro die)<br>
- solution: get the Cd or Ni Coated Clutch<br>
The clutch discs that came with the early cars have a black anodized like
finish on the splined hub. The new style discs have a bright nickel plated
hub that slides on the mainshaft easier. The problem is that when the clutch
is released, the old style discs would not slide away from the flywheel,
which causes hard shifting and grinding. This can damage the syncros and the
gear sets if not corrected. Clutch jobs are much cheaper than trans 
repairs.<p>

List]</A> <A HREF="supportfrm.html">[Add yourself to Support List]</A><br>
<p>

<li> Vibration Damper gets loose on driver's side axle - All G60 (90-92)<br>
- why: they are permanantly fixed to axle, and later they fall off<br>
- solution: new axle (VR6 has a removable dampner, could this be used?)<br>
<A 
HREF="/~cca-webmaster/cgi-bin/formoutput/support-dampner.txt">[Get 
Dampner Support 
List]</A> <A HREF="supportfrm.html">[Add yourself to Support List]</A><br>
<p>

<LI> Rear Tire Cupping (Uneven Wear) - (All Corrados, Passats, Jetta 
///'s)<br>
- why: something to do with a defective axle<br>
- solution: The tire wear called CUPPING is a smooth valley and hill pattern that
crosses the tread on a diagonal of about 45-60 degrees. The pattern is
usually all around the tire with the hill peaks about 2 inches apart.
<p>
        The problem is corrected with a new spindle that is ground with a 10'
angle (10/60 th of a degree) at the mounting flange, which is installed on
the left rear, then the thrust angle is corrected by shifting the rear axle
assy. (equalizing toe-in relative to vehicle centerline) on a 4 head
alignment machine.
<p>
        This is offical VW procedure. VW does not recomend plastic shims to
correct alignment problems, but many shops do without much trouble.
<p>
        Currently, all Audi dealers are required to have a Hunter P-211
alignment machine to do the A-4 with the 4 link front suspension. The 1997
Passat and the 1998 Golf and Jetta will also get the 4 link setup so the VW
dealers will also have P-211 machines. These are the most accurate machines
out at this time, and have software specifically for VW and Audi. The A-4 has
a camber tolerance of 1' (1/60 th of a degree).

List]</A> <A HREF="supportfrm.html">[Add yourself to Support List]</A><br>
<p>

<LI> Mirror Backing Peals - all Corrados (89-95)<br>
- why: The mirrors have a heating element attached. It turns on when
you turn on the rear defroster. Supposibly this deterirates the shiny
backing of the mirror and you get the ugly brown peeling around the edges<br>
- solution: New mirror?<p>
<A 
HREF="/~cca-webmaster/cgi-bin/formoutput/support-mirror.txt">[Get 
Mirror Support 
List]</A> <A HREF="supportfrm.html">[Add yourself to Support List]</A><br>
<p>

<LI> VR6 leaking head Gaskets - all VR6 (92-95)<br>
        why - For some reason the head gasket blows<br>
        solution - get a new gasket<br>

The head gasket jobs we have done were done because of oil leak complaints. 
The leak appears at the right rear head bolt hole near the #1 spark plug. The 
oil transfer port (where the oil passes through the head gasket to feed the 
top end) is very close to this bolt. In these engines, the oil was bypassing 
the sealing ring at the transfer port and the closest path out of the engine 
is that head bolt hole, which is open at the bottom of the threaded boss in 
the block. 
<p>
This leak is commonly mis-diagnosed as an oil pan gasket, but on close 
inspection, the trail of oil can be seen running down the RR corner of the 
block (nearest the passenger side strut tower). The oil runs down to the oil 
pan gasket and because this is the high point of the gasket surface the oil 
runs almost all the way around the oil pan.
<p>
When loosening the head bolts, the head bolts in that area were not as tight 
as they should have been. This can be caused by defective head bolts, 
head gaskets, or they were not tighened properly at the factory (not 
likely). There was no warpage of the cylinder head, the replacement head 
gaskets are identical to the old gasket, and the head bolts are always 
replaced as per normal procedures. 
<p>
I have not heard of any coolant or compression loss type failures.
<p>
All of these repairs were done on cars with 20-30k miles (32-48kms) and were 
done under warranty. <p>

Maintainance note: All of the cylinder heads showed some signs of corrosion 
(pitting) on the surfaces between the cylinders (one quite badly), but not in 
critical sealing areas. In all cases, the coolant had changed color from 
bright blue to amber. The VW coolant contains a litmus dye that changes color 
when the coolant becomes acidic, and therefore should be changed when the 
color change is observed, usually about 2 years or a little less. The VW 
coolant is expensive, but I recomend using it anyway.<p>

<p>

<Li> Some other very common quirks with Corrados with no real solution:
<ul> 

<p><li> Windshield wipers miss a few areas - All Corrados (90-95)<br>
- why: ??<br>
- solution: bend the wiper arm, new blades, RainX<br>
<p><li> Exhaust hangers go bad - All G60 (90-92)<br>
- why: it's a heavy exhaust<br>
- solution: get new ones (the ones with the chain in the middle)<br>
<p><LI> Fuba Antenas Malfunction - (Years??)<br>
- why: something fries in the circutry<br>
- solution: need to get a new one<br>
<p><LI> The Battery Dies - (All Corrados)<br>
- why: Bad battery from VW. <br>
- solution: new non-VW battery. If still dies, look for drain (some 
report the trunk light does not turn off)<p>
Dead battery problems in Corrado and Passat are very often related to that 
electric passive seat belt system used in the non-airbag US market cars.<p>
<ol>
<li> If the shoulder belt clip does not move all the way to the front and 
rear positions when is should, the system can continue to draw power from the 
battery. <br>

<b>IMPORTANT!</b> If the belt does not move all the way to the rear 
position, use 
the backup shoulder belt clip that is under the small pop out panel in the 
"B" pillar next to the rear end of the belt track slot. The electrically 
operated belt clip can be pulled out of the track very easily if it is not in 
the rearmost position.

<li> If the front-rear seat adjustment lever is not in the "locked" 
position, 
there is an electrical draw from the release solonoid in the inertia 
(shoulder belt) reel on the inboard side of the seat. This solonoid keeps the 
belt from locking up when the belt is moving in the track and while the seat 
is being adjusted front to rear.

<li> If the key is left in the ingition lock, the seat belt system remains 
activated, also drawing the battery down. A common parking lot and sales lot 
problem.

<li> There is a tech bullitin about dark cars in high ambient temperatures 
and 
direct sunlight activating the A/C high pressure switch or the engine bay 
temp switch and running the radiator fan until it cools off or the battery 
goes dead. A good battery will last about 2-3 hours. There is an updated fan 
or A/C relay that has a timer that will not let this happen.
</ol>
<p><li> Supercharger dies between 50-?k miles - All G60 (90-92)<br>
- why: ??? (no corrolation found with those using AST or Neuspeeds 
smaller pulleys)<br>
(Here is a personal account of a charger blow-up: Before it blew up 
I could hear a whining noise and was not getting good top end performance.
Some of the smaller gear ring just cracked and blew out of the top of the 
Supercharger case. Superchrger seemed well oiled. Only things I did find 
were a hole in the by pass tube and the internal belt was busted (I think 
as a result of the gearing locking/jamming).I was doing 5k revs when it 
blew.)<br>
- solution: get a new one<br>
- Personal Note: I don't really know about this one. I didn't see any 
real data. Supercharger needs regular oil changes and if that is not 
done, then it might die. I heard of G60's in the 200K mile range.<p>
I have not seen any bullitins relating to blower failures. I have noticed a 
couple of common factors on G-lader failures. Mileage does not seem to be a 
major factor.
<ol>
<li> Improperly installed or poor quality air filters. The last 2 that I 
replaced had had the air filter replaced by a quick lube joint and the 
sealing bead was not in its groove, allowing dirt to bypass the filter. 

<li> The blower and the associated intercooler plumbing were saturated with 
oil 
(and dirt from the filter problem), probably from leaking seals in the 
blower. 
</ol>
The relatively flat low rpm performance tends to make the driver rev the 
engine too high when the oil temp is low. Cold, thick oil can not flow well 
(starving the bearings), and generates excessive pressure (possibly 
contributing to seal failure). I recomend against using high viscosity oils.
I use a 10-40 100% synthetic, and have seen at least a 50% reduction in 
general engine wear.<p>

<p>
</ul>
</ol>

You can now stop asking the question: "What does that look 
like?" because we now have a collection of pictures (from the various 
corrado owners) that show off their cars for the benefit of others. 
Enjoy!! 
<p>

Most of the images are in their original form, some pictures are small,
some are big, and the resolution varies.  Only a few images are suited (in
size) for placement on your desktop - a lot are just small snapshots. 
<p>

NOTE: Remember that pictures take a while to load up!! Also, I listed the

<CENTER><h1> <A NAME="1">Introducing the Corrado Club of America</A></h1></CENTER>

<H3>Our Mission</H3>
The Corrado Club of America formed to bring Corrado 
drivers and enthusiasts together from all over North America. 
The CCA welcomes all Corrado owners, 
G60 and SLC/VR6, to share and further our appreciation and love 
our cars. 

<H3>Corrado History</H3>
The Volkswagen Corrado was produced from 1988 to 1995 by
Volkswagen AG.  Partially hand built by Karmann Coachworks
in Osnabruk, Germany, the Corrado embodies the best of blazing
performance and tight handling and comfort.  With production ceased in
1995, the Corrado is destined to become a collector's car, especially that  
less than 18,000 Corrado's were sold in North America.<p>

<H3>CCA History</H3>
The seeds were planted several years ago with the start of the <A HREF="#3">Corrado-L Internet mailing list</A>, created by Corrado enthusiasts and admirers. In 1995, the Club officially formed. Members were initially pooled from the internet mailing list
 and the Corrado web site. As 1996 began, the Club's appeal widened to include dozens of non-internet-enabled enthusiasts and the Club's geographic coverage spread out to include nearly every state in the U.S. and every province in Canada. Shortly after, 
local and regional 	<A HREF=events.html>events</A> became a major source of interest for members, with events in the Midwest, Northeast, Atlantic and West Coast regions as well as Canada and Europe. Events include gathering for local auto-crosses, day-lon
g drives, car shows, technical workshops, tours of the best Corrado 	<A 
HREF=organizers.html#1>performance tuning shops</A>, driving workshops 
and more!<p>

<CENTER><H2><A NAME="3">E-mail Lists, IRC and Newsgroups</A></H2></CENTER>

<H3>Corrado-L E-mail list</H3>
The corrado-l mailing list is a place where all sorts of Corrado issues 
are discussed. The information ranges from the basic upgrades such as 
lights to technical information such as engine modifications. Currently 
there are about 20-30 messages a day sent on this mailing list. <p>

If you would like to join the corrado-l mailing list group, there are two 
options. One is the normal subscription where you get a message as it is 
sent by a user. The other option is the digest version, where you get a 
collection of one days messages. The advantage of the digest is that you 
will have one long mail message per day from the group instead of several 
short ones flooding your mailbox.<p>

Just a note to the new internet rookies: This service does not cost 
anything. AND the "l" is an "L" (letter) not a "1" (number)<p>

To subscribe, send a mail to the following address: 
<b>majordomo@teleport.com</b>. The body of the message should be:
<b>subscribe corrado-l-digest</b> for the digest version and <b>
subscribe corrado-l</b> for the normal version.<p>

To unsubscribe, send mail to <b>majordomo@teleport.com</b> with the body 
of the message <b>unsubscribe corrado-l-digest</b> or <b>unsubscribe 
corrado-l</b> depending on the service you are subscribed to.<p>

Digests are sent out at 1am or when more than 40k has accumulated.<p>

To get previous digests, send a message to majordomo@teleport.com with the 
text "index corrado-l-digest" and you'll get back a list. The rest of the 
instructions are in the message you get back. (For some reason it won't
let you grab the compressed ones (they end in .Z), so those are there
only until I find a home for them. But everything since #100 is
available.)<p>

If you have problems related with the list, contact Kurt Wiedenhoeft (<A HREF="mailto:kurtww@saskia.com">kurtww@saskia.com</A>), the list maintainer.

<h3>Corrado IRC Channel</H3>
Currently, there is also an IRC (Internet Relay Chat) channel set up for 
the Corrado owners. This is where you can talk to fellow Corrado 
owners in real time. It's like a big meeting where one person can 
talk to everyone else. The only catch is that you have to type 
(instead of drive).<p>

<STRONG>GENERAL</STRONG><br>
The channel to join is <b>#corrado</b> by typing <i>/join #corrado</i>. 
The channel is open almost every night.<p>

There are two different kinds of IRC connection out there.  
One is the UNDERNET IRC (US.UNDERNET.ORG; join #vwcorrado).  However, the 
one most of us are using is INTERNET IRC (#corrado).<p>

If you are having
problems connecting to the channel using your default server, try one of 
these alternative servers. To change servers just type /server 'server name'
when you are in IRC.<br>
<ul>
<li>irc.phoenix.net
<li>irc.ilstu.edu
<li>irc.neosoft.com
<li>irc.winternet.com
<li>irc.primenet.com
<li>piglet.cc.utexas.edu
<li>irc-2.mit.edu
<li>irc-2.escape.edu
<li>irc.sdsc.edu
<li>irc.cerf.net 7001
<li>irc.cris.com 6668
<li>irc.stealth.net 5550 (other ports are also availabe, but I find these 
faster) <li>irc.epix.net
<li>irc.mo.net
<li>irc.caltech.edu 7001 (.edu accounts only)
</ul>
<p>

<STRONG>UNIX</STRONG><br>
Just start up IRC by typing irc at your unix prompt and then join the 
corrado channel.<p>

<STRONG>PC's</STRONG><br>
Download the latest version of mIRC (4.0) from 
<A HREF="http://www.sbcomp.com/mirc/index.html">http://www.sbcomp.com/mirc/index.html</A>.
It's a winsock app. and it's free for personal users.  This site also
includes an introduction to IRC and mIRC's features.  While your
there, download the FAQ for mIRC 4.0.  It shows you how to use the
program's more advanced features.<p>

<STRONG>MAC's</STRONG><br>
Ircle for Mac's works really well. The last release version was v2.2. 
(<A 
HREF="ftp://mirrors.aol.com/pub/info-mac/comm/tcp/">ftp://mirrors.aol.com/pub/info-mac/comm/tcp/</A>)<br>
Version 2.3 is in its 51st beta (as of today) at:<br>
<ul>
PPC:  ftp://www2.bridge.net/pub/ircle/ircleUSppc.sit.hqx<br>
68K:  ftp://www2.bridge.net/pub/ircle/ircleUS68k.sit.hqx<br>

<CENTER><h1> <A NAME="1">Corrado Club Upcoming Events</A></h1></CENTER>

The Corrado Club has local and regional events throughout the year that are organized by 
club members. Some events are sponsored by tuners like New Dimensions 
(along with their other event). In any case, they are a lot of fun and I 
encourage you to come out with us!!! Go on and look at the <A 
HREF="/~cca-webmaster/cgi-bin/formoutput/eventlist.html"> 
events list</A> to see if there is an event scheduled in your area.</p>

If you want to take charge and organize an event in your area, go right 
ahead. <A HREF="eventfrm.html">Post your event</A> here on the web page 
as well as on the <A HREF="intro.html#3"> Corrado E-mail list</a>! <p>

<CENTER><h1> <A NAME="2">CCA World Wide Event</A></h1></CENTER>

<H3>General Information</H3>
The goal of the Corrado World Wide Event is to have Corrados in each 
state/province (US, Canada) and 
country otherwise, gather at a popular picturesque landmark (i.e. Big Ben, 
Three Mile Island, Sahara desert). Following the great convoy of Corrados 
driving down the countries roads, a group picture is to be taken in front 
of the landmark.
<p>
The pictures will then be set up on the CCA Web Page and articles describing your event may 
appear in the Spoiler Up Newsletter.
<p>

<H3>Organization and Contact Information</H3>

To organize this event we will need a representative in each 
state/province or country. All the representative has to do is pick a 
location, a date, and tell others the event information when they call 
you. Then, just send in the pictures and a little article to us. 
If there is no one in your area yet, please come forward and voulunteer! 
<p>
If you just want to show up for an event and not organize it, contact the 	<A HREF=organizers.html#2>CCA representative</A> closest to your area.<p>

<H3>Successful Events</H3>
I hope you will find that one day of your summer to take a nice drive in 
your corrado and make this the best and biggest event ever! Can you 
imagine how jealous the Porsche, BMW, miata clubs will be?
<p>

And here is a list of the regions that already had their event. But do 
not be shy! Get in contact with the 	<A HREF=organizers.html#2>region organizer</A>, they will most 
likely do it again and want more people and corrados for the fun and pictures!<p>

<H3>1997 Corrado Registry</H3>

The 1997 Corrado Registry was compiled and designed by James S. Bratek of Bratek Mutlimedia
Design. The registry is compiled on a yearly basis and this year it was made in 
a really nice format, viewable with Adobe Acrobat Reader. <p>

To download the Registry, click here. <A HREF="../usrapps/cir97.pdf"><IMG
BORDER=0 SRC="../pics/butcca.gif"></A><p>
	This file is in Adobe Acrobat format.   Adobe Acrobat Reader is required for viewing.
For information on this application and new document format, check out <A HREF="http://www.adobe.com/prodindex/acrobat/main.html">Adobe Acrobat Information</A><p>

<H3>Microsoft Windows95 Corrado Theme</H3>

I have put together pictures and sounds for a corrado theme. Just unzip the <A HREF="../usrapps/corrado-theme.zip">this zip file</a> in your Program Files/Plus!/Themes directory. Then go to control panel and double click on the Desktop Themes Icon and secelct the Corrado theme. (You need the Microsoft Plus! Pak)<p>

The sounds are not good quality as I do not have good Audio equipment, but if you're wondering what you are hearing, it is my 1990 G60 (K&N and no suitcase muffler, stock muffler) in the rain.<p>

The animated icons are really cool too (I think). It is either the front or the back of the corrado with flashing brake lights, 4 way flashers or headlights.<p>

I have selected 4 background graphics and made them bmp's. You can save some space if you make them jpg's. Also, if you want more backgrounds, take the microsoft scenes screen saver files and take the jpgs from there!<p>

Hope you like it.  <p>
<hr>

<H3>Microsoft Scenes Corrado Picture Set</H3>

I have made a picture set of some of the pictures in the corrado 
gallery for Microsoft Scenes. Microsoft Scenes puts pictures on the 
desktop or acts as a screensaver. Just <A HREF="../usrapps/corradoscenes.zip">dowload this zip file</a> and 
uncompressit it in your /scenes/picsets directory. A corrado directory
will be created. Then, go to your MS Scenes and add this picturee set.<p>

<H3>Corrado Club of America - Distribution Brochure</H3>

After many requests for a distribution brochure, we finally have one. Special
thanks to Jason Livingood, Delaware Valley Regional Organizer, for designing and 
completing this brochure.<p>

r the stamp and envalope. All proceeded go to the club.<p>

<H3>T-Shirts</H3>
At the end of the summer of 1996, I saw a picture and heard a mention of CCA T-shirts. I have yet to recieve one and I don't know how much they cost or how to get them and how many are available. Hopefully someone who has made them can enlighten me.<p>

<H3>Licence Plate Holders</H3>
I know there is a demand for this item but there seems no one with enough enthusiasm to go ahead and make them up. If you want to voulunteer for this project, contact the club.<p>

There is talk that a new version of the corrado is being designed somewhere in Germany. I don't know the details, but I saw some pictures and info floating around. If you see something in this subject, drop me a line so I can include it here (including prototype pictures).<p>

<H2>Is THIS the New Corrado?</H2>

NOTES:
<UL>
<LI>all figures for manual transmission (no slush boxes here !)
<LI>The ones with prices are current models (to be phased out <sniff>), the
figures come from various magazine tests.
<LI>Prices : 1 GBP= 1.59 USD
<LI>mpg    : "non-US gallons" !!! (you guys got short changed on your 
gallons <g>)      1 gallon=4.55 litres
<LI>In the VW brochure "Technical data and equipment" (Jan 95 420/1190.01.18) it
states that you get an extra 5 Nm to 240Nm at 4200 with 98 RON (octane)
compared with 235Nm at 4200rpm, 95 RON. Not sure if the European RON is the
same as US octane measurement. Every little bit counts.
<LI>The Polo weighs 1830 llb, Scirocco 1973 llb, Golf 2117 llb. The Corrado
anything from 2500 to 2700 llb. I guess the US versions are even heavier,
with AC, electric everything and the extra smog gear.

<H1> Corrado Preview (1988) and Ad (1990)</H1></A>
By: Todd Schwartz (schwartz@emp1.emp.state.or.us)
<H2>SNEAK PREVIEW:  VOLKSWAGEN CORRADO G60</H2>
<H3>Road & Track, 9/88</H3>
</CENTER>
It won't go on sale in Europe for a couple of months yet, and the time you
can buy one in America-spring 1989-is a bit further away.  But this much is
clear about the new Corrado: It's the Ben Johnson of the Volkswagen fleet,
an athlete with plenty of muscle and speed.
<p>
	And yet this new $20,000 sports coupe from Wolfsburg doesn't strut its best
stuff outwardly.  Instead, the big news is under the Corrado hood.  And
there's not even anything unusual about the basic specifications here: a
4-cylinder engine with 81.0-mm bore, 86.4-mm stroke, 1.8 liters of
displacement and only two valves per cylinder.  But wait there is something
to write about. and it's signaled by that "G" after Corrado.  This is the
first car to go into full-scale production with what the Germans call a
G-Lader, a mechanically driven spiral supercharger.
<p>
        Actually, VW has been working on the spiral blower for eight years.
A pilot series of 500 of VW's smallest German model, the Polo, has already
been built and sold with the G-Lader.  There's also a corporate-policy
dimension to this power-boost technology, in that Volkswagen seems to have
drawn a line of demarcation between the VW and Audi emblems: spiral
superchargers from Wolfsburg, exhaust turbochargers from Ingolstadt. (Except
for diesels, that is, which get turbos in both camps.)
In the spiral supercharger, the engine's intake air passes through a
snail-shaped housing, where it is compressed by a fast-turning spiral
impeller to about 0.7 bar above atmosphere.  This compressor, which itself
soaks up as much as 18 horsepower, is driven by a toothed belt.  The
device's big advantage is torque, right across the engine's rev range.
Rumor from Wolfsburg has it that the Corrado engine delivers more than 200
Newton meters from 3000 to 5000 rpm and reaches a peak torque of 220
Nm-that's 162 lb-ft, or about what you'd expect from an unblown engine of
2.5-2.7 liters.
<p>
	But as with anything else, there are disadvantages too.  By the time the
engine is churning out maximum power, 5800 rpm, that little spiral is
whirling at around 11,000 rpm.  And there's not much margin of safety beyond
that; the impeller is getting very close to critical vibrations.  So this is
a power booster that would make little sense for a Formula I engine, for
instance.  But for an engine whose job is to deliver good work in daily
driving, it makes great sense.
<p>
        VW is so convinced of this, in fact, that you'll be seeing more
spiral superchargers from Wolfsburg.  About the time you read this, the
company will be producing a second series of 1500 Polo G 40s, as they're
called.  A bit later there will be a Passat G 60 and a Golf G 60 and
eventually the Polo G 40 will go into full production.
<p>
        Those numbers after the G, by the way, stand for the spiral blades'
width in millimeters.  And between Golf, Passat and Corrado-all of which use
the G 60 supercharger-there are nuances of difference as well.  In the new
Passat, for instance, the blower draws its air through that stylish new VW
emblem gracing the otherwise unadorned front end; in Corrado and Golf the
air comes in through the right front fender.
Whatever the air source, the power boost is eye-opening.  Fully emission
controlled, the G 60-blown 1.8-liter four puts out 150 bhp.  And if what we
hear about the performance is true, the Corrado G 60 may make most of its
competitors look like snails: 0-60 mph in well under 8 seconds, for instance.
<p>        
        Just for comparison: The Porsche 924S, which costs about $5500 more
in Germany (and $26,550 in the U.S.), takes 8.5 see for the same exercise.
And the 944, which comes to $30,995 in the U.S., takes a full second more.
When it comes to top speed, the Corrado's 137 mph line it up squarely with
the 924S's 137 mph and the 944's 136.  
<p>
        That the Porsches, with 158 bhp to work with, just match the
Corrado's top speed may be traceable to somewhat better aerodynamics for the
Corrado.  If the Corrado winds up looking a bit round and puffy, VW's
designers (under Herbert Schaefer) compensate with a reasonably nice drag
coefficient-0.32,, versus the 924S's 0.33 and the 944's 0.35-an even nicer
overall drag factor (Cd x A) of less than 0.6 square meter.  For comparison,
the present S presents a 0.68-square-meter face to the wind; the Porsche
924S comes in at 0.58 and the 944 at 0.66. An eye-catching Corrado
aerodynamic detail, shared with the new Porsche 911 Carrera 4: a movable
rear spoiler that automatically rises into position at 75 mph, then retracts
when the car slows to 25 mph.
<p>
        Speaking of Scirocco, we were surprised to learn that the older coupe
won't be discontinued when the Corrado makes its debut.  Critics say the
Corrado is so expensive to produce that it can't totally replace the S.
From what we hear, in Germany the Corrado G 60 will have to be priced about
$5500 higher than the most expensive S, the GTX 16V, whose tooling is long
since amortized.  This points up a growing problem for German carmakers:
Saddled with the highest costs in the world, they're struggling to stay
competitive and it's not going to be easy.
<p>
        Mind you, the Corrado won't be merely more expensive than its
ancestor.  It sits on a wheelbase almost 3 in. longer, is about 2 in. longer
overall and 1.6 in. wider, and rides about an inch lower than the S.  It's
said to be about 8 percent roomier too.  All this is no surprise when you're
reminded that where the S is still based on the old original Golf (Rabbit),
the Corrado platform is that of the present Golf II.
<p>
        Corrado's instrument panel and steering wheel are similar to those
of the new Passat.  The steering wheel will be adjustable; a short shift
lever, connected to the same 5-speed gearbox used in the Passat, grows out
of the center console.  The Corrado is clearly a 2+2, but that doesn't mean
its rear seats are only theoretical-there really is room for people here.
Just the same, leg room is tight, so longer trips are probably out of the
question for adults, except possibly cats and fakirs.  Folding the rear
seatbacks approximately-doubles the 12.2cu-ft cargo space.
<p>
        Chassis components are mostly from the Golf GTi 16V, with MacPherson
struts at the front and the typical VW twist beam at the rear.  New here are
15in. running gear- 15 x 6J wheels, 185/55VR-15 tires-and big brakes; at the
front are hefty 10.1 -in. ventilated discs, and at 9.0 in. the solid rear
discs are also quite respectable.
<p>        
        There won't be the palette of engines and trim levels that European
customers usually have to choose from.  So far the only engines Volkswagen
plans to offer are the 1.8-liter G 60 and the present 16 valve engine (136
bhp in non-catalyst, 123 bhp in catalyst form).  The U.S. version of the
Corrado will get only the G 60 engine.
<p>
        Insiders also say some lower-power engine alternatives may be
offered later, at least when S sales tail off-an event that has long since
occurred in North America.  It also seems possible that VW's fascinating new
"inline V-6" engine, an extremely narrow-angle V-6 that displaces 2.4 liters
and develops 170 bhp, might find its way into the Corrado.  And since VW
already offers 4wd in the Golf, why not in the Corrado too?
What won't be offered is a design concept favored by Schaefer, a sort of
fast-back sports wagon (something like Volvo's 480ES) that was turned down
by management.  Another variant seems to have a better chance: a Corrado
cabriolet that was only recently shown to VW's management product-strategy
committee.
<p>
        With or without cabrio, the Corrado will be built at Karmann in
Onsabruck, where the present Golf/Rabbit cabriolet and S are assembled.
Seen in context with VW's plans for Karmann to build only about 100 units a
day, this indicates that VW doesn't see the Corrado as a volume seller; it's
an "image car" that VW hopes will lend its name and other models greater
prestige.

Mention the word Volkswagen and what do people think of?
They think practical.  They think affordable.
<p>
So, what's the problem?
They don't think sports car.
<p>
But just suppose you could take everything you love about sports cars and
all the good things about Volkswagens and put the two together.
<p>
What would you have? A sports car that is fun yet sensible.  Beautiful yet
functional.  Powerful but responsible.
<p>
In short, you'd have the new sports car from Volkswagen: Corrado.  If your
mind has difficulty accepting that fact, perhaps your foot will understand.
Press the accelerator and the Corrado takes you from 0 to 60 faster than you
can say "What seems to be the trouble, officer?"
<p>
Its time of 7.5 seconds is considerably faster than a Porsche 944.  And its
top track-speed of 140 is higher, too.  Instead of being turbocharged,
Corrado is supercharged.  Result: It eliminates turbo-log.  And provides a
steady infusion of power.  From the time you turn the key until you hit the
redline.
<p>
A supercharged, intercooled power plant gives Corrado's engine the torque
and response of normally aspirated engine with nearly 50% more displacement
<p>
Corrado not only looks like a sports car.  It drives like one.  Perhaps
because it is a wish list of everything our engineers wanted in a sports
car.  Like a speed-activated spoiler which automatically extends when you
need it.
<p>
By reducing rear lift by up to 64%, it increases high-speed stability and
directional control.
<p>
Question: How important is this spoiler?
Answer: Important enough to be on Formula 1 cars and the Porsche Carrera 4.
<p>
Corrado also has the largest passenger compartment of any car in its class.
So the backseats are more than theoretical.
As for the trunk, it holds more than a big Mercedes'.  Yet for all its room
and comfort, Corrado is first and foremost a driver's car.
<p>
You won't find the usual jumble of faux fighter pilot paraphernalia here.
Rather, an environment engineered to inform, not entertain.  One that is
surprisingly quiet.
Thanks to a Volkswagen innovation called a decoupled longitudinal beam.
<p>
In the event the peace and quiet gets to you, there's always the premium
Heidelberg sound system with six speakers.  In fact, Corrado has everything
from a trip computer, air conditioning, height-adjustable steering column,
cruise control, power windows, door locks and mirrors, to 15" alloy wheels
and fog lamps.
All standard.
<p>
As you might expect, this kind of sports car isn't mass produced.  Corrado
is built in limited numbers by one of  Europe's last great coachworks, Karmann.
<p>
Enhanced by perhaps the greatest technological breakthrough of all time.
The human hand.
<p>
A thorough examination will tell you that the art of custom craftsmanship
and attention to detail is still being rigorously practiced.
<p>
Given the fact that production is limited.
Given the fact that Corrado is only $17,900.
We suggest you visit your Volkswagen dealer.
And experience all the engineering that makes this very special sports car a
Volkswagen.
<p>
$17,900.
It's time to think about Volkswagen again.

Lots of COOL stuff.


<A NAME="3"><H2>PURPOSE:</H2></A>

<p>
The purpose of this Frequently Asked Question [FAQ] file is to provide a
*short* summary of the resources available pertaining predominantly to
Watercooled [W] VWs, where this information is posted, archived and accessible
to you.

<p>
Due to its origin, the FAQs are mostly geared towards the US Market,
where cars based on the Jetta/Golf/Rabbit platforms of all three generations
are the most prevelent.<BR>
As a consequence, the focus is mostly on fuel injected cars with
emmission control devices.

<p>
The intent is to keep this file short to encourage easy distribution
(some mailers do not allow files above a certain size to be received)
and increase awareness to the VW community of the availability of
these resources.

<p>
This FAQ was derivative from the general watercooled VW FAQ
rec.autos.vw volume can be reduced.


<A NAME="4"><H2>The FAQs please:</H2></A>

<p>
Here is a quick summary. Details follow. What I tried to do here is
dissasociate information with where it is stored and how it can be
accessed.

<p>
The following types of (electronic) information are available:

<UL>
  <LI> The Watercooled VW FAQs:
                Info FAQ		&lt;=== You are reading this file
                General FAQ<BR>
                Technical FAQ<BR>
                Performance FAQs<BR>
  <LI> The Watercooled VW archives (includes the FAQs)
  <LI> Other Archives (e.g., Team.Net, New Dimension's [ND], AOL, ...)

</UL>
<p>
The originals of these [W] VW FAQs and the [W] VW Archives are being
maintained by the author. However, there are now numerous sites
available that have a portion or a modified form of these archives available.
There are also other archive sites, either on Internet or on other BBSs
archives that contain either VW or other car related material.

<p>
The [W] VW FAQs are also periodically posted on rec.autos.vw, rec.answers,
news.answers and automatically updated at the rtfm site at MIT where all
the other UseNet FAQs live.

<p>
The following electronic services are available:

<p>
   To access the info:<BR>
<UL>
  <LI> File access to retrieve the archives (ftp, gopher, archie, ftp-by-mail)
  <LI> Hypermedia access to home pages (WWW, URL, xmosaic, netscape, lynx)
  <LI> Archives on other BBS systems

</UL>
<p>
   To discuss and distribute info related to VWs/cars:
<UL>
  <LI> Usenet (rec.autos.vw)
  <LI> Mailing lists for discussion of certain topics (e.g., Corrados)
  <LI> Other BBS's for discussions and accessing archives
          (e.g., New Dimension's, AOL, ...)


</UL>
<p>
Confused?<BR>
Most of the archives and discussion groups are avaible on the Internet,
while a few others require you to log into a BBS system directly with a modem
(e.g., New Dimensions).

<p>
If you have direct Internet access then you can directly
transfer files, send mail, read Usenet, or browse home pages with a variety
of programs that often come with your System or be bought for a small sum.
Internet is now also available through third party services such as
AOL, Compuserve and others, and they may or may not provide all the
standard Internet services mentioned here.

<A NAME="18"><H2>THE WORLD WIDE WEB</H2></A>

<p>
This is the most convenient and most modern way to access the archives,
text, graphics, sounds, movies that is becoming increasingly available.

<p>
Here is a list of VW and other car related sites.
Some of these sites offer duplicates of the [W] Archives, or variations
thereof.<BR>
To access these sites you'll need programs such as mosaic or xmosaic of NTSA,
Unix lynx, netscape or similar.<BR>
The "http://some.address/subdirs/filename" is called the Universal Resource
Locator [URL] and tells those programs where that file is located and
how it should be accessed.<BR>
Filenames with a ".html" extensions (for HyperText Markup Language)
contain formatting instruction and links to other sites that are interpreted
by the above programs.

<p>
A tip from Kenneth Finnegan: Some browsers puke if you don't put a trailing /
on the address.For example: http://ug.cs.dal.ca/~gajewski/corrado.html/

<A NAME="20"><H2>THE ARCHIVES SITES</H2></A>

<p>
These methods will allow you to retrieve archives and other information
in a more manual way. Pictures, movies, etc are usually first compressed
and converted to an ASCII format (uuencode, BinHex, etc) before sent
to you through the net.


<A NAME="21"><H4>ACCESS BY FTP:</H4></A>

<p>
   FTP (for File Transfer Protocol) is one of the older methods to
   exchange files between machines on the internet.

<p>
   If you have a Unix or VMS system hooked up to Internet the following
   commands should work for you. If however you are accessing Internet
   through a MacIntosh/Finder, IBM-type machine, or are accessing Usenet/News
   or Internet indirectly through AOL/CompuServe/Others, the procedure may
   be different or access may not exist.
   However, before contacting either Jan, Blake or Dan, please try to find out
   the capabilities of your service first to try to access those files directly.
   If neither methods listed work, as a last resort, contact one of us
   and explicitely say that you tried but failed.
   Note that the server is sometimes down, or time-outs occur due to
   net traffic, so please try a couple times before complaining.
   We cannot provide you with any help setting up access to Internet, ftp,
   or alternate access methods (because we simple don't know either).

<p>
   A typical ftp session works as follows from the command line (Unix/VMS).
   Substitute all items in &lt;&gt; with strings:

<p>
                ftp &lt;address, e.g. ftp.lap.umd.edu&gt;
                Login as: anonymous<BR>
                Passwd: &lt;your-email-addres, for me = jan@ug.eds.com&gt;
                cd &lt;the directory to go to, e.g., pub or vw_archives&gt;
                ls<BR>
                get &lt;file&gt;<BR>
                ....<BR>

<STRONG>DISCUSSION GROUPS</STRONG>
<HR>

<A NAME="25"><H2>USENET</H2></A>

<p>
Usenet is one of the largest, world wide set of discussion groups.
There are a variety of car related groups, the most relevant here is:

<p>
rec.autos.vw

<p>
The FAQs are periodically posted on this group.
There are many programs that provide access to UseNet. On VMS there is
News, Unix: rn, xrn, gnus, through the WWW, and there are readers
for Macs, PCs, etc. AOL, CompuServe and other providers also
provide access to UseNet in some form or another.

<p>
Q: How do I post on rec.autos.vw if you do not have usenet access
   but do have internet e-mail access?<BR>
<OL>
  <LI> Send your posting to rec-autos-vw@cs.utexas.edu   (128.83.139.9)
   Note replacement of '.'s with '-'s in group name.
   This works for other groups as well.

  <LI> Where can I get "general" info on cars?
  <LI> See Richard Welty's FAQ postings in rec.autos.* first, or in the archives
   mentioned above.

  <LI> Is VW monitoring UseNet? Who else is monitoring UseNet or one of the
   mail list servers?<BR>
  <LI> VW does have a web page, but that does not mean they
   monitor any of the groups or mail list servers.
   However, several of the tuners (ND, AMS, VT, ???) and car magazine
   authors/editors (EC, VWT, Greg Raven) are currently monitoring and
   participating on either UseNet or one of the Mail List discussion groups
   using either their real name or an alias.
   I personally welcome their presence, but please do not expect them
   to provide you with answers to any of your questions.
   They are all busy people, and they may have certain reasons why they
   may not want to answer any of your questions (liability).
   On the other hand, be also aware of the reverse, that one tuner
   may put down an other's products.

<A NAME="26"><H2>MAIL SERVERS</H2></A>

<p>
A mail server is a centralized site where all mail messages received
are retransmitted to all the subscribers.
To become member of such a mail server, you typically have to send
a message to either a person or the mail server.

<p>
The following is taken from Richard Welty's Automobile Mailing List FAQ:

<p>
        ---- Text from Richard ---

<p>
There are a number of electronic mailing lists on the network devoted to
various special automotive topics.  Some of these are very specialized,
and at the end of this posting I list a number that are focused on
the activities of specific localized clubs.

<p>
The list of available sites is available at:

<p>
ftp://ftp.balltown.cma.com/pub/misc/Autos/mailing-lists.text

<p>
or at the rtfm.mit.edu site with all the rec.autos.* groups.

<p>
It is maintained by Richard Welty (welty@balltown.cma.com).

<p>
Most mailing lists provide separate addresses for administrative
queries and for general mail; where separate administrative
addresses exist, I have listed those below, as the general addresses
are not appropriate for inquirys and requests.

<p>
Listserv, listproc &amp; majordomo:

<p>
these are the three most common automatic list handlers.  Listserv
and listproc take similar commands; majordomo is subtly different.
commands for all three should be in the body of the mail message.
a listserv/listproc request to join the honda list should look like
the following:

<p>
sub HONDA-L Joe. W. Newbie

<p>
note the real name.  listserv/listproc will get the email address from the
message header.

<p>
a majordomo request to join the italian cars list should look like

<p>
subscribe italian-cars newbie@aol.com

<p>
note the email address and lack of real name.  the email address is
optional; if omitted, majordomo will extract the real name from
the message header (this is often the best way to handle this.)
        ---- End Text from Richard ---

<p>
This FAQ is divided into a preamble and a list of subjects. Each
subject is described by a list of questions and answers.

<p>
This FAQ is split into four individual postings:

<p>
                Info FAQ<BR>
                General FAQ		&lt;=== You are reading this file
                Technical FAQ<BR>
                Performance FAQs

<p>
This FAQ handles mostly general questions regarding Water Cooled VWs, while the
Technical FAQ focusses mostly on the technical aspects, procedures and
tools for water cooled VWs.<BR>
Whereas the technical FAQ deals mostly with maintaining the status
quo with your car, the fourth FAQ deals with improving upon the stock
design and performance.<BR>
The Info FAQ describes where to obtain additional information, where
the archives sites are, and other related WWW/URL sites.

<p>
Due to its origin, the FAQs are mostly geared towards the US Market,
where cars based on the Jetta/Golf/Rabbit platforms of all three generations
are the most prevelent.<BR>
As a consequence, the focus is mostly on fuel injected cars with
emmission control devices.

<A NAME="3"><H2>PURPOSE:</H2></A>

<p>
The purpose of this FAQ is to address frequently-asked questions as
a whole, so that rec.autos.vw volume can be reduced.  Towards this end,
we assembled a list of common questions, and some general answers to
these questions.  Most answers are assumed to be correct to some degree,
but there is absolutely no guarantee that anything is correct.
Product information is supplied for your convenience, but any product
mention is not intended as an endorsement or an advertisement.
In addition, products change, quality may improve or degrade, new ones
may supersede existing ones, and therefore all the data here is to be taken
as transient.<BR>
What is considered the best oil today may be the worst tomorrow.

Q: Where can I retrieve these FAQs, where can I obtain the VW archives
   and other related information?<BR>
<OL>
  <LI> See the VW Info FAQ.


  <LI> What does [W] and [A] mean in the UseNet posting headers?
  <LI> [W] = Watercooled subjects.
   [A] = Aircooled subjects.<BR>
   Please use this to allow people to filter out irrelevant articles.


  <LI> What are the best manuals for my car?
  <LI> Robert Bentley Manuals:
   "Official Factory Manuals" series. Available from the publisher
   1000 Massachusetts Avenue, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02138
   (800) 423-4595, (216) 572-0725 (?) (617) 547-4170
   VW &amp; other US mailorder houses.<BR>
   Currently NOT available outside North America.
   Covers ONLY cars sold in the US &amp; Canada.
   NOTE according to (rgolen@UMASSD.EDU) there are TWO types of
   Bentley manuals:<BR>
   VW Service Manual= Aimed for amateurs (us!)
   VW Repair Manual = Geared for experienced/professionals
   Bentley is setting up a home page. Domain name: RB.com

</OL>
<p>
   John Muir:<BR>
   "Complete Idiot Guide to keep your water cooled VW alive".
   John Muir Publications Inc., Box 613, Santa Fe, NM 87504
   (800) 888 9079 (?) (800) 888-7504 (?)
   or try Classic Motorbooks 1-800-826-6600, or KdF Enterprises?
   (Rumored to be out of print, A-1 cars only, but has lots of
   advice/procedures that are still valid today)

<p>
   Greg Raven:<BR>
   "Volkswagen Water-Cooled, Front-Drive Performance Book"
   Available from US mailorder houses.<BR>
   greg.ihr@kaiwan.com

<p>
   [Vack] Peter Vack, The Volkswagen Buyer's Guide. 1-800-826-6600 (Motorbooks
   International), $16.95.<BR>
   Discusses the VW models and VW's technology (i.e., VR6 &amp; G60)
   over the years (up to the Corrado).<BR>
   It claims that: "Overall, the Corrado had a classical shape that
   harked back to the old Ferrari 275 GTB/4 and is appreciated by
   enthusiasts."  In general, an interesting book.

<p>
   Haynes:<BR>
   "Modify Your Golf/GTI" (available from Rapid Parts) "VW Service Manual".
   Also available outside North America.

<p>
   Chiltons:<BR>
   Chilton Way, Radnor PA 19089<BR>
   (800) 695 12 14, (215) 964 40 00, (215) 964 47 45
   "Front Wheel Drive VW(?), 1974-1990", Item # 6962
   The main problem with Chilton is that it contains ALL FWD VWs
   from 1974-1990 in one small paper back book, using fuzzy pictures,
   and even pictures from *other* car makes.
   Chilton is generally not the preferred book to buy, but in some
   cases there may be no alternative.

<p>
   Caveat:<BR>
   For regular service, my personal [jan] preference goes to Bentley (old
   style), Muir (A1 cars), Bentley (new style).
   For newer cars, I look in the older books which gives detailed
   instructions, than turn to the new style Bentleys and try to figure out
   what to do there.<BR>
   Back issues of EuroCar/VW&amp;P &amp; ?? (=British car mag) also contain detailed
   tech procedures that may be of use.<BR>
   I have both Haynes and Chiltons, and find them entertaining but never use
   them.<BR>
   Naturally, your preferences may vary.

<p>
   Bentley:<BR>
   "Bosch Fuel Injection and Engine Management", Charles Probst, available
   from Classic Motorbooks, Bentley and others.
   This "Bosch Bible" fully explains the theory, troubleshooting, and
   service of all Bosch systems from D-Jetronic through the latest Motronics.
   Sftbd., 8" X 10", 192 pgs., 475 ill.
   More of a specialized book.

<p>
   Auto-Bound at (800) 523-5833 has been quoted a couple of times as
   a good supplier for some of these books.

<p>

   The new Corrado (1990)   	WSP 521-202-00


<p>
Q: Can I get VW Service Bulletins?<BR>
<OL>
  <LI> YES, and you can get the index for free!
   Pick a flyer from your VW dealer or call: (800) 544 80 21
   The bulletins are referred to by a "V" group number - year - index
   e.g., V13-91-06<BR>
   The actual bulletins cost $4.00 for the first, US$2.00 for each subsequent
   one. You can also order a yearly subscription, in which case they also send
   you a library of all microfilmed repair manuals.

</OL>
<p>
   Some car stores, such as SuperTrak in LA, have a computer with a
   CDROM with all these bulletins, and allow you to scan through this data
   base for free.

<p>
   There is now also an online site that provides access (for a fee).

<p>
Q: I am going to Germany, what can I visit that may be of interest?
<OL>
  <LI> While in Wolfsburg, make sure you go to the VW Factory Museum!!! If
   you have some time before you leave write to:
   Hans-Jurgen Klar<BR>
   Besucherdienst (Visitors' Bureau)<BR>
   Volkswagen AG<BR>
   D-38436 Wolfsburg<BR>
   (0 53 61) 9-20200	-- drop the first zero if calling from abroad
   Fax (0 53 61) 92 44 79

</OL>
<p>
   Ask them for help, advise, etc. see if they can arrange for your tours
   of both the museum and the factory. Plant tours are at 1:00 pm and
   last about 1.5 hrs. Visit the VW museum...open from 9 to 5.
   When you go to the museum, make sure you have lots of film and lots
   of money. The museum store (actually three large display cases) has
   a lot of neat VW stuff!

<p>
   Automotive Museum in Sinsheim (on the autobahn A6 which runs from
   Mannheim to Heilbron - near Heilbron).
   There they have a whole museum full of cars - the Blue Flame, a DeLorean,
   the first Wanklemotor car (rotor engine I think), it's a real treat.

<p>
Q: What's A-1 and the A-2 designations mean I see all the time?
<OL>
  <LI> The A-1 and A-2 designate the platform/generation the car is based upon.
   A-1 (or Mark-1) were the first generation water cooled VWs such as the
   Rabbit/Golf I, Jetta I, Cabriolet, and Scirocco I &amp; II.
   A-2 based VWs are the Golf II, Jetta II, and the Corrado.
   A-3 is the latest platform, which includes the Golf III, Jetta III/Vento,
   and the yet to be released new Cabriolet.
   VWs based on the same platform share many of the same components such as
   suspension components (rear torsion beam, sway bars).
   This however does not imply that the engines are the same within one
   platform.<BR>
   Within one platform, many different engines are available (mostly Europe.
   The old Golfs came with anything from a 1.1l to an 1.8l, including
   diesels), and across different platforms you may also find many of same
   engines (the 2.0l 16V is used in the A2 Golf GTIs and the B3 Passats).
   Therefore similar engines will share similar parts, and certain
   improvements from one platform can often be transformed to the other
   (e.g. exhaust manifolds from an 81 GTI to an 84 S).
   There's a complete list by Tom H at the end. It includes Euro &amp; US models!

  <LI> What is captured in the US Vehicle Identification Number?

<p>
   NOTE: The letters "I" and "O" in the Model Year table above have been
   skipped, probably to avoid confusion with the digits "1" and "0"
   respectively.

<p>
   NOTE: Many other nations use the Chassis number only, and they can often
   be found stamped somewhere on the car's body, usually in the engine
   compartment. The format is very similar. Example 81 S:

<p>
   W V W   Z Z Z 5 3   z B K   0 1 2 3 4 5

<p>
   "Z" and "z" is used as a filler, there is no special meaning behind it.

Q: What does the Karmann badge on some VWs mean?
<OL>
  <LI> Karmann refers to the body builder for VW, which made/makes all
   Sciroccos/Cabriolets/Corrados. Karmann has been around for a long time.
   One of the most famous Karmann-VW projects was the Karmann Ghia,
   which was a pretty thinly disguised Porsche.
   Ghia is also still around, but now works with Ford.
   Some of it from [e0ewqbwu@tuzo.erin.utoronto.ca].

  <LI> What are VWs OEMs (Original Equipment Manufacturer)?
  <LI> VW makes cars, which is an assembly of components, but not all components
   are made by VW. In fact, VW makes mainly the body and the power train, the
   rest they buy from elsewhere.<BR>
   The OEM parts can often be had for less than buying the same VW part.
   Most of the ones listed below will have a VW part number, but are also to
   be had directly from the OEM w/o the VW part number.
   For example MANN makes VW filters with the VW label, but the same filter
   also exists with the MANN label.<BR>
   In other cases, VW uses parts w/o restamping or hiding the OEM name for
   marketing reasons, e.g., Recaro seats, BBS rims.
   The OEM suppliers are (not exhaustive, changes frequently):

Q: Where can I get DISCOUNT and PERFORMANCE parts?
<OL>
  <LI> Many of these retailers sell the same OEM parts VW uses anywhere from
   10% to 60% less. (See above for the OEM brand names).

</OL>
<p>
   Always check carefully the brand before buying
   because some substitutes may be offered by other manufacturers
   but with lower quality. It's best to stick with OEM or
   better/performance brands.

<p>
   NOTE: The contents of this list now also includes references of shops
   that do more than just sell OEM parts.
   I also included retailers that sell performance parts made by some of the
   "tuners" and performance manufacturers.

      Profile:
      It's a regular dealership that is now specializing more in parts
      distribution, and has a casual relationship with some of the
      performance shops like APS. They also deal with the magazines,
      lending out test cars.
      Some of the people that work there such as Mike Potter (parts)
      auto-x their VWs (Scirocco for Mike) and are therefore more
      "knowledgeable" than the average place.
      Don't bother Mike too much because he is very buzy.

Q: Who are the VW (performance) tuners?
<OL>
  <LI> This is surprisingly harder to answer than it may seem because it
   depends on what you mean by a "tuner".
   For example, Neuspeed is a VW performance brand sold by APS &amp;
   other retail outlets. APS can give you advice on their parts,
   but will not install them or do custom work on your car.
   However, AMS, ND, VWSpecialties, Velocity Tuning and others are "tuners"
   because they will customize your car using their own products
   (ND Turbo systems) or other "tuner/manufacturer" products (AT, Neuspeed).


</OL>
<p>
   This list is mostly geared to USA &amp; Canada. Some German addresses
   are also mentioned. In the UK &amp; D, see EU_VW_Tuners in the VW archives.
   To be added to this list, you must be an established bonafide business,
   tuner or mail order house. Brief user feedback as posted publically
   may also be added.

      Makes custom chips for cars (concentrates on the whole program
      range). Supposedly initially trained APS on how to make chips.

      Profile:
      Primary retailer of Neuspeed products and a few OEM parts (brakes,
      lights, etc).
      Parts usually fit in stock positions and are usually CA smog legal.
      Their performance philosophy is: Make it breathe (exhaust)
      stiffen and lowered suspension (usualy Bilstein).
      They also sell chips, but some claim that they concentrate mostly
      on the top end, not the low.
      Owned by Bill Neuman (who "ruthlessly" runs the place) and aided
      by his two sons: Aaron and Gary Neuman (who are both very technically
      capable and nicer then some of the people occasionally answering
      the phone). Unlike a regular "PARTS" place they can provide advice
      on how to customize your car with their products, but they will
      not do any custom work anymore.
      Pretty much all the parts you buy from them are good quality.
      Note: Neuspeed products can be bought elsewhere for less (e.g., ND,
      Plain Wrap, VW Specialties).

Q: What are some of the brand name namufacturer/product addresses?
<OL>
  <LI> It's not always clear where something belongs, e.g.,
   Zender is a product name, and a tuner. Therefore, see also the other lists.
   There are no strict criteria to be added to this list, and to be
   listed (or not) is not meant as an endorsement!
   In addition, most of the product names mentioned are not purely

Q: What does 'Fahrvergnuegen' mean (current commercial jingle in NA)?
<OL>
  <LI> Fahrvergnuegen (with ue=u") means 'pleasure of driving', and VW claims
   it can only be experienced in a VW. I think most of us could find
   similar pleasure in a 911 Turbo, though :-).

  <LI> Who did the music on the US/Canada VW commercial?
  <LI> "Harry's Game" from the album "Anam" on Atlantic Records by the Irish group
   Clannad.

  <LI> Where did VW car names come from?
  <LI> Most of the European names given to VWs came from wind names.
   In other countries, the same models may bear different names, such as
   the Golf I called the Rabbit in the US and Caribe (?) in Mexico.
   More recently, VW started adopting other naming convetions (e.g.,
   Corrado). (Enhanced with Dennis's notes).

</OL>
<p>
   Scirocco	- Hot North African desert wind that blows into Italy
                  Original name was rumored to be Blizzard.
   Golf		- Gulf stream winds (a high altitude North-south 100 mmph wind)
   Jetta	- Jet stream (East/West wind, affecting Pacific air travel)
   Passat	- Trade winds<BR>
   Vento	- Blowing/windy (E/I)<BR>
   Polo		- ?<BR>
   Santana	- Hot desert blast accross the Sea of Cortez.
   Corrado	- Not a wind, it's derived from Spanish Correr which means to
<PRE>
                  run. The original name for the car was Taifun (Typhoon)
                  which means huricane except it was already a registered

<p>
Q: What does GTI, GLI and so on mean?<BR>
<OL>
  <LI> L       = Luxe (base model)
   LS      = Luxe Special, couple more do-dads
   GT      = Grand Tourisme, better equipped &amp; usually a larger engine than
             the "L" series<BR>
   GL      = Grand Luxe (geared for more luxury), basically == GT
   GTI/GLI = Originally, the fuel injected version of a GT/GL which means it
             produced a lot more power. With most cars FI, the GTI/GLI
             designation means a more powerful engine than a GT/GL model,
             sometimes also with a better suspension. Note that originally,
             GLI != Jetta, as the case in the USA.
   SL      = Serie Limite' (limited series), like the Karmann series in US.
             Really a variation on a GT.
   GTX     = Same as GTI but used in Europe and elsewhere.
   G40/60  = GT version with VWs G-type supercharger. The number is the width
             of the G-charger (lader in D) coil in millimeters. For those who
             aren't aware, the G40 is used on some Polos, the G60 on Passats
             and Corrados.<BR>
   VR6     = Cars based on the new staggered 6 cylinder engine (in-line-V-6).
   SLC     = Sport Luxury Coupe, the VR6 equipped Corrado in the US.
   Syncro  = VWs version 4WD distributes its torque with a "visco-gear"
             (It's a special silicone gel that stiffens if the relative
             motion (shear) increases)<BR>
             VWs 4WD is designed by Steyr-Puch, an Austrian Company and not
             by Audi.

</OL>
<p>
   Originally, all European VWs were carbureted, except those with the "I" or
   "i" and a few rare cases with an "E" for "Einspritzung", designation which had
   a more powerful fuel injected engine, a "GT" set-up, and some more sporty
   equipment (suspension, gauges).<BR>
   In the US, VW switched over to FI first with the '76 limited
   edition Super Scirocco and in 77 to the rest of VW's watercooled
   cars, and in Europe a bit later (with mono-throttle FI) which meant that
   all cars really counted as "I" models.
   GTI/GLI now just means that the car has a more powerful engine and a
   sportier set-up.

<p>
   Note also that the US, only gets the two top of the line VWs from their
   larger mass produced series (but not the Polo).
   Certain special models, such as the Golf G60 Synchro, the US will never
   see.<BR>
   In Europe, VWs came with anywhere from 1100, 1300 to 2900 cc engines. The
   US never saw the 1100 &amp; the 1300's and only sees a slightly scaled down
   version of the 2900.


<p>
Q: Is VW the inventor of the VR6 and G-charger design?
<OL>
  <LI> No in both cases. Most of the car "novelties" you see now on the road
   have been invented between 50 and 100 years ago.
   The reason why you only see these innovations pop up now is because
   many of these innovations where not economically feasible to be
   mass produced.

</OL>
<p>
   For example, the G-charger, was pattented in 1905 [Vack], was to replace the
   common piston driven steam engine, requires very precise machining that
   can only be achieved with current day NC machine tools.

<p>
   The VR6 design is modeled after an 18 degree V4 made by Vincenzo
   Lancia for the Lancia Aprilia [Vack].

<p>
   ABS is also nothing new, a mechanical version based on centripetal
   forces was used on German trucks during WWII.
   Similarly, Turbo chargers were first used on Messerschmidt planes
   to compensate for thinner air at altitude.
   However, if there is one thing VW should get credit for is applying
   some of these innovation and making it economically feasible to
   produce. Not a simple feat.


<p>
Q: What is VW's heritage?<BR>
<OL>
  <LI> [By Jan &amp; Rauhut]:
   VW was founded by the controversial Adolf with the goal to make
   an affordable and reliable car available to everyone.
   That's also where the name came from, Volkswagen litterally meaning
   "People's car". There were other similar efforts, such as the "Volks" radio,
   but only the car remained until now.
   In May 1938 VW built the first factory nearby Fallersleben, which
   is now Wolfsburg. Prof. Ferdinand Porsche designed the first Beetle in
   the thirties. The beetle was presented by the Nazis as "Kraft durch Freude"
   "Power of Fun" car, which was a part of the Nazis philosophy. Due to the
   WWII VW did not sell much beetles until 1945. After WWII VW sold altogether
   15.235.200 Beetles.<BR>
   VW produced some other air cooled, rear-wheel drive cars. The VW 1500,
   VW 1600 were produced from 1961 until 1973. They looked like a long
   beetle, VW managed to sell 2.583.015 units. The VW 411, VW 412 were
   produced from 1986 until 1974, 355.200 units were sold.
   In the late 60s, VW realized it needed to diversify its product
   line and acquired a number of companies such as NSU (1970) and
   Audi (1969). Audi (Audi NSU Auto Union) was summary of the companies
   Audi, part of NSU, DKW and Auto-Union. In the early 80's VW acquired the
   Spanish SEAT (pronounced Say-Ath), and in the late 80's Skoda after the
   Berlin wall came tumbling down.

</OL>
<p>
   NSU had a few interesting products such as the K70 and Ro80.
   The K 70 was developed by NSU, Neckarsulm, in 1969, and VW
   sold the K 70 as the VW K70 from 1970 until 1974. Altogether
   210.082 units were sold.

<p>
   The K70 was sold with two different engines: 1.6l with 75 hpwr and
   1.8l with 100 hpwr. The VW K70, developed by NSU, was the first VW with
   a water cooled engine and first front-wheel drive car.It resembled a
   boxy version of the first Jetta.

<p>
   Another one of NSU interesting products was the Ro80, probably the
   first production car with a Wankel (rotary) engine. The Ro80 was sold
   from 1967 until 1974, 33910 Units were sold. The Ro80 had a 0.5l(!) engine
   with 115 hpwr. Its production was stopped due to persistent problems,
   but was at the time a very innovative and modern looking car.

<p>
   Probably the most lasting influence to the VW product line was made
   by Audi whose Audi 50 become the start of their new line of cars.
   The Audi 50 become known as the first VW Polo, and many of the drive
   train components are shared between VWs and Audis to this date.

<p>
Q: What's the relationship between VW, Audi and Porsche?
<OL>
  <LI> VW and Audi are under the same company whose name is
   "Volkswagen Audi Gesellschaft" (VAG).

</OL>
<p>
   They have separate research departments, separate assembly plants,
   but do share parts, engines and cars (US VW Quantum == Audi) on occasion.
   The original version of the Polo were actually made by Audi
   called the Audi 50. The basic 1500/1600 now 1800 cc block is also
   from the former Audi 80.<BR>
   In Europe it is not uncommon to have both dealers that sell and
   service both VWs and Audis (and sometimes also Porsches).
   In North America the two (three) are usually separate.

<p>
   Regarding VW &amp; Porsche (From Tom H.):
   There are no ownership arrangements -- the two companies are essentially
   separate.  There is, however, a lot of co-operation, as Porsche does
   consulting work for VW, and Porsche has some access to the VW parts bins.
   VW has also built some 914s, 924s and 944s for Porsche, and Porsche is
   to build the Audi 80 RS2 for VW.

<p>
   And of course Ferdinand Porsche designed the Beetle while running a
   design office in the 30s -- and Ferdinand Piech, the current CEO of
   Volkswagen AG, is his grandson.

<p>
   The relationship was much closer yet in the early years of VW and
   Porsche, when Heinz Nordhoff was running VW: this is when the 914 was
   conceived as a VW-Porsche. When Nordhoff died (in 1969?), the new CEO
   (who was that? I forget) did not want to honour all of Nordhoff's verbal
   agreements with Porsche. As a result, the relationship soured somewhat
   -- and the 914 was significantly more expensive than originally planned.

<p>
   One of the best books relating the VW/Porsche relationship is _Excellence_
   _was_Expected_ (which is primarily a Porsche book; alas, it's most certainly
   not cheap.

<p>
Q: What do the oval "B", "D" stickers on car's bumpers mean in Europe?

Summary of some recall campaigns, service actions, pre delivery campaigns
for Volkswagen models. This may not apply to some vehicles in CANADA or
the UNITED STATES, as some campaigns are not implemented in the respective
countries. This list may NOT be ACCURATE, for the correct information always
refer to you local dealer, who will be able to check for any outstanding
campaigns for vehicle.

<p>
Please note, that the biggest problem for any manufacturer is the notification
of the owners. Please advise them of the purchase of the vehicle, if the
vehicle is used from a non VW dealer or private source and any
address changes. Again, your local dealer is more then willing to help you
in this matter.

<A NAME="33"><H2>Other Known Failures/Technical Service Bulletins:</H2></A>

<p>
This section contains common known failures reported by VW users or
VW magazines, and "official" Technical Service Bulletins (TSB) from VW.
The TSBs are VWs way to tell all the mechanics: "If you see this
problem, do that". That's all. They are NOT recalls, and do not
imply any financial comittments.<BR>
If your car is under warrantee you will not have to pay, if not, you pay.
With any problem, you always have to be able to recreate it.
However, not all dealers are up to date with their TSBs (:-&lt;) and
on some occasions we can use knowledge of these TSBs to point to
a potential solution and also point out that your case may not be
unique. The TSBs are identified by a number: V35-92-01. See elsewhere
in this FAQ on how to obtain them (I have to rearrange things a bit
as soon as I have time).


<p>
   83-86 GTI, GLIs, 84-86 Cabriolets, 83-86 Sciroccos except 16V, 84-86 Cabs:
   Self Machining Transmission due to lack of snap rings on the differential
   shafts. See April 1990, EuroCar pp 53, "VW 020 Gearbox Failures: Causes and
   Cures". Only Close ratio transaxles are affected.
   Starting at serial number 15102 (built after october 14th 1982).
   Serial numbers up to 14102, (built up to October 14,1982) are immune.
   VW part#171-498-088 offers the clips as part of the rebuild kit.
   (Another sources says: If either rivet has been removed, secure the
   differential pinion shaft with circlips, Part No. N 042 363 1.)
   Gear oil leaking under the tranny, or strange noises are first signs,
   between 50k and 120k miles.<BR>
   NO RECALL! Sue VW. Techtonics Tuning is recommended by VW&amp;P to fix selfmachined 
   cases (probably because they wrote the article).

   In California, I've just read<BR>
   that Univ of Dayton (Ohio) scientist has finally figured out what went
   wrong with the Low-Aromatics-Diesel introduced in California.  Apparently
   the lack of armomatics and sulfur allowed oxidation of the fuel (when
   meeting up with heat and oxygen) to form peroxide.  This peroxide wasn't
   detected in the fuel, but was found on the damaged oil rings.  All major
   refiners in Calif. are now blending anti-oxidant additives.
   (per U.S. Oil Week 6/06/94)

<p>
   Today's newspaper (9/3/94) reported that legislation to repay those of
   us who have lost diesel injector pumps from the 'new and improved' diesel
   fuel, has been signed by Gov Re_Pete Wilson.
   Reimbursment of up to $450 bucks for cars and $550 bucks for trucks
   will be alloted to those who have suffered damages.
   Details on how to get reimbusrsed will be published in the newspapers later
   this year.  The Senate and Assembly passed the bill in August.

<p>
   March 1, 1995 is the deadline for filing a claim with the State of
   California for replacement or reimbursement for damages to your

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;MORE???? Pls provide recall campaign &amp; number &amp; a 1 line description

<p>
Q: I heard there is a recall on my Golf/Jetta/GTI heater core. What do I do?
<OL>
  <LI> The recall affects only '85-'90 cars of the above models, although older A1
   VWs have had heater cores fail also. For some time, VW was replacing cores
   under a 'goodwill program', and now the recall is official.
   VW recommends that if you are experiencing any of the typical symptoms,
   take your car to the nearest authorized VW dealer.
   If you paid to have the work before, AND you can prove it, they will
   reimburse you.

  <LI> What are the symptoms of a leaky/bad heater core?
  <LI> A smell of coolant coming from your vents when the heater is on, an unusual
   amount of fogging of the windshield, and in some extreme cases, coolant
   leaking into the inside of the car, burning the occupants.

</OL>
<p>
   There are many cases in which the front passenger or the driver
   himself were hurt. First known cases in Japan, VW recalled the
   questionable cars (only in Japan!). Later many cases in Germany,
   too, but VW waited with a recall since Feb. (?) 1996.


<p>
Q: My A/C is smelly after use, especially during humid summer months?
<OL>
  <LI> A kit to alleviate this from (313)-774-4300, which removes mildew from
   evaporators. Of course first you should try spraying 1/4 can of Lysol down
   the fresh air entry vent, WITH THE DOORS AND WINDOWS OPEN!!

  <LI> My radio keeps on playing when the car is turned off?
  <LI> This is normal. Most VWs sold up to 1992 will play with the car turned off.
   You can change that by using the switched power wire instead of the "always
   hot" wire. Newer VWs have found a compromise: The radio will play after the
   car is shut off as long as the key remains in the ignition.
   NOTE however...this will probably NOT work with coded radios.

  <LI> My oxygen sensor light has come on. What am I supposed to do?
  <LI> Change the oxygen sensor (aka Lambda Sensor), and reset the oxygen sensor
   light. Oxygen sensors are to be changed every 30k/60k miles depending
   on your car. Many claim that the newer heated 3 wire ox. sensor can last a
   lot longer than the designated 30/60 k miles. This is probably true, but
   when it does go, your car will run very rich!
   Some have reported poor running conditions, rough idle and significant loss
   of power as well (recent news thread on r.a.t).
   A bad O2 sensor will increase the catalytic converter temperature
   significantly and could lead the substrate to loosen from the casing
   (happened to me). You will hear a distinct rattling from your exhaust, and
   eventually clog the exhaust system.<BR>
   Note, engine temp will also increase, risking engine damage and possible
   fire.<BR>
   This increases back pressure and decreases the car's power to the point
   where it may not sustain highway speeds.
   Again depending on your model, a cat. conv. can be very expensive (US$400-
   US$800 in my case), while the ox. sensor is about US$100. If you decide not
   to replace the sensor, do follow Bentley's procedure periodically to check
   whether it's still ok!

</OL>
<p>
   Note from M Sirota: I found a 16V converter at Wolf Sport for $365. I've
   actually found a new 16V converter at Techtonics for only $125, but they
   say it sucks.

<p>
Q: How do I reset the oxygen sensor light?
<OL>
  <LI> The oxygen sensor light is attached to a small odometer which trips a
   switch every 30/60k miles. To turn the oxy light off, you have to reset
   that odometer. VW has two locations for this unit: Either somewhere along
   the speedometer cable, or as part of the instrument cluster.

</OL>
<p>
   A2 Jettas &amp; Golfs: Remove the coolant reservoir to locate the box with the
   white recessed switch. Push it in far until you hear a satisfying click.
   You should only need to push once. The "box" is black, and the speedometer
   cable passes through it.

<p>
Q: I have a Clock, not a tach, can I get a "new" instrument cluster?
   [blu@cellar.org]<BR>
<OL>
  <LI> Yes! Any cluster from just about any late VW (Golf/Jetta2/Sirocco2), will
   work with any other cluster. There were a few changes through the years,
   but the speedo, tach, temp, fuel, and warning lights (ex. Upshift, and OXS)
   will work. I installed a cluster from an 85 Golf in my 89 and it works just
   fine. A "new" used unit can be installed in a Golf/Jetta in about 45 min,
   with minimal hand tools. The new gauge cluster will plug right into the
   existing hardware. It might make life a bit easier if you remove the
   steering wheel, however, its not necessary.
   While it *might* seem simple to just replace the clock with a tach, its
   not, this is fairly complex, and time consuming. I know you will "loose"
   your original mileage with the "new" used speedo, but trust me, its just
   simpler to do.

  <LI> What's a good car cover for my car? Will it scratch or dull my paint?
  <LI> Generally you are looking for a cover which is soft where it contacts
   the car paint, resists water from penetrating, breathes (trapped
   moisture dulls paint), and is mold resistant.
   Car covers made out of "Evolution 3" made by Kimberly Clark, or Technalon
   material seem to be the current favorites and satisfy the above. They do
   get wet with heavy rain or when the water repellent stuff wears off after a
   couple of washes.<BR>
   (For a sample call in the US (800) 424 80 00, code= 44-12-36).
   They are also pretty bulky, and if wet, heavy.
   I hose my covers down every couple of months and occasionally wash them in
   an industrial washer. Apply Scotch Guard to make it somewhat water
   repellent again.

</OL>
<p>
   Nylon covers are next to worthless.<BR>
   To minimize paint scratches, keep your car clean, keep the cover clean, and
   "roll" rather than slide the cover on.
   I have also found that rolling it on and of is by far the easiest way to
   cover the car. Install from the front.
   Get a lock, and the cover then serves as reasonable theft deterrent as
   well.

<p>
Q: Whenever it rains, the carpet in my VW gets wet?
<OL>
  <LI> There are two sources of this problem: The front of the car, and the rear.
   Front: Rust around windshield, antenna wire or other holes not plugged
   right. Better fix this because if it leaks at the driver's side it may
   short out your fuse box. Also check all the rubber grommets that plug the
   holes.

</OL>
<p>
   [eldred@csi.jpl.nasa.gov] There are 2 water drain holes in the area just
   below the hood vents forward of the windshield which tend to get clogged
   with leaves. Make sure these are clear. If the water doesn't drain fast
   enough it will come through the vent air intake.

<p>
   [From finnegan@navo.navy.mil:]<BR>
   A break in the plastic drip shield which runs across the top of the
   firewall under the hood can allow copious amounts of water to flow into
   the fresh air intake vent. Replace the shield.

<p>
   Rear: Water leaks resulting in large puddles in the rear seat footwells are
   generally caused by poor seals against the door windows, and broken seal
   on the door liners.<BR>
   The window seals are easily replaceable. To replace the seal inside the
   door, you have to remove the inner door panel, which is quite easy as well.
   Glue a thick sheet of plastic between the door frame and the door panel.

<p>
   See tech tips for more detail

<p>
   From Jens Knickmeyer: Every time I found water puddling in the car just in front of the drivers
   seat, the seals inside the door were defective. I had this problem
   on several cars (3 Polos, 1 Audi 80, 2 Golf). Thank heaven only
   the Polos were my cars!

<p>
Q: My back up lights don't work anymore, but the bulbs are ok!
<OL>
  <LI> Most likely your back up light switch in the transmission is broken. In
   some cars it will also disable the upshift indicator. According to
   rgolen@smucs1.umassd.edu, short shift kits reduce the longevity of these
   switches to 3-4 months.


</OL>
<p>
<A NAME="36"><H2>IT'S A FEATURE NOT A BUG!</H2></A>

<p>
Q: During hard cornering my inner rear wheel lifts. What's wrong? Is this
   bad?<BR>
<OL>
  <LI> This is normal behavior in all A-type (and probably other) VW's, and for
   that matter many other cars as well.
   VW dials in a lot of rear roll stiffness to reduce understeer.
   This with the limited rear wheel shock/spring travel distance
   causes the rear inner wheel to be lifted during hard cornering.
   It does not reduce performance much because the inner rear wheel
   has very little load at that point.<BR>
   Many other cars have the same feature to some degree or another.
   If you think a Porsche 911 will fix the problem, look closely,
   they lift their inner front wheel during hard cornering.

  <LI> My VR6 equiped VW (Corrado, Passats) rattles in idle, but the sound &lt;SOUND&gt;
   goes away when I push in the clutch!
  <LI> My VR6 equiped VW (Corrado, Passats) rattles when I take off &lt;SOUND&gt;
   It sounds like "Krrrrrrr"<BR>
  <LI> They all do that. According to Jens Knickmeyer:
   This problem is well known at VW. The reason is the gear-box. The tooth
   wheels (a pair for each gear) have too much space between the teeth
   which results in the rattle. Nothing to worry about, there are other
   cars with the same symptom (Polo-G40, Audi 100, VW LT28, ...)

</OL>
<p>
   Some reported similar problems with a heat shield ratteling
   but in that case the sound will be independent of whether you
   push the clutch in.

<p>
Q: The AC comes on when I turn on the defroster. What's wrong?
<OL>
  <LI> Sigh! Does anyone read the User's Manual anymore? The AC comes on to
   eliminate moisture. Works real well too!

</OL>
<p>
INTERCHANGING PARTS &amp; TOOLS<BR>
<HR>

<p>
Q: What VW parts are interchangeable between models &amp; years? (This is for all
   you junk-yard cats). Created on a suggestion by [dh3q@andrew.cmu.edu (Dan)]

<OL>
  <LI> General Rule:
   All cars based on the same platform are mechanically similar. When the
   engine is mostly the same, it'll share engine parts, exhaust, suspension,
   transmission, brakes, rear axle beam, most electrical components, sway
   bars. Different years may have different components, but the rule is
   usually that G &amp; J are about the same in one year while the S's and
   Corrados are usually a bit ahead and occasionally share components found in
   the next platform (e.g., The A2 based Corrados VR6/SLC have the A+
   suspension found on A3 GTIs).

</OL>
<p>
   Note that in Europe the engine range is much larger than in NA, but
   mechanically things are similar within the same engine range. Throughout
   this document you will find other hints of interchangeabilities, for
   example, look at the part numbers: S's have a lot of part numbers from R/Gs
   (the second and third set of numbers are important), see also the list of
   rims and wheels for interchangability. GTI/GLI rims are a nice upgrade for
   most G &amp; Js.

<p>
   However the opposite is true as well...The same model of the same year may
   have slightly different components. Essentially VW builds cars until they
   run out of a particular batch of parts, or they make them for one region
   but then send them elsewhere (e.g., Corrados sold with heated seats in
   Southern California). Another example of this are radiators, don't ask what
   radiator is supposed to be in your car because no one really knows...

<p>
   A1: R=G I=Conv/S I &amp; II/J I are all similar. Bodywise &amp; interiorwise, the J
   &amp; R are most similar, except for the rear trunk, rear seats, &amp; muffler. J's
   used to have thicker sway bars, a good upgrade for an S &amp; R. Final exhaust
   sections also different. S's are bodywise &amp; interiorwise different, struts
   are different (?), mechanically things are laid out a tad different (air
   filter). Convertibles share most with the R/G I, but later models have
   similarities with S's (exhaust).

<p>
   The Passat I/Dasher shares some mechanical parts with the other A1 cars
   (e.g., 1600 engine), but otherwise shares more with the old Audi 80/Audi
   Fox (NA). Note that the reverse is also true, some Audi 80/100 (4000/5000)
   parts will fit in A1 VWs (e.g., the windshield washer canisters of a 5000 =
   S). In Europe, the low end Audis share more mechanically with the high end
   VWs, because they basically use the same engine block (1600/1800).
   There are also some parts shared with Porsches, most notable the 924 &amp; 944
   series (locks, rack, steering (?)).

<p>
   A2: G II/ J II/Corrado. The G &amp; J are most similar, except for the obvious
   differences. The dashes are very similar but there are some nuances like
   the trim which is bolted in for J but snapped in on early US made Gs.
   Corrados 16V (Europe) share the most with GTIs, but the G60s only share
   some suspension components (rear axle beam). The SLC/VR6s don't share much
   mechanical with other VWs but share a lot with the other C's (brakes,
   interior &amp; body). VR6 rims will not fit a G60.

<p>
   Please add specific contributions:

<p>
   Brakes: Most &gt;81 A1/A2 VWs can be upgraded to newer calipers &amp; rotors be it
   in some cases with some additional modifications (VW&amp;P/EuroCar has had a
   bunch of article on that).

<p>
   The biggest right now are those on the Corrados.

<p>
   Cylinder Heads: Cylinder heads on 1.7 l A-1 cars from US '82.5 thru '84 are
   interchangeable with earlier A-1 engines except a different tool must be
   used to depress the lifters. GTI cylinder heads are incompatible.
   [eldred@csi.jpl.nasa.gov]

<p>
   Struts: R/G=J<BR>
   Interior pieces: A lot will be interchangeable (R/G=J) but be careful a lot
   of piece will look the same but won't fit.

<p>
   Steering wheels are interchangeable up to 8/88? when they switched to a
   finer spline. An adaptor<BR>
   is used to make the wheels fit, so you can use any old wheel on a
   newer car if you purchase this adaptor.

<p>
   Alternators: Almost all are interchangeable, but some may require a
   different harness. Usually go to a higher amperage, never lower. The 90A
   are the current "hot ticket".

<p>
   Starters are the same on the engines of one model of the A1/A2 cars.
   Electrically no problems, just look at the mechanical requirements
   before you go to the junk yard.


<p>
Q: Will Rabbit seats fit in a Scirocco?
<OL>
  <LI> Rabbit seats won't fit, the legs on the seat are too high. Try a junk yard
   seat, or weld the adjusting mechanism to a height suitable to you.

  <LI> I need tool VW #xyz. Is there a suitable replacement?
  <LI> Often yes. Here are some:

</OL>
<p>
   Remove grease cap from rear axle tool:
      Adjustable pliers, screwdriver<BR>
   Timing belt tensioner pulley tightening tool:
<PRE>
      Bend a section of coat hanger into a U shape of the proper size for

      through the top.
      From [Ken_Tsai@qmgate.arc.nasa.gov]: The Oxygen Sensor Socket from Lisle
      will work. The socket has a hex at the top so you can use a combination
      wrench to loosen the strut nut while holding the center rod stationary

</PRE>

<p>
   Remove Valve Adjustment Shims:<BR>
<PRE>
      For changing valve shims, a valve depressor is necessary, but the funny
      special pliers are not. All that is needed is a small "jeweler's"
      screwdriver. File the blade until it is narrow enough to fit flat into
      the slot in the shim bucket. Then file it until there is a nice knife
      edge on it. Depress the valve, and stick the screwdriver through the
      slot on the bucket and under the shim at the same time. It will just pop
      right out, though oftentimes it helps to wiggle the valve depressor
      around to help out. [Borowski]

      this trick from Popular Science for years: Make a pin wrench from an
      adjustable ("Crescent") wrench with two holes drilled into the sides of
      the jaws, near the tips. With pins placed in these holes, it is a strong
      adjustable pin wrench. A second set of bigger holes can go a little down
      from the tips and further from the nut-turning faces:

   Transmission plug tool:<BR>
<PRE>
      I use a 17mm wheel lug bolt...  They're plentiful: if you don't have any
      spares, [some] bone-yard will be more than happy to let you paw around
      their wrecks and carry away as many as you can hold.
      You can either snap a pair of vice-grips onto the bolt's shaft
      (tightly, mind you- those plugs can be VERY tight...) or do what I did,
      and weld a nut onto the end of the bolt.
      This allows you to use a socket and breaker bar or flex
      handle to loosen the plug, then switch to a ratchet to spin it off.
      It also allows you to use a torque wrench to re-install the plug to
      manufacturer's torque specs.

      [David M. Duma]:
      Go to the section of the hardware store where they sell angle iron and
      threaded rod.  Buy a "coupling nut" for the threaded rod (basically a very
      long hex nut).  I found that the nut for 1/2" rod was 11/16" across the
      flats, which is about 17.5mm .  Walk over to the tools aisle and check the
      coupling nut with a 17mm wrench to be sure.  This fits my car's transmission
      plug perfectly.  If yours is snug a few minutes with a coarse abrasive stone
      should produce a custom fit.  You can then put the coupling nut into a
      socket or box end wrench whenever you need it.
      The same principle allows you to buy some of those power screwdriver bits
      and put them into a 1/4" socket to use with your ratchet handle.
      I'm still looking for a BIG nut to fit into the timing mark hole plug on the
      transaxle.

Q: My factory VW radio is CD changer ready. What unit other than the VW one
   can I use?<BR>
<OL>
  <LI> The ones that can control a CD changer are made by Panasonic for VW.
   The VW changer is also made by Panasonic for VW.

</OL>
<p>
   The head unit will only control the VW changer -- it won't control
   other Panasonic changers. In other words, you are stuck with VWs changer.

<p>
Q: What are the FI types used by VW?<BR>
<OL>
  <LI> [From TomH] First, let's remember that "CIS" is really Bosch K-Jetronic,
   and "CIS-E" is KE-Jetronic. Now, as for the US GTI/GLI injection systems:

</OL>
<p>
   83-84   8V   K-Jetronic<BR>
   85-87   8V   KE-Jetronic<BR>
   87-89  16V   KE-Jetronic<BR>
   88-92   8V   Digifant II<BR>
   90-92  16V   Motronic

<p>
   KE-Jetronic is basically a K-Jetronic with ignition control and a knock
   sensor, while Motronic has full engine management capabilities.

<p>
   Note that the above data is for the US GTI/GLI series cars. The US GT/GL
   models for example in 85-87 use CIS [kokerj@rpi.edu].

<p>
   Digifant is a pulsed injection system (rather than continuous, like the
   Bosch K series), which is in principle better. I'm no big fan of (at
   least the early versions of) Digifant, I don't think it has horrible
   reliability problems, either. You *will* need to run injector cleaner
   through the engine more frequently, though, or performance and mpg will
   drop right off the scale.

<p>
   [From Jens Knickmeyer]:<BR>
   The Digifant was developped by VW because the Bosch L-jetronic had
   too small arrays, in VWs opinion. So they made their own system and
   included the Dignition which lead to the motormanagement system
   Digifant. I do not know for other contries, but here in Germany the
   system has a communication bus called ABUS (Automubile, Bitserielle
   Universelle Schnittstelle - automobile bitserial universal interface).
   It is used to connect the diagnostic computer to the Digifant which
   has a built-in automatic error detection (can detect defective temp.
   sensor and knock sensor. If the latter is detected, the Digifant will
   cut off fuel at high loads approx. every 5 secs.). The Digifant uses
   ABUS also to exchange data with DIGIFIZ and maybe other future
   components.

<A NAME="38"><H2>RECOMMENDATIONS</H2></A>

<p>
Q: How do I take care of my car to make it last long?
<OL>
  <LI> Here are a couple of one liners, some of which are explained in more
   detail elsewhere?<BR>
  <UL>
    <LI> Check fluids often (oil, coolant, PS fluid, brake fluid, battery)
    <LI> Follow recommended maintenance
     Change oil &amp; filter 3000 miles/5000km or 7500mi/12000km with synthetic oil
     Use the correct weight of oil for the climat
     Change coolant when it looks dirty (or every 2-4 years) and use phophate
     free coolant mixed with distilled water
     Bleed brakes yearly. Use Dot 3/4, Dot 4 or Super Dot 4 fluid
     Change fuel filter (at least every 30k miles or 50k km)
    <LI> Use OEM, MANN or Bosch filters.
    <LI> Change the oxy-sensor at the recommended interval (if you don't
     you may burn your cat. converter which is A LOT more expensive to replace)
    <LI> Reset mechanical trip odometers when the car is stationary
    <LI> Warm up your car by driving gently until your oil temp is 80C
    <LI> Check your CV boots for breaks often and replace as soon as they crack
     (this will prevent having to replace the whole joint)
    <LI> Use fuel injector cleaner every couple months
    <LI> Check tire pressures periodically. It's better to over inflate than to
     underinflate (I run 40 psi on my G60 with little effect on wear)
    <LI> Garage the car, leave it out of the sun
    <LI> Replace all gaskets and seals if you take something appart.
     It's a small cost in comparison to the cost and time to take
     something appart<BR>
    <LI> Cars with solid lifters: Adjust valve clearances as recommended
     (if you don't, you may burn your valves).
    <LI> Replace all belts every ~60k miles/100k kms
    <LI> Replace all hoses every ~100k miles/160k kms
    <LI> Replace vacuum hoses as they get stiff and brittle
    <LI> Learn how to rev-shift to save clutch wear
    <LI> Check transmission level periodically. Familiarize yourself
     first what that level should be for you car.
    <LI> Stay away from low quality parts, especially for CVJoints and axles
     Do not use remanufactured parts, only OEM
    <LI> Run your AC at least once a month for a couple of minutes
     to lubricate the bearings and prevent the seals from drying out

  </UL>
  <LI> Should I warm up my VW?
  <LI> General recommendation is:
</OL>
<p>
   - Let it idle for a bit (couple secs, 1/2 minute)
<UL>
  <LI> Then drive the car easily, rpm &lt; 3000 or so.
  <LI> When the car is up to operating temp (80C oil or water needle 1/2 way)
   you can increase rpm.<BR>
   Why? Part of the reason is lubrication. Cold oil is not as viscous.
   Oil pumps are constant volume pumps (at a specific rpm) and therefore
   may produce excessive pressures when cold.
   The second reason is thermal expansion. An engine is made to be driven
   at operating temperature, and therefore things will not fit or seal
   as well when cold. In addition, engine components expand at different
   rates (e.g., cast iron vs aluminum, small vs large volumes) and the
   slower this process occurs the smaller the expansion differences.
   Idling your engine may warm up the engine too fast, driving hard
   immediately will produce reduced lubrication and excessive pressure.

Q: Which is better High or Low revs when driving? Will either one damage the
   engine?<BR>
</UL>
<p>
A: The answer is to avoid extreme stress on the engine, neither excessive high
   or low revs are advised.

<p>
   Low Revs: You are putting a lot of torque on the engine with a low oil
   volume &amp; pressure. This can lead to damage. Generally stay above 1500 or
   2000 rpms.

<p>
   High Revs: VW engines are rather comfortable in the higher ranges. However,
   at high revs you have a lot of (transient) thermal effects taking place
   which are not always healthy (valves, head) in addition to certain harmonic
   vibrations in all the shafts that spin, sometimes also the pistons
   (motorcycles tend to have that problem more).
   So far I have found VW engines to hold up well.
   These cars were designed to sustain fairly high speeds in Germany.
   However I have also found that the periphery does not always hold up:
   Waterpumps tend to leak a lot quicker when you rev high.
   Now what's high? Generally near redline is high, and it's not advised to go
   over, or stay there for long.

<p>
   Normal non-aggressive driving should be done between ~2000rpms &amp; max torque
   which is usually around 4000 rpms, resulting in "normal" wear.

<p>
Q: How do you break into all A1 &amp; A2 VWs (exc. Corrado, Passats, A3) w/o
   breaking glass in under 10 secs? (Verified by Jan, in a junk yard of
   course).<BR>
<OL>
  <LI> This has received some protest, but I decided to post it anyway to make
   people aware of the ease with which one can break into a VW, and because
   advertisements for the deterrent actually has a picture on how to do it.

</OL>
<p>
   Punch a small hole with a screwdriver directly underneath the doorhandle
   (underneath the lock) and move screwdriver up and down to unlock.
   ADP armor door plates are the only safeguard. (800) ADP-LOCK, about $50 per
   pair. Install in 5 minutes with just a screwdriver. Other brands exist.
   Stay away from flimsier products though.

<p>
   An alarm with engine lockout is also HIGHLY recommended.
   Newer VWs come with such an alarm! Apparently very effective.

<p>
Q: What gas (petrol) should I use?<BR>
<OL>
  <LI> Very tough to answer! Generally stick with the better brands because they
   take better care of the quality of the gas, keep their tanks cleaner, etc.
   Note however that many brands share gas in rural areas to reduce
   transportation costs (though they may add different additives).
   It's also recommended to stick with one brand. Apparently the additives
   are not always compatible (varnish).
   Convenience stores switch brands often to reduce cost ==&gt; not recommended.
   I have a VW brochure from '87? that recommends Shell, Chevron &amp; AMOCO
   BY NAME (Publication W42-002-920-0). Texaco seems ok too (IMHO).
   That brochure talks about additives that reduce carbon build-up.
   I have had rough idle problems with ARCO EC gas in CA.
   Whether you need "super" or high octane gas remains debatable.
   Some brands add more detergent in their high octane gasses which will
   keep your engine cleaner.<BR>
   Gas formulas change over time and per geographic region.
   In the winter a more volatile gas, or oxygenated gas is sold to improve
   cold starting and reduce emissions (which may increase gas consumption
   between 3% and 15%).<BR>
   Cars with knocks sensors can derive more power with higher octane gas.
   And, yes, all watercooled VWs can run on unleaded fuel.
   Basically, if your car runs well with the brand you are using, stick to it.


  <LI> When/how often should I get an alignment done?
  <LI> Cars generally stay aligned unless one of the components wears out
   (e.g., spring sag, upper bearings stretch), you hit something hard or
   you replaced shocks and springs.<BR>
   If you notice any form of uneven wear, e.g., feathering, more wear on
   one side than the other, it is time for an alignment.
   However, it's a good idea to first replace the worn out part before
   you do the alignment, and with the high cost of tires, it may be
   a good idea to check things out then.
   You can do some primitive alignment checks yourself to see whether
   the car is at least in the right ball park. See the alignment archive
   and faq.vw.perf for more details.

</OL>
<p>
   Choosing an alignment shop is a different issue. Having computer
   equipment means nothing. The place I visit uses merely hand tools
   with his expertiese and I trust him alot more than the majority of
   alignment places that just blindly punch in some numbers and align
   two arrows on the computer. Ask around.

<p>
   To avoid the BS they may give you, on most A* VWs, only the front
   camber and toe-in are adjustable. Caster is not. The rear is even
   easier, nothing is adjustable without either bending the rear axle
   arms or by adding shims behind the axle stubs. In general, the rear
   is not adjusted. Some shops will want to do a "four wheel alignment"
   to determine the "thrust angle". It's ok to check things out but
   in general I would only trust a specialist to touch my rear wheel
   alignment and I would only pay a small amount over a front end alignment
   rather than double to have the rears checked.


<p>
Q: Good and bad VW years? Impressions?<BR>
<OL>
  <LI> &gt;&gt;&gt;Need help with this one!!!

</OL>
<p>
   General:<BR>
   (From M.Sirota) US [made] VWs, unfortunately, suck after lots of mileage.
   Most notably, they rattle like the dickens. (??-'88 Rabbit, Golf, GTI, base
   Jetta). Jetta GL's and GLI's and Carats and the like were made in Germany
   during this period.

<p>
   [From Jan:] Do not mistake bad service with the quality of the car. In the
   US, most VW service is at best second class. Older VWs (A1) are also more
   prone to rust, esp. around the wheel arches due to the absence of the
   plastic protectors. Newer VWs are much better protected, up to the point of
   using galvanized sheet metal on some panels in Corrados.

<p>
   [From Dan Simoes:] as far as quality goes, it seems to follow the pattern:
   (best--&gt;worst) German-built, Mexican-built, US-built although there are
   certainly enough exceptions to this rule. VW recognizes the quality
   problems with the Mexican cars, and feels that they will be fixed by the
   time we get the A3 cars.

<p>
   81 Scirocco: Made by Karmann, European Market! Major Problems: 2B5 Zenith
   Carb, electrical problems (easy to fix, hard to find), motor mount, 2nd
   gear wears out after 100-some k miles.

<p>
   Impressions: Noisy. With modified suspension a fantastic handler. A car
   with an incredible portion of fun, though engine a bit underpowered (86
   HP).

<p>
   79.5 (?) - 84 Rabbit Diesel (US-built models):
   (tgpt_ltd@uhura.cc.rochester.edu)

<p>
   Major problems: For some reason extremely hard on starters and alternators.
   Heavy vibration when cold reduces life of some parts. Even more prone to
   engine mount woes than gas models.

<p>
   Impressions: The car that wouldn't die. Consistently run 300,000+ miles.
   Anywhere from 30 - 55 mpg. Horribly underpowered (52 HP). Emissions exempt
   in some states, which is a good thing. Regular oil filter &amp; fuel filter
   changes even more important than most. You either love them or you hate
   them. At 300,000 miles things that were supposed to last "the life of the
   car" start to break.

<p>
   84 US Rabbit: another car that won't die. Mechanically excellent--I have
   177k miles and it runs like new, though I've had to make one major repair
   (cylinder head). Interior doesn't hold up as well--I've replaced the carpet
   and the headliner fell off the ceiling. Outside body/paint still excellent.
   I want something fancier but I can't justify it since it's worthless as a
   used car. All rattles disappeared when I replaced the infamous right hand
   engine mount. You do need to stick on anti-sway bars for decent handling.
   [eldred@csi.jpl.nasa.gov]

<p>
   85-87 8V GTI-US: US made, US market. Major problems: Rough Idle, switches,
   seat bolsters ripping, some (85-86) been released with mismatched
   wristpins. Engines usually seem to last long. Cat converter usually dies
   between 80-120k miles. Some batches have paint problems. Older cars
   develop alot of little leaks (oil, gas pump housing along the seam).

<p>
   Impressions: Lots of low end torque, good handler, great around-the-towncar, 
   and good low speed (&lt;80 mph) cruiser. Good mileage (~30 mpg or better).
   High end lacking. Very practical.

<p>
   88-&gt;90 GTI/Golf: Mexican made, US market. Major problems: Same as above.
   Quality of cars varies a lot between batches.

<p>
   Impressions: Reduced low end torque, higher seats.

<p>
   90-&gt; Passat: Made in Germany. Major problems: Early production had many
   quality problems all over. Later models seem to fare better.
   Common problems: See the recall list, rear window regulator,
   rear stub axles causing uneven tire wear.

<p>
   Impressions: 4 cyl version underpowered especially in automatic version.
   VR6 equipped car is quieter and more powerful. Lots of room. Good handling.

<p>
   90-92 Corrado G60: Made by Karmann, US market.
   Major problems: Generally fairly reliable.
   First cold start sometimes fails. Second start usually ok. Notchy
   transmission/Linkage binding.<BR>
   Common problems: exhaust hangers go bad (it's a heavy exhaust),
   auto belts malfunctioning (really, starter switch),
   windshield wipers miss a few areas.

<p>
   Impressions: Low end lacking, notchy shifter, but otherwise a nice, sturdy,
   and practical car. Good handling, bad rear visibility. The usual rattles.
   Lots of aftermarket parts available to improve power and handling.

<p>
   92-&gt; Corrado VR6/SLC: Made by Karmann, US market.
   Major problems: Transmission Linkage binding, increasing notchiness.
   Several had their ABS system go bad.
   Common problems: Windshield wipers miss a few areas.

<p>
   Impressions: Great car, better than the G60 version in virtually all
   respects. Quiet.

<p>
   [Tom H]<BR>
   From what the service people at my dealer (whom I have a lot of confidence
   in) say, a partial quality/reliability ranking might be something like:

<PRE>
     Corrado  &gt; Golf/Jetta A3 &gt; Golf/Jetta A2 &gt; old Passat
    (Karmann)     (Puebla)     (Westmoreland)     (Emden)
</PRE>

<p>
   The Mexican-built A2s appear to have had very uneven build quality, with
   some highly trouble-free (like mine) and others complete disasters.


<p>
   [From Jens]:<BR>
    Worst case on European market: VWs built 1984. VW used sheetmetal from the
    GDR and it was so bad (state and metal :-) ... ) that you cannot paint
    as quickly as new rust arises! These cars rust on the hood and on the
    roof, not only in critical areas.

<A NAME="40"><H2>CURRENT VW TYPES:</H2></A>

<p>
   A01: 1975-1980<BR>
   Polo, Derby<BR>
   A small car with a transverse FWD layout. Derby is a sedan version of the
   Polo; both available with 2 doors only.

<p>
   A02: 1981-<BR>
   Polo, Polo Coupe, Derby/Polo Sedan<BR>
   A small car with a transverse FWD layout. Derby later renamed Polo Sedan.
   Base Polo has almost vertical hatchback, while Coupe is sportier looking.
   All are available with 2 doors only. Facelifted for 1991.
   Jens Knickmeyer:<BR>
   New engines since 1984/85: [kw/hp]: [33/45], [40/55], [56/75], [83/113].
   The latter one uses the G-supercharger G40, therfore the car is called
   Polo-G40. At first only 200 cars were built for motorsports (Polo-Cup
   in Germany und UK), then a second series of about 500 and a third of 500
   cars were produced.<BR>
   1992-1994 the new Polo-G40 has been produced regularly. VERY expensive
   insurance for that car.

<p>
   A1: 1974-1984 (in some cases, e.g., Cabriolet: 1993)
   Golf/Rabbit/Caribe, Jetta/Atlantic, Scirocco I &amp; II, Cabriolet,
   Pickup/Caddy.<BR>
   Compact cars with transverse FWD engine. Jetta has a trunk, while Scirocco
   (2-door only) is a sportier design by Giorgio Giugiaro (S I only).
   Rabbit/Golf was face-lifted in 1980 (1981 in the US).
   Golf/Rabbit GTI production 1979 (US: 83) through 1984.
   A1 Scirocco I production ended in 1982 followed by
   the Scirocco II until 1990 (1988 for USA), while Cabriolet (-&gt;93) and Caddy

   Ibiza<BR>
   A compact car, something between a VW Polo and a VW Golf, with
   transverse FWD. Presented in May 1993. Designed by Giugaro. It is
   an evolution of VW's A2 platform.  The car is a hatchback (3 or 5
   doors). Since most parts in the car originate from VW, it certainly feels
   like a VW. The interior of the car just looks like a new version of the
   Golf (maybe the Golf II-and-a-half :-).
   Anyone who knows the A3 car will recognize the handles, the instruments,
   the side mirrors, etc. All engines available are VW engines; there is a
   1.0 (45HP), 1.3 (55HP), 1.6 (75HP), 1.8 (90HP), a GTI with the 2.0 (115HP).

   Presented in 1991. Looks somewhat like the Vento/Jetta III. Looks like
   a sedan, but it is really a hatchback with an enormous trunk. Available
   with the 1.8, 2.0 and 1.9(T)D. Still to come: the top version with the
   2.0 16v (150HP). [as far as I know, a Toledo VR6 does not exist].

<A NAME="1"><H2>PURPOSE:</H2></A>
   This FAQ is geared predominantly at the technical aspects of watercooled
   VWs based on the Golf Chassis (A1-A3: Golf I/Rabbit, Golf II &amp; III,
   Sciroccos, Corrados, Jettas, Vento, Convertibles) using the original Audi
   "1600 type" engine block (now available up 2 liters) and the new VR6
   2.8/2.9l engine aimed at the US/Canadian market.
   Not covered are the engines/fuel systems available outside North America
   such as the 1300 cc engines, carburetors/mono-throttle FI systems.
   These cars have many similarities with Dashers/Passats/Fox's. These are
   mostly mechanical, but not for the styling, suspension &amp; exhausts.

<p>
   These technical aspects handles issues that will help you maintain the
   car in near stock conditions. The perfomance FAQ discusses issues
   to improve upon the stock design.<BR>
   Quite often, to remain stock complient is as expensive as it is to
   upgrade to better after market (performance) parts. Shocks and tires
   are a good example of this.

Q: I have a problem with my car? What do I do? How should I go about
   fixing it?<BR>
<OL>
  <LI> Diagnose the problem as well as you can: When does it happen? Is it speed
   dependent? Is there a noise associated with it? Where is it coming from? Is
   the problem temperature dependent? Happens at start up/after a while? Are
   there any physical signs such as fluids/grease/wear marks? Does everything
   look in good order/everything still attached?

<p>
   While you are going over your car, check whether all the basic things are
   in order.<BR>
   VW engines run hot and the 4 cyl. vibrate a lot. As a result things rattle
   loose and dry out quickly. This in turn causes a host of other problems.
   Electrical connections &amp; wires: Connectors tend to corrode, wires break
   internally. Older VWs have a lot of problems which will make you think the
   car is totally gone while all it may be is a loose wire, or a bad ground.
   Also check out less obvious things: alternator brushes, fuse box, Hall
   connections *inside* the distributor?
   Vacuum hoses: They crack, they leak. Replace where needed.
   Beware of all rubber components. They wear out with all the heat.

<p>
   If your engine does not run, there are really two main sources: Mechanical
   and periphery. Generally, VW engines hold up mechanically rather well, and
   even with mechanical problems you can often get the engine to run.
   Usually the problem is located with the periphery. You really only need two
   basic things to make an engine run: Fuel and a spark at +/- the right
   moment. Suspect a problem with either one first and trace it from there.
   If for example the problems occurs each time it rains, suspect something
   wrong with an electrical connection or water leaking onto the fuze box.

<p>
   Yours truly once had problems with a carb and was able to start and run the
   engine while spraying carb cleaner directly into the intake manifold (with
   the carb REMOVED).

<p>
   Cleaning the car and engine is often helpful in locating the problem,
   especially leaks. It also make working on the car so much easier, for you
   and the mechanic.

<p>
   If you haven't found it yet, read through your manuals and try to identify
   the offending piece?

<p>
   Ask around. r.a.vw is an excellent source for help, but please be as
   detailed as you can. If you are having trouble diagnosing the problem, just
   imagine how hard it is for us not even having seen the car.
   So *please* don't post: "My car makes a funny noise. What could it be?"
   Start with make, model, year, and an accurate diagnosis.

<p>
   After you narrow it down to a couple of potential sources, start with the
   easiest and cheapest fix.<BR>
   My experience is that a majority of seemingly serious problems can be
   traced to very simple problems.<BR>
   Mechanics do NOT have the time to check individual components.
   Many work on commission (like department stores) and the more cars they
   work on (not fix) the more they earn. Therefore, they usually take the
   quickest route for them (replace stuff), and of course you end up paying
   for that shiny new part through the nose even though it does not fix the
   problem.<BR>
   Besides, would you pay a mechanic $200 to fix a 50 cent connector because
   it took him/her the whole day to find it?

<p>
Q: I want to work on my VW. What tools should I get?
<OL>
  <LI> I'd recommend Muir's (Complete Idiot) Stage I and Stage II tool list. Here
   is roughly the "phylosophy" to follow:

</OL>
<p>
   Most people start with a couple of tools and then buy more as time
   progresses and they learn how to work on their car.
   It makes sense, except that it is usually cheaper to buy the most complete
   "set" rather than buying a small set and then adding on (e.g., socket "set"
<UL>
  <LI> 50 US cents a socket in the largest set, individual = 2-7 US$/piece).
   My recommendation therefore is to buy the largest possible set of whatever
   you can afford. Trust me, you will always be going back for more. In
   addition, good tools will last you your lifetime!

</UL>
<p>
   Next, what brand name should you get. First look for tools with a life time
   warrantee (though that may not be an indication of quality). In North
   America, SnapOn, MAC, Stanley, Mechanix, Blackhawk, KD, and Sears Craftsman
   tools (though their quality and warrantee policy is rumored to be
   declining).<BR>
   Avoid cheap tools, they are NOT worth the money, they can do more harm than
   good (stripping), and may actually hurt you.
   My order of preference is (and I'll be flamed for this, but this IS based
   on 15 years of experience): Made in the USA or NW-Europe, &amp; Japan. I
   usually stay away from Taiwanese tools except for one shot "light" duty
   items. They are getting better, but so far quality has varied too much to
   be reliable.

<p>
   A basic set should consist of:<BR>
   Socket set:<BR>
   Most versatile is a 3/8" ratchet drive set. It must contain 10, 13, 17,
<PRE>
      19mm, and sparkplug socket, a couple extension bars and a 3/8-1/4"
      adaptor.
      12 pt sockets are the most common, but you may want to consider a 6 pt
      set instead. They are MUCH less likely to strip and break if you need to
      exert a good amount of torque.
      Deep sockets are also useful in case you need to clear a bolt.
      A torque wrench is also very useful. Unfortunately there is no one size
      for all torques on the car. There are a variety of models: Cheapest are
      those with a read out gauge. They work well but usually you end up in a
      position that you cannot read the gauge.
      I prefer the "click type" torque wrenches where you dial in the desired
      torque and it will give you a loud click once you attain that.
   Screw drivers:
      Get a whole bunch of sizes, spade &amp; Phillips
   Allen Keys:
      Get a whole bunch of sizes, though you may want to get Allen key Sockets
      to use with your 3/8" drive (once you figure out the sizes you need).
   Wrenches:
      Get the largest set you can afford. Open and closed.
      Same sizes as above. Get at least one large adjustable one.
   Pliers:
      Again, get the largest set you can afford, regular &amp; miniature,
      straight, needle nosed. Vise Grips are useful too.
   Hammers:
      Get a plastic &amp; rubber one. The "normal" hammers are usually not used on
      cars except in utter frustration.
   Jack &amp; Stands:
      I'd recommend a floor jack over a bottle or scissor jack. A floor jack
      will make raising your car *so* much easier. Stands are also a must. You
      don't want you car crashing down on you. Use with wood and some foam
      rubber to protect you car's undercoating.
   Lights:
      At the minimum get a knock-about light with a shatter proof heavy duty
      lamp in it (don't even *think* of using a regular light bulb, dangerous,
      and they only last 10 minutes under those conditions). A well lit garage
      (i.e., 8" neon lamps is ideal).
   Oil Filter wrench:
      Different types exist and it depends on what works best for your car. My
      favorite is the one that looks like an extension bar with a loop of seat
      belt material.

Q: My A1 based VW sounds very buzzy and noisy, vibrations in the &lt;NOISE&gt;
   engine compartment. What's wrong?<BR>
<OL>
  <LI> Check the front right engine mount. They wear out in ~50k miles.

</OL>
<p>
   From [KIRBY ERLANDSEN]: My tricks are to cut the old one out with a hacksaw
   (this is easy because you can remove the hacksaw blade and cut from the
   inside out ) and put the new mount in the freezer while you heat the
   bracket in the oven. Then with gloves on, you can hammer the two together
   fairly easily. [Note, oil the components FIRST] If that does not work,
   bring it to a machine shop and have them press it in for you.

<p>
   See also a1.mounts in the archives.

<p>
Q: My odometer/trip odometer stopped working. How do I fix it?
<OL>
  <LI> This is an old known problem. The odometer gear which drives the 1/10 mile
   splits thus no longer engages the shaft to the 1/10 mile digit wheel. You
   can glue it back with epoxy (after you spend some prime time behind your
   dash removing the speedometer and opening it up).

</OL>
<p>
   Hints on removing: A2's are a lot easier than A1's. The hardest part is
   unscrewing the speedo cable. Try taking the lower dash covers off and put
   your hand up from the bottom. Also I just remove the steering wheel before
   working on the cluster. It makes it a whole lot easier, but be sure your
   steering wheel and shaft are marked so you can get them back on the same.
   Otherwise your wheel will be crooked when you drive straight.
   Reinstalling is harder because you have to be sure the square drive on the
   speedo matches up with the cluster. Otherwise the cable will not seat fully
   or the speedo nut is hard to start.<BR>
   Also, be careful to align the wiring connector before trying to insert -
   it's polarized.

<p>
   Other hint: I also twisted some fine wire around the flanges of the gear
   (near the shaft) and put glue over the wire and flanges. Make sure to get
   the gear back in the proper position under the worm gear.

<p>
   Other hint: I usually go down to the junk yard and look for damaged
   dashboards and speedo's. Usually one has the gear I need -- I just pry it
   off -- this is a no cost item if you have a friendly junk yard owner.

<p>
   Other hint: Another approach I used on my '79 Rabbit was to go to a hobby
   shop and find a small pinion gear for those electric race cars. It had the
   right number of teeth, and same ID, but was slightly wider and had an Allen
   set screw.<BR>
   I filed off the outer edges to clear the other worm gears and mounted it on
   the shaft with the set screw. Looked weird, but worked OK. The gear will
   cost about $3 and you need the fine Allen key wrench.

<p>
   You can also send it to have it fixed at:
      VDO (the OEM) in VA, (703) 665-0100

<p>
Q: What is VWs part numbering scheme?<BR>
<OL>
  <LI> Each part number is composed of nine numbers in three groups, followed
   optionally with a letter suffix (taken from WolfSport's catalog):

</OL>
<p>
   vvv ggg ppp [s]

<PRE>
   vvv:  Vehicle type      ggg:     PRIMARY INDEX
   171 = R/G I             100-199 = Engine/Cooling/Clutch
   161 = Jetta I           200-299 = Exhaust, Fuel Tank
   165 = Jetta II          300-399 = Transmission/Transaxle
   261 = 16V GTI           400-499 = Front Axle/Suspension
   531 = Scirocco I        500-599 = Rear Axle
   535 = Scirocco II       600-699 = Brake
   155 = Convertible       700-799 = Cables, Bumpers and Foot control
   191 = Golf              800-899 = Body/Interior
                           900-999 = Electrical, ignition, fuel injection

   ppp:  Individual Part Number     s:     Suffix, optional
</PRE>

<p>
   The primary index and the part number are the most important numbers
   because many of the cars share the same parts. So do not be surprised to
   see a 171-Rabbit type part in a Jetta.
   Note that some part numbers are exclusively related to certain parts
   of the car. For example, vvv = 020 are related to the transmission,
   vvv = 056 common oil filter.

<p>
   Note: This is scheme has been in use since the Beetle days (111 - Standard
   Beetle - LHD) but I leave that for the [A] FAQ. AUDI uses the same scheme
   as well (?).

      Probably a bit dated by now, but the one that was most impressive

      I also used ChemClean to dunk the entire carb (see below)

</OL>
<p>
   FI/Valve Cleaner:<BR>
<PRE>
      What ever you get make sure it does NOT harm catalytic conv or the
      oxysensor.

      The following are recommended and seem to work faily well. They are
      added to a tank of gas, or fed directly into the FI system.

      Lubro Molly: there are two products, an injector cleaner
      and a valve cleaner. You can run the valve cleaner straight
      through your injection system by hooking it to one of the
      vaccum hoses and sucking it straight into the valves. Produces
      lots of smoke but really helped my friends old 924. These are
      expensive at $12-14 for both.

      RedLine SL1: works very well and relatively cheap: $3.50 for the 12oz
      bottle. My current favorite.

      Chevron Techron: get the real thing, not the ProGuard stuff.
      Not too expensive at $5.99/20oz bottle. (Imparts, others) Chevron
      however, warns you not to use it too often between oil changes...
      (I think no more than 5 treatments)

      44K (BG Products): VW also recommends this more concentrated to be
      used every 4k miles (= VW Part #208 (?)).

      VW AutoBahn injector cleaner (rumored to be the same as Chevron Techron
      for a lower price, for once).

      Chevron ProGuard: only if none of the above is available. I used it
      a few times, but couldn't tell a difference. I think it contains
      Techron, but if you can get the real thing...
      Note that ProGuard is a weaker version of Techron.

Q: What should I do with Loctite Threadlocker (tm) and Anti Seize (tm)?
<OL>
  <LI> Use Anti-seize on anything that you will disassemble again and is subject
   to corrosion (water pump bolts, wheel bolts, exhaust bolts), but be
   careful on sparkplugs and oxygen sensors (it contains lead which kills
   the cat, make sure it's on the threads only).
   Use Loctite Threadlocker (medium strength is ok) on anything you don't want
   to rattle loose and you cannot use serrated o-rings: Brake bolts, etc.

</OL>
<p>
   I use anti-seize the most, and if you torque things right, I never had a
   problem of anything rattling loose.<BR>
   Note that Loctite also seals out air, and therefore prevents corrosion
   which means that disassembly will also be facilitated, compared to
   something rusted shut. A small tube of each goes A LONG way.

  <LI> This is an old problem that may have numerous causes. Mostly A2
   Golfs/GTIs/Jettas/GLIs (8v &amp; 16V) are affected. First make sure everything
   "obvious" is ok: vacuum (hoses, pipes, intake), electrical connections,
   tuned up right,  spark plugs, distributor, good tank of gas, etc.
   These are by far the most likely causes of this annoying problem.

</OL>
<p>
   [jan, 19930902, overheard in the VW shop]
   VW is going to embark in some form of campaign, not sure whether it is an
   actual NHTSA mandated one, to replace all the ECU's with one using gold
   plated connectors, replace and reroute several vacuum hoses, and replace
   the throttle body (the shaft has a radial play causing a vacuum leak in
   some cases). I believe that recent Passats, A2 Jettas and GTIs are included
   in this.

<p>
   Depending on the model, do the following:
<UL>
  <LI> Change to a different brand/type of gas (4-5 tanks) VW had a bulletin out
     on this. They recommend Shell, Chevron &amp; AMOCO(?)
  <LI> Use a good Fuel Injector Cleaner every 4000 miles. See Chemicals
     for recommendations.<BR>
  <LI> Use fuel dryer (using ISOPROPANOL NOT Methanol)
  <LI> Check (idle) throttle switch
  <LI> Clean sensor plate or airmass sensor &amp; throttle body orifices
  <LI> Change the fuel filter
  <LI> Clean idle stabilizer VALVE with brake or carb cleaner (VW&amp;P) (Note:
     Earlier cars had a Digital Idle Stabilizer circuitry (DIS) which is
     something different, and *rarely* fails).

</UL>
<PRE>
     For RD (8V) series idle stablilizer problems (&amp; others probably):
     Symptom: Idles extremely rough when cold, improves after warmup. Doesn't
     compensate for A/C compressor load when on.
     Diagnosis: Disconnect the connector from the valve, measure resistance
     from the center pin to each side, both should be about 12.5 ohms.
     If either one reads high or open, replace it. (will be about $200 at your
     Bosch dealer, owww).
     Reason: The internals of the valve form a bidirectional DC servomotor,
     the windings of which are connected through a commutator, which has a
     nasty habit of arcing until the connection is gone.
</PRE>

<UL>
  <LI> Check *all* vacuum hoses (inc. those going to the brake booster &amp; the
     brake booster itself)<BR>
  <LI> Check *all* air pipe connections (esp. between the throttle body &amp; air
     cleaner housing). Look around hose clamps, crimped ends, where there may
     be relative motion and cause a tear.
  <LI> Check for vacuum leaks anywhere else, e.g., around the intake manifold.
  <LI> Check *all* electrical connections (see also later on bad grounds)
     Be aware of the old "leak in the windshield molding or firewall
     gommets that drips and shorts out the fuse box" problem.
     Many A1's suffer that problem, especially those with badly installed
     replacement windshield (most places, BTW).
  <LI> Check inside the distributor (carbon build up will cause misfires/bad idle)
  <LI> Check warm-up regulator/thermo switches
  <LI> Check proper working of the Oxygen [Lambda] Sensor (see Bentley)
     Hint: Disconnect the O2 sensor, if the car runs better suspect that it
     may be bad.<BR>
     Replace if suspect. Some O2 sensors will last longer than their
     expected 30/60k miles lifetime, others fail *much* sooner.
     Resetting the warning light for maintenance is NOT a good substitute.
  <LI> Clean contacts of the ECU, and all engine management related components
     with an aerosol contact cleaner (note: Newer VWs use gold plated
     contacts, so this definite a problem area in older cars!)
  <LI> Check ground of ECU. There is a bulletin out on this. Usually this
     failure is acompanied with black smoke billowing from your exhaust.
  <LI> Check fuel pump relay, it may have an intermittent failure. HARD
     to diagnose, until it cuts out entirely. If it does die,
     jump the two large terminals on the relay block to operate the pump
     so you won't be stranded. [frank.sikernitsky@mail.trincoll.edu]
  <LI> Check the working of the injectors (incl 5th one).
  <LI> Check the injector O-rings (older cars)
  <LI> Clean the tank screen at the bottom of the tank or on the transfer fuel
     pump (&amp; also clean the tank if you find junk)
     From WENDTM@FIRNVX.FIRN.EDU (Mark): When I pulled the hose off the intake
     side of the fuel pump it only dribbled slowly from the tank! No Gusher!
     That was a real clue that the tank was faulty, and not the pump. :)
  <LI> Clean the screen *inside* the fuel pump.
  <LI> Check whether the filtering banjo bolt (has a screen) near the fuel
     distributor has been removed at the first service (mostly A2 cars with FI
     in the US, don't know about Europe). It's replaced with a bolt w/o a
     screen (Part nos: Screw = N 0210715 Washers = N 0138128, for *most* A2
     cars). If it is left, it may clog or restrict flow.
  <LI> Check the health of the fuel pump(s) (measure the amount of current it is
     drawing). Note, many A2s have two pumps!
  <LI> Improperly grounded potentiometer (90 Golf: scottz@pangea.Stanford.EDU)
  <LI> Check the CONTROL PRESSURE REGULATOR. Apparently the heating element
     wears out, and it won't give correct pressure until it warms up
  <LI> Faulty oil pump relief valve. Pumps up the hydraulic lifters too much
     limiting compression. Apparently mentioned in EuroCar.
  <LI> If nothing helped, you may need a new ECU! (The 91?,92? Jettas went
     through 5 different ECUs, according to my mechanic).
  <LI> Catalytic converter clogged and breaking up. However, if that happens
     it will rattle like a coffee can with coins in it.
  <LI> If the car bucks/loses power around  3000-4000 rpm when accelerating,
     check the full throttle switch. seibed@lamar.ColoState.EDU (Edward Seibert)

Q: What oil filter should I use on my VW?
</UL>
<p>
A: VW's, MANN's or Bosch (OEM). FRAM (PH2870) or other brands do NOT have the
   same valving (backflow, bypass), valving rates, rigidity of construction,
   and quality. The other brands will work ok, but you may be running a risk.
   Several known cases of Corrado G60s blowing FRAM filters open. Some known
   cases of Porsches ruining engines with FRAM filters due to inadequate
   gaskets.<BR>
   MANN filters are also available from Beck Arnley World Parts, and are
   packaged under that brand, so they are much cheaper than the factory
   filters.

<p>
   The function of the bypass valve is to bypass the oil filter if the filter
   is clogged or the oil is too viscous during a cold start. Dirty oil is
   better than NO oil.

<p>
   The anti-backflow valve prevents the oil from draining out of the engine
   block into the oil pan. This means that oil will be available almost
   instantaneously at a start up, which is also when the majority of wear
   occurs (SLICK 50 is not lying about that). The VR6 engines have this valve
   build into the engine!

<p>
   [Jan: Compared to the SLC oil filters (~15-20US$), the regular filters now
   seem cheap (~4-6US$)]

<p>
   NOTE: Newer VWs DO NOT use the same filters as before. The G60 filter is
   recognizable by the "nut" welded on the bottom, the SLC does NOT use a
   filter but a replaceable insert (two kinds available, a short and a long
   one, measure before you buy).

Q: I seem to be running hot. What should I do?
<OL>
  <LI> Check and do the following.
  <UL>
    <LI> Check your coolant level
    <LI> Check the concentration of your coolant
    <LI> Clean your radiator fins (do that with every wash)
    <LI> Check whether the fan still comes on at the correct temps
    <LI> Flush the system, check for calcium deposits inside the radiator
     and tubes and check the thermostat.
     Using destilled water in your mixture will prevent any deposits from
     happening.<BR>
    <LI> Check whether you have the right pump. Some aftermarket pumps have
     smaller impellers and therefore do not pump adequately.
    <LI> Check whether the bottom radiator hose collapse when the engine
     is hot and running. Replacements exist that have internal coil
     to prevent a collapse. Mostly A1 cars are affected by this.
    <LI> You may be running too lean
    <LI> Your temperature sensor may not be working right. Drop it in
     boiling water and see what temp you read. May also be a problem
     with your system ground.

Q: How do I flush my cooling system?<BR>
<OL>
  <LI> [From ND]: The proper way to renew the coolant is to remove the thermostat
   so as to drain the complete system.<BR>
   [Jan: This is true for all 4 cyl cars, the VR6's have a drain plug located
   right next to the dip stick.<BR>
   Also don't forget to turn your interior heat to max as to drain that too.]
   [ND] When we do a Coolant service at the shop we replace the thermostat and
   o-ring with our special low temp 80 Celius unit from Germany.
   [JAN] I am not sure whether that is advisable in colder climates
   as the engine may never heat up.<BR>
   If you still have the stock Fan switch we recommend
   to replace it with the our low-temp unit which will allow the fan to
   come on a little early to keep the temps down. If you replace the
   thermostat we always drill a small air relief hole [1mm] in the main plate of
   the thermostat so as to prevent a air pocket to develope at the
   thermostatic bulb and cause the unit to stay closed. Just had a call
   from a VW owner back east who had this problem. He called to thank me
   for figuring out why his VW overheated after changing his thermostat.
   [Jan: I usually don't do it that way, instead I loosen the upper
   radiator hose and poor the coolant through several channels and then
   squeeze the tubes to let the bubbles out. However, do carry the rest
   of the coolant with you on your next drive just in case.]

</OL>
<p>
   Another trick to get around the airbubble problem came from Donald Borowski:
   Heat up the thermostat on a pan of water until it opens, and then insert an
   asprin pill as it closes.  This will keep it open long enough to
   fill the system and get the air out, and then will disolve.
   I don't think that acetosalicylic (sp?) acid is very strong, and
   the amount is rather small.


<p>
Q: I want to flush my cooling system. Where can I get phosphate free coolant
   other than at the overpriced dealer prices?
<OL>
  <LI> Phosphates corrode aluminum (all VW heads) through an electrochemical
   reaction with the cast iron block, which is why VW recommends to use
   phosphate free coolants.

</OL>
<p>
   According to [scornelius@ws11.iac.honeywell.com] Aluminum oxide in solution
   forms a black paste that makes a real mess, this will be visible inside the
   coolant bottle once the corrosion process has started (I've seen this in a
   custom street rod). So if you see a used VW with this condition, run
   away....

<p>
   According to [Vincent Yeung] who called Prestone:
   Phosphate free anti-freeze is necessary in Europe because of
   the very hard water they have there. Somehow the phosphate in
   ordinary anti-freeze will react with the minerals in the hard
   water. However, he said the water in North America is not as hard
   and he knew a lot of VW with aluminum radiator have no problem
   using ordinary anti-freeze with tap water.

<p>
   In the US market, all the popular brands until recently (Prestone, Zerex)
   contain phosphate in a buffered solution which keeps the phosphates in the
   coolant from ionizing (so they claim), at least for a while.
   I have used Prestone without seemingly ill effects, but if you want to be
   100% sure, not void warrantee, use VW's coolant. Furthermore, mix with
   DISTILLED water, NOT tap water. Also do not mix coolants of different
   types. Flush the system before you change!

<p>
   Newer coolants by Prestone (4/60), Arctic, Quaker State and
   BASF's Zerex Extreme are phosphate free,
   and are sold with different labels as to clearly identify the new product.
   They are selling these phosphate free products for environmental reasons!

<p>
   They all advertise around a 4 year-50/60k miles life expectancy.
   Whether that's purely marketing (the stuff costs more) or a significant
   difference over the original formulations (that probably will last that
   long as well) remains unknown.<BR>
   Unverified claims: Texaco's coolant is also Phos free.
   Whether these have any long term harmfull side effects (probably not)
   still remains to be seen (these products were introduce in 93 in the US).

<p>
   Note that VW's coolant is also made by BASF, but seems to be
   as slightly different formulation than their commercial Zerex product.
   According to BASF, Zerex Extreme has been approved to be used in
   VW, BMW, MB, Audi, Saab, and Volvo.

<p>
   Sierra's new anti-freeze is based on Propylene Glycol (environmentally safe).
   Propylene Glycol is used as a "light" oil substitute in foods and is
   therefore not as deadly as Ethylene Glycol.
   See also below for more details.

<p>
   ND has the following to say about Sierra:
   "Total marketing !! This is just another coolant with a different formula
   and since most all coolant is recycled now the enviro aspect is mute.
   This stuff will not work any better than any other coolant. Almost all
   coolant nowadays is ok to use in your VW. Just make sure it was designed
   for Aluminum heads which is almost all of them now."

<p>
   Another thing to note is that VW claims that its original coolant
   does not have to be renewed every two years like Prestone.
   The reason they give that coolants like Prestone have sacrificing
   chemicals that prevent corrosion for a certain period.
   VW claims that their coolant does not have any sacrificing
   chemicals and therefore does not wear out.
   Personally, I don't think this is entirely true, and as a precaution,
   I change the coolant of it turns color or every couple of years.
   In some of the cars I have owned they coolant looked perfectly
   fine, in others it turned reddish brown after a couple of months.

<p>
   This is not an endorsement of either products. I have no idea as to their
   effectiveness.

<p>
Q: What's the easiest way of removing a water pump (A1 &amp; A2 VWs)?
<OL>
  <LI> The idea is to remove the *entire* pump assembly first, and separate the
   pump halves outside of the car. To remove the entire pump assembly, you
   have to remove all "fan" belts, pulleys, the drive belt covers, unbolt the
   alternator and move it out of the way somewhere, unbolt and reposition
   the power steering pump (easy once you locate the bolts, there is
   one on "the other side" that needs to be accessed with a long extension bar,
   don't need to disconnect the hoses), and unbolt and relocate the AC
   (don't need to detach any hoses here either).

</OL>
<p>
   Then removing the pump is trivial. It's just the rest of the
   stuff that's a pain, depending on the model.
   Be patient, there are several hidden bolts/nuts that attach the AC and
   power steering pump.

<p>
   Tip: Loosen the pulley bolts BEFORE removing the belts.
   If you are lucky, there will be enough resistance to keep the pulleys
   steady. If not, I have gone as far as to use a pipe wrench to hold
   the pulleys steady.

<p>
   Another tip: If your pump leaks between the halves, it's safer to replace
   the pump as one unit rather than the impeller half. Chances are that the
   leaking pump is warped, and no matter how often you replace one half, it'll
   *always* give you problems. Use anti-seize on the bolts during reassembly.

<p>
   While you are at it, check or replace the thermostat. They do get lazy
   after a while. Checking/replacing the hoses may not be such a bad idea
   either (note: they last ~ 70k miles or ~10 yrs IMHO).

<p>
   On A1 Diesels (maybe A2) however it's easier to remove the timing belt, and
   then remove the impeller half of the pump. However [Borowski] the timing
   belt need not be removed on cars without air conditioning. Once the
   alternator bracket is removed, the water pump comes out easily.

<p>
   Tip from Greg Welch:<BR>
   Stay away from non-OEM waterpumps. Some are sold with smaller
   impellers and as a result do not pump as well (you run hotter).

<p>
Q: How often should I change my drive belt?
<OL>
  <LI> 8 Valve engines, around 60-75k miles, 16V's BEFORE you reach 50k miles. 8V
   engines will NOT be damaged if the thing breaks, 16V will be.
   The VR6 engines use an actual chain rather than a synthetic belt and do not
   have to be changed.<BR>
   The only exception to the 8V rule is the Heron head used on European
   A1 GTIs (not sold in the USA/Canada). It does interfere.
   Note that tensioning the belt correctly is tricky, if it's too tight you
   may prematurely wear out a bunch of bearings.
   If it's on too tight, you'll hear a characteristic whining/high pitched
   sound. &lt;NOISE&gt;<BR>
   From [Lee Hetherington]: THE MORAL OF THE STORY IS TO SET THE TENSION BY
<STRONG>TRIAL AND ERROR BEFORE YOU PUT THE COVER BACK ON.</STRONG>

  <LI> I hear an intermittent high pitched chirping noise that comes &lt;NOISE&gt; and
   goes when I rev the engine?<BR>
  <LI> This could be caused by a bunch of things.
   First check whether all the belts are on tight enough, but also not too
   tight (there is a difference between a belt slipping, e.g., when you go
   through a puddle, and a bearing being over stressed).
   Remove all belts, and if the noise persists, suspect the drive belt
   tensioner. (You can actually feel it vibrate when it chirps, but don't get
   your fingers stuck).<BR>
   They are easy and cheap to replace, see elsewhere for a replacement
   tensioning tool.<BR>
   If that's not it, and the drive belt is not on too tight (see above) then
   you may be in trouble.

  <LI> How do I know whether my water pump is going bad?
  <LI> Obviously if it starts to leak either through the pump half seam or the bearing (the little hole on the bottom).
   However, there are also other failure modes you have to be aware of:
   If the car makes a grinding whish-whish-whish sound when cold &lt;NOISE&gt; which
   diminishes as you drive, the pump bearing may be failing and the impeller
   is machining the pump housing into slivers.
   To check for this condition, remove all belts, and spin the waterpump
   pulley. If it turns well damped and smooth, it's fine. If it feels gritty
   and crunchy, it's machining itself. If on the other hand it spins loosely,
   the impeller may have detached itself from the shaft.
   Note that you should not mistake the grinding whish-whish-whish &lt;NOISE&gt;
   sound from a regular whish-whish-whish noise. &lt;NOISE&gt;
   In this case the belts may be simply getting hard or the pulleys are out of
   line.<BR>
   To check for this, take a can of Silicon spray and spray it on the belts
   while the car is idling. If the sound disappears immediately, you found the
   problem.<BR>
   Either replace the belts, or use some hard soap on them (but don't lose
   your fingers for this either).<BR>
   If the pulleys do not line up, check whether any of the bushing are worn
   (e.g., the rubber alternator bushing as found on older A1 VWs is notorious
   for wearing out). Otherwise use spacers and O-rings to get them to line up.

  <LI> Why the hole at the bottom of the impeller housing?
  <LI> To keep the bearings dry. Moisture is the death of bearings. Seals are
   never quite perfect, thus the hole. From: borowski@spk.hp.com (Don T.
   Borowski)

  <LI> Where are the timing marks on A1 &amp; A2 VWs?
  <LI> At the top of the clutch/bell housing you will find a plastic plug. Pulling
   the plug allows you to use a magnetic factory sensor. If you want to use a
   strobe, you will have to *unscrew* the whole plug assembly. Then you'll see
   a reference mark, and an arrow somewhere on the flywheel:
   Mark in hole: [ ]<BR>
                  ^<BR>
   flywheel:      |

</OL>
<p>
   Normally the two have to line up under normal idle &amp; a strobe connected to
   cylinder #1. Some cars require certain vacuum hoses or the idle stabilizer
   to be disconnected. Check manual.

<p>
   Note: Some cars (e.g. 87 &amp; 88 GTI 16V) also have marks on the front pulley,
   with an arrow on the end of the block.

<p>
   Note: Excessive advance raises combustion temperatures and pressures, while
   excessive retard extends the burning cycle through the exhaust and raises
   exhaust temps. (Mark Shaw)

<p>
Q: My radiator leaks, what should I do?
<OL>
  <LI> Replace it. In most VWs this is pretty easy to do (1 hr), and a new
   radiator (which is = OEM) can be had for around 100-150US$. The hard part,
   esp. in older cars and in Europe, is finding the right radiator. Even VW
   does not keep track of what car left the factory with what radiator.
   Furthermore, the serial numbers are not very useful because they may not be
   available anymore.<BR>
   What you need to do is first measure the core length of the radiator, then
   determine whether it has an external recovery tank, and then determine
   whether it is screw in mount (mostly pre-82) or the newer pin-points
   (Wolfsport has some good explanation of this).
   Now you need to decide whether you want the same radiator, or a larger one.
   Most VWs come pre-drilled to accept certain larger radiators.
   Larger radiators are used in cars with A/C, or if the car is destined for a
   warmer climate (though that may not be where the car is sold).
   You also may want to install the largest possible radiator if you
   autocross, do long desert runs or tow something.
   A larger radiator allows a larger cooling capacity, which means it can
   dissipate heat quicker. This does NOT mean that it will run cooler on
   *average* because that's controlled by the thermostat (a.k.a. "aquastat" in
   some places).<BR>
   Some 3rd party places (e.g., JC Whitney) sell generic radiators with a
   conversion kit which are much harder to install, and not recommended.

Q: What causes engine knock/pinging/detonation? &lt;NOISE&gt;
<OL>
  <LI> Too much advance. Check Timing. Also check VALVE timing. Too low gas
   octane/too high engine compression. Engine overheating. Carbon build up on
   valves. An improperly torqued knock sensor can cause the sensor to not
   function correctly resulting in knock and/or loss of power. Failing knock
   sensor.

</OL>
<p>
   NOTE: Do not mistake engine knock or pinging for other problems. Knock
   occurs under load (e.g., accelerating, going up a hill, fast driving).
   Knock seldom occurs under no load conditions (e.g., idle or revving the
   engine). If you hear a rattle there &lt;NOISE&gt; it may be something else:
   valves, bearing, wristpin slap, etc.

<p>
Q: I have an A2 VW and I hear buzzing from the rear of the car? &lt;NOISE&gt;
<OL>
  <LI> These cars have two fuel pumps: The transfer pump which is mounted *inside*
   the gas tank, and the regular pump which pumps the gas to the fuel
   distributor.<BR>
   Just before you start the car (key in "on" position) you should hear a
   slight buzzing that MUST go away after 5 seconds. Whenever the buzzing
   noise becomes increasingly more audible while driving, it may indicate that
   one of the pumps is about to fail. Changing the fuel filter may help.
   Bentley manual has a procedure to check the health of the pump, basically
   by measuring the current being drawn.
   Cleaning the fuel filter screen with the transfer pump also seems to help.

Q: What does an engine compression test tell me about the health of my engine?
<OL>
  <LI> There are different ways to check engine compressions, and they can reveal
   specific internal defects.<BR>
   General procedure:<BR>
  <OL>
    <LI> Remove all spark plugs.
    <LI> Ground center spark plug wire AWAY from the cylinders
    <LI> Make sure you have a healthy battery &amp; the car is at operating temp.
    <LI> Attach compression gauge on cylinder 1
    <LI> Put car in neutral &amp; have friend push in clutch &amp; accelerator
    <LI> Have friend crank engine, note FIRST reading and reading after
      pressure stabilizes (3-5 cranks).
    <LI> Note down readings and repeat for all cylinders
    <LI> A healthy engine should have all readings near mfr's spec, and should
      be about +/- 10% of each other. If not...you are in trouble.
    <LI> If one or more is low, but not adjacent cylinders (e.g. 1 &amp; 3)
      suspect either a burned valve or worn rings. If adjacent cylinders are
      low, also suspect a bad head gasket or a warped head.
    <LI> To determine whether it's rings or valve, do a leak down test =&gt; Add
      a couple spoon fulls of regular engine oil to the engine through the
      spark plug hole of the offending cylinder
    <LI> Repeat measurement. If it remains low =&gt; Valve/Head, else if the
      readings jumped up =&gt; Rings.<BR>
    <LI> To distinguish between head vs valves =&gt; see a professional. They'll
      lock the drive shaft, put air pressure on the cylinders and watch for
      bubbles in the coolant fluid.<BR>
    <LI> Also the first reading and the final readings should not be too far
      apart.

  </OL>
  <LI> How often should I adjust my valves (gas engines)?
  <LI> All/most? VWs made after 1985 have hydraulic valves, which adjust
   themselves. Cars before that need periodic adjustments.
   Check for the recommended intervals in your manual, do more frequently on
   older cars &amp; with periodic compression checks. Badly adjusted valves reduce
   power, increase pollution and may lead to burned valves (valves cool thru
   contact with the head).<BR>
   It's a fairly easy job to do, you DO need two special tools: One to
   compress the valves and one to remove the adjusting shims. They can be had
   at most car specialty stores.<BR>
   All VW engines based on the old 1500 thru 1800 block use calibrated metal
   shims (tappets) the size of Alka Seltzer pills for adjusting the valves.
   You first measure your clearance, then determine how much off it is, take
   out the old shim, calculate what new size you need, and race of to your
   parts supplier (or use a shim from another valve).

  <LI> What's a CAM "saver" cover, alias CAM splash guard, alias CAM cover baffle?
  <LI> It's piece of plastic that fits between the actual CAM cover and the upper
   CAM bearings (just wedged between the two). When the car is running, oil is
   splashed around a lot in the CAM chamber (just try it...you'll have to
   repaint your garage) and sometimes saturates the positive crankcase
   ventilation valve.<BR>
   The PCV is connected to the breather tube on top of the CAM cover and goes
   to the airfilter box. When the PCV gets saturated it my drip oil into your
   airfilter box. The CAM saver cover prevents oil from splashing directly on
   to the inner CAM cover, and also allows oil to drip back directly on the
   CAM providing extra lubrication instead of just sliding back along the
   sides. Both VW and certain after market places sell these barriers for
   about US$ 15.<BR>
   Many of the newer VWs (87 GTIs) have such a barrier installed as stock, but
   you can often retrofit your car with it as well.
   Note that these things not always fit quite right... According to Graig:
   You need to buy a new cam cover gasket set too as you'll be junking your
   old one when you take the cam cover off. If you have an aftermarket cam
   cover, trade it in for a factory one, as the actual oil breather itself has
   a better baffle (rather than just a screen or mesh like in some aftermarket
   ones). This is a safe preventive too, even if you don't autocross.
   Everyone who even thinks of driving their VW hard should put one of these

  <LI> How do I remove bushings from a blind hole?
   (For example: small bushing on the right side of the clutch throwout shaft)
  <LI> There are several methods:

  <OL>
    <LI> tap it (with a thread tap), screw a bolt into it, and draw it out.
    <LI> this is real slick, and it often works (I use it for pilot bearings
   fill the blind hole with grease, find a bar that fits nicely in the
   bushing (often a junk part like the one that came out of it),
   slug the bar with a hammer and the hydrolic press will force out
   the bushing (really does work!!!)<BR>
    <LI> You just get the appropriate bolt that will JUST thread into
   the soft bushing material.  As you thread it in to the bottom it will pull
   the bushing out (when it hits bottom).
    <LI> Cut/grind a washer so that it's just
   barely bigger than the bushing on two sides, and smaller than the
   bushing on the other two sides. Put a screw through the hole on the
   washer. Work this washer into the blind hole until it gets BEHIND the
   bushing (assuming the bushing doesn't go all the way back).  Then
   straighten the washer out so that the two long sides are against the
   back of the bushing, and tug heartily on the screw with either a slide
   hammer or a prybar, depending on which presents the best potential for
   leverage (in my case, a slidehammer wouldn't fit into the confines,
   but a pair of long-nosed Vise-grips worked perfectly -- the long nose
   worked as a pivot point against a perfectly-positioned bulge in the
   differential housing, sort of like a wheelbarrow, and a good tug got
   the bushing out).

  <LI> How do I check (and remove) for the inline FI filter
   in early A2 cars, and how do I remove it if there.
  <LI> This filter is installed by VW apparently to filter out
   contaminants remaining from manufacture that are in the fuel system *after*
   the main fuel filter, but will continue to catch junk the main filter misses.
   Pre-Digifant/Motronic A2's are affected (CIS, CIS-E).
   Failure to remove this bolt may clog the system.

</OL>
<p>
   This filter is located inside the 'banjo bolt' that
   connects the fuel line to the fuel distributor.
   This bolt is hollow, and the filter, about the size of a long pencil eraser,
   is hiding inside.<BR>
   Here is the procedure I used to check for and remove the filter I
   found in the GTI:

<UL>
  <LI> Buy two copper washers to replace the ones on the banjo bolt,
        or you will suffer a fuel leak like I did.
<STRONG>- HAVE A FIRE EXTINGUISER WITHIN ARM'S REACH!!</STRONG>
  <LI> Start engine, and pull the fuel pump fuse while it is running
        to depressurize the fuel system, or a faceful of gas awaits.
  <LI> Remove the banjo bolt associated with the incoming fuel line
        (don't confuse it with the return line) with a 17 MM wrench.
        A small amount of fuel will dribble out, nothing a paper towel or
        two can't handle.<BR>
  <LI> If your bolt is hollow, celebrate and put everything back together.
        Torque bolt per Bentley's spec for your car.
  <LI> If you see something inside, try to poke it out through the side
        holes in the bolt.  That failing, whip out your drill with a 1/4
        bit, and *gently* apply torque with the bolt supported in a vise.
        In my case, the bit grabbed the filter, and I was able to withdraw
        it.  Admire the filth, then clean the bolt well before reinstalling
        it with the new washers.<BR>
        Alternatively, you can also buy the new screw
        Part nos: Screw = N 0210715 Washers = N 0138128.
  <LI> Don't forget to put your fuel pump fuse back, or the car won't start!

Q: My exhaust bangs against the rear axle/my muffler hangers brake frequently.
</UL>
<p>
A: This is a common problem on certain cars (e.g., A1 Sciroccos and
   early G60 Corrados).<BR>
   Check the following:<BR>
<UL>
  <LI> Realign the exhaust pipes
  <LI> Check front engine mount(s)
  <LI> Replace the hangers with stronger units.
     The most common hangers used in A1/A2 cars up to ~1991 look like
     rubber donuts with some rubber in the middle. I bit like an "0".
     There are two stronger versions of the "0" hanger available:
     840 253 147 A: It looks a tad different but probably work;
     171 253 147 G: This looks identical to the original "0" but has
                    has a chain molded internally and hence cannot be
                    twisted sideways nor break.

</UL>
<PRE>
     Some cars also use rubber donuts without a center piece:
     191 253 147 A and they look like an "O" with a tab on one end.

     The newer A2 &amp; VR6 cars use a different hanger system, and those
     hangers look more like a piece of stretched caneloni.
</PRE>

<UL>
  <LI> One thing to keep in mind is that stiffer hangers may increase interior
     noise (but may prevent your exhaust from bending).

  <LI> Instead of using one stronger one, I have had some success with doubling
     up hangers.

<p>
Q: On the electrical diagrams, do the circuit numbers have any meaning?
<OL>
  <LI> Yes. VW uses Bosch numbering scheme, as do BMW &amp; M-B. The most common ones
   are:<BR>
   1 =      Ground (0 Volt)<BR>
   15=     Switched Positive (Hot when ignition is on)
   30=     Always hot "12 Volt" (even though it'll closer to 13.4 Volt)

  <LI> My battery is not charging well, I am only showing 12V when charging rather
   than 13.4V. What is wrong?<BR>
  <LI> There are numerous causes for this. Most of the time the problem is fairly
   trivial. Going from cheapest to most expensive, try the following:
   See also charge light diagnosis below.

  <UL>
    <LI> Check the ground connections, possibly install a new ground from
     alternator to battery rather than using the engine block/transmission as
     conductor. Forget trying to find the bad connection with an Ohm meter: Say
     your alt. puts out 50 Amps, you'll get a drop of 1 Volt for each .02 Ohm!!!
     Most VOMeters are not accurate enough in this range.
     So, those tiny little resistances that have build up over the years REALLY
     add up.<BR>
     Use a THICK (10 or less Gauge/"AWG"), multistrand wire.
    <LI> Check the alternator wiring harness. Same reason as above.
    <LI> Clean all related connectors (sand paper, file).
    <LI> SOLDER ALL crimped connectors
    <LI> Check for an unusual drain (unlikely but possible)
    <LI> Check/clean/replace the alternator brushes (easy, see wear limits in
     Bentley).<BR>
    <LI> Check the battery water level (use distilled water)
<STRONG>NOTE: DO NOT ASSUME YOU HAVE A MAINTENANCE FREE BATTERY BECAUSE IT</STRONG>
<STRONG>DOES NOT HAVE LITTLE SCREW TOPS. MOST VW BATTERIES ARE NOT MAINTENANCE</STRONG>
<STRONG>FREE AND THE WATER LEVEL SHOULD BE CHECKED PERIODICALLY!</STRONG>
    <LI> Have the battery checked (it may be shorting out)
    <LI> Have the alternator checked (diodes and regulator may be bad). Alternator
     replacement is by the way trivial. If the alternator is bad, upgrade to a
     higher amp one, especially in older cars and if you have a powerful stereo
     system or aux lights 90 amp replacements are the current "hot" ticket. Euro
     car had a detailed procedure on this about 1 or 2 years ago.

  </UL>
</OL>
<PRE>
     NOTE: Many car parts places will check out your alternator for free
     or a very low cost. Sears used to do it for free in the US if you had
     a DieHard battery, now they charge some nominal amount.
   - Replace battery connectors with better quality ones.

<p>
Q: My charge light does not behave as expected. What is wrong?
<OL>
  <LI> Taken from EC (March 1994):
   The charges light is directly connected to the excitor part of the
   alternator. It provides the initial power to get the alt working.
   And it also provides alot of additional info:

</OL>
<p>
   Engine off, ignition on, no charge indicator:
<UL>
  <LI> Lamp burned out, wiring break, internal alt failure, voltage regulator
     bad. Alt will NOT charge!<BR>
   Engine running, charge indicator on:
  <LI> Alt is not charging. Belt loose, bad voltage regulator.
   Charge indicator on, engine &amp; ignition off:
  <LI> At least one of the 3 diode groups is shorted. Alt is only partially
     charging. Have it serviced/replace diodes.
   Charge indicator out at idle, half intensity at higher rpms:
  <LI> At least one of the 3 diode groups is open. Alt is only partially
     chanrging. Have it serviced/replace diodes.
   Charge indicator glows dimly under electrical load (most noticable at night):
  <LI> Bad connection between alt and battery (see above).

Q: Starting problems (hot or cold).
</UL>
<p>
A: Check out the electrical connections, and battery (see above under
   charging). Also check out functioning of the solenoid.
   If the problems occur only with a hot engine, consider the VW
   solenoid package that will cut out most other drain when starting,
   or the heat shield package (also from VW) for the starter.


<p>
Q: What do the H1, H2...H4 designations mean?
<OL>
  <LI> These are the type of Halogen bulbs used in US non-sealed beam lamps
   (reflector &amp; glass) since 1985 and longer for the rest of the world. The
   same lamps are also used in fog/driving lamps. They are available in
   regular strength (around 55 W) and more.
   H1 - Single filament lamp<BR>
   H2 - Single filament lamp?<BR>
   H3 - Single filament lamp?<BR>
   H4 - Dual filament lamp

</OL>
<p>
   These bulbs can be had at different strengths:
   H1 55, 100, and 130 watt<BR>
   H4 - 55/60, 55/100, 80/100, 80/130, 100/150 watt
   Anything bigger than the 55/100 -100 H1 you must have relays or you will
   fry the pins in the back of the fusebox.
   Note that only the stock strength are strictly legal.

<p>
   Tip: When installing new (Halogen) light bulbs in your car, make sure you
   DO NOT touch the glass part of the light bulb with your fingers.
   This is because the oil from your fingers gets so hot that it makes the
   bulb really hot and it explodes. [If you do, clean it off with a high
   concentrate alcohol: methanol, ethanol or isopropanol].

<p>
Q: What's that extra bright red light on some European cars?
<OL>
  <LI> That's a "Nebelschlussleuchte" (sp?), or rear-fog anti-crash light. Many
   of the newer cars shipped to the US have these incorporated (but not
   connected) into the rear lenses [Corrados, Passats, Audis]. Very effective
   in fog, snow and heavy rain.

  <LI> Why does my fog light switch have two positions that do not have any
   effect?<BR>
  <LI> It's to switch on the rear fog light(s), which is often not connected in
   cars shipped to the US &amp; Canada.

  <LI> Why should I use Dielectric grease, and on what?
  <LI> Dielectric grease is a NON-conducting grease that seals out moisture and
   therefore prevents corrosion on electrical connectors. This also happens to
   be one of the main problems with older VWs, and currently one of the causes
   of bad idle/ecu (connector) failures. The jury is still out on this
   grease... some claim it will get hard. Others have suggested to use a
   conducting paste as used on aluminum residential wiring. The latter will
   aid in conduction, but should not be used in high voltage cables (spark
   plugs) or where several wires are adjacent because of potential shorts.

  <LI> I lost the code for my radio. How can I get it back?
  <LI> The only sure way is to contact the dealer, but you may end up
   paying close to 100$ for either the code or a recode.
   Some suggest freezing the radio overnight which will reset the
   code to 0000, though it may also kill the LCD display.

</OL>
<p>
   Hold on that code in a very safe place!

<p>
Q: My radio never locks up if I disconnect the battery eventhough
   it is claimed to be a coded radio?<BR>
<OL>
  <LI> The code has to be activated before it will lock up the radio.
   This is normally done right after you buy the car, but nowadays
   with the sad dealer service it is often overlooked.
   See the "coding radio" archive on how to do this, but it basically
   comes down to entering the code as though the radio had locked up.

  <LI> How often should I replace my spark plug wires? How can I check them?
  <LI> Many of the performance shops recommend you change them every 30-50k miles.
   I am not convinced whether this is really needed.
   The general rule of thumb is that the wire's resistance should be
   around 12kOhms per foot, and not more than 50kOhms/foot.
   Check also for the specific values in the car's manual.

  <LI> How can I install programmable wiper control in my car like the new
   cars have?<BR>
  <LI> The programmable wiper control allows you to program the interval time.
   Because VW does not like to add new knobs and wires, they have put all
   the control in the relay in a type of teach and play back mode.
   If your old windshield wiper relay part number is 191 955 531,
   then you can swap it with the programmable unit: 357 955 531 or
   the new number 1HM 955 531B for under US$40.
   Note, APS sells these control units for about 10US$ less. The APS part
   number is: 25-955.531

</OL>
<p>
   To program is easy: Push down on the w-w lever, have it wipe once, bring
   it up and wait until you need to wipe again, then push it down.
   It'll use the same wait interval! Very clever, but not obvious.

Q: What shift mechanisms do VWs use over the years?
<OL>
  <LI> A1 &amp; A2:
      Mechanical linkages<BR>
   Corrado &amp; Passat:<BR>
      Cable linkages (The SLC/VR6 uses a SIMILAR mechanism as the G60,
      contrary to some "knowledgeable" car mags. The main difference is a

   A3:<BR>
      Mechanical linkages with counter weight, ?Cable linkages on VR6?

  <LI> What size clutches did VW use over the years?
  <LI> According to Peter Tong:
   There are 4 sizes. 190mm early gas rabbit (A1s), 200mm diesel rabbits,
   210 mm 83-84 GTI, 85-92 G/J/ (A2s). I think Sachs also sells a 215mm clutch
   kit as well - aftermarket.<BR>
   Many clutches in these sizes come for road and racing applications.
   You can also combine clutch discs with different strength pressure plates
   as well. 16V clutch is similar but has provision for the AGB tranny's
   larger input shaft.

   See also the performance FAQ on sport clutches.

<p>
Q: How can I improve shift effort/meshing of my gears? First gear feels like
   there is something blocking it?<BR>
<OL>
  <LI> First check out the linkage adjustments, regrease where needed, and older
   cars, possibly replace the old linkages/bushings. A special spacer tool is
   needed for one of the adjustments (A1 &amp; A2) which happens to be exactly the
   same size as the skinny side of an audio cassette. Other special tools may
   be needed.

</OL>
<p>
   The end of the shift lever has a ball on it that fits into a cup.
   The cup wears and allows the ball to ride lower and lower.  Pretty soon,
   the ball, with shifter attatched, is riding so low that you don't need
   to push down to bypass the reverse lock out.
   All you need to do is replace the ball and cup.  While you're in there,
   replace theshifter bushings for the feedthrough.
   See the Bentley manual for an excellent description.
   BTW, you'll most likely have to drop the exhaust to get at the parts.
   I have done this operation several times on various models, and can
   honestly say that it can be done in about 2 hours or less if you
   have a torch to remove the old exhaust clamps.

<p>
   Also check out whether the motor/transmission mounts are ok, misalignment
   will cause shifting problems as will a dragging clutch.
   If your shifting effort is hard/stiff on cold days &amp; grinds in 1st &amp; 2nd,
   but easier once warmed up you may want to change to a synthetic
   transmission fluid (see performance FAQ).

<p>
   Also see the G60_Xmission_Mods, faq.vw.perf, Solid_Shifter for adding a
   counter weight to the shift linkages for a more "solid" feel, and
   Adjust_Linkages.


<p>
Q: First gear grinds? &lt;NOISE&gt;<BR>
<OL>
  <LI> Shift into third thirst then shift into first.

  <LI> How can you tell if your synchro is REALLY shot?
  <LI> Let the car idle, and with out depressing the clutch move the gear
  shift into the gears you want to test.
  If the synchros are more or less ok your idle will dip (or as I found out,
  your car will start to move) w/o crunching.,
  If however they are shot, you'll hear a big grinding sound.
  Don't try it with the reverse gear, it has no synchro an will crunch
  majorly.

  <LI> What's a CV Joint?
  <LI> Constant Velocity Joints (Joint Homokinetique (Fr)) connect the two ends of
   your two drives shafts to your differential and the wheels. They allow the
   drive axle to move and allows you to transmit power when you turn. The
   closest equivalent is a Universal Joint.

  <LI> How do CV Joints go bad and how can I prevent it from happening?
  <LI> CV Joints wear out over time, like any other moving part. However they wear
   out prematurely when the boot that surrounds them cracks and lets in dirt,
   or when the CV grease deteriorates.<BR>
   The boots crack because of age or because of street debris, and therefore
   the outer CVJs (esp. with the more exposed CVJs in A1 cars) are most
   subject to tearing. To detect a tear in outer CVJ boot is easy: it'll throw
   black grease all around your inner rim, around your brake.
   Whenever you check your tire pressure, check for those signs.
   To detect a rip in an inner CVJ boot, and small cracks in the outer, you
   need to manually inspect them. If you detect a ripped boot early, you can
   get away by merely repacking the CVJ boot with CVJ grease and a new boot.
   NOTE: VW and Loebro sell boot kits, that includes everything you need for
   the job (about US$15).<BR>
   If on the other hand, you did not detect the rip early, or you hear a
   knocking sound when you turn, you may have to &lt;NOISE&gt; replace the entire
   CVJ, a messy procedure requiring special tools.
   Other symptoms of a bad CVJ includes increased &amp; uneven steering effort
   while driving.

</OL>
<p>
   CVJs also fail because the CVJ grease deteriorates over time because of
   heat exposure.<BR>
   Here too the outer ones get the most beating because of the heat generated
   by the brake disks.

<p>
   Generally, you should repack the outer (&amp; change the boots) every 60k
   miles. The inner ones usually last closer to 100k miles. If however you see
   pitting and scoring of any of the inner surfaces you may as well replace
   them.

<p>
   Tip: [First heard from WolfSport, reported by [Borowski]) There are many
   times when both wheel drive shafts need to be removed (two torn boots,
   etc.) This is a perfect opportunity,to switch the CV joints to the opposite
   sides. They will then wear on different internal surfaces, extending their
   life.

<p>
Q: What tool should I use to remove my inner CV Joint (driveshaft-to-drive
   axle flange) bolts?<BR>
<OL>
  <LI> Most VWs use an 8mm 12 point internal spline, aka CV Joint tool aka triple
   square.<BR>
   Snap On triple-square CV socket, Part number (3/8" drive) = FTSM8C.
   KD #2304, fits in a 5/16" socket.<BR>

Q: How do I know my front wheel bearings are shot?
<OL>
  <LI> They'll make a roaring "wowowowow" sound, and the noise &lt;NOISE&gt; may change
   depending whether you are heading straight or turning. Special tools are
   needed to remove the bearing (cost ~150US$) though the bearings themselves
   are around 30US$/each. Certain performance places listed above will sell
   bearings packed with synthetic grease (last much longer, racing
   applications).

Q: I need to change my brake pads, which should I get?
<OL>
  <LI> This is a tricky question, and depends on what car you drive and whether
   you were happy with what you had.

</OL>
<p>
   Normal driving, no problem with fade:
   Stock VW, or Mintex Silver pads. Repco Semi-Metallic are ok as well. Others
   like or prefer Wagner Pads.

<p>
   Autocross:<BR>
   Repco Metal Masters. Be aware that many have reported that these pads
   require significant more pedal pressure, especially when cold.
   Advantages: Fade resistant, less brake dust, no squeal.

<p>
Q: Is it easy to change pads/shoes?<BR>
<OL>
  <LI> On most newer VWs, changing front pads is next to trivial. Rear pads
   require more work because the piston needs to be screwed in which is either
   done with a allen (hex) wrench or a special tool. Rear shoes (drums) are
   probably the hardest, but still easy enough. Follow Bentley and/or Muir.

  <LI> Do I need to turn my rotors each time I change pads?
  <LI> Another religious issue...
   In general: NO, unless your rotors are badly scored. If they are warped,
   replace (it's cheap and easy to do). Call places like APS &amp; WolfSport.
   Note: If you take the rotors off yourself, turning them at a machine shop
   costs very little.

  <LI> How often should I bleed my brakes and change the fluid?
  <LI> Brake fluid should be changed AT LEAST every two years. Bleeding should be
   done yearly and after an Autocross. Brake fluid absorbs water which
   corrodes the lines. Bleeding regularly will significantly increase safety
   and life of your brake components.<BR>
   DOT 4 fluids have a higher boiling point than DOT 3 fluid but are also more
   hydrophilic and therefore must be replaced more frequently than DOT 3.

  <LI> What brake fluid should I use?
  <LI> Check the manual. Most older VWs use DOT 3. The newer ones use DOT 4 or
   Super DOT 4 (higher boiling point). Castrol makes one which is both DOT 3
   and 4 compatible with a very high boiling point.
   The only place I have found Super DOT 4 in the US is at the VW dealer.
   One of the dealerships here also recommends Wagner as an aftermarket DOT 4
   oil.<BR>
   The higher the boiling the better: Brake -&gt; heat -&gt; fluid boils -&gt; bubbles
   -&gt; loss in brake pressure -&gt; crash.

  <LI> How do I remove the screw that holds the front rotor in place?
  <LI> If a screwdriver &amp; liquid wrench does not work, try an impact screwdriver.
   It's a screwdriver that makes a 1/4 turn when hit by a hammer.

</OL>
<p>
   Tip: When changing the rotors, make sure you put a bundle of anti-seize on
   the inside of the new rotors so they do not get stuck to the hub.
   Also remove as much rust and gunk so that the rotors seat well.
   I had to take mine off the hard way: Heat until red, cool with cold water,
   hammer and use a pry bar.<BR>
   Also make sure you antiseize the screw that holds the rotor in place. If
   the head is messed up you can try reslotting, but chances are it won't help
   either.

<p>
   If the screw head is messed up be extremely careful with those easy-offs/
   screw or tap extractors.<BR>
   When they break, you cannot get them out.
   Andy's recommendation is to drill out the screw with the right diameter
   drill instead, rethread, and put in a new screw of a larger diameter. You
   don't want to make the hole too big either, though you could use a threadlocker 
   to come back to the original size.<BR>
   Note that that screw is not vital! It only holds the rotor temporarily in
   place until the wheel bolts torque the rim/rotor/hub sandwich together.

<p>
Q: I hear a "clunk" each time I brake/start? &lt;NOISE&gt;
<OL>
  <LI> Check whether all the anti-rattle springs are still there (two per
   caliper).

  <LI> How do I prevent my brakes from squealing? &lt;NOISE&gt;
  <LI> Chances are that you have the original semi-metallic VW brakes pads, which
   are notorious for this.<BR>
   First line of defense is to get that "anti-brake-squeal goo" (comes in a
   tube or a spray can) and apply it to the BACKS of all your pads. That stuff
   is essentially liquid high temp rubber that will dampen vibrations.
   The second line of defense is to change to a different brake pad brand.
   See the Repco_MetalMasters file on this subject.
   (In short, do not get Repco MM's unless you want to race, their SemiMetallics 
   are closer to stock in brake feel, while someone else recommends
   Wagner pads.)

  <LI> When standing on the brake pedal, my foot slowly sinks to the floor? What's
   wrong?<BR>
  <LI> You either have a leak or your master cylinder is shot. Don't bother trying
   to rebuild the master cylinder, unless you have access to high precision
   tools. Mexican made replacements tend not to last long. Get the German OEM
   ones or the VW one (same thing, more $$$$).

  <LI> Problems with rear drum brake lock up?
  <LI> This can have many causes:
  <UL>
    <LI> Out of round drums. Have them turned or replaced (easy, cheap)
    <LI> Change shoes
    <LI> Out of adjustment or self adjusting mechanism not functioning right
    <LI> Handbrake cable out of adjustment
    <LI> Proportioning valve out of adjustment or faulty
    <LI> Incorrect cylinders installed (17mm vs 14 mm, they look very similar but
   make a 40% in brake pressure!)<BR>
    <LI> Faulty master cylinder.

  </UL>
  <LI> What grease should I use on the rear axles of my VW.
  <LI> A high quality Lithium based grease with Molibdenum disulfide (MoS2) (all
   VW shops have switched to this).<BR>
   In general you can use "Moly-Slip" grease where you used to use the old
   "White Lithium" grease. MoS2 works a bit like graphite in that it doubles
   the lubrication properties of the base grease.
   Note: Generally do not mix greases of different base, e.g., an Aluminum
   based grease with Lithium base. They may react and lose lubrication
   properties. Note2: CV Joints use a special grease, less viscous grease.

<A NAME="14"><H2>MAINTENANCE</H2></A>

<p>
One of the best ways to keep your car alive is to perform periodic
maintenance.<BR>
Here is some data that applies mostly to the newer A2 cars.
This data came from the VW manuals, Bosch dealer, and New Dimensions.


<A NAME="15"><H4>New Car</H4></A>
Do not change the oil until after the recommended initial 7500 miles.
Apparently VW uses a special oil to break in the car. Do check the oil
level on new cars frequently.


<A NAME="16"><H4>Oil Change</H4></A>
It's a religious issue. The following seems to work:
Mineral Oils:	every 3000 miles or 5000 kms or 6 months
Synthetics:	every 7500 miles or 12000 kms or 12 (?) months
Change oilfilter at the same time


<A NAME="17"><H4>Fuel Filter (FI cars)</H4></A>
Every 60 k miles (eventhough VW now claims it's not needed)


<A NAME="18"><H4>OxySensor</H4></A>
Older A2s with Non heated sensors:	30k miles
Newer A2s with heated sensors:		60k miles
Do NOT neglect this. You will NOT be saving money because if the
sensor goes bad it will quickly take your catalytic converter with it.
And those are EXPENSIVE!


<A NAME="19"><H4>Plugs</H4></A>
Newer A2s:	Every 30 k miles<BR>
I often check them (gap) and clean them every 15k miles


<A NAME="20"><H4>Transmission Fluid</H4></A>
Synthetic Fluid:	replace every 90k miles


<A NAME="21"><H4>CVJoints</H4></A>
Repack:


<A NAME="22"><H4>Coolant</H4></A>
Every two years or when it turns murky


<A NAME="23"><H4>Brake Fluid</H4></A>
Renew every two years<BR>
Purge every year


<A NAME="24"><H4>Drive Belt</H4></A>
8V:			100 k miles, but safer at 75k miles
16V/A1 Euro GTI:	50 k miles


<A NAME="25"><H4>Belts</H4></A>
Every 60 k miles. Put old ones in trunk.


<A NAME="26"><H4>Coolant hoses</H4></A>
Unclear, but they seem to last about 100-200 k miles.
If you see one go, replace them all because you'll never remember
which was changed when.



<A NAME="27"><H2>TIRES/RIMS/SUSPENSION</H2></A>

<p>
NOTE: Most tire/rim/suspension questions have been moved to the performance FAQ.
   The reason for this is that buying stock tires/rims/shocks is often
   more expensive than buying a better product.


<p>
Q: How do I know whether my shocks are worn out?
<OL>
  <LI> Shocks either lose their damping capability or freeze up. The result is
   that your car may not handle well (or safely). When you bounce the front of
   the car, a good set of shocks will stop the motion in less than one cycle:
   Bounce the car couple times, let go, and it should go up and a small amount
   down and then STOP.<BR>
   Just look at your old mechanics/physics books for damped and undamped
   impulse response of a spring and damper combination.
   Test for seizing: you press down, and it stays down. Note that Sport Shocks
   may be so stiff that it will barely move when you press down.
   Note also that this failure mode occurs mostly on A1 cars which put too
   much side loads on shocks.<BR>
   I [Jan] went thru several virtually indestructible Bilstein sport shocks
   due to this failure. Hold on that receipt for life time warrantee!!!!

</OL>
<p>
   Also suspect your shock if you hear an excessive amount of swishing.&lt;NOISE&gt;
   That's cavitation (local boiling of oil) which usually accelerates wear.
   "Gas" shocks contain a chamber of pressurized gas that keeps the oil under
   pressure and prevents cavitation, increasing damping capabilities and
   reducing wear.<BR>
   For the front "shocks" you have two choices for replacement: You can either
   buy an entirely new strut (which is the whole assembly, usually sold in
   combination with springs) or replace the shock insert in your existing
   strut (cheaper, more work). Most of the time you replace the insert.
   The rear shocks are replaced as a whole, and fairly easy to do yourself.
   Note that the fronts tend to wear out long before the rears.
   Note, if you replace the front shocks you may want to consider replacing
   the upper strut bearings.

<p>
Q: How do I know upper strut bearings are worn?
<OL>
  <LI> Those are the black rubber and brass metal that stick out of your shock
   towers. They fail in two ways:<BR>
</OL>
<p>
   - Rubber gets stressed out: They'll stick more than ~1.5 cm above the shock
   towers<BR>
<UL>
  <LI> Metal bushing worn: Steering will feel loose, you may hear a clunking
   noise at times. &lt;NOISE&gt; They are not that expensive (ca 25US$), and easy to
   do once you get the strut out of the car.

</UL>
<p>
   (Mark Shaw) says something similar: If I can get the tips of my fingers
   between the top plate and the housing with the vehicle standing on a level
   surface, then the strut bearing has seen enough abuse. This was passed on
   to me by a friend who works at the VW Proving Grounds south of Phoenix. He
   also recommends that you use the ones with the "A" suffix on the part
   number ([jan] note many aftermarket places sell heavy duty versions of
   these, probably those with an "A")

<p>
   I do not change them unless the strut cartridges are also weak. Experience
   has shown me that in all cases strut bearings should be replaced when the
   strut cartridges are replaced.

<p>
   Note also that (Norm Heckman): A drop of 3/4" was given as a limit for auto
   safety inspection rejection in N.Y. state. (drop = after you jack up the
   car).

<p>
Q: What is the proper tire inflation for my car?
   Should I use the number printed on the side of the car?
<OL>
  <LI> Probably the best tire pressure to follow for average driving
   is the one printed on the door jamb, or listed in your manual
   of the car...at least it's a good starting point.

</OL>
<p>
   When the tires are new, measure the profile depth on the sides and
   in the center of the tire, for all tires.
   Measure again after you have driven couple thousand miles/kms.
   The wear should be more or less even accross the entire tire width, with
   a bit more wear on the front than the rear tires (FWD cars!).
   This naturally assumes that your alignment is correct.

<p>
   If you find that the centers of the tires are wearing more, decrease
   pressure, if you find they are wearing less, increase pressure
   (radial tires, bias plies behave differently).
   If you find that the side of the tires are wearing uneven
   (or see other oddities), you may need an alignment.
   (See also the alignment archives on this).
   Generally if you load up your car with alot of weight, it's recommended
   to increase your tire pressures.<BR>
   Similarly, if you are planning to drive at high speeds for a longer
   period of time, increase the pressure.
   This will reduce tire flex, and hence will produce less heat build up.
   Also keep in mind that underinflation is one of the worst things
   you can do to a tire for that very reason.
   Higher tire pressures are also recommended to reduce the chance of
   rim damage with softer rims (e.g., 1990 Corrados, some 16V rims).

<p>
   The number printed on the side of the tire is merely the maximum
   inflation pressure for that tire, and is not meant to indicate the
   inflation pressure for your car.

<p>
   For performance driving see the performance faq.

<p>
Q: What shocks are interchangeable between cars?
<OL>
  <LI> Here is a list of what is interchangable between the various
   VW models in the strut-shock area. [From ND BBS]

</OL>
<p>
 A1 Models = 75-88 Scirocco 75-84 Rabbit (Golf 1) 80-92 Cabrio

                know as A1 suspension design most US models use
                internal threaded struts ( can swap for external)
                all other use the same inserts and strut bearings
                Springs vary according to models
</PRE>

<p>
 A2 Models   85-92 Golf and Jetta 2 93- Golf and Jetta 3
<PRE>
                slight
                mods needed to A3 to use A2 struts as all A3 and some
                late A2 have sealed (throw away) struts housings.
                Springs vary

 Others      Corrado G60 models can use A2 shocks in the rear
                but front are same dimensions but use a larger shaft
                and are designed for higher weight load.
                Strut housings are similar Strut bearings look the same
                But I believe the Corrado ones are stronger. We now
                offer HD strut bearings (VR6 Golf) for all the A2 style

Q: What do all those numbers mean on my tire.
<OL>
  <LI> See the rec.autos FAQs, the tire FAQ, and also the VW Performance
   FAQ for size info.<BR>
   For the other number:<BR>
   The last 3 numbers on the DOT code is the build date: 113
   means the tire was made in the 11th week of 1993, or 015 = 1st week of 1995.

<OL>
  <LI> [From an old WolfSport catalog:] Place a 15 mm socket between the arm and
   foot of the lower hinge (to the outside of the hinge anchor bolt). You'll
   have to almost close the door to get &amp; keep it in place. Now gently! exert
   some force on the door &amp; the check alignment.

<p>
   [From Jim Macklow] I've had success with my wife's Rabbit by doing the
   following: Open door, then jack up door with floor jack, making sure the
   door is closed as far as possible.

<p>
Q: How do I eliminate all the rattles, squeaks and buzzes in my car? &lt;NOISE&gt;
<OL>
  <LI> VWs are unfortunately well known for this. Part of the cause is the rather
   stiff suspension and hard motor mounts that just rattles the car apart.
   Often the fix is easy once you find the cause. The following are a few
   tricks that I have used over the year that will help eliminate a good deal
   of them.

</OL>
<p>
   Tip: Start with cleaning the inside and outside of the car, and remove all
   the coins and pens stuck in the seat rails. Then take a screw/nut driver
   and fasten all accessible interior screws and bolts. If a particular
   screw/bolt loosens frequently, use Loctite (tm). The bolt that holds the
   seat back adjustment knob is notorious for loosening and rattling. Have
   someone drive around while you go around and isolate where all the noise
   comes from.

<p>
   Another weird one that helps with some rattles and groans is to install a
   lower stress bar on A-1 cars that do not have one, and apparently an upper
   shock tower stress bar on all others (haven't tried this yet, but Aaron @
   APS claims that it helps surprisingly well).

<p>
Q: Something in my dash rattles? &lt;NOISE&gt;
<OL>
  <LI> That's probably the most common and most annoying place for it to happen.
   VWs have actually improved over the years and so we can learn from their
   attempts to reduce rattles. Most of the rattles are caused by loose wires
   and components touching the vent tubes or other solid material. VW often
   uses electric tape to hold things together, but over time the tape loosens
   and falls off. What you need to do is get a bunch of tie wraps, bundle
   everything back, get some "nerf foam" or sheets of black felt and position
   it between the wires, vents and other stuff. Using felt or foam between
   interior vinyl covered body panels also helps eliminate a lot of squeaks
   there.<BR>
   (Note that Corrados now have strips of black felt glued to the back of
   virtually all plastic panels).<BR>
   Another type of dash squeak is caused by plastic components rubbing against
   each other. Usually a dose of ClearGuard will help eliminate that but if
   you have the space try glueing some felt between the two.

</OL>
<p>
   A tip from (Tim Hogard): Tighten the the two nuts that hold the dash in
   that are on the engine side of the firewall.

<p>
Q: My doors/hatch/vinyl squeak over bumpy roads, especially when cold? &lt;NOISE&gt;
<OL>
  <LI> "Lubricate" the door seals with Talcum powder or ClearGuard. "Lubricate"
   the rest with ClearGuard or Silicone spray. You may also want to adjust the
   doors so they close better by first loosening the strike pin and moving it
   either in or out. The rear hatch lock can also be moved a bit, but it's
   easier to adjust those black knobs on either side of the hatch. They screw
   in and out.

  <LI> My suspension groans when I go over a speed bump/other bumps? &lt;NOISE&gt;
  <LI> Check for squeaky muffler hangers, and sway bar bushing!
   Squeeky Muffler hangers sounds like: eee-eee-eee as you drive along.
   Sway bar bushings squeek when you go over a bump slowly, e.g.,
   a speed bump. It sounds like: eeee--aaaa, eeee-aaaa.

</OL>
<p>
   Start with Si-spray. It usually cures the noise temporarily,
   but at least you will be able to identify where the noise is
   coming from.

<p>
   For a more permanent sway-bar bushing noise solution, especially
   if you have an aftermarket sway bar with polyurethane bushings:
   try the following:<BR>
<OL>
  <LI> Check the alignment of all the components.
  <LI> Relube the bushings with a Silicone-Teflon grease.
      APS's sway bars now come with this grease and it works fairly well.
  <LI> Here is a trick that I have not tried as yet: Score the bushings
      with coarse sand paper or fine saw. This will leave little
      indents where the grease can settle rather than squeezed out when
      you reassemble the bushings.

</OL>
<p>
   The same tricks can be used for other rubber based suspension components
   (e.g., A-arm bushings).

<p>
Q: Something in my door rattles? &lt;NOISE&gt;
<OL>
  <LI> First make sure it's not a screw which is loose (lots hidden away). If
   that's not the case then take the door panel off and check all the screws
   inside. Tighten, use Loctite, possibly use foam and felt to prevent
   components from banging against each other. Some recommend installing a
   sound deadening material such as Dynamat (tm).
   Before putting the door panel back, you may want to use some foam strips
   (like the window air seals) to provide some spacing for the snaps.
   While you are at it, clean the drain holes and lube the lock &amp; window
   mechanism.

  <LI> How should I take care of my car's exterior? What products to use?
  <LI> Wash on a regular basis. First, hose down car, don't aim at locks, gas cap,
   etc. Also hose down the radiator &amp; underside of the car.
   Use one of the available car wash products in a bucket &amp; sponge down car.
   (All this to be done in the shade).<BR>
   I have tried several types of shampoo, like the RainDance, dislike the
   Meguire's shampoo, others like Blue Coral. Other suggestions are welcome.
   Rinse sponge often to avoid scratching the paint. Generally work from
   cleanest areas (roof) to dirtiest (front sides) of car.
   Avoid rubbing too hard as you may scratch the surface.
   Keep car wet (on a dry day in CA, the car dries almost instantly leaving
   water marks).<BR>
   Hose down soap, and with a fresh bucket of water and a chamois or a
   synthetic chamois, dry car.<BR>
   Again, rinse the rag as often as you can.

</OL>
<p>
   Wax at least twice a year, with a good brand of wax. Wax only after the car
   has been thoroughly washed. Follow the directions of the product and either
   use clean rags or cotton wool to apply wax.
   Why wax? It puts a protective layer over your paint, and replenishes lost
   oils.<BR>
   Hard waxes (e.g., Carnuba based waxes) tend to last longer but require a
   lot of work.<BR>
   [Note: Latest word on this is that these waxes contain
   hardly any Carnuba any more]<BR>
   See what the local body shop uses (the one I visit use Meguire's
   professional line of products, but it's by no means the only wax. I like it
   as well (Hi Tech Yellow Wax #26), used to use RainDance wax but stopped
   because it is rumored to be too abrasive, hated Nu-Finish.
   The ultimate is Zymol, 800-999-5563, but it costs a lot! Others have
   had good results with Mother's.)<BR>
   Wax horizontal surfaces more frequently (hood, roof).
   If rain does not bead up and slide off the car, it's time to rewax.
   Polish your car sparingly, e.g., if you want to get rid of swirls,
   scratches or an oxidized layer of paint.
   Polishes contain fine grit and therefore are rather abrasive.
   You can get polishes with different grades of grit #2, e.g., see Meguire's
   line of polishers: Swirl Remover #9 (to be used last),
   Fine Cut Cleaner #2 (leaves a dull finish, removes small scratches), etc.
   The coarsest version of a polish is a rubbing compound.
   It will not leave a shine, and works just like a piece of sand paper.
   It is mainly used to even out portions that were repainted.
   Note that you can buy 1000, 1500 and 2000 grit sandpaper which in some
   cases is actually finer than some rubbing compounds.
   They may come in handy when you are trying to smooth a repainted scratch.

<p>
   Note that many "waxes" contain both detergents and polishing compounds.
   Some work quite well (e.g., DuPont's Rain Dance) but some find it too
   abrasive for frequent use. That's why it's better to use non-abrasive
   waxes, and only polish when you need it.

<p>
   Glazing compounds are a bit like wax:
   they replenish lost chemicals in the paint, but the protective layer they
   provide does not last very long (e.g., Meguire's Show Car Glaze #7).
   For a deep shine I often first use a glaze then
   a carnuba wax. I have tried some of the supposed once a year hi-tech
   "coverings" but was rather underwhelmed by the result.

<p>
   To get the wax off the black trim, use some detergent or Simple Green &amp; a
   toothbrush. Then apply a vinyl/rubber conditioner on all
   rubber components. It'll slow the ageing process a bit and restore
   the color of the component (see below for product listing).

<p>
   To get the rims clean is a different matter, especially the alloy rims.
   VW's product is supposedly quite good, I would avoid most others as they
   contain extremely caustic (i.e., HF) acids. I haven't found the "best"
   formula as yet... I use Simple Green, dishwashing detergent and some
   polishing compound.<BR>
   To make your life easier, wax your rims. It'll also reduce pitting (which
   is caused by a galvanic action between the hot brake metal particles and
   your alloy). BTW, BBS rims are nice but a chore to clean.
   On the tires use one of the rubber/vinyl conditioner or one of
   products made specifically made for tires. They are usually sold in cans
   (Tire Shine), but I find it hard not to overspray all over the place (&amp;
   that stuff leaves marks on the floor).

<p>
   To get windows real clean, wash with a strong detergent, perhaps followed
   by some alcohol. Then use Windex or similar product and dry most with
   rag/chamois and follow with a piece of newspaper paper. Works amazingly
   well.<BR>
   A product like Rain-X also cleans the windows real well as a side effect.
   Some have complained that Rain-X leaves a hazy film (can be buffed out with
   a *very* clean rag). Rain-X ("invisible windshield wipers") work quite well
   on some windshields but only last a couple 1000 kms, or about a month
   and a half.

<p>
   Inside the car I just use some light detergent and water to clean
   things. For the vinyl dash and other vinyl interior components I now
   use (again) Meguire's #40 spray. It's similar in function to products
   like Clear Guard and Armor All except it's not so greasy, slippery
   and smells better.<BR>
   Carpets and seats you just vacuum. It's not a bad idea to treat cloth
   seats and carpets with protective products like Scotch Guard.
   This is easy to do yourself and often sold at an enormous cost with
   new cars.

<p>
Q: What are the best vinyl/rubber cleaners/enhancers/replenishers?
<OL>
  <LI> Armor All was one of the first widely available products that would
   make greyed plastic and rubber components black again.
   However, it has now fallen in disfavor because of its drying out
   effect on rubber components causing dry rot when the these components
   stop receiving regular applications. I have used the stuff for over
   7 years without the noted cracking and rot, but I may have been lucky
   and I usually do not hang on to my tires all that long ;-&gt;

</OL>
<p>
   Currently recommended products:<BR>
   Clear Guard, Black Again, Meguiar #42, Harly Tire-Nu or Lexol Vinylex.
   Others have reported favorable (better) results with Turtle Wax's Black
   Chrome product for black bumpers and Westley's Black Magic.

<p>
   Here is a writeup sent to me by JBratek@aol.com from Larry Reynolds of
   Car Care Specialties, Inc, Saddle Brook, NJ, 201-796-8300, carcaresp@aol.com
   during a recent PCA workshop covering concour tips for Porsche owners:

<p>
   There are two main degrading agents that attack tires. They are UV light
   waves and ozone. Both of these attack the long hydrocarbon chains of the
   rubber and by breaking these bonds, shorten the molecules with resulting loss
   of elasticity and other problems. Tire manufacturers add two primary
   sacraficial protectants to the rubber. To protect against UV, they add carbon
   black. This is why tires don't come in designer colors to match your paint.
   The carbon black will turn white/gray as it absorbs the UV and dissipates the
   energy as heat. Thus the basis of rubber parts turning gray as they age. To
   protect against ozone, tire manufacturers add a wax-based sacraficial
   protectant. The ozone attacks the wax and depletes it. As the tire rolls,
   additional wax is forced to the surface of the tire. This is referred to as
   "blooming". This blooming refreshes the surface wax protectant. A tire that
   has not been flexed will have the wax depleted by the ozone and thus begin to
   degrade and suffer "dry rot". The silicone oil in Armour All et Al may
   actually dissolve the wax and be the cause of premature tire sidewall
   cracking/failure. In conclusion, any tire dressing should contain a UV
   protectant to bolster the efforts of the carbon black and not contain any
   silicone.

   and rotate this in the chip until all of the rust is sanded off.
   [Jan: I just fold either 220 or 400 grit sand paper and use the edge
   to scrub the rust off. If I see pitting, I use Naval Jelly (Phosphoric
   Acid) to reduce the remaining rust]

<p>
   I think that he used a primer first and then the touch-up paint but I don't
   recall that well.<BR>
   [Jan: Primer is a good idea because it helps evening out the pit
   that you created. I use Galvanizing primer, sold under different brands
   such as Rustoleum. It's more rust resistant. After it dries I use
   400 or higher grid sandpaper to level the primer out].

<p>
   He used the end of a match (matchbook type (cardboard))
   to apply the paint because the brush was usually too clumsy.
   [Jan: Use what ever makes sense. QTips, small brushes, the end of a
   bamboo BBQ squewer. For larger areas, I use a spray can directly,
   after covering the stuff I don't want to paint.]

<p>
   Fill the chip as much as possible letting the paint dry between coats
   until it is flush with the old paint.
   Let it all dry thoroughly and then polish the car (area).

<p>
Q: How does paintless dent removal work?
<OL>
  <LI> From Larry Keys:
   They're really, hush, hush, about it.  They only describe their method
   as "the process".  I'm almost certain that no magnets or hammers are
   used, since the paint is perfect and so is the smoothness of the metal.

</OL>
<p>
   Someone posted on r.a.driving, that the process is actually an old one
   that's been around since the 50`s.  Anyway, he went on to say that this
   process is used on airplanes to remove hail dents.  The poster said that
   the metal skin of the plane was allowed to heat-up, or was heated, then
   dry-ice was applied to the area.  Something to do with the expanding and
   contracting properties of metals?

<p>
   Jan: I had them take out a couple dents in my car, and all they did (in
   my case) is use a set of blunt tools to massage the dents of the inside
   panels out.

<p>
Q: I need to repaint part of my car. What should I look for in a body shop?
<OL>
  <LI> Probably the best you can do is ask several VW dealers where they send
   their cars for warrantee work (and ask them why).
   Also some of the more popular magazines will have recommendations
   but they are usually for the CA area.

</OL>
<p>
   The first thing I look for is the type of paint they use.
   VWs are painted with a Urethane Paint by Hoechst or Glazurit, which
   is about as high quality as you can get [BMW &amp; M-B use the same type].
   I usually try to stick close to the factory brand of paint because the
   pigment formulation is at least similar eventhough the solvents are not
   (the body shop cannot bake the entire car as the factory does).
   Paint fades, but having roughly the same pigment formulation will allow
   the repainted parts fade in roughly the same way.

<p>
   All body shops have to mix the paint to match your color, so you will
   not find any containers that say Alpine Weiss L90E and expect it to match.
   VW buys paint in bulk, and each batch differs slightly in color eventhough
   it may have the same color code.


<p>
Q: How do I fix rubber components such a bumpers and spoilers?
<OL>
  <LI> 3M manufactures a material called "Flexible Parts Repair Material".
   It is a 2-part putty that is essentially a rubber Bondo.  I [Craig] have
   used it several times and am quite happy with it.  I believe that
   the kit costs about $15.00 at your local body shop supply store.

</OL>
<p>
   I [Jan] have used Shoe Goo at times to fix portion of my chin spoiler.
   Works rather well.


<p>
Q: I cracked my windshield, what should I do?
<OL>
  <LI> If the crack is small (&lt;2 cm in diameter) and either out of your line of
   site or away from the wipers, you could have it filled
   with an epoxy compound. Some have reported good luck with this, I have
   not been very lucky.

</OL>
<p>
   If the windshield starts cracking, you could try to drill a hole to
   stop the crack with a tungsten carbide drill bit, bit in all likelyhood
   it's not going to do much good. You still need a new windshield.

<p>
   I personally do not like the majority of aftermarket windshields.
   They are either weaker (crack much quicker), show distortions, introduce
   more wind noise, cause water leakage and therefore
   I usually get the windshield at VW or order the OEM windshield
   (Securit). They are more but I think they work better and seem to
   hold up better to stone chips.<BR>
   You may have to fight it with your insurance co though. I tell them
   that the aftermarket windshields are not E2 certified and therefore
   do not meet OEM specs.

<p>
   The windshield on older VWs are just held in place with the rubber
   molding, while the newer VWs have bonded windshields with a substantial
   higher installation cost.<BR>
   As always, you should replace *ALL* old seals when replacing a windshield,
   it's worth the extra cost to avoid leaks and rust.

<p>
   Look for a reputable place to install the
   windshield because in the newer cars the windshield is part of the
   structural integrety of the car.<BR>
   Some of the mass market and cheaper place DO NOT BOND THE WINDSHIELD
   ADEQUATELY. All they use is Butyl Tape, which stays soft and will
   pop out the windshield in the event of a roll-over. Windshields Of America
   lost a multimillion dollar law suit in Colorado because of this
   (I mention them because I am EXTREMELY dissatisfied with them as well:
   It took them 4 tries to get it right, and I am not even sure they
   used anything but butyl tape).<BR>
   According to the place I now go to (I loose one windshield every couple
   years) recommends P255FC Urethane for bonding the windshield.
   It becomes very rigid and you cannot prick it with a pin after it cures,
   while butil tapes feels soft and goo-y.


<p>
Q: My seat material has ripped, how do I fix it? This is mostly dedicated
   to those with 85-87 GTIs. :-&lt;<BR>
<OL>
  <LI> Excerpts from the group:
   My 87 GTI 16V needed replacement 3 times.  The first two were under
   warranty, the third time I decided on the DIY route.
   I checked the re-uphostery option, but was too much of an unknown
   result.<BR>
   I decided to buy the dealer part and do it myself.  Took the seat out
   and removed the old bolster.  As it turned out, there was a sharp
   weld bead right under where the rip always started!
   A few wraps of ye ole duct tape fixed that.  I then re-installed the
   new bolster cover over the old foam bolster itself.  This was a pain
   in the ass, because there are these sharp upholsterer's clips you
   have to re-bend into place (there may be a tool to ease this, but I
   used pliers).  The whole thing took a couple of hours.
   Anyway, it held up after that.  I'm convinced it was that sharp weld
   in the seat frame that caused it, and if you have a grinder you may
   want to grid it down to smooth it for extra insurance.

</OL>
<p>
   Ok, here's two different versions of fixit solutions: #1 find a GTI with
   the same seats and get the passenger's seat $35 around my parts for a GOOD
   one with NO TEARS or Wear. Then disassemble it and re-cover your driver's
   seat with its parts. it's a little more complicated than just taking one
   out and swapping the other in as things like the seat belt and slider rails
   aren't exactly the same. (they are Really close, but not the same when you
   consider things like the seat belt mount point...)
   #2 Take the entire seat apart and recover it in a BETTER material. I've
   been running my butt across a material called Sunbrella (designed for use
   as boat cushion/boat top material). At first, it didn't seem as comfy as
   the original, but then again the other original wore out and has since
   been covered to match. Mine are done in black which ought to absorb as
   much of the scorching South Florida sun as anything, yet they are never
   hot like vinyl even when I have the glass sunroof removed at noon. I would
   hate to think what an upholstery shop would have charged to do the work my
   mom did re-covering my 2 fromt seats because this fabric is VERY un forgiving
   when you start stretching it over the frame. There were a few stitches that
   mom had to dismantle and re-sew to get to fit just right, but everyone who
   looks into my interior comments on my seats. (the rear seat is still done
   in the original fabric which is now starting to show its age 12+ years)

<p>
Q: How do I treat my leather interior?<BR>
<OL>
  <LI> I have so far not found any "miracle" solution.
   A variety of suggestions however exist:
  <UL>
    <LI> Vacuum all the dust and sand from the seam (it causes the seams to tear)
    <LI> Moist rag for occasional cleansing
    <LI> Meguire's leather treatment
    <LI> Saddle Soap and Mink Oil
    <LI> Lexol Cleaner and Conditioner

Q: When my Corrado spoiler retracts, it squeaks. What do I do? &lt;NOISE&gt;
<OL>
  <LI> "Lubricate" it with Talcum powder. Note that baby powder used to be talcum,
   but because of the naturally occurring asbestos with talcum (I know, we are
   all doomed), baby powder sometimes contains corn starch instead. Note:
   Silicon spray dries out rubber and is not recommended.

  <LI> Are those ventilation filters sold by APS any good?
  <LI> They are pure CRAP!!! They are too restrictive according to Roc Goolen. [If
   you really want to filter your air, go to a hardware store, buy a furnace
   filter for a couple $$ and rig it up somehow. Jan...later I tried that,
   and wouldn't you know, that too restricted the airflow!
   At least I only spent .40 US$ finding this out.]

</OL>
<p>
   Note that the filters that APS used to sell were made by Climismann (sp?);
   they are now selling units made by Bosch and make the claim that they "work
   much better." [Hmmmmm.... Ed.]
