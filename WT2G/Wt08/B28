</CENTER>

<B>STUDY GOAL AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>

Coupled with a concern for employee health, employer liability
issues have heightened the interest in ergonomics and the
possible market implications of ergonomic products.
Ergonomics combines product engineering, psychology, and
medicine to improve human performance and health.<P>

This BCC report analyzes the growing ergonomic office
equipment products market, and describes the technology and
performance criteria for ergonomic or adjustable office
equipment, furniture and computer accessories. It views future
trends that meet the health, safety, and productivity
requirements of the office computing environment.<P>

Legislation both past and pending requires that adjustments be
made available to people who use video display terminals and
keyboards  intensively for more than four hours a day.<P>

Until recently, advanced ergonomic systems have been kept from
wider implementation by their higher cost, limited supply, and
lack of standards and testing. However, the growing demands
for adjustable usage and ever smaller systems are breaking
down these barriers.<P>

Significant technological advancements are taking place today,
despite the current economic recession. Ergonomic office
equipment and accessories represent the cutting edge of
product design with great potential for business opportunity.<P>

<B>CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE STUDY AND FOR WHOM</B><P>

This report presents a detailed analysis of current and future
developments in ergonomics and ergonomic office equipment for
safety and productivity. The design of today's office
equipment has become a major factor in the design and
manufacture of the total system.  Market forecasts are
revealed by individual product segments from 1992 through
1997. Case studies of technology applications, as well as
market size, growth and usage trends through 1997, are
featured.<P>

Additionally, leading suppliers are profiled. This unique
strategic planning tool  shows suppliers to the industry the
paths to business opportunity, while end-users will benefit
from knowing about the new products, processes and their
suppliers.<P>

This report is directed to the following decision-makers who
need strategic planning data on ergonomic office products and
devices, together with information on the manufacturers,
industry and markets. They are:<P>

<UL>
<LI>electronic office equipment suppliers<BR>
<LI>manufacturers of personal computers, and peripherals--keyboards,  mouses, monitors<BR>
<LI>manufacturers of office equipment and furniture--desks,
   tables, chairs and printers<BR>
<LI>manufacturers of computer and furniture accessories:
   keyboard storage drawers; wrist rests; back support lumbar
   rolls; footrests; workstation retrofits; tiltable screen
   arms; antiglare hoods; and other products<BR>
<LI>companies that use computers and workstations<BR>
<LI>rehabilitation and physical therapy professionals
<LI>insurance companies<BR>
<LI>information industry companies -- publishing, advertising,
   etc.<BR>
<LI>government  agencies, OSHA, state agencies<BR>
<LI>electronic and electrical equipment manufacturers<BR>
<LI>merger and acquisition and investment executives</UL><P>

<B>REASONS FOR DOING THE STUDY</B><P>

This BCC report, which first analyzes the trends in office
illness and the implications for workers' compensation claims
as a driving force for ergonomic products, recognizes the
irrefutable logic for preventing office injuries and improved
evidence of the need for ergonomic furniture. The report then
analyzes trends in office furniture, computer accessories and
new computer keyboard design by type and relationship to
industry sectors. Production trends are highlighted with
market forecasts through 1997.<P>

<B>METHODOLOGY AND INFORMATION SOURCES</B><P>

Research was conducted by way of discussions and in-depth
interviews with a representative sample of vendors, end-users,
and trade associations. All dollar projections in this report
are in 1992 constant dollars.<P>

Data are based on a thorough review and appraisal of ergonomic
technology and products based on a systematic review of
developments through telephone and in-person interviews,
together with an extensive data base of technical and
marketing sources.<P>

Additional data for this document were obtained from an
exhaustive review of technical papers.<P>

<B>RELATED BCC RESEARCH CREDENTIALS</B><P>

Since 1971, BCC has been a leader in market research and
consulting to the electronics, computing and
telecommunications industries. BCC continues its in-depth
analysis with the current volume.<P>

<H3><I>INTRODUCTION</I></H3>

</CENTER>



<B>STUDY OBJECTIVES</B><P>



The Clinton Administration has committed itself to building a national 

information infrastructure in the U.S., popularly referred to as the 

"Information Highway." Today, information can be the basis of building large 

fortunes, much as land was a century ago in the American West. Information of 

any kind can race along electronic "superhighways" at the speed of light. In 

the process, barriers are broken down that once segmented huge economic 

empires: computer companies and phone companies, cable systems, movie studios 

and media and information oriented conglomerates.<P> 



All these efforts will, in the near future, make information of any kind 

easily available for individual consumers as well as large companies. The 

printed paper page, long the carrier not only of information but also of 

cultural value, is rapidly being replaced by electronic "blips" that appear on 

our computer screens. And this affects the printing and publishing industry as 

well as our sense of cultural values. Electronic information, while providing 

vastly improved access to published matter, does not have the "permanent" 

qualities of a printed publication. It requires new skills to access, thus 

restricting large shares to information specialists, creating new classes of 

society.<P> 



Another question that is starting to worry many inside and outside the 

industry is how this huge flow of data will be controlled, regulated and 

secured. If anybody can access it, then the real danger exists that anybody 

can also tamper with it, potentially bringing the whole system to a crashing 

halt, with unforeseeable effects on the U.S. or even world economy.<P> 



This study examines the structure of the electronic information service 

industry to the extent that it has replaced or is replacing the printed word. 

It addresses questions such as "What is the future of electronic publishing?" 

and "Who will benefit most: users -publishers - service providers - hardware 

suppliers or software developers?"<P> 





<b>REASONS FOR DOING THE STUDY</B><P>





Over the past decade, computers have become an indispensable tool, in the 

business world as well as at home, for the professional as well as the casual 

user. By some estimates there are now some 40 million personal computers in 

use worldwide. With it went an explosion of new applications and uses, which a 

few years ago might have been considered "science fiction." One of the early 

promises of computer applications in the business was to create the "paperless 

office." These efforts are receiving additional attention, in the U.S. as well 

as worldwide, because the production of printing and writing paper uses wood, 

a natural resource that is becoming more and more sparse, and the paper 

manufacturing process can pose significant environmental threats.<P> 



Although few businesses or individuals are as yet ready to replace all printed 

communications with electronics, significant progress is being made towards 

that goal. Today, electronic databases can provide information in a few 

seconds or minutes that would have otherwise taken hours or days to locate. 

Furthermore, electronic information can be directly stored on magnetic media, 

and thus be easily accessible for anyone using a computer. The range of 

applications is enormous: from CD-ROM library catalogs to on-line 

communications via bulletin boards, from on-line commercial databases offering 

a vast array of downloadable information to electronically filed tax returns, 

from on-line shopping clubs to electronic books, the field appears to be 

limitless.<P> 





<b>CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE STUDY</B><P>





This study pulls together achievements in electronic communications 

technologies and efficiencies during the past decade. It analyzes the limits 

and opportunities of various kinds of technologies and access methods for the 

decade to come. Based on previous patterns, technology developments, and the 

opinions of many industry insiders, we then forecast potential use patterns 

for the nineties and beyond. This report summarizes and compares pertinent 

scenarios, using the most likely ones for our own forecasts.<P> 





<b>SCOPE AND FORMAT</B><P>





This BCC report focuses on the aspect of electronic publishing, including 

books, magazines and newspapers, advertising, marketing, travel and real 

estate transactions, and the like. We examine the current, recent past, and 

foreseeable future developments of electronic publishing in the U.S.A., try to 

quantify its volume, and examine its qualitative impact on the way business is 

done today and people communicate via electronic means. Especially, we 

investigate currently used products and technologies facilitating electronic 

publishing, and attempt to forecast their likely development in various 

applications until the end of the decade. Lastly, we take international 

developments into account, comparing U.S. developments to the rest of the 

world, in order to show possible alternative developments, and how electronic 

publishing will make international communications easier than ever before.<P> 





<b>METHODOLOGY</B><P>





In assembling this report, published data from various governmental and 

private sources were considered. Projections were established by BCC, taking 

into consideration projections made by published sources as well as industry 

consensus and external influences such as demographic and economic data and 

likely political developments.<P> 



Using these data, we have attempted to quantify, in as much detail as possible, the

current and future markets for electronic publications in their various subject categories.

For underlying market developments, we adopted to some extent market forecasts for

the telecommunications industry in general, published by trade associations such as the

National Telecommunications Association (NATA) and others.<P>





<b>INFORMATION SOURCES</B><P>





This study relies heavily on the input provided by experts in the field as well as on the vast scientific and popular literature that is available. The topic of electronic communications is being addressed by a variety of interested parties, ranging from major computer

hardware and software suppliers to major and minor telecommunications concerns as well as the television and entertainment industries. The one industry that is perhaps most concerned is the publishing industry, which is looking for ways to utilize this trend to electronic communications to their advantage.<P>



Lastly, there are a number of government and private entities concerned with the security and safety of electronically transmitted information, developing methods and products to achieve this end. We have attempted to incorporate the latest thinking on these subject matters and are grateful for the input

of all those contacted.<P>

<B>STUDY OBJECTIVES</B><P>

This new Business Communications Co. (BCC) report provides
a technical and economic market analysis of the fiber-optic
test equipment industry.<P>

The principal objectives of this study are to:<P>

<UL>
<LI>Investigate and discuss the instruments, technologies,
       and applications<P>

<LI>Characterize and quantify the current and future U.S.
       and worldwide markets for fiber-optic test equipment,
       including:<P>

<UL><LI>OTDRs--full-featured OTDRs, mini-OTDRs, and
              PC/laptop-
              based OTDRs<BR>
<LI>Power meters<BR>
<LI>Test sets<BR>
<LI>Remote/automatic test equipment<BR>
<LI>Fiber-optic manufacturing test equipment,
              such as optical spectrum analyzers, chromatic-
              dispersion analyzers, profilometers, etc.<BR>
<LI>Other instrumentation such as sources,
              attenuators, talk sets, fiber identifiers, etc.</UL><P>

<LI>Identify and characterize the principal industry
       participants<P>

<LI>Provide an overview and characterize the end-use
       markets for fiber-optic systems, including
       telecommunications (both short- and long-haul
       applications), cable television, other video and
       interactive video, information and data communications,
       etc., and to show how growth for these varied
       applications relates to the fiber-optic test equipment
       business<P>

<LI>Identify and discuss the pertinent institutional and
       legal issues<P>

<LI>Identify and characterize the principal government
       entities.</UL><P>

This study provides a very substantive overview of the
industries served by the fiber-optic test equipment industry
to explain why there will be significant growth in test
equipment over the next 5 years and beyond. In addition to the
in-depth market analysis of the test equipment industry, the
report presents a detailed overview of telecommunications,
cable TV, video, data communications, and other end-use
markets.<P>

This study does not cover process-control instrumentation,
sometimes used during fiber or cable manufacture.<P>

<B>REASONS FOR CONDUCTING THE STUDY</B><P>

Business Communications Co. (BCC) initiated this study of the
fiber-optic test equipment industry in response to numerous
inquiries regarding this market. The report, a natural follow-
on for a number of other optics, electro-optics, and fiber-optics reports which have been published by BCC over the last
few years, provides a thorough analysis of the U.S./North
American market, and, in addition, it is the only current
study that provides a worldwide market analysis and market
projections.  In addition, this report is a natural follow-up
for a number of other optics, electro-optics, and fiber-optics
reports published recently by BCC.<P>

The study is timely because of the many changes occurring in
the fiber-optics end-use industries, particularly in the
telecommunications and cable TV industries. There is
tremendous potential for expanding the use of fiber-optics and
fiber-optic test equipment.<P>

<B>CONTRIBUTION OF THIS STUDY</B><P>

This study comes at a critical time in the development of new
fiber-optic test equipment and new fiber applications that
will demand different types of equipment, less expensive
equipment, remote/automatic test equipment, and new testing
requirements. This timely BCC study seeks to answer these
questions through discussion, and provide reasons for its
conclusions.<P>

To provide market projections for fiber-optic test equipment,
it is necessary to thoroughly analyze and characterize the
future markets for the many important new applications for
fiber, as well as expanded use for existing applications.
Thus, this report not only  provides a thorough market
analysis of the fiber-optic test equipment industry, it also
analyzes the major end-use markets for fiber systems as
follows:<P>

<UL><LI>It assesses relevant technologies<BR>
<LI>Provides market projections for 1991, 1992, and 1993
       through 1998, and in some cases through 2003<BR>
<LI>Characterizes existing and potential applications<BR>
<LI>Discusses the major driving forces behind the
       development of the industry<BR>
<LI>Identifies niches of specific promise<BR>
<LI>Discusses thorny institutional and legal issues<BR>
<LI>Provides a thorough list of companies and organizations
      involved in the test-equipment industry and major end-
      users<BR>
<LI>Provides brief company profiles</UL><P>

<B>METHODOLOGY AND INFORMATION SOURCES</B><P>

The information presented in this study was derived, in part,
from more than 75 interviews with knowledgeable industry and
government sources. In view of the increasingly worldwide
nature and importance of the industry, both domestic and
foreign sources were contacted, and global information and
market data are included in this report. In all, more than 150
companies and organizations were surveyed. In addition, a
thorough search of technical, trade, and government literature
was conducted.<P>

The "Rest-of-the-World" (outside the U.S.) market information
was derived from contacts with foreign companies, both outside
and inside the U.S., foreign trade information, various
government data, other industry sources, and a BCC evaluation
and extrapolation of the hard data to those areas for which
data were scarce. BCC in-house resources were consulted and
utilized where appropriate.<P>

This study was conducted over a 2-month period ending in
February 1993. Dollar market projections are given in constant
1992 dollars unless otherwise noted.<P>

</CENTER>

<B>STUDY GOALS AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>

There seem to be many avenues of investment open to local exchange
carriers (LECs), each with perhaps different issues, regulatory
concerns, and potential for revenue return.  Our goal in preparing
this report was to analyze the key markets in the U.S. that could
attract LEC investment, to predict their potential for success in
those strategic markets, and to size all opportunities.<P>


<B>REASONS FOR DOING THE STUDY</B><P>

We have witnessed some LECs asking for relief from regulatory
prohibition to enter the long distance market.  We have seen LECs
buying cable television franchises.  Some LECs are announcing plans
to provide fiber to residential neighborhoods and offer interactive
television.  Some LECs have trumpeted in the press the idea of
personal communications networks and related wireless applications.<P>

With all these diverse interests and expressed key opportunities by
the local telephone operators we wished to review these many
opportunities to understand which would have more potential both
from an operating as well as from a gross revenue standpoint.  It
is our purpose to provide a document that both the LECs and other
related businesses can use to plan for the oncoming revolution in
the local telephone company.<P>


<B>CONTRIBUTION OF THE DOCUMENT AND FOR WHOM</B><P>

This report is intended to show how the local telephone business
may evolve into related communications technologies.  It offers a
complete profile on all regional Bell operating companies, and
acknowledges their role as leading the independents into the next
century.  It takes a realistic view at sizing the key opportunities
for all potential providers, and then discusses the potential for
LECs to capture some share of that market.  The LEC share is then
sized, based on stated assumptions.  A ten-year forecast period is
used.<P>


<B>SCOPE AND FORMAT</B><P>

We cover the key local telephone companies' potential in the next
ten years with sizings, assumptions behind the sizings, and issues
related to the market for all contenders.  We cover the areas of
local network services, long distance, and wireless as they have
been defined by tariffs and regulatory agencies, and then cover in
some detail our assessment of the evolution of television in the
residence, noting key opportunities for LECs and sizing three forms
of television revenue: 1) subscription, 2) pay-per-view, and 3)
interactive television.  Our general format is to give both
background, present, and predicted future applications of the
technology, along with ten-year forecasts that are based on 1993
U.S. dollars.  The overall scope of this report is limited to U.S.
opportunities.<P>


<B>METHODOLOGY</B><P>

All of our forecasts include sufficient assumptions to enable the
reader to disagree with an assumption and to recalculate the
forecast.  We use various methodologies in forecasting, carefully
recognizing past history, and forecasting each year into the
future, and only then do we calculate an average annual growth
rate, which is shown for all predictions.  Not all opportunities
sized in this report show a positive growth rate, as we are
cautious to understand how one new technology might replace an
older one.<P>


<B>INFORMATION SOURCES</B><P>

Interviews, trade shows, press releases, FCC reporting, other
writers' views, and our own expertise went into the preparation of
this report.  BCC has extensive in-house expertise in the fields of
wireless, cable television, and local telephone company operations
that were all brought to bear in compiling the analyses and
predictions embodied in this report.<P>


<b>RELATED BCC WORK CREDENTIALS</B><P>

Within the last two years BCC has prepared reports entitled,
"Telecommunications' Retail Opportunities," "Long Distance Markets,
2001," "Wireless Communications," "Video Communications into the
21st Century," and "Delivery Alternatives for Residential
Television."  This report is consistent with those previous
reports, and forecasts agree with each other, or we state what new
information has occurred to alter our outlook.  Our report on video
communications has been referenced in publications all over the
world as being a key contribution to the outlook for all forms of
video.<P>

<H3><I>INTRODUCTION</I></H3>
</CENTER>

There has been considerable discussion concerning the technology, even the
form of the organization, that will be in prime position to carry subscription
television into the home of tomorrow.  This report delves into the technology,
the businesses, the organizations, and the issues surrounding the future for
Delivery Alternatives for Residential Television.  It deals only with the
subscription form of television.<P>

Subscription television can be delivered to the home via wires from the
telephone company, over-the-air via microwave radio, through-the-air from
satellites direct to the home antenna, and, traditionally, via cable from
cable system operators.  The preceding diagram seeks to illustrate these
alternatives.  This report answers the question, "Who wins the race for the
delivery of subscription TV to the residence?"<P>

There has been an enormous amount of activity recently associated with various
forms of delivering television to the home.  The media has been announcing a
new merger, technology, alliance,  trial, or service nearly daily for the last
six months. It is our goal to sort through all of these announcements and put
them in perspective of the total business.<P>

<B>STUDY GOAL AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>

There is significant change underway in all aspects of delivering television
to the home.  The world of fiber optics offers manifold increases in capacity
for wired systems.  New technologies and frequencies are changing the world of
microwave delivery.  New, more powerful satellites offer considerable
economies for receiving television in the home without the cost of laying any
wire.  The telephone companies have been allowed to offer "video dial tone,"
and are aggressively pushing to obtain approval to enter subscription
television businesses.  Meanwhile, the telcos are buying into existing cable
franchises outside the telco area of operation.<P>

Any one of these changes might suggest that the world of home delivery of
television will be altered significantly -- but together, they form a
different picture.  It is our intent in publishing this study to offer the
reader a platform for understanding the industry that can be used to assess
any of the announced or yet-to-be-announced changes.<P>

<B>CONTRIBUTION OF THE STUDY AND FOR WHOM</B><P>

We cover all aspects of delivering video to the home, including the video
store rental or purchase.  We further develop scenarios based on past history,
experience, and sound business principles for the world of subscription
television ten years from now.  We avoid speculating on outside influences
such as court, legislative, or regulatory rulings or proceedings.  In this
context we offer reasoned forecasts that have all assumptions thoroughly
discussed.  These scenarios and forecasts are intended to be of assistance to
vendors of video equipment, providers of video programming, and suppliers of
video services as they assess their future business opportunities and plans,
recognizing a changing world of competition and technology.<P>

<B>SCOPE AND FORMAT</B><P>

This report focuses on the subscription television business in the United
States.  All figures are based on 1993 U.S. dollars.  We address the
underlying technologies with discussions on general benefits, and then
incorporate these technological changes into the past, present, and future of
each of the categories of service for delivering television: subscription (for
a fee), pay-per-view, and interactive video.  There is a strong recognition of
the market forces that may accept or reject technological change.<P>

<B>METHODOLOGY</B><P>

We take into account technological change, economic factors, history, market
acceptance factors, and competition in deriving our forecasts.  All
assumptions are discussed thoroughly so that the reader may alter any
assumption and derive a revised forecast.<P>

<B>INFORMATION SOURCES</B><P>

BCC has compiled this report from research of available literature, interviews
of leading industry experts and vendor representatives, attendance at seminars
and tradeshows, and combined that input with the experience of the author, who
has been personally involved with the television delivery industry and all
aspects of video communications.<P>

<B>OTHER BCC WORK CREDENTIALS</B><P>

This is the first BCC report on the specific subject of delivery of television
to the home, but several related reports have been published recently by BCC,
including: Report G-134, VSATs, in which the subject of satellites is
thoroughly addressed; Report G-109, ISDN, that assesses the many attributes of
digital transmission; Report G-136, Long Distance, covering the gamut of long
distance opportunities; and Report G-138, Video  Communications into the 21st
Century, that addresses all of the markets for various forms of video
communications.<P>

<B>STUDY GOALS AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>


Electronic superhighways is the buzzword of the day. Everybody talks about it 
but few know anything about it. The objective of this study is to enlighten 
the readers about broadband data networks, their technology and markets. 
Future telecommunications networks are likely to be integrated, i.e., they 
will carry voice, data, pictures and video intermingled. Thus, the study 
covers these aspects as well.<P> 


<b>REASONS FOR DOING THE STUDY</B><P> 

The study is presented at this time because of the rapid developments in 
broadband telecommunications. A year ago few people had heard about the 
subject. By 1996 they will be in wide usage. The study will prepare vendors, 
providers and users for this event.<P> 


<b>CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE STUDY AND FOR WHOM</B><P> 

The report is the first extensive study of the future markets for broadband 
terminals, transport channels, and equipment, with estimates going all the way 
to the year 2010. The study is aimed at vendors, providers and potential users 
of broadband networks and equipment.<P>  


<b>SCOPE AND FORMAT</B><P> 

The scope of the report is to describe sources of information that generate broadband bitstreams, the characteristics of these bitstreams, the required transmission links between sources and sinks, and the future overall broadband 
network.  A summary follows this introduction. The third section covers the background and includes an overview of the changing demands for bandwidth, the related policy of the Clinton-Gore administration, and brief descriptions of the existing telecommunications and cable television industries.<P>
In the fourth section the different future markets demanding broadband transmission facilities are discussed. The economic aspects, such as the expected revenues from broadband traffic, the estimated investment requirements, and the future markets for equipment are covered in a separate section.<P>
The sixth section describes the existing networks. The future technology is described in the seventh section. Different networks are described, as are broadband access, transmission and switching systems. A separate section covers the activities 
of the government and of regulatory agencies. The structure of the relevant industry, such as providers of the infrastructure, service providers, and vendors of equipment are covered in the ninth section. Activities overseas also are covered in this section. The companies and authorities mentioned in the report are listed with addresses, telephone numbers, and contacts in the 
end of the report. A list of acronyms also is included.<P> 

Actual data for 1992 are presented in the report, as are estimates for 1994, 
1998, 2002, 2006 and 2010.<P> 


<b>METHODOLOGY</B><P> 

In forecasting the developing technologies, standard procedures were used. 
These include those described by Joseph P. Martino in the third edition of his 
book Technological Forecasting for Decision Making. The author of this report, 
Bertil Lindberg, is an adjunct associate professor at the Polytechnic 
University in Brooklyn, New York, where he currently teaches a graduate course 
in Technological Forecasting. Lindberg has followed technology and market 
trends in the telecommunications industry, and researched and published 
numerous reports during some 40 years.<P> 

The demand for bandwidth and traffic is calculated as follows. The number of terminals equipped for a certain service is determined for each type of workplace including schools and homes. Then the average number of minutes per day to be demanded by an average user is determined. The number of users is multiplied with the average usage to obtain the annual national demand in minutes by required bandwidth. Finally, the demand in bits per unit of time for each type of channel by bandwidth is obtained by multiplying the usage time by the maximum bandwidth of that type of channel. The demand is calculated for each of today's standard channels: 64 kbit/s, 1.544 Mbit/s, 51.84 Mbit/s, and 155.52 Mbit/s.<P>
Even though a certain demand may not require the full bandwidth of a channel, the entire channel will be occupied. Within 
the time span of the report, i.e., to 2010, the demand for channels with 
bandwidths over 155.52 Mbit/s is expected to be insignificant and is not 
covered in this report. Detailed calculations are made for each of the even 
years between 1990 and 2010. Due to lack of space, data for all years are not 
presented in the tables. However, the charts show data for all the even years.<P> 

The forecasted market data are based on future market predictions that can be 
made today.  This implies that the actual values will come close to the 
predicted ones if the government, regulatory authorities, and the market allow 
it to happen. The forecast predicts that users' demand for telecommunications 
services will remain at a value of 2% of gross domestic product through 2010.<P> 

The fact that data are shown with an accuracy to the last digit of a number in 
the report does not by any means indicate that the data are accurate at that 
level. The reason for presenting the data as shown is to give the reader the 
opportunity to compare data across the report and to reduce rounding errors in 
the totals.  Rounding errors in the last digit still occur.<P> 


<b>INFORMATION SOURCES</B><P> 

In preparing this report the literature was researched and scanned. Among them 
are the FCC Statistics of Common Carriers and the Federal Communications 
Commission (FCC) unpublished database report 43-07. At the completion of this 
report, FCC data through December 31, 1992 were available. Knowledgeable 
persons among vendors, providers and users were interviewed. International and 
national standards were reviewed, as well as standards work in progress.<P> 


<b>RELATED BCC WORK CREDENTIALS INCLUDING
WORK DONE BY OTHER AUTHORS</B><P>

BCC Report G-147 covers the delivery of television program to residences by other means than broadcast and cable television. The report, Delivery 
Alternatives for Residential Television, by Thomas Rush, was researched and written independently of this Electronic Superhighway report.<P>

<H3><I>SUMMARY</I></H3>
</CENTER>


The information age is at our doorsteps. New information is generated in great 
volume. The public is demanding access to large amounts of information. This 
creates a demand for transportation of large volumes of information between 
suppliers and users. Not only is the volume of information requiring 
transportation increasing, the requirements for bandwidth are growing, too. 
Among new activities with large bandwidth requirements are video-on-demand, 
multimedia applications, videoconferencing, digital facsimile and high-speed 
data transmission. These new demands create a demand for improved broadband 
communications facilities.<P>

Presuming a completely free market, the revenues of telecommunications for local exchange carriers and other entities handling access lines are expected to grow from a total of $45 billion in 1994 to $68 billion in 2002 and to reach $146 billion in 2010, or 2.1% of the gross domestic product (GDP). The revenues of providers of local services, shown, refer to net revenue and do not include access charges of about $26 billion annually. Table 1 shows the fastest growing segments by bandwidth of access lines and by type of traffic.<P>

In addition, long distance carriers and similar entities connecting local exchange areas are facing a potential market growing from $81 billion in 1994 to $120 billion in the year 2002 and to reach $218 billion in 2010. The 
revenues of long distance service providers include the $25-27 billion that 
they have to pay to the local carriers in access charges. Currently, one 
quarter of all traffic passes through long distance carriers and with the 
growth of the local traffic, the long distance traffic will also grow.<P>  

Most of the new traffic will be generated by video transmissions that have the potential of generating revenues of $62 billion in 2010.<P>

To handle the growing amount of traffic, the current infrastructure has to be 
improved. Equipment vendors will be facing an annual market growing from $32 
billion in 1994, to $41 billion in 2002 and $258 billion in 2010 as shown in 
Table 2. In 2010 over 60% of the equipment market will be generated by access 
lines with a bandwidth of 155 Mbit/s and more.<P> 

In addition to the local carriers, long distance carriers will experience growth in revenues as stated earlier. Thus, vendors of equipment to long distance carriers will also face a growing market. The investment in equipment by these carriers will grow from an annual amount of $5.5 billion in 1994 to $5.9 billion in the year 2002 to reach $26.3 billion in 2010. <P>

Traffic within enterprises does not generate revenues for any 
telecommunications providers. Thus, such revenues are excluded from the 
revenues listed in this report. However, revenues generated by dedicated (or private) lines passing through public networks are included.<P> 

Because the network products required to handle the new demand for broadband services essentially are new, the suppliers of broadband equipment will not necessarily be the conventional ones. Rather, the market is open to a wide range of new and old suppliers.<P> 

The best solution to handle voice and video over the same broadband facilities seems to be asynchronous transfer mode (ATM). While this technology was conceived for use in worldwide public networks, it has initially been applied to local and private networks. As the ATM switches required for these small networks are inherently small, and consequently the demand for large ATM switches is slow to materialize, manufacturers of small ATM switches got a 
head start.<P>  

While U.S. providers of networks and network services have been slow in 
advancing broadband services such as those depending on ATM, the Europeans are 
advancing in the deployment of ATM based services. This fact may lead to a 
situation where the Europeans will get an advantage over U.S. suppliers.<P>  

For many years the telecommunications and cable television industries have 
been working on improvements of their networks, and on merging them. Providers 
of telephone service want to add broadband data and video services, while 
providers of cable television want to add telephone and data service to their 
networks. International and national standards bodies have been working on 
integrated and broadband networks for a long time. Obviously, equipment 
manufacturers are involved. All see the need for broadband digital networks in 
the future and all want to be in on it.<P> 

The need for electronic superhighways in the United States was mentioned as a 
campaign issue in a press release from the Clinton-Gore campaign headquarters 
on September 21, 1992. Since the election the point has mainly been carried by 
Vice President Gore. What he has in mind is a broadband digital network 
similar to the narrowband data networks operated by the government and by 
universities.<P> 

The providers of public telecommunications services, i.e., the conventional telephone companies, are considering transmission links that can carry 2.5 gigabit/s (Gbit/s, 109 bit/s, thousand million bit/s), and switches for those bitstreams.  The current limits are in the accessing of these broadband networks. Practically all existing access lines consist of twisted copper wire pairs that are designed and built to carry voice traffic. With a developing technology called asymmetric digital subscriber lines (ADSL), copper-based 
loops will be able to carry bitstreams at up to 6.3 Mbit/s to subscribers.<P> 

The cable television industry has cable networks that reach 60 million homes in the U.S. and are passing by another 30 million homes for a potential 90 million homes wired for cable television. These networks are designed to 
deliver television programs to homes, but only a few are built for transmissions the other way. Thus, they cannot be used for two-way communications today. Further, they have been prohibited from entering the telephone business by the government. However, the cable television industry has its eye on going into the telephone market, especially two-way broadband services.<P> 

The telephone companies are currently prohibited from transporting television programs to users. However, both parties are petitioning the FCC and lobbying Congress to obtain the right to enter each other's traditional markets. In some individual cases they have already succeeded, and the trend seems to go towards granting full competition in the same markets for telephone and cable 
companies.<P> 

The FCC is considering applications from telephone operating companies to 
offer "video dialtone." This refers to switched broadband services. Twenty-two 
telcos have applied for permission to offer video dialtone to 4.5% of U.S. 
homes.<P>

<B>STUDY GOALS AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>

Our goal in conducting this study is to evaluate the results of
recent developments in digital networking and computing
technologies and how they affect the multimedia networking
industry.<P>

Technological innovations in digital video computing and
communication are generating new opportunities for those who are
already in the industry and for newcomers.  While some giants
dominate the industry, some of the more interesting developments
are generated by small and medium sized entrepreneurs.  The
industry is intensely software-oriented with no known hardware
vendor who can provide a direction.  Participants in the industry
include such diverse groups as vendors of microprocessors, servers,
desktop computers, network components, interfaces, and telephone
service providers, etc.  Our report ties together some of the more
active sectors of the industry and presents a comprehensive
analysis of the opportunities offered in each group.<P>


<B>REASONS FOR DOING THIS STUDY</B><P>

This study was undertaken to measure growth prospects and direct
business possibilities that are generated for the vendors and
suppliers of select components and services for the digital video
computing and networking industry.  Our analyst was made aware of
the differences between the direct and indirect business
opportunities that may result because of developments in this
industry.  While the overall opportunities may exceed several
billion dollars, only select sectors of the industry that provide
opportunities for the vendors and suppliers of equipment and
services will be focused on.  Our goal is to analyze the
opportunities that are most attractive for these sectors.<P>


<B>CONTRIBUTION FOR THIS STUDY AND FROM WHOM</B><P>

This study is based on information carefully compiled from
interviews with industry experts and officials of Federal agencies,
data excerpted from questionnaires mailed to industry specialists
and other informed individuals, and analysis of a wide variety of
information generated by the industry press and technology
journals.  Additionally, selected industry experts were approached
more than once to clarify several related issues.<P>

Information generated from vendors and statistics generated from
select agencies was matched to produce estimates of the most viable
areas of business opportunities.  A consensus was developed to
focus on the most productive areas of the technology.<P>


<B>SCOPE AND FORMAT</B><P>

This study covers the projected growth of select areas of
technologies that contribute to the digital video computing and
networking industry.<P>

Each projection was based on current industry statistics, opinions
from industry experts, and analysis of information available from
several industry sources.<P>

Where applicable we have taken a general average of the projections
provided by various industry sources and have matched them with the
volume of current business reported from Federal agencies and
associations.<P>


<B>INFORMATION SOURCES</B><P>

BCC has surveyed over 100 sources to obtain data for this study.
These included the Federal Communications Commission, the
Department of Commerce, consultants, vendors, users, and others.
Major industry publications, reports from industry associations,
and major financial publications were also consulted.<P>

<B>STUDY GOALS AND OBJECTIVES</B>


<P>A wealth of media attention has been given to the Information Highway.  Our goal
in writing this report is to offer the reader both a road map and a definition of
segments and alternatives for achieving the Information Highway result.  We offer
10-year assessments of the forecasts, issues, and drivers for each segment.  This
report is a sequel to G150, The Future for Telecommunications/Electronic
Superhighway, which analyzed the demand side of the telecommunications
business through the year 2000.  This report emphasizes the specific technologies
that are going to make it all happen.</P>


<B>REASONS FOR DOING THE STUDY</B>

<P>The convergence factors that have brought computers and communications
together are more crisply definable than ever before.  Computers are moving into
the home and adding multi-media and/or video capability.  The microelectronics
evolution has made it possible for the set-top converter for cable television to be
a computer in itself.  Communications via fiber optics offer tremendous capacity,
and the microelectronics to drive fiber have brought both additional capacity and
flexibility to the transmission scenarios.  Our reasons for doing this study are to show
that now is the time to forecast how all these alternatives work together, and how
internetworking is the key to the Information Highway.</P>


<B>CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE STUDY AND FOR WHOM</B>

<P>This study is a result of BCC offering individual studies on all the aspects of the
Information Highway in recent years.  This study pulls these individual efforts
together with one overriding theme -- internetworking.  It is intended as a planning
guide for all organizations in the internetworking businesses of providing service,
databases, transmission, access, and equipment for all forms of voice, data, and
video communications.</P>


<B>SCOPE AND FORMAT</B>

<P>This study views all components of the Information Highway under the umbrella of
internetworking.  It is limited to a top-level view of the subject, recognizing that
each element is worthy of an individual study.  It includes forecasts for each
segment that is based on 1995 dollars.</P>


<B>METHODOLOGY</B>

<P>Assumptions are noted with all forecasts, along with potential issues and drivers.  We
look for synergistic forces, pricing trends, and convergence factors to derive future
acceptance of technology and information.</P>


<B>INFORMATION SOURCES AND OTHER BCC WORK CREDENTIALS</B>

<P>Much of the research for this report comes from previous efforts by BCC.  We have
noted that many of our previous forecasts on subjects such as Video
Communications, LAN Systems, Private Networks, Local Telephone Companies, and
the like, have been extremely accurate both in the assumptions behind our
forecasts as well as the numerical values of our forecasts.  Additionally, we use
sources from the press, conference speakers, interviews, and trade shows for our
verification of data.</P>

<B>STUDY GOALS AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>

Our goal in conducting this study is to evaluate the market
potential for products and services in the emerging markets of
interactive television in the United States.  This report focuses
on the business and home entertainment sectors of the interactive
television industry.  Our objective is to highlight main areas of
programs both by types and production, transmission techniques,
home and business reception areas, products used in the areas of
program production, transmission and reception.<P>

<b>REASONS FOR DOING THIS STUDY</B><P>

This study was undertaken to measure the growth prospects and cross
influences that the network and cable television, phone, satellite,
coaxial cable and fiber optic industries have on each other in the
emerging world of interactive television.  Additionally, the
results of current interactive television tests, FCC standards and
licensing procedures, and strategic alliances between leading
industry partners have high impact on the growth prospects of the
interactive industry.  While the available reports cover "some
specific areas" of the industry, we believe that this study
includes comprehensive all important technology and business
sectors of the industry in the U.S.<P>

This report also analyzes the various approaches adopted by the
sponsors of various interactive trials that are currently going on
in several locations in the country.<P>

The researchers were made aware of the conflicting and
contradictory information currently being generated in the industry
about the projected technical and business problems and other
issues in the interactive industry.  Some industry experts have
projected very high growth rates for all sectors of the interactive
TV industry, while others predict unusually poor growth prospects
for the industry.  Our goal for the study was to evaluate the
"real" growth potential for both program production, transmission
and reception, as well as products required for all three areas,
and arrive at realistic projections.<P>


<b>CONTRIBUTION FOR THIS STUDY AND FROM WHOM</B><P>

This study is based on detailed information generated from
interviews with vendors, users, consultants, officials of industry
associations and federal government agencies, sponsors of various
trials, and other industry experts.  Additionally, a variety of
published information from governmental, trade press, associations,
research organizations, the Federal Communications Commission and
other sources were analyzed. Over 100 vendors from around the
country were approached for detailed information on their
activities and the data generated was carefully analyzed.<P>

Information generated from various sources was matched to produce
an "actual deployment prospects vs projected installation"
scenario.  Furthermore, a consensus was developed to eliminate the
most vexing problem facing the industry - whether interactive
television is technically viable, cost-effective, and whether the
viewers will be ready to pay for the services.  A median cost
crossover ratio was developed to arrive at a reasonable deployment
scenario.<P>


<b>SCOPE AND FORMAT</B><P>

This study covers the major products, program types and
transmission technologies, as well as products and components that
are likely to be used in the interactive television industry.  The
analysis focuses on all three major sectors of the industry -
program production, transmission, and reception.  Each segment is
analyzed, focusing on the current state of the technology and
developments, major technology and business trends influencing the
development of the industry.  A brief overview of the technology
and interactive procedures is presented where appropriate.<P>


<b>METHODOLOGY</B><P>

BCC presents an analysis, by each major technology, product,
services, and programming group segment, focusing on its relevance
to the overall industry structure.  The projections for each
segment evaluate the per-year growth during the next five years.<P>

Where applicable, the volume of growth is presented in dollars,
number of hours of programming, likely subscribers and program
sponsors.  Each projection was based on current industry
statistics, opinions from industry experts and analyses available
from several sources.<P>


<b>INFORMATION SOURCES</B><P> 

BCC has surveyed over 300 sources to obtain data for this study. 
These included manufacturers of equipment such as cameras,
recorders, etc., major studios, cable and phone companies,
advertising agencies, industry associations, officials of the
Federal Communications Commission, and other industry experts. 
Major industry publications, reports from the Federal
Communications Commission, National Telephone Industries
Association, Cable Television Association and financial press were
also included.<P>

<HTML><H1 ALIGN=center> G-155 INFORMATION & DATA HANDLING DEVELOPMENTS INMEDICINE, HIGHLIGHTING OPPORTUNITIES FOR HARDWARE, SOFTWARE ANDSERVICES</H1><I> <H3 ALIGN=center>BARBARA BREINDELProject Analyst</H3> </I><H2 ALIGN=center>INTRODUCTION</H2><H3>STUDY GOAL AND OBJECTIVES</H3><P>This study, INFORMATION AND DATA HANDLING DEVELOPMENTS INMEDICINE, HIGHLIGHTING OPPORTUNITIES FOR HARDWARE, SOFTWARE ANDSERVICES, focuses on the market opportunities for goods and services for handling theoverwhelming information and data handling requirements of the healthcare industry.</P>            <P>By the year 2000 the demand for healthcare will increase far beyond what we can currently imagine.  Numerous opportunities will emerge, particularly for hardware, software and services that will handle the information and data generated within the healthcare system and for adequately trained personnel to develop, market, purchase, install and operate these systems.   Accurate and up-to-date information is essential to continuous quality improvement and in the lowering of costs in most organizations, and is even more important in healthcare.  Furthermore, healthcare is considered the fastest growing market segment.  Healthcare reform efforts focusing on cost containment are anticipated to expand the data handling marketplace as healthcare deliverers search for methods to reduce costs associated with servicing an increasing number of patients. The handling of information by computers and the exchange of this information through computer-based systems in medical applications has led to the emergence of an area now known as healthcare information systems or healthcare informatics.  The wider availability of communications capacity, advances in networking capabilities, and the availability of lower cost information technologies are causing an evolution in the information segment of the U.S. healthcare delivery segment.</P> <P>Healthcare information systems include the use of computers in the areas of: </P>     <P>patient care and management - care providers are using          data entry devices to document care given both at the bedside and          at central terminals</P>     <P>patient records  - compilation of patient or test data,          maintenance and retrieval of these records and use of these records          for billing and usage and outcome analysis</P>     <P>patient monitoring - by recording patient data on-line          and from various tests</P>     <P>exchange of medical data - from the compilation and          maintenance of databases.</P><P>Computer systems are also being used for:</P>     <P>interactive medical education - from database and          tutorial software</P>     <P>physician decision making - from the use of patient          records and other databases.</P><P>Consequently, it is not hard to imagine that in addition to the traditional use of computers in medicine we most likely will see a "medical information superhighway."  It is the purpose of this report to identify all opportunities and to define the current market in its entirety.</P> <H3>REASONS FOR DOING THIS STUDY</H3><P>The large volume of data produced within the health care industry, and the high cost of processing this information, makes manual processing an overwhelming and nearly impossible task.  Doctors and nurses spend an inordinate amount of time on paperwork. It has been estimated that physicians spend 38% of their time and nurses 50% of their time on routine paperwork.  In a recent study by Ira Magaziner, Senior Advisor to President Clinton for Policy Development, it was found that nurses often spend more time with paper than with patients.</P> <P>Consequently, the health care segment has seen and will continue to see the introduction of electronic data processing products and systems.  Any systems developed must be capable of handling the large, complex and growing knowledge or database of the medical field.  This database includes scientific knowledge, as well as the operational aspects of providing daily health care, with particular emphasis on the handling of the financial and medical records generated for each patient.</P> <H3>CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE STUDY AND FOR WHOM</H3><P>This study should prove of particular value to all participants and observers of the health care industry and the related information handling industries, including manufacturers and marketers of computer hardware and software and suppliers of data handling services.  The report defines this markets with emphasis on:</P>      <P>need for information and data handling systems in the          healthcare industry</P>     <P>current market structure and size with forecasts through          2000 in constant 1994 dollars</P>     <P>new marketing concepts and trends</P>     <P>technological aspects</P>     <P>market segments</P>     <P>major participants by area of participation</P>     <P>impact of outside influences such as national healthcare          programs and the regulatory environment with identification of          potential market barriers</P>     <P>government regulations and participation</P>     <P>identification of niche areas offer opportunities</P>     <P>corporate strategies</P>     <P>international aspects of the market</P>     <P>analogous markets</P><H3>SCOPE AND FORMAT</H3><P>Both the health care and data handling industries are examined in this report with particular emphasis on those companies that are taking innovative technological development and marketing actions to position themselves as market leaders through the year 2000.</P>  <P>The market is segmented into hardware, software and services for the purposes of this report with each of these segments finding applications in numerous segments of the health care industry.</P> <H3>METHODOLOGY</H3><P>The methodologies employed in this study include use of both primary interviews with industry personnel and analysis of secondary data.  Among the primary data sources are company personnel, government and regulatory representatives, industry observers, and industry professional organizations.</P>  <P>Growth forecasts are made in constant 1994 dollars based on the manufacturers (wholesale) price level unless otherwise noted.</P> <P>All data collected was reviewed by BCC's specialists in the health care industry and all findings and projections were confirmed with numerous industry sources.</P> <H3>INFORMATION SOURCES</H3><P>Data sources for this report include information obtained from interviews with various market participants and observers.  BCC's extensive library also served as a data source as did corporate and industry trade association publications and industry data banks.</P> <H3>RELATED BCC WORK CREDENTIALS</H3><P>The BCC project director of this report holds both medical technology and advanced marketing degrees.  Further supporting the analyst's knowledge in this area is extensive experience in the pharmaceutical industry, the medical device industry, and in other high technology markets.  The most recent studies published by this analyst are a study of changes in the drug industry, including changing markets and marketing techniques, changing strategies and the changing structure.  Other recent studies include an examination of the emerging opportunities in the U.S. healthcare delivery system in the year 2000, an examination of the medical diagnostic kits and products market and a report on the U.S. blood industry.  Other reports issued by this analyst are reports on trends in noninvasive and minimally invasive medical devices, microorganism testing systems, gene probe markets, bioengineered protein drugs, new drug delivery systems, medical diagnostic equipment, biocompatible materials and the laser industry.</P> <P>Published BCC reports related to the present topic include:</P><UL>     <LI>C-181  -  THE CHANGING DRUG INDUSTRY:                    .

<B>STUDY GOALS AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>

There have been many specialized uses of the Global
Positioning System (GPS) of satellites, primarily in the
military and maritime navigation markets. Our goal in
writing this report is to size the market for consumer
products and services, particularly those markets that
utilize GPS for positioning to aid in either personal
navigation or tracking of vehicles or personnel. We reach
that goal by assessing the various suppliers' abilities to
address the consumer market with the proper products.<P>


<B>REASONS FOR DOING THE STUDY</B><P>

Our early assessment of this market showed that forthcoming
is a convergence of the several product areas of technology,
namely: digital mapping, CD-ROM implementation in computers,
GPS receivers, and microelectronics. All are on a downward
spiral of pricing, and put together they offer a strategic
package that allows for in-vehicle permanently installed
systems as well as handheld products. In doing this study we
assess how all of these technologies can come together to
offer a package of convenience and key value to the
consumer.<P>



<B>CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE STUDY AND FOR WHOM</B><P>

It is our intention that this study is a guide to the
suppliers of products and services in developing business
plans to address the consumer market. Our forecasts,
statements of assumptions, and discussion of issues serve as
a compendium of backup data for individual business plans.<P>


<B>SCOPE AND FORMAT</B><P>

All aspects of the personal use of GPS positioning systems
are covered in this report. It does not include GPS uses for
nonpersonal applications such as military, marine, or
commercial vehicles. It covers forecasts and assumptions for
the United States, using a 10-year forecast that is
developed from a "bottoms up" method of forecasting price
and units.<P>

<B>METHODOLOGY</B><P>

Assumptions are noted with all forecasts, along with the key
drivers and potential issues. We look for both value-added
factors and consumer convenience factors in developing
drivers for the forecasts. We look for pricing trends,
industry leaders, representative products and services, and
convergence factors to derive future acceptance of this
technology and digital database contribution.<P>


<B>INFORMATION SOURCES AND OTHER BCC WORK CREDENTIALS</B><P>

BCC is a leader in supplying market planning information to
the computer and communications industries. Our reports on
wireless communications and mobile satellites as early as
1990 have addressed the potential of the automatic vehicle
location application. We have been consistent in predicting
rapid acceptance of microelectronics in all forms, primarily
based on ever-increasing functions at an ever-decreasing
price. This report is written from information garnered
through trade shows, trade press literature, marketing
literature, and interviews of industry sources, along with
the experience of our staff.<P>

<B>STUDY GOALS AND OBJECTIVES</B>


<P>Many segments of the portable computer industry are in full stride. 
Propelled by highly capable machines offering easy portability as well
as the ability to access data remotely, the portable computer market is
becoming the fastest growing segment of the industry.  Remote access
has further produced the newest industry buzzword, convergence. 
The discussion of this topic revolves around the fusion of computers
with communications, computers with communications and
entertainment technology, voice with video and data communications,
etc.  Additionally, there also exists a convergence of differing
computing devices as their functions and markets begin to overlap.</P>  

<P>Whether for the home, business or research communities, the overall
vision revolves around computers, stationary or portable, gaining the
ability to interface with essentially any technology which can transmit
information or entertainment, be it by voice, video, or data over a

<P>This BCC report presents a detailed analysis of the current and future
markets for the large variety of portable computing applications, from
the notebook and subnotebook computer form factors to handheld
computers primarily for data handling, as well as those still-evolving
devices loosely called PDAs.  The study also addresses the potential
impact of the latest wireless communications systems on the market. 
Forecasts are presented that project sales and product evolution
through the year 2000.</P>


<B>REASONS FOR DOING THE STUDY</B>

<P>The study is presented at this time because of the rapid development
of the mobile computing market.  A second generation of PDAs has
been introduced and the FCC auction of bandwidth for new wireless
communications systems promises to bring change to both the
communication and computer industries.</P>

<P>Until recently, factors such as high costs, large size and weight, high
power consumption, and poor capability have frustrated mobile
computer users.  However, portability has improved dramatically and
prices are falling due to increases in both component supply and
competition.  In addition, the largest form factors, the notebook and
subnotebook computers, can now boast virtually identical capabilities
as desktop machines.</P>

<P>Current trends indicate that the markets for most portable devices will
continue to grow as more and more people seek the ability to be
productive away from the office.  Continuing evolution of the
smallest devices will eventually bring them into line with market
requirements.</P> 

<B>CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE STUDY AND FOR WHOM</B>

<P>Portable computers are already a strong and rapidly growing segment
of the overall computer industry.  However, a great deal of activity is
concentrated in the development of new materials, components, and
methods that will be required to successfully implement the new ideas
being suggested for a wide variety computing and communications
applications.</P>

<P>This report provides an analysis of those segments of the portable
computing industry and markets which involve devices weighing 8
pounds or less, both by function and end use, through the year 2000. 
The structure of the industry is discussed, and company profiles of the
major players in each of the industry's three main segments are
presented.  An analysis of the impact that this market will have on the
bulk of components that make up portable systems is also included.

<B>STUDY GOALS AND OBJECTIVES</B>


<P>China's telecommunications market has expanded at a remarkable rate since the 
1980s. Sharply increased demand for telecommunications services has put 
serious pressures on the current telecommunications supply system controlled 
by the Chinese government.   Demand has increased so greatly that suppliers of 
telecommunications services of China have had to depend on charging 
subscribers high prices to keep the balance between the demand and service 
supply.</P> 

<P>In the past 10 years, the Chinese government has invested substantially in 
telecomunications infrastructure projects.  The supply of telecommunications 
services still lags considerably behind the fast-growing demands.  
Nevertheless, this is just the beginning of the development of China's 
telecommunications market.  According to the statistics, China's 
telecommunications market is one of the most backward markets in the world.  
For example, by the end of 1994, the number of telephones per 100 persons in 
China was only 3.2.  If the development goal set by the Chinese government can 
be reached by the end of this century, China will still only have eight 
telephones per 100 persons, which is significantly behind the average level of 
current world (15 telephones per 100 persons), and will barely catch up with 
the current average level for Africa. Obviously, in the next 5 to 10 years, 
the demand for telecommunications services will increase even faster than at 
present.  If the Chinese government does not change its current management 
practices in telecommunications, the gap between the highly expanded demand 
and the limited telecommunications services supply will be enlarged.</P> 

<P>From a concern about the further development of this market, the author has 
undertaken a series of studies and surveys.  The purpose of this project is to 
help those who are interested in China's telecommunications business 
understand the new developments happening in China, and to forecast the 
development of the market by the end of this century.</P> 




<B>SCOPE AND FORMAT</B>

<P>This study is basically an analysis of datasets and related information about 
China's telecommunications market.  These datasets and information are 
collected from China's publications and the Chinese government departments, 
and include material collected from interviews and tele-interviews with some 
high ranking Chinese officials.</P> 

<P>This study is divided into the following parts:</P> 

<P>TRENDS: Introduction to the development of China's telecommunications market 
from the 1950s to the 1990s.  Three development stages are analyzed: the 
period before the 1980s; the expansion period from 1980 to 1990; and the 
period of the development and acceleration since 1990.</P> 

<P>MARKETS: Introduction to China's telecommunications market by provinces and 
areas, and by products.</P> 

<P>COMPANIES: Introduction to the suppliers of telecommunications facilities in 
China's telecommunications market.</P> 

<P>ANALYSIS AND FORECASTING: Analysis of the indicators of China's 
telecommunications market and forecasting the further development of China's 
telecommunications by the year 2000.</P> 

<P>THE GOVERNMENT'S CONTROL OVER THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS MARKET
AND THE REFORM:</P> 
<P>Introduction to the Chinese government's management system for 
telecommunications, and analysis of the possibility of reform and opening the 
market.</P> 

<P>Before 1980, China's telecommunications market was stagnant.  In the 30 years 
from 1950 to 1980, for example, the number of telephones per 100 persons in 
the 1950s was lower than 0.2, in 1980 was 0.43, which increased less than 
0.25.  After 1980, with the development of economic reform, the 
telecommunications market began to grow very rapidly.  From 1980 to 1990, for 
example, the number of telephones per 100 persons doubled.  At the same time, 
the number of telephone subscribers almost doubled.  The average annual growth 
rate of subscribers was more than 20 percent.  Since 1990, the development was 
accelerated.  For example, the telephone subscribers increased by 22 millions; 
the average annual growth rate has been more than 30 percent.</P>  

<P>This study also forecasts the market development by the year 2000.  If the 
Chinese government has sufficient funds to invest in the market, the number of 
telephones per 100 persons can be expected to reach 14 by the year 2000.  
However, financial problems may delay development.</P> 

<P>Another problem is the monopoly which controls the telecommunications market 
of China.  The monopoly belongs, of course, to the state-owned enterprises and 
ultimately to the government.  This monopoly promises to be the major 
obstruction limiting the development of China's telecommunications market.  
This study analyzes this management system and discusses the possibility of 
changing the current market management system.</P> 

<B>METHODOLOGY</B>

<P>The research of this study includes extensive interviews and telephone 
interviews with officials and researchers in China, some of whom are high 
ranking officials in the Chinese government, i.e., in the SPC (State Planning 
Commission).  The information collected from these surveys is firsthand 
material which may not be available in current publications.  Some secondary 
sources include the Statistical Survey Reports and Statistical Yearbook of 
China, as well as Chinese newspapers and magazines.</P> 

<P>This study uses statistical analysis methods such as simulation and modeling.  
It also implemented time series models such as the ARMA and the ARIMA models. 
Regression methods such as least squares are the basic tools for the 
statistical analysis in this study.</P> 


<B>CONTRIBUTION OF THIS STUDY</B>

<P>This study describes the recent development of China's telecommunications 
market and points to opportunities therein, which may be useful to those who 
are interested in the telecommunications business.  China's telecommunications 
market may be the largest one in the world and is expanding with increasing 
acceleration.  This study analyzes its fast development and points to some 
major elements which have affected its expansion, as well as elements which 
may determine its further development.</P> 

<P>The Chinese government's system of control over the telecommunications market 
is one of the major elements affecting that market.  Currently, the monopoly 
status of government agents and state-owned enterprises is seriously 
obstructing the expansion of telecommunications services.  The study analyzes 
the government's telecom-munications' management system and the structure of 
functional departments, which may help people to understand China's macro 
telecommunications' market management.</P> 

<P>China has established the development of the telecommunications industry as an 
important goal.  This study introduces this development plan and analyzes its 
reality. The conclusion is optimistic.  Moreover, this study also points out 
the limitations of this development plan.</P> 

<P>This study hazards some forecasts for China's telecommunications market 
development.  Compared to what can be expected, the current expansion is only 
a small beginning.</P>

<B>STUDY GOALS AND OBJECTIVES</B>


<P>From the employees who are scheduled to work at home, to the after hours 
worker, and including the self-employed home office worker, home offices have 
been in existence for years.  Within the past year or so, manufacturers have 
recognized the significance of the home market which includes users from 
children working on their homework, using the online services to gather 
information, to their parents balancing their checkbook, and lastly the home 
office worker.</P> 

<P>Throughout this report, the home office market will be referred to as such and 
should not be confused with the overall home market.  Although, in many cases, 
home office workers purchase their home office products with the rest of the 
family in mind and therefore the line between home usage and home office usage 
becomes somewhat fuzzy. Therefore, in some cases, the home office market 
becomes a subsegment of the overall home market.  Only recently have the home 
office workers become in vogue and their needs have just begun to be addressed 
by office equipment manufacturers. Manufacturers' production and 
implementation of products have only begun to scratch the surface of the 
requirements of the home office population.</P> 

<P>This segment requires computers, peripherals, software and office products.   
However, this segment may require specialized equipment in terms of fully 
configured products that can be accommodated within smaller spaces, as the 
typical home office is in the basement or in the corner of the living room or 
may be even in a spare bedroom.</P> 

<P>BCC has prepared this report to show the viability of the home office segment 
of the workforce in terms of demographics, computers, peripherals, software, 
office products and ancillary services.  BCC has recognized the significance 
of this market whereas no other research or marketing source has.  BCC has 
delved into a myriad of specific areas of products to determine current and 
future unit and value trends of the home office market, whereas others have 
merely suggested broad-based needs to the home office worker such as a guide 
to working at home.</P> 



<B>METHODOLOGY</B>

<P>The research for this report included personal contacts with key management 
and marketing professionals within the leading competitors in each product 
segment.  Additional contacts were made to people within these industries that 
are on the client side, the actual users of these products.  Further contacts 
were made to home office workers, be they telecommuters or self-employed home 
office workers.</P> 

<P>The basis of the trends and forecasts were determined from the aforementioned 
contacts, combined with information gathered from secondary sources such as; 
trade publications, trade associations, on-line databases, company literature 
to supplement our understanding of the markets, applications and trends 
impacting the future of telecommuting, working from home and the home office 
environment.</P> 

<B>CONTRIBUTION OF THE STUDY</B>

<P>Although this segment of the work force has been evolving for the past few 
years, acknowledgement by the very manufacturers that could benefit from new 
workers have been slow on the upstart.  This analysis should be used by these 
companies to further understand the demands of this exceptionally viable 
segment of the workforce and to forecast production of their products based 
upon information gathered from their own sources and in conjunction with this 
report.</P>

<B>STUDY GOAL AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>

This study was done with the objectives of identifying some of the leading technologies that are 
influencing the emerging high-speed networking industry and determine their growth
opportunities, 
prime product areas and the type of applications that lend themselves significantly to specific 
technologies.  The growth of high-speed networking industry has been influenced by several
factors that 
impact on its growth.  Some of these include the increasing use of multimedia, desktop
videoconferencing, 
high-volume data transfer, Internet connectivity, scientific and engineering applications, federal 
government supported applications, etc.  The unique nature of the applications used in these
environments 
lend themselves to be implemented on specific high-speed networking technologies.  This in turn
impacts 
on the services, type of networking and end-user products that are used in each technology area. 
One of 
the major goals of this study is to identify the growth opportunities for each type of technology as
a whole 
and also the products and applications that benefit the most from it.  The primary stated objective
of this 
study is to focus on overall opportunities in the U.S. and specific areas worldwide where
high-speed 
networking is on the rise.<P>


<B>REASONS FOR DOING THE STUDY</B><P>

This study provides a comparative analysis of growth opportunities in six technology areas that
are 
impacting on high-speed networking.  While studies performed by others focus on each area of
high-speed 
technology separately, this study offers a unique comparative analysis of six of the most discussed 
technology standards in the industry.  The study performs an analysis of each technology area
separately 
and then cross-references growth opportunities by each applications area and technology.  The
study aims 
to fill a major gap in the industry for an in-depth comparative analysis of major technologies that
are 
influencing the high-speed networking industry.  Additionally, this study presents the individual
and 
comparative growth opportunities for the six technology groups in easily understandable tabular
format.  
Our prestudy research with various industry sources indicated that there is a need for a
comparative 
growth study for major technologies and applications groups, which inspired this effort.<P>


<B>CONTRIBUTION OF THE STUDY AND FOR WHOM</B><P>

This study contributes a unique perspective of the emerging high-speed networking industry and
presents 
a comprehensive growth study for the benefit of individuals and organizations involved in various
areas of 
the industry.  While highly focused studies available in the industry highlight developments in a
product 
or technology area, this study specializes in focusing on comparative analysis that should be of
special 
appeal to product and applications developers, consultants, hardware and software engineers,
phone 
companies, service providers and others.  This study contributes a comparative analysis of U.S.
and 
international markets hitherto not attempted in the industry.<P>


<B>SCOPE AND FORMAT</B><P>

The study includes an analysis of six major technology areas that are considered the most
discussed 
standards in the industry and aims to provide a brief analysis of each technology, its unique
features, 
advantages and disadvantages, business and technology trends that are influencing the technology
and the 
industry as a whole, main products, applications and services in each technology area and presents
growth 
analysis till the year 2001 in tabular and chart formats.  Additional analysis highlights the most 
productive end-user areas where the technologies are applied.<P>

The format of the study includes the presentation of the most relevant topics in each technology

</CENTER>

<B>STUDY OBJECTIVES</B><P>

This report focuses on two industries, namely, the
telecommunications industry and the electronics and computer
industry.  It has two objectives: first, to analyze in detail the
changes in the trade relationships between the U.S. and Mexico
brought about by the approval of NAFTA; second, to present
forecasts for U.S. exports to Mexico for each of those industries.<P>


<b>REASONS FOR DOING THE STUDY</B><P>

After heated debates, a heavy dose of political arm twisting, and
much hand wringing, the U.S. Congress approved, last November, the Bush Administration's trade agreement with Mexico.  The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), has now been approved by all three governments and took effect on January 1, 1994.<P>  

The treaty has been hailed as the most promising trade agreement
ever signed, of even more importance than the agreement linking the
European countries into a Common Market.  Canada, the U.S., and Mexico now represent a market with a combined GDP of over $6.3 trillion, with a population of some 370 million people.  Even though Mexico is the economic weak member in this agreement, it is believed the dismantling of trade barriers will give a boost to its economy.  NAFTA will provide it with the much needed stable environment that should attract the foreign capital it requires to modernize its industries.  It will also allow Mexico to focus more on updating its physical and social infrastructure and less on protecting its inefficient industries.<P>

NAFTA is also expected to create additional trade opportunities
for the U.S.  In this third of a three-report series, we examine
the impact the NAFTA will have on opportunities for additional U.S.
exports for two industries: telecommunications and electronics and
computers.  The first previously published report focused on autos
and auto parts and the second analyzed prospects for additional
trade in crude petroleum, natural gas, petrochemicals, and
plastics.<P>


The telecommunications system as personified by Telefonos de Mexico
(TELMEX) is the pride of Mexico's economy and rapidly becoming one
of its most important industries.  Since its privatization in 1990,
it has established itself as a crucial element in bringing Mexico
closer to its industrialized neighbors to the North.  It is rapidly
extending Mexico's telephone network throughout the country and it
is modernizing and expanding its long-distance links with the
outside world.  It has also attracted the attention of the
investment community and has become the darling of investors.<P>   

Mexico's indigenous electronics and computer industry has suffered
setbacks in recent years due to the stiff competition from imports. 
It is small in comparison to other sectors and Mexican
manufacturers are relatively inefficient versus those found in the
U.S. and Canada.  The indigenous industry compares unfavorably with
the 500+ maquiladora plants involved in the manufacturing and
assembling of electronics and computer products.  Those in-bond
plants, set up mostly by U.S. producers to reap the benefits of low
wages for their labor-intensive operations, promise to flourish
under NAFTA as their outputs are allowed to be sold more freely
in the Mexican market.  The manufacturing of more sophisticated
computer equipment, however, may continue to remain in the U.S. as
the industry is suffering from overcapacity and cutbacks, not
expansion.<P>



<b>CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE STUDY</B><P>

The study is aimed at those groups and individuals directly and
indirectly connected with the two industries covered in this
report.  They are the most affected by NAFTA and they will have
to decide within the next few years whether or not to develop plans
to take advantage of NAFTA.  We are offering these interested
parties our insights into possible developments in Mexico over the
next 10 years.  Decisions whether to begin or expand business
programs should always be done with as much information as
possible.  By providing our customers with a well reasoned
analysis, we believe that the quality of their decision-making
process can be greatly enhanced.<P>


<b>SCOPE AND FORMAT</B><P>

This study is divided into two sectors covering the
telecommunications equipment and the electronics and computer
industries.  It focuses first on the changes brought about by 
NAFTA, changes mostly in the investment rules and tariff structure
for each sector.  It then proceeds to analyze the demand for
equipment and services for those two sectors in Mexico.  We analyze
the present structure and provide a 10-year forecast for both
industries, with emphasis on imports for U.S.-made products.<P>



<b>INFORMATION SOURCES</B><P>

This study relies on a wide variety of sources.  We are thankful to
those industry experts contacted during the course of this study
who have been willing to share their thoughts with us.  We have
also made use of publicly available sources of information such as
the numerous studies published over the last two years on the
potential impact of NAFTA on the various sectors of the U.S.
and Mexican industries.<P>

</CENTER>

<B>STUDY GOAL AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>

BCC's goal in conducting this study was to determine the current
worldwide status of the market for uninterruptible power supply
(UPS) systems, and to assess their growth potential over a 5 year
period from 1992 to 1997.  We were particularly interested in the
impact on the market brought about through new technology.  We were
also interested in the types of batteries used in UPS devices, and
the software produced by the industry.<P>

Our major objective was to present a comprehensive analysis of the
current uninterruptible power supply market and plot its future
course.<P>

<B>REASONS FOR DOING THIS STUDY</B><P>

Over the past several years, advances in technology have changed
the size and structure of UPS systems.  Smaller, more powerful
devices are being sold to meet the requirements of markets in
transition.  The move away from central computing and large
mainframes to decentralized personal computers and workstations has
changed power management demands.  Electronic instruments have
replaced electromechanical devices in the laboratory and
industrial environment, expanding the need for smaller UPS systems.<P>


BCC decided to examine the current status of UPS systems.  We were
interested in finding out how they were evolving and what specific
changes were taking place.<P>

<B>CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE STUDY AND FOR WHOM</B><P>

We assembled a study of the two basic UPS technologies: standby and
online.  We present a worldwide industry structure, examine the
competitive aspects of the industry, analyze the current markets,
and project shipments for each major technology to 1997.  The study
will be of interest to those who manufacture UPS devices,
electrical and electronic equipment, batteries, and cables.  It
will also interest those who manufacture computers, communications
network equipment, laboratory and process control devices, and
security systems.  Producers of software will also find it useful.<P>

<B>SCOPE AND FORMAT</B><P>

The scope of our study encompasses the four types of standby and
online UPS systems, the types of batteries used to support them,
and the kinds of software that enable users to diagnose power
problems, communicate with UPS devices, and monitor and control
their operation.  We also project UPS systems by power range and
present the relative positions of the systems by technology.
Growth potential is analyzed for the four types of systems:
traditional standby, UPS card, double conversion online, and
line-interactive.  Also discussed is the growth of UPS systems by
application areas: data processing, communications, industrial,
medical and laboratory, utility, and security.  We present forecasts
to 1997.  Technological issues and trends are reviewed.  Other
influential factors such as past growth and the effects of the
economic climate, are also discussed.<P>

Because this is a worldwide industry, BCC analyzes the domestic and
international regulatory and standards situations and their impact
on the UPS business.  The economic environment and its effect on
the business is also reviewed.  BCC presents an analysis of the
market factors within the UPS industry and among various end-user
industries, and looks at their impact for the future.<P>

<B>METHODOLOGY</B><P>

BCC presents an analysis of UPS shipments and their value by major
category.  Our estimated value is what manufacturers and  material
providers have paid in current dollars.  Then, based on our
surveys, we analyze UPS applications by major technology, calculate
estimates for growth, and forecast shipments of UPS systems and
their value, and the value of batteries and software for 1997.<P>


<B>INFORMATION SOURCES</B><P>

BCC surveyed approximately 65 companies to obtain the data for this
report.  Included were manufacturers of UPS systems, batteries and
software providers.  We surveyed distributors of UPS systems and
companies that use these devices in various industries, such as
data processing, telecommunications, medical and laboratory
equipment, and process control.  We also included several trade
associations, the U.S. Department of Commerce, and data from
financial and industry sources.<P>

<B>STUDY GOALS AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>

Printed Circuit Boards presents a detailed view of market size,
growth, and trends for this industry.  The major product lines and
applications are identified and the market size for each product
line and application are estimated for the next five years. 
Significant technological trends and developments in materials and
applications are identified and analyzed.  International aspects of
the printed circuit board market are discussed, and the structure
of the industry is addressed, including profiles of the major
printed circuit board suppliers.<P>


<b>REASONS FOR DOING THE REPORT</B><P>

Printed circuit boards represent a technology critical to modern
electronic products.  The growth of the electronic equipment
industry is driven by a seemingly insatiable demand for both new
and existing products.  High definition television, interactive
multimedia, handheld computers, voice recognition synthesis, image
processing, character recognition, and artificial intelligence will
enter the market later this decade.  Coupled with existing radio,
television, computer, and other products, these new technologies
will demand great quantities of sophisticated electronic equipment
and components, including printed circuit boards.<P>


<b>CONTRIBUTION OF THE REPORT AND FOR WHOM</B><P>

This BCC report provides in-depth information and state-of-the art
technological evaluations for decision making by those involved in,
or considering becoming involved in, the supply of printed circuit
boards to the computer, communications, instrumentation,
industrial, consumer, automotive, and military markets.<P>

The study can assist clients in strategic planning, acquisition
analysis, technology analysis, commercial development of new
products, and analysis of competitors' strategies, strengths,
weaknesses, pricing, market share, and profitability.<P>


<b>SCOPE AND FORMAT OF THE REPORT</B><P>

This report analyzes the products, applications, technology,
international aspects, and industry structure.  It also profiles
key companies/organizations involved in the supply of printed
circuit boards to the computer, communications, instrumentation,
industrial, consumer, automotive, and military markets.<P>

The format of this report is to state all values, projections, and
forecasts in terms of constant dollars unless otherwise noted.  All
numbers and projections are substantiated or noted as to their
origin.<P>


<b>METHODOLOGY</B><P>

The background research of Printed Circuit Boards consisted of a
thorough analysis of trade, government, and company literature, and
the substantial information in BCC's database.  An extensive series
of personal and telephone interviews with key executives and
officials in the industries, trade associations, and government
followed the background work.  The expert and reasoned comments of
these people, combined with BCC experience and analysis, provide
the basis for the content of this report.<P>

The market growth for printed circuit boards forecast in this
report is somewhat more optimistic than that of some other
contemporary forecasts.  BCC believes that growth in electronics,
particularly portable electronics, and resultant demand for
miniaturization, high connection and wiring densities, and high pin
counts, will fuel a more robust printed circuit board market than
would otherwise be expected.  The contents of the report amplify
these considerations.<P>


<b>INFORMATION SOURCES</B><P>

Major sources of information are noted throughout the report and in
Appendix A (Works Cited).<P>


<b>BCC CREDENTIALS</B><P>

The author of this report has worked on many assignments dealing
with the supply of technologically advanced materials to industry,
and has analytical familiarity with many of the important issues
influencing the supply of printed circuit boards to the computer,
communications, instrumentation, industrial, consumer, automotive,
and military markets.<P>

<B>STUDY GOAL AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>

BCC's goal in conducting this study was to determine the current
worldwide status of the insulated wire and cable industry, and
assess the growth potential over a five year period from 1990 to
1995.  We were particularly interested in the uses of the more
traditional types of wire and cable in comparison with fiber optic
cable.  In addition, we were interested in the potential market for
key insulation materials, such as resins and rubber-
based compounds, and newer materials used for high-temperature
applications and non-toxic flame retardation.<P>

Our major objective was to present a comprehensive analysis of the
current wire and cable industry and plot its future course.<P>

<B>REASONS FOR DOING THIS STUDY</B><P>

Wire and cable is a mature business that is experiencing flat
growth.  In recent years, however, demand for electronic, data and
telecommunications functions has increased.  In addition,
requirements for high temperature and flame-retardant, non-toxic
wire and cable products has stimulated demand for newer, more
functional insulation materials.<P>

BCC decided to examine the current position of the various wire and
cable technologies to see how these demands were being met.  We
were interested in determining the competitiveness of the various
types of wire and cable and their insulating materials.<P>

<B>CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE STUDY AND FOR WHOM</B><P>

We assembled a study of the nine major types of wire and cable
products, their technological trends, and the major materials used
for their insulation.   We present a worldwide industry structure,
examine the competitive aspects of the industry, analyze the
current markets, and project shipments for each of the nine product
categories for 1995.  This study will be of interest to those who
make electrical and electronic devices, construct industrial,
institutional and residential buildings, design and install
communications systems, and those in the utility business.<P>

<B>SCOPE AND FORMAT</B><P>

The scope of our study encompasses the nine major types of wire and
cable products: electronic, telephone and telegraph, power
distribution, control and signal, building, apparatus, magnet,
"other," and fiber optic.  BCC explores each technology, makes
an assessment of its current market status, examines its influence
on future markets, and presents forecasts of growth to 1995.
Various technological issues, including new kinds of materials, are
discussed.  Other influential factors, such as past growth
performance, usage by industry sector, and the functions of power
transmission versus communications, are also discussed.<P>

Because this is a worldwide industry, BCC analyzes the domestic and
international regulatory environments and their impact on the wire
and cable business.  We also assess various international economic
indicators and their possible impact on the industry.  BCC
presents an analysis of the driving forces within wire and cable,
and evaluates the market growth factors for the future.<P>

We also review the use of materials such as the conventional
polymers used to insulate the bulk of wire and cable products.  In
addition, we review the fluorocarbons, low-halogen and other newer
compounds being used to provide high-temperature and flame-
retardant properties.  Future costs and consumption of these
materials, and their percentage of total wire and cable costs, are
also estimated.<P>

<B>METHODOLOGY</B><P>

BCC presents an analysis of the value of wire and cable shipments
by each product category.  We also present the value of materials
used in the production of each wire and cable product.  Our
estimated value is what manufacturers and materials providers have
paid in current dollars.  Then, based on our surveys, we analyze
applications for each of the nine major products, and calculate an
estimate for growth, and forecast shipments for 1995.<P>

We present the kinds and values of insulation materials used for
wire and cable in 1990.  Based on technological trends and
application growth, we project materials consumption for 1995.<P>

<B>INFORMATION SOURCES</B><P>

BCC surveyed approximately 70 companies to obtain the data for this
report.  Included were manufacturers and distributors of wire and
cable, major users of these products, and suppliers of materials.
We also included the U.S. Department of Commerce, several trade
associations, and data from financial and industry sources.<P>

<B>STUDY GOAL AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>

This study analyzes and forecasts both the product and end-use
markets for advanced building communication and control systems and
devices (or ABCs). Briefly, the markets for products are divided
into two broad types of ABCs:<P>

--DEVICES, which are individual control products such as those used
for security, HVAC, and lighting; and<P>

--SYSTEMS, which are centrally controlled products including those
used for security, HVAC, lighting, and telecommunications.<P>

The markets for end-users fall within the four conventional
classifications of buildings: Residential, Commercial, Industrial,
& Institutional.<P>

<B>REASONS FOR WRITING THIS STUDY</B><P>

There are dramatic changes occurring in the markets for products
that make it easier to manage buildings and for products that
improve production through enhanced telecommunications. Some of
these products are the ABCs examined in this study. (Essentially
there is no difference between a building fully equipped with ABCs
integrated as one system and an intelligent, or smart, building.)
The ABC industry is now beginning to blossom into a respectable and
interesting business. Thus, many questions have to be answered:<P>

* Which types of buildings tend to be equipped with which types of
ABCs?<P>

* What are product preferences by type of building?<P>

* What are the different ABC product forecasts?<P>

* Does all the initial hype and subsequent bad press on the concept
of intelligent buildings now,have implications in the marketing of
ABCs?<P>

* To what extent is there consumer education regarding ABCS, and
what does that suggest for the future?<P>

* How is the diffuse industry structure of the firms which
manufacture ABC products broken down?<P>

The study was undertaken also to determine the impact of all the
related trends and patterns on the future of ABCs. Among these
trends are: rapidly advancing technologies, deregulation, growing
concern over social issues, the slowing of inflation, declining
prices in electronic Products, the increasing number of elderly,
declining household size, merger & acquisition activity, and the
growing use of intelligent buildings in other developed nations.<P>

<B>CONTRIBUTION OF STUDY</B><P>

This study is unique in eight ways -- that is, it makes eight
contributions to understanding the so-called business end of the
building control industry. They are:<P>

* The study develops and organizes a useful classification system
which simplifies understanding what products perform what
functions. This is useful in two ways:<P>

--determines where a firm and its competitors fit into the overall
picture
--Articulates or defines markets to determine strategy<P>

* The marketing of intelligent buildings in the U.S. is studied for
its impact on why product demand has developed so differently here
than in other industrial democracies. Included in this are the
implications for ABCs, as industries fight to survive by
modernizing.<P>

* Market size, forecasts, and growth rates are detailed by eight
product types, as well as two broader product groupings. This
includes developing the ratio between expenditures on ABCS and
expenditures on building construction. This study is designed
especially for manufacturers and users of the products discussed.
Others, such as industry analysts and consultants should also find
the study helpful.<P>

* The study analyzes why the eight different product groups are
growing at different rates.<P>

* The four basic groups of end-users are studied for trends that
affect their respective demand for ABCs.<P>

* The industry structure is investigated for its global
implications. Both foreign firms, as well as recent M&A activity,
are included.<P>

* The hype of earlier years has had its negative impact. This and
other marketing issues--especially consumer education--are
analyzed.<P>

* The impact on ABCs of financing, leases, government actions, and
technology are examined.<P>

<B>SCOPE AND FORMAT</B><P>

This study is laid out according to the following table of
contents, with special features of each
section noted:<P>

<B>ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS</B><P>

These are primarily:<P>

1. Economic which emphasizes GNP, interest rates, and construction
activity. Of particular interest here is a series of ratios,
discussed more below, relating ABC expenditures to construction
expenditures.<P>

2. Demographic with special attention to trends such as fewer
persons per household and more elderly.<P>

3. Regulatory which focuses on issues which include (but are not
limited to) government actions, technical standards, health
concerns, building codes, and taxes.<P>

<B>MARKETING</B><P>

This section examines marketing issues, paying special attention
to:<P>

1. Financial, and Leases for their impact on demand for ABCs.<P>

2. Consumer Education, which is also discussed elsewhere in the
study because of it's importance.<P>

3. OEM Demand for ABCs versus Retrofit Demand.<P>

4. Channels of Distribution, especially retail or residential,
compared to non-residential or business.<P>

5. Technical and Perceived Problems with ABCs.<P>

6. Other Nations' use of ABCs and intelligent buildings.<P>

7. Profile of Existing Intelligent Buildings.<P>

<B>END-USE MARKETS</B><P>

This section examines trends that affect the demand for the
following four conventional classes of buildings which form the
end-use markets: Residential, Commercial, Industrial, &
Institutional.<P>

When certain generalizations apply, a two-way classification of
Residential & Non-residential is used.<P>

<B>INDUSTRY STRUCTURE</B><P>

This section includes market shares of leading manufacturers both,
overall and by the two broad groups of products (devices &
systems). There is also a discussion of the leading firms and
recent M&A activity.<P>

<B>PRODUCT OVERVIEW</B><P>

Included in this section are:<P>

1. R&D and Technology<P>

2. Service aspects of ABCs<P>

3. "Organizational table" of the ABC industry. The table then forms
the basis for the next two sections which respectively examine and
forecast the device markets and the system markets.<P>

DEVICES:<P>

1. Safety<P>

Security
Fire
Medical
Other Hazards

2.Heating\Ventilating\Air-Conditioning (HVAC)<P>

3. Lighting<P>

4. Other<P>

SYSTEMS
1. Central Coordinating Units (CCUs)<P>

Switches

3. Sensors<P>

4. Other System Components (OSC)<P>

Devices and Systems are then discussed in their own sections
following the product overview.<P>

Technology and Marketing are also discussed in other sections as
appropriate.<P>

The APPENDIX outlines the real estate or building industry defining
the roles of various types of players, such as builders,
developers, etc.<P>

METHODOLOGY Forecast methods include standard statistical methods
such as analyzing trends, ratios, and growth rates. The final
forecasts represent an integration of numerical results, review of
the literature, and comments made during the interviews.<P>

Because this study will be released very early in 1990, it was
thought appropriate to estimate 1989 values. Thus, 1989 is the base
year. 1988 data are included because that is the last year for
which "solid data" are now available. The computations for the
compound average rate of annual growth (noted in the tables as
"AAGR") are figured from 1989. The forecast years are 1991 and
1995. The backcast year is 1985 which was the first year for
significant activity in intelligent buildings. Also, in the
industry structure section 1988 revenue figures are used because
1989 data were not available when work was completed.<P>

The data are measured in terms of current dollars -- that is,
unadjusted for any inflation or deflation. The data are also
"shipments" which refers to the value of the products as they leave
the factory. Shipments should give the reader a clearer picture of
how much is actually being produced. Costs such as transportation,
marketing, etc. are included in "sales" figures which are not in
this report. That difference can be considerable, especially for
those buying retail.<P>

Important to these forecasts are a series of ratios relating
dollars of building construction expenditures to dollars of ABCS
shipped. This is discussed in the section on environmental factors
and is referred to.several other times.<P>

<B>INFORMATION SOURCES</B><P>

* Standard U.S. Government data on GNP, prices, population, and
construction<P>

* Company literature, especially annual reports, lOKs, & product
information<P>

* Business publications, notably the The Wall Street Journal &
Business Week<P>

* The daily press, particularly The New York Times & USA Today<P>

* Trade publications, such as Sensors, Telephony, & Buildings<P>

* Phone & personal-interviews with: manufacturers of ABCS,
architects & engineers, builders, realtors, developers, authors,
and The Intelligent Building Institute. Many of the interviews
included: (l) open-ended questions. Some particularly striking--not
necessarily nice--quotes are used, especially when they epitomize
views repeated in a somewhat subtler fashion. (2) The probing of
answers which appeared to contradict statements from other sources.<P>

* A "shopping trip" was made to outlets such as Sears, Radio Shack,
and Zenith (now Bull's Heathkit). The salespersons were not aware
that the conversations they were conducting were interviews for
this study. The purpose was to find out what a typical person who
had heard of "smart homes" and other high-tech building management
products might encounter.<P>

* Sensors's "Expo" was visited as an additional source of
information.<P>

<B>RELATED BCC WORK CREDENTIALS</B><P>

The project manager has written studies for BCC on the following
industries:<P>

* Intelligent Buildings
* Security Systems
* Insulated Wire & Cable

readers in the U.S. will have a dollar volume of $3.38 billion.
The goal of this study is to present a comprehensive analysis of
the smart-card industry of the 1990s, its structure, market
dynamics, technologies and customer bases, and to examine
exactly how today's $75.23 million embryonic marketplace will
experience rapid growth in the 1990s.<P>


<B>REASONS FOR DOING THIS STUDY</B><P>

*  This study presents a thorough but succinct review of all
major smart card applications up and running in the U.S. as of
1990, as well as a synopsis of major activity worldwide.<P>

*  A census conducted by BCC especially for this study pinpoints
quantitatively the actual number of smart cards in the U.S. in
circulation circa 1990.<P>

*  New strategic directions have been charted by smart-card
makers since VISA's decision against smart card deployment. This
study identifies and explains what these strategic directions
are and how they will be implemented.<P>

*  Even though the industry is still in its infancy, a number of
major competitors are vying today for significant market shares.
This study highlights the efforts to date in this regard by
AT&T, Data Card, Micro Card Technologies, Schlumberger, Smart
Card International and others.<P>

*  Smart cards involve not one but three major advanced card
technologies.  A layman's technical overview of each is
presented along with product descriptions.<P>

*  Intel Corp. expects to bring to market a semiconductor chip
with one hundred million transistors on it by the year 2000.
This study outlines the probable course of future technological
change and its impact on the smart card.<P>

*  Cost-pricing data and projections are made in the study for
1990, 1995 and 2000 for all major smart card types and their
accompanying readers.<P>

*  No less than 15 separate market segments await significant
smart card penetration.  Several of these segments will be
"megamarkets" involving hundreds of millions of cards and
millions of card readers. This study catalogues each of these
market opportunities and presents concrete quantitative data
about the potential card universe of each.<P>

*  Likely card and reader populations for each segment are
forecast for 1995 and 2000. Financial projections of the dollar
volume of cards and readers for each segment are also made.<P>


<B>CONTRIBUTION OF THE STUDY AND FOR WHOM</B><P>

The U.S. smart-card industry in its entirety, past, present and
future, is detailed and analyzed in one volume.  This study is
thus an invaluable aid to market researchers, strategic and
information systems planners, industry analysts and consultants,
and executives at major smart card concerns.<P>

It can provide invaluable information and capacity-utilization
projections for  plastic card and electronic terminal
manufacturers, banks, transaction processors, telecommunications
networks and other satellites of the mag stripe and smart card
industries.<P>


<B>SCOPE, FORMAT AND METHODOLOGY</B><P>

This BCC study surveys every major aspect of smart card
deployment in the U.S., such as reasons for its delay, present
card populations, major market segments of promise, product
positioning by smart-card makers, likely scenarios of rapid
growth that will make small niches today mass markets by the
turn of the century, and quantitative capacity projections and
financial forecasts.<P>

As a study, this volume is divided into three parts.  In the
first, an in-depth examination of the U.S. smart card industry
today and major worldwide activity is presented.  In the second,
market structure and competitive factors are analyzed and
profiles of market leaders are presented along with a simplified
technical explanation of cards and readers.  In the third, every
promising market segment is carefully evaluated as to its
potential card population, and specific projections are made of
card and reader populations and their dollar volumes in 1995 and
2000.<P>

This study's methodology is straightforward.  It outlines the
conceptual underpinnings to present-day smart-card marketers,
outlooks and strategies, the exact nature of current products
and services, the likely ways card populations will finally
achieve the critical mass necessary to promote major growth, and
the
end-result of this growth in terms of market development and
financial return.<P>


<B>INFORMATION SOURCES</B><P>

Preparation for this study entailed an exhaustive search of
secondary source materials, in-depth review and synthesis of the
proceedings of major smart card industry conferences, and the
knowledgeable input of executives of major smart card
manufacturing concerns and end-user companies and organizations.<P>


<B>RELATED BCC WORK</B><P>

This study is BCC's fourth major survey in the card technology
and electronic banking fields published in the last three years
along with an impressive list of publications in the
electronics, computer and telecommunications fields.<P>

<B>STUDY GOAL AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>
INTRODUCTION

The goal of this report is to provide the most detailed and comprehensive study
ever of neuroengineering and its commercial potential.  The objectives include
a thorough coverage of the underlying technological issues of the developing
hardware and software tools of neuroengineering as well as assessments of
newand potential products.<P>

Thus, another important objective is to provide realistic market data on the
product areas for which the future neuroengineering products are expected.<P>

<B>REASONS FOR DOING THE STUDY</B><P>

The main reason for doing the study is that in the last two years there has
been a sudden growth of interest in the applications of neural network models
and neurocomputers.  The surprisingly broad interest among scientists and
engineers in different disciplines matches the equally surprising breadth and
depth of possible commercial applications of this technology.<P>

Furthermore, there has been a rapid increase in the number ofplayers, as well
as the areas they are investigating.  While many observers say that it is too
early to predict whether or not the first generation products will be
commercially successful beyond the R&D market, there are indications that, in
some applications, they are  successful beyond all expectations.<P>

Among the claimed advantages of neural networks and neurocomputers over
conventional forms of computation are demonstrations of adaptiveness, learning,
associative memory, optimization and classification of information. The
more interesting claims are for systems that can do all this without the aid of
a human intermediary.  Just by providing a neural network model with examples
of the problem situation, and training the model through repeated trials with
the information, it forms a matching pattern of the information and its
relations. Then, the neural network models are able to respond to
new information by either matching it in specified ways to the earlier
information or creating new categories to accommodate uniquely new information.<P>

By repetition of new and old information, a neural network model is then able
to adapt and perform an appropriate response to the information, whether it be
to move a robot arm to a unique position, find a subtle pattern in financial
trading data, or to distinguish between different images of a person.  These
more complex forms of information processing portend a role for computers quite
unlike that which has been envisioned for conventional computers. And, that is
part of why there is so much excitement.  While a number of researchers do not
like to openly admit it, there is the feeling among some in the community that
neural network models and neurocomputers are one step closer to creating an
artificial mind.  The shortcomings and disappointments with artificial
intelligence have tempered researchers expectations.  But, still, some
find these new demonstrations getting uncomfortably close to mimicking capabilities
that define human beings.<P>

It is interesting to note that some financial houses and individual investors
are  purportedly already realizing small and growing fortunes in stock and
commodity trading (there is supposedly more success with commodities than with
stocks), in sports forecasting, and other areas involving assessment
of uncertain and changing environments.  It appears that in just such
complex environments even the current types of neuroengineering products seems
to thrive.<P>

The study investigates the claims that neural networks and neurocomputers are
purportedly better than more conventional kinds of software and hardware.  The
study assesses the commercial implications for suppliers as well as end-users.
This includes an analysis of the types of applications that have been mentioned
above, along with consideration of the significance of adaptiveness, learning,
and other features.  This includes addressing such questions as:  In what ways
can adaptive properties be put to use?  What kinds of learning do neural network
models address?  How extensively can they be used in control systems, data
analysis, pattern recognition, and other applications?  What are the likely
markets that could result? How will they affect other markets?<P>

<B>SCOPE AND FORMAT</B><P>

The scope of the report is comprehensive.  It covers the many issues concerning
the merits and future prospects of neuroengineering.  It covers the technology
as well as the applications that are under development and discussion.
It covers the hardware development issues that so many regard as critical to the
development of a neuroengineering industry.  The report discusses the prospects
for suggested applications, and projects the likely size and growth of the
markets that will probably result.  There is also extensive analysis of the
marketshares of suppliers, along with sales projections that are segmented in a
variety of ways.<P>

The start-up firms are discussed in terms of their products,their services,
their strengths and their weaknesses.  The role of the major corporations are
considered as well.<P>

The report also looks at the varieties of basic research, product development
and commercialization that are  going on in universities, and government both
in the US and abroad. Competitive aspects are discussed, including the
activities of Japanese firms that are getting involved in neuroengineering.<P>

<B>CONTRIBUTION OF THE STUDY</B><P>

This study provides the most complete accounting of the ongoing developments in
neural networks and neurocomputing.  It provides the most thorough and up-date
assessment to be found anywhere on the subject.  No other study has as complete
a listing of applications that are under development or that have
beensuggested.

The study also provides extensive quantification of many important facets of
the market developments for neuroengineering. This, in turn, contributes to
determining what kinds of strategies firms need to adopt in order to compete in
this emerging marketplace.<P>

<B>METHODOLOGY AND INFORMATION SOURCES</B><P>

We first conducted an exhaustive search for the literature on neural networks
and neurocomputing. Secondary sources included trade literature, databases, and
various government sources. Then, there were over 150 formal and informal
interviews, and discussions with leading researchers, graduate
students, government officials, presidents of start-up firms, as well as their
associates, end-users, various suppliers, analysts, venture capitalists, life
scientists, computer scientists, engineers, mathematicians, and many others.
the range of interviews and discussions reflected the breadth and depth of
neuroengineering in its combined use of neurobiology, design in
computer architectures, and abstract conceptual models as well as otherareas.<P>

<B>RELATED BCC WORK</B><P>

Many of the studies from the Electronics Group are related to this study on
neuroengineering.  Supercomputers, the software industry, the artificial
intelligence marketplace, voice recognition and synthesis technology, and a
number of other studies, provide important information.<P>

<B>STUDY GOALS AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>

Our goal in conducting this study was to determine the impact of
micromachining technology in the manufacture of microsensors and
the market potential for the various types microsensor
applications.<P>

While other studies focus on the market potential for sensors, we
felt that there was a need to address the business implications
that micromachining technology has on solid state silicon sensors.
We believe that this is the only study that relates various
micromachining techniques, to  several types of silicon sensors
used in end-user applications.<P>


<B>REASONS FOR DOING THIS STUDY</B><P>

It is common knowledge in the industry that silicon sensors are
making a large headway in various industrial and other
applications.  However, we found that very little information
exists on how developments in micromachining techniques affect
silicon sensors application by the type of variables they measure
in various industries.  The impact of developments in
micromachining techniques will continue to be felt far beyond the
integrated chip manufacturing or silicon sensors industry.  These
developments will influence  testing and measuring applications in
several industries.<P>

BCC decided to examine major trends in micromachining technology on
the type of silicon sensors that are produced and how they are used
in several end-user applications, as well as present projections on
market opportunities and growth potential in each type of industry.<P>


<B>CONTRIBUTIONS TO THIS STUDY AND FOR WHOM</B><P>

A number of sources from several industrial, academic, research,
business and other fields were researched for this study.  We have
analyzed available information from various sources and matched it
with interviews with several industry experts.  Additionally,
available information from industry associations, federal agencies, trade and technical
journals has been matched with trends in the industry and with
other factors that influence the opportunities in the trade.<P>

This study covers the use of micromachining technology in producing
silicon sensors in aerospace, process control, medical, industrial
automation, medical and consumer applications.  This study is aimed
at manufacturers of silicon manufacturing equipment (SME),
manufactures of silicon sensors/transducers/transmitters, Original
Equipment Manufacturers (OEM) who use silicon sensors in various
testing and measuring equipment, investors, bankers and others who
are directly or indirectly involved with the industry.<P>


<B>SCOPE AND FORMAT</B><P>

This study covers all major sectors of the micromachining and
sensors industry.  BCC analyzes each segment, discusses the current
status of the technology, examines the influences that developments
in the micromachining industry will have on each end-user segment
that uses the products and on the OEM market that forms the largest
component of the business.<P>

We have taken care to examine those aspects that directly affect
the industry as a result of developments in  micromachining
technology and have presented a realistic assessment of the
opportunities that are likely to arise in each industry.<P>


<B>METHODOLOGY</B><P>

BCC presents an analysis, by each technology/industry segment, of
the current status in that segment, potential impact of the
development of micromachining technology, and projections of a
number of variables that are expected to influence the industry for
the next five years.<P>

We present the volume of potential growth, where applicable, in
dollars and quantities for each industry.  Each projection made was
based on current industry statistics, opinions from industry
experts, and analysis of information made available from  several
industry sources.  Where applicable we have taken a general average of the projections
provided by various industry sources and have matched them with the
volume of current business reported from federal and trade
agencies.<P>


<B>INFORMATION SOURCES</B><P>

BCC surveyed approximately 100 sources to obtain data for this
study. These included manufacturers of semiconductor manufacturing
equipment, manufacturers of sensors, end-users in various
industries, experts in federal and other agencies, consultants and
other relevant sources.<P>

</CENTER>

<B>STUDY GOAL AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>

Our goal in conducting this study is to evaluate the results of the
current trends in LAN connectivity technology and make projections on the
market potentials for LAN connectivity products in light of increasing use
of personal computers in the work place.<P>

<B>REASONS FOR DOING THIS STUDY</B><P>

This study was undertaken to measure the relative growth prospects and
cross influences that fiber optics and traditional LAN media have on each
other.  The researchers were made aware of the conflicting and
contradictory information currently being generated in the industry about
the projected effects of FDDI on the LAN connectivity market.  Some
industry experts have painted a rosy picture of high growth for LAN
connectivity technology in general and FDDI in particular.  Our goal for
this study was to evaluate the "real" markets and the "real" growth
potential, and to estimate realistic projections while eliminating gross
over-projections.<P>


<B>CONTRIBUTION FOR THIS STUDY AND FROM WHOM</B><P>

This study is based on information carefully generated from interviews
with industry experts, data excerpted from replies to the questionnaires
mailed to industry experts and other informed individuals, and analysis
of a wide variety of information generated by the industry press and
technology journals.  Additionally, select industry experts were
approached more than once to clarify several related issues.<P>

Information was generated from vendors as well as users and matched to
produce a "the availability vs need" scenario.  Furthermore, a consensus
was developed to eliminate the most nagging problem facing the industry -
 the definition of a PC LAN.  A definition of an average LAN was created
from the various definitions that are floating around in the industry.<P>

<B>SCOPE AND FORMAT</B><P>

This study covers the major products and systems that influence the PC LAN
connectivity markets.  Each segment is analyzed, focussing on the current
state of the technology, major trends that influence the sales of the
product group, and marketing methods, along with a brief overview of the
technology. </B><P>


<B>METHODOLOGY</B><P>

BCC presents an analysis, by each major technology/product group segment,
focussing on both hardware, software and the media that make up the PC LAN
industry.  The projections for each sector focus on the current and per-
year growth during the next five years.<P>

Where applicable, the volume of growth is presented in dollars and
quantities.  Each projection was based on current industry statistics,
opinions from industry experts, and analysis of information available from
several industry sources.<P>

Where applicable we have taken a general average of the projections
provided by various industry sources and have matched them with the volume
of current business reported from federal and trade agencies.<P>


<B>INFORMATION SOURCES</B><P>

BCC has surveyed over 100 sources to obtain data for this study.  These
included the manufacturers of LAN systems, hardware, software, media and
consultants.  Major industry publications, reports from the Department of
Commerce and other federal agencies, industry associations and major
financial publications were also consulted.<P>

PC LAN technology, while being relatively young, is undergoing tremendous
changes.  These changes have been generated by the overall improvements
in PC, network, software technologies and by user demands.  Taking
advantage of the developments in the network technology, especially the
techniques that enable speedier transmission of data, the PC LAN industry
has managed to match it with the overall developments in PC technology -
such as increased memory and faster processing in each PC.<P>

This combination has enabled PC LAN developers to provide data access and
transmission facilities and sophisticated applications, processing, etc.,
that were hitherto confined to mainframe and mini computers.  And PC LAN
has additional advantages - cheaper installation and management costs,
portability, ease of use, and easier to manage technology.<P>

The business and industrial users have started a gradual shift  towards
PC-based data processing facilities by downsizing their mainframe and mini
computing systems.  This has naturally given an impetus to the growth of
PC-based LAN systems.<P>

To this end the world-wide LAN market is now at an impressive
$6.53 billion.  By 1995, the market is expected to reach a level of $12.02
billion - a reflection of an 16.5 per cent average annual growth rate.
Most of this will be due to the large number of non-fiber optic LANS which
are expected to grow from a $5.66 billion level to $10.09 billion in 1995.<P>
Fiber optic LANs which are now at an $865 million level and which
represent 13.2 per cent of total LAN sales will reach $1.92 bilion in
1995, at which time they will account for 16.0 per cent of the total LAN
sales.<P>

The U.S. accounts for close to 60 per cent of the total LAN market.  This
report finds developments in PC LAN technology in various applications as
follows:<P>

<B>PC LAN MARKETS SHOW HEALTHY GROWTH TRENDS</B><P>

The demand for PC LANs will show healthy growth trends between 1991 and
1995.  The worldwide revenues from PC LANS will increase from $6.53
billion in 1991 to $12.02 billion in 1995, registering an aggregate growth
of 18.40 per cent per year.   The growth will be fuelled by an increasing
move towards downsizing, connecting more and more end-users to databases
through LANS and an overall increase in the use of PCs in work places.
Hardware will account for two-thirds of the revenues followed by software
and media.<P>


<B>NON-FIBER PC LANS STILL DOMINATE THE MARKET</B><P>

PC LANS that are supported by non-fiber media, such as copper
wire and co-ax still dominate the markets.  Their position is being
challenged by fiber optic-based PC LANS.  However, the large installed
base of non-fiber optic LANs will not be easy to dislodge in the
foreseeable future.   The revenues from non-fiber optic PC LANS will
account for $5.66 billion in 1991 and will increase to
$10.09 billion in 1995 registering an aggregate annual growth of 15.66 per
cent.  The demand for copper-wire based PC LANS will be higher than the
demand for co-ax supported systems.<P>


<B>FIBER OPTIC PC LANS: ENJOYING INCREASING MARKET SHARE</B><P>

While the use of fiber optic media is increasing in wide area networks and
telecommunication links, as yet, it is not replacing traditional media in
PC based LAN systems in large numbers.  This is due to the high cost of
the fiber optic cables and installations.  The current worldwide revenues
from fiber optic PC LANs is around $865 million and is expected to grow
to $1.92 billion by 1995, registering an annual aggregate increase of
22.20 per cent.  While other industry sources project much higher
aggregate growth, we believe such optimistic growth rates cannot be
maintained due to the current recession, overall cost-cutting and other
factors.<P>


<B>NUMBER OF NON-FIBER OPTIC LANS: CONTINUING TO INCREASE</B><P>

The installed base of twisted copper wire and co-ax based PC LANs will
continue to increase despite a strong challenge from fiber optic-based PC
LANS.  As explained earlier, the traditional LANs still enjoy cost
advantages; the benefits offered by fiber optic based LANS cannot be
utilized by all users.  The number of traditional PC LANs installed in
1991 will be around 648,020 and will increase to 877,653 by 1995.  These
estimates include complete LAN systems that incorporate servers, primary
and secondary nodes.<P>


<B>THE MARKETS FOR PC LAN MEDIA: CONTINUE TO SHOW HEALTHY GROWTH TRENDS</B><P>

The media used in PC LANS is difficult to isolate as some PC LANS are
connected through WAN facilities.  By limiting the media to the segment
used within a building to connect nodes to servers, the demand for media
can be quantified to a considerable degree of accuracy.  The demand for
all types of media used in PC LANS will grow to $328 million during 1991
and will reach $527 million by 1995, registering an annual aggregate
increase of 12.79 per cent during the period.  This includes twisted
copper-wire, co-ax and fiber optic media.<P>

<B>STUDY GOAL AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>

Our goal in conducting this study is to evaluate the market
potential for the use of fiber optic cables and products in the
United States and principal countries in Europe and Asia.  This
report focuses on the use of fiber optic cables and products in the
telecommunications industry, which accounts for over 90 per cent of
the market.  Our objective is to highlight main areas of usage,
volume, and value of cables and products used in major
applications.<P>


<B>REASONS FOR DOING THIS STUDY</B><P>

This study was undertaken to measure the relative growth prospects
and cross influences that the fiber optics and telecommunications
industries have on each other.  While some reports currently
available cover "some areas" of the industry, we believe that this
study includes a comprehensive coverage of the major sectors of the
industry in the U.S.A. and abroad.  Additionally, it includes
export prospects for fiber optic products from the U.S.A. to
principal markets outside the country.<P>

This study also analyzes markets in the U.S.A., some countries of
Europe and East Asia by application, products and fiber optic
cables.<P>

The researchers were made aware of the conflicting and contradi-
ctory information currently being generated in the industry about
the projected efficacy of fiber optics in telecommunication
applications. Some industry experts have projected very high growth
rates for fiber optics in all aspects of telecommunications.   Our
goal for this study was to evaluate the "real" growth potential for
fiber optic applications in telecommunications and arrive at
realistic projections.<P>

<B>CONTRIBUTION OF THIS STUDY AND FOR WHOM</B><P>

This study is based on detailed information generated from
interviews with vendors, users, consultants and other industry
experts.  Additionally, a variety of published information from
governmental, trade press, associations, research organizations and
other sources were analyzed.  Over 300 vendors from around the
world were approached for detailed information on their activities,
and the data generated was carefully analyzed.<P>

Information generated from various sources was matched to produce
an "actual deployment vs projected use" scenario.  Furthermore, a
consensus was developed to eliminate the most vexing problem facing
the industry--whether fiber optics is actually cost effective. A
median cost cross-over ratio was developed to arrive at a
reasonable deployment scenario.<P>

<B>SCOPE AND FORMAT</B><P>

This study covers the major products and cable types that are used
in fiber optic systems in telecommunication applications.  The
analysis focuses on the end-user market applications as well as
select products that are used in the industry.  Each segment is
analyzed, focusing on the current state of the technology and
deployment, major trends that influence the sales of the product,
and marketing systems.  A brief overview of the technology is
presented where appropriate.<P>

<B>METHODOLOGY</B><P>

BCC presents an analysis, by each major technology/product group
segment, focussing on the components and cable systems.  The
projections for each product and application evaluates the current
and per-year growth during the next five years.<P>

Where applicable, the volume of growth is presented in dollars,
fiber-kilometers and units.  Each projection was based on current
industry statistics, opinions from industry experts, and analysis
available from several reliable sources.<P>

<B>INFORMATION SOURCES</B><P>

BCC has surveyed over 300 sources to obtain data for this study.
These included manufacturers of fibers, cables and a variety of
components, users, consultants and other industry experts.  Major
industry publications, reports from the Department of Commerce, the
Federal Communications Commission, Bureau of Census, various
associations, and financial publications were also consulted.<P>

<B>STUDY GOALS AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>

Over the last several years PCMCIA, an acronym for the Personal Computer Memory
Card International Association, has become a buzzword in the mobile computing
industry.  The Association is a standards and special interest group devoted to
developing the nonproprietary PCMCIA/PC card technology as well as the Card's
potential market.  Aside from the most seasoned portable computer users and the
industry itself, PCMCIA still remains somewhat of a mystery.  However, 
indications are that this is changing, and the PCMCIA/PC Card will soon become 
as commonplace as the floppy disk or compact disk.<P> 

This BCC report presents a detailed analysis of the current and
future markets for the large variety of PCMCIA/PC Card applications, from
communication to data storage cards as well as data acquisition and global 
positioning cards.  The study also addresses the impact on the personal 
computer industry.  Market forecasts are presented that project sales to the 
year 2000.  In addition, a short discussion is presented indicating the 
possible future for the various markets into the early 21st century.<P> 


<b>REASONS FOR DOING THE STUDY</B><P>

The study is presented at this time because of the rapid development of the 
mobile computing market.  This market is being strongly influenced and 
facilitated by the credit card sized PCMCIA/PC Card, which can provide truly 
mobile solutions to the mobile computer user.<P>  

Until recently, factors such as high costs, large size, high power consumption,
proprietary systems, and poor capability have kept much needed computer 
peripheral equipment out of the hands of mobile computer users.  In addition, 
many of the same problems coupled with operational and interoperational 
problems held the promising PCMCIA/PC Card market at bay as well.  However, 
diligent work by the PCMCIA has at last resolved most of the major issues and 
created new opportunities for card designers.<P>

Current trends indicate that 
the PCMCIA/PC Card interface will take its place as the peripheral and upgrade 
solution of choice across all computer lines well into the 21st century.  
There are also strong indications that the form factor will spread to 
virtually every corner of the electronics market, from automobiles to 
television.<P> 
       

<b>CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE STUDY AND FOR WHOM</B><P>

PCMCIA/PC Cards are a small but rapidly growing segment of the overall computer
industry.  A great deal of activity is concentrated in the development of the 
materials, components, and methods required to successfully implement the 
large variety of card applications.<P> 

This report provides an analysis of the complete PCMCIA/PC Card industry and
markets, by card function and end use, through the year 2000.  The structure 
of the industry is discussed, and company profiles of the major players in 
each of the industry's segments are presented.  The report is directed to 
decision makers in the PCMCIA/PC Card as well as the related electronics 
packaging and materials industries and markets.  They are:<P> 

<UL       Card application designers<BR>
       Electronic material suppliers<BR>

<b>SCOPE AND FORMAT</B><P>

This report is an analytical business tool whose primary purpose is to cover the
emerging PCMCIA/PC Card industry in terms of application and end use markets. 
A summary follows this introductory section and is followed immediately by an
overview of the history of the card and the development of the market.  The 
ensuing segments are analyses of the current and future market trends.<P>  

The final segments address the industry's structure, analysis of the card's 
impact on electronic packaging, and a patent analysis which addresses the 
areas of high patent activity as they pertain to PCMCIA/PC Cards. 

The appendices include not only directories of pertinent associations and 
conferences, but also the most extensive directory of PCMCIA/PC Card related 
vendors and manufacturers available with close to 450 entries.<P> 


<b>METHODOLOGY AND INFORMATION SOURCES</B><P>

The material presented is based on  information gathered from personal 
contacts with participants within the PCMCIA/PC Card industry as well as a 
thorough review of the technology gathered from technical papers and industry 
conferences.  Our final analyses and projections are based on a combination of 
a consensus among the primary contacts combined with our understanding of the 
impact of trends from a historical perspective.<P> 

Additional data was obtained from extensive reviews of secondary sources such as
trade publications, trade associations, company literature, and on-line 
databases. This was done to supplement our understanding of applications, 
markets, and trends in the PCMCIA/PC Card industry as well as the closely

<B>STUDY GOAL AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>

BCC's goal in conducting this study was to determine the current
status of the market for thick and thin film materials in the
microelectronics industry, and assess their growth potential over
an eight year period from 1992 to 2000, the end of the century.  We
also looked at their growth positions at the end of five years,
1997, the more traditional time frame for market studies.<P>

Our major objective was to present a comprehensive analysis of the
current thick and thin film materials market for microelectronic
products and plot its future course.<P>

<B>REASONS FOR DOING THIS STUDY</B><P>

Thick films provide high volume and low cost yields while thin film
deposition and reaction techniques make it possible to engineer
materials on the atomic scale.  There is a convergence of both
technologies in today's microelectronics market.  Thick and thin
film material technologies are being developed and evaluated by the
worldwide electronics industry because they offer solutions to many
of the advanced device challenges relating to high density and
greater speed of current and future electronic devices.<P>

BCC decided to examine the current status of thick and thin film
technologies.  We were interested in how they were evolving and
what specific changes were taking place.<P>

<B>CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE STUDY AND FOR WHOM</B><P>

We assembled a study of the two technologies: thick and thin film.
We present a worldwide industry structure, examine the competitive
aspects of the microelectronics and materials industries, analyze
the current markets, identify factors that will drive demand, and
project shipments to 1997 and 2000.  The application of thick and
thin films to semiconductor and related devices, and components, is
analyzed.  This study will be of interest to electronic material
suppliers, manufacturers of semiconductors and related devices such
as hybrid circuits and multichip modules, makers of electronic
components, suppliers of printed circuit boards, and manufacturers
of electrical and electronic equipment.<P>


<B>SCOPE AND FORMAT</B><P>

The scope of our study encompasses thick and thin film materials
and technologies in terms of processes, properties and
applications.  Trends in demand for microelectronic products are
reviewed and their impact on film technologies is assessed.
Semiconductor and component applications of thick and thin films
are discussed and future market drivers are identified.  Materials
are analyzed by their basic functions as conductors, resistors and
dielectrics.   Specific material properties are reviewed and sample
configurations of thick and thin film products are provided.  The
value of material shipments is projected by basic function, type of
material, and application.  Technological issues and trends are
reviewed.  Other influential factors such as the economic climate
are also discussed.<P>

Because this is a worldwide industry, BCC analyzes the domestic and
international legislative issues, standards situations and their
impact on the microelectronics materials business.  BCC also
presents an analysis of market factors within the thick and thin
film industries and among various end-user industries, and looks at
their impact on the future.<P>

<B>METHODOLOGY</B><P>

BCC presents an analysis of the value of thick and thin film
material shipments by major categories.  Our estimated value is
what manufacturers and material providers have paid in current
dollars.   Then, based on our surveys, we analyze thick and thin
film materials by basic function, type of material and application,
calculate estimates for growth, and forecast value of shipments for
1997 and 2000.<P>

<B>INFORMATION SOURCES</B><P>

BCC surveyed approximately 70 companies to obtain the data for this
report.  Included were manufacturers of semiconductors, components,
thick and thin film materials, coating service providers, materials
distributors, and industrial and consumer electronic companies.
Additional data for this report were obtained from government
information, trade associations, industry and financial sources,
and an exhaustive review of technical papers.<P>

<B>STUDY GOALS AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>

The objective of this BCC study is to ascertain the 1993 standing
of multichip packaging worldwide.  Providing for a standard five-
year planning cycle, estimates are given for 1998.  This study
defines the multichip module in all its variations. It analyzes the
technology options, determines the current applications multichip
modules in which (MCMs) are being shipped, defines and graphically
analyzes MCMs from many perspectives, categorizes and profiles the
companies involved, defines the unique nomenclature, and lists
organizations, conferences, authors, and consortia.<P>

This report is a steering mechanism for its readers so multichip
packaging will be a loss leader or profit maker rather than a
loser, whether MCMs are the company's sole product or one
electronic packaging option.<P>

Multichip modules are to single chip modules what HyperMart is to
WalMart; what Incredible Universe is to Radio Shack; what a
supermarket is to the corner mom and pop market.  How the market
place is understood and marketed to will determine each company's
staying power and success.<P>

<b>REASONS FOR MULTICHIP PACKAGING STUDY</B><P>

The multichip packaging area is dynamic and capital intensive.
Multichip packaging requires the integration of design control over
the whole package.  In this way the bare die, substrate, and
interconnections are integrated together.  The most successful
companies have been vertically integrated, but even these companies
have had to move toward concurrent engineering and strategic
partnering to address the cost of doing business in next generation
electronics.<P>

Electronic packaging must now address more complex mixed-mode
designs that require thermal management, higher performance, faster
response, and smaller size.<P>

Multichip packaging is synergistic.  Designed as part of a complete
system, multichip packaging will give next generation performance
with presently available subsystems of chips, substrates and
interconnects.  To successfully produce a multichip package, a
business concern must pull formerly separate technology avenues
together.<P>

The multichip packaging market is largely undefined and misunderstood.  MCMs are at the heart of many technology changes.  In fact
multichip packaging is at the crossroads of many technologies.
Everyone agrees multichip packaging is the way to achieve the
highest performance and/or density.  IBM has proven that multichip
packaging can leverage the next-level chip integration for applications demanding it sooner than the chip houses can deliver.<P>

The result is a profit-making window unattainable by competition
not using MCM technology.<P>


<b>VALUE OF MULTICHIP PACKAGING STUDY AND FOR WHOM</B><P>

In this venue multichip packaging can make anyone mastering it a
technology leader.  The performance level for multichip packaging
has now dropped to the level of the personal computer.  For
example, Austek Microelectronics has a pluggable replacement to
turn the 286 CPU-based computer into a 486 CPU-based state-of-the-art personal computer.  The result is cost savings to the customer
and profit for the company using MCMs as a solution.<P>

From personal to super-computers, every sector of electronics will
begin using MCMs.  For some applications it will be a viable or
competitive option to other packaging methods; in other application
areas MCMs will be the required packaging technology to survive in
the marketplace.<P>

This BCC report contributes to the advancement of the developing
MCM industry.  The MCM marketplace is dynamic and subject to over-
and underestimation.  The reader will find herein a conservative,
fact-based analysis of multichip modules as an electronic package
from 1993 through 1998.<P>

<b>MARKETING MANAGERS</B><P>

Marketing managers will use this report to assess the competition
and identify customers.<P>

<b>MANAGEMENT CONSULTANTS</B><P>

Management consultants will determine whether companies divest or
invest in MCM technology based, in part, on the market projections
and competition strengths revealed in this report.<P>

<b>EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURERS</B><P>

Equipment manufacturers will develop or modify existing products to
address MCM manufacturing concerns that are emphasized in this
report.<P>

<b>MATERIALS SUPPPLIERS</B><P>

Materials suppliers will implement beta programs with key companies
to strategically place themselves early in the MCM development
cycle, based on the applications projected for growth or high
profit margin found in this report.<P>


<b>VENTURE CAPITAL MANAGERS</B><P>

Venture capital managers will identify target companies for investment, merger, or acquisition from those identified and described in
this report.<P>

<b>STRATEGIC PLANNERS</B><P>

Strategic planners will identify other companies with critical
strengths to strategically partner with so they can share in
overall MCM market growth projected in this report.<P>

<b>SCOPE AND FORMAT</B><P>

This BCC business opportunity report covers with a critical eye the
multichip module marketplace as it really exists.  Future projections take into account actual market growth based on company
revenues and as part of the overall electronic industry.<P>

The format is provided in easy to follow sections that overview the
subject, define the technology, segment the market by manufacturing
technology, method, application and region, profile the companies,
define the terminology, and identify the technical community.<P>

This BCC report is a one-stop source for serious players in the
emerging multichip module industry.<P>

<b>METHODOLOGY</B><P>

Material and data presented in this report were obtained from
personal interviews at the 1993 International Conference and
Exhibition on Multichip Modules, telephone interviews of marketing
and engineering personnel at a majority of the companies profiled,
catalogs obtained from the companies, and a literature search of
1993 articles on MCMs from around the world.<P>

<b>INFORMATION SOURCES</B><P>

Specific sources of multichip module information include the
International Society of Hybrid Microelectronics, authors of
technical papers, company advertisements and technical periodicals.<P>

Competitive marketing reports were considered where applicable.<P>

<B>STUDY GOAL AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>

This study provides a comprehensive assessment of the market
for electronic connector materials as well as an analysis of
the connector industry, its end-use markets, foreign trade
and the connector industry's changing structure.  It provides
a concise look at the individual types of connectors, the
types of materials they use and the future for each connector
type.<P>


<B>REASONS FOR DOING STUDY</B><P>

Electronic connector materials represent an important
industry, both economically and strategically.  Although many
of the materials that are used by the industry find other
end-uses, many have been designed specifically for the
connector industry.  Over the past decade, major changes have
taken place in the connector industry, both technologically
and structurally.  These changes are impacting material
producers in a major way.  With years of effort developing
technologically advanced materials at stake, the time has
come to take a hard look at these changes and how they will
impact the future of electronic connector materials.<P>


<B>CONTRIBUTION OF THE STUDY AND FOR WHOM</B><P>

This study provides a detailed look at the competitive
materials used in the electronic connector market.  It also
examines which materials are noncompetitive and what the
future is for those materials.  By examining each specific
connector type and its end-uses, it becomes clear where the
market is headed for the different connector materials.
Whether you produce ceramic ferrules, plastics for D-
subminiature military connectors, or high-performance
beryllium copper contact materials, this study will provide a
clear outlook for your market.  If you are a connector
manufacturer, this study provides the latest developments for
the industry with realistic, well-balanced forecasts and
conclusions.<P>


<B>SCOPE AND FORMAT</B><P>

The scope of this report is extensive and includes:<P>

<MENU><LI>Connector shipments by type<P>

<LI>Connector end-use markets by type<P>

<LI>Connector imports/exports - plus a worldwide overview of theconnector industry<P>

<LI>Connector materials shipments, including plastics, contactmaterials, ceramics, composites and others<P>

<LI>An examination of the electronic connector industry structure and its trends<P>

<LI>Electronic connector and material company profiles</MENU><P>


All the individual electronic connector types are examined
and detailed in terms of applications, end-use markets and
types of materials used.  All the various connector types,
including rectangular, circular, coaxial, printed circuit
board (PCB), planar, hermetically sealed, fiber optic,
special purpose, connector parts and IC sockets are covered.<P>


The five major connector end-use markets are discussed,
including transportation, communications, military, computer
and others.  Shifts in market share and new end-uses are also
analyzed.  Particular attention is given to the all-important
military market and its impact on the connector industry.<P>

The section on foreign trade provides an overview of some of
the most compelling factors in the connector market -
offshore manufacturing, offshore sourcing and
imports/exports.<P>

Over one-third of the study is dedicated to connector
materials and all the factors shaping and changing the
market. Surface mount technology (SMT), high pin counts
connector designs, miniaturization, multilayered PCBs and
many others are discussed.  Competitive materials are studied
and analyzed b y performance and costs to the manufacturer.<P>

The electronic connector industry structure entered an era of
consolidation during the 1980s.  Changing needs and demands
from OEMs, overcapacity and intense competition have had a
dramatic impact on the industry.  The study reviews all these
issues and pieces together many of the mergers and
acquisitions over the past five years and their impact.<P>

Following the industry structure, more than 30 company
profiles of leading connector and connector material
producers are presented.<P>


<B>METHODOLOGY</B><P>

The conclusions of this report were derived through a number
of independent steps.  The first observations were made by
carefully examining the various connector types and the size
of each market.
For the most part Government data were used.  This
information was used partially to formulate the size of the
end-use markets, the second step.  Certain connector types
appear more frequently in some markets than in others.  Of
course, the trends of the products within the end-use markets
served were also carefully examined.  Estimated sales of
major producers to various markets were also weighed.
Interviews of connector industry spokespeople revealed
similar opinions as to the size of various end-use markets.<P>

The third step involved establishing the different types of
materials used in the connector industry.  Each material,
whether it was a plastic or a contact material, was evaluated
in terms of its individual properties and characteristics
vis-a-vis other materials used in similar applications.  The
materials were also evaluated in terms of new applications
and their consequences on market share.  The size of this
market was developed through government data, industry
interviews and by establishing the types of materials used
most frequently by different connector types and then
comparing the data to the size of each market.<P>

The fourth step was to conscientiously examine what
international factors are having an impact on the electronic
connector market.  Foreign trade, offshore manufacturing and
the overall globalization of the industry were studied and
their impact on U.S. world market share. The structure of the
connector industry was examined along the same lines.  The
electronic connector industry structure has undergone
tremendous changes over the past six years.  A shakeout began
in 1985, and subsequently led to an era of consolidation.
Vendor reduction by OEMs, just-in-time (JIT) manufacturing,
application tooling and other factors have also been steadily
creating major industry changes.  Given all these factors,
forecasts were then developed for the connector markets,
products, foreign trade and, finally, the materials.<P>

The data in this study are reported in current dollars. An
average annual inflation rate of 4 to 5 per cent throughout
the decade should be included when evaluating the forecasts.
While this may be low, it reflects the historical trend of
the past decade.<P>

Many elements were considered when examining the economy, its
future recovery and its impact upon the electronic connector
industry.  Issues included the nation's banking industry
problems, the S&L crisis, the Persian Gulf events, the
country's budget deficit, the balance of trade, the upcoming
free market alliances of Europe and the U.S.-Canadian free-
trade policy.  The impact of a free market economy in the
Soviet Union was given some weight, although when or how this
will develop is very questionable.  The relatively strong
performance of the stock market and the fluctuating dollar
were also analyzed.  Current economic indicators still point
to a very slow recovery from the recession; however, with
many companies reporting less than robust third-quarter
earnings, weak housing sales, and still high unemployment
rates.  Given all these factors, only a moderate recovery is
forecast for 1992.  In the longer term, as the economy begins
to pull away from the damning effects of overspending, etc.,
a strong economic turn-around should be well underway by mid-
1993 and will favorably impact the connector industry growth
rate, sending it above the historical rate.<P>


<B>INFORMATION SOURCES</B><P>

The data for this study were compiled from government
sources, trade associations and extensive interviews of
connector manufacturers and material suppliers.  The U.S.
Department of Commerce was the basis for connector shipment
and import/export data.  Forecasts and market trends were
based on interviews with connector product specialists,
marketing personnel, engineers and others.  Interviews of the
connector material producers were used to estimate shipments
for plastics, contact materials and other materials.
Databases were searched for up-to-date literature, and
related articles were studied.  Along with expert technical
assistance from industry personnel, numerous technical books
on both electronics and materials were used as technical
references.<P>

<B>STUDY GOAL AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>

This BCC report describes the technology, processes, materials, and performance
criteria for state-of-the-art electronics packaging with a view toward future trends, in
order to meet the "slim-fast" requirements of higher speeds and densities, smaller size,
and higher heat.

This BCC industry study presents a detailed analysis of current and future
developments in electronic packaging in micro-electronics.  Electronic packaging is the
dynamic process of physically locating, connecting, and protecting electronic
components.  The packaging of today's electronic equipment has become a major
factor in the design and manufacture of the total system.  The major technologies of
multichip modules, tape automated bonding, and chip-on-board for integrated circuits
are analyzed and market forecasts are revealed by individual materials and equipment
application segments from 1992 through the year 2000.  Case studies of technology
applications as well as worldwide materials market size, growth and usage trends
through the years 2000 are featured.  Additionally, leading suppliers and strategic
partnerships are profiled worldwide.  This unique strategic planning tool will show
suppliers to the industry the paths to business opportunity while end-users will
benefit from knowing about the new products, processes, and their suppliers.<P>



<B>REASONS FOR DOING THE STUDY</B><P>

Until recently, advanced packaging and interconnection systems have been kept from
wider implementation by their high cost, limited supply, lack of standards and testing,
complexity, and lack of an industry infrastructure.  However, the growing demand for
higher performance, faster signal transmission, less energy usage, and ever smaller
systems are breaking down these barriers.  Essentially, three types of interconnection
and packaging are at the leading edge:  tape automated bonding (TAB), chip-on-board
(COB), and multichip modules (MCMs).  These technologies are being devised,
developed and evaluated by the worldwide electronics industry because they offer
solutions to many of the advanced device and electronic packaging challenges relating
to high density, high speed, and high heat of current and future electronic systems.<P>

Significant technological advancements are taking place today, despite the current
worldwide economic recession.<P>

Electronic components with very high functional density and performance
requirements demand unique and innovative approaches which address electrical,
thermal, and mechanical packaging material concerns.  Current indicators show that
electronic semiconductor packaging technology consisting of TAB, COB, and MCM will
be the advanced packaging approached for the 1990s through the 21st century.<P>



<B>CONTRIBUTION OF THE STUDY AND FOR WHOM</B><P>

This BCC report analyzes worldwide trends in advanced systems, packaging, and
interconnection by type and relationship to electronic industry sectors.  Production
trends are highlighted, with industry consumption by material, device, interconnect,
and electronic equipment applications through the year 2000.  Activities of materials
suppliers, components, and electronic equipment suppliers are profiled.<P>

This BCC study provides a thorough analysis of the electronic packaging and device
market and industry, and then provides a comparison of advanced materials and
processes.  The study discusses the global electronic packaging and materials industry
structure, describing activities of the major suppliers in the U.S., Europe, and Asia.
Worldwide material consumption is tabulated and the market forecasts are provided
by type of material through the year 2000.  Case studies and winning strategies are
presented with an eye to the 21st century.<P>

<B>STUDY GOAL AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>

BCC's goal in conducting this study was to determine the current
worldwide status of the market for magnetic and optical storage
media and materials, and to assess the growth potential over a
five-year period from 1991 to 1996.  We were particularly
interested in the changing composition of storage media brought
about by new technology and the effect on materials consumption.
<P>
Our major objective was to present a comprehensive analysis of the
current magnetic and optical storage media and materials industry
and plot its future course.
<P>
<B>REASONS FOR DOING THIS STUDY</B><P>

Over the past decade, advances in technology have changed the
structure of computer- and consumer-oriented storage devices and
media.  Disk storage drives have become smaller while storage
capacity has increased.  The compact disk has replaced the
traditional vinyl long-playing record.  The changing use of storage
products has altered the requirements for materials, particularly
in computer and consumer media.<P>

BCC decided to examine the current position of the materials used
in magnetic and optical media.  We were interested in finding out
what kinds of substrates, coatings, and covers are being used to
meet the demands of a changing environment.<P>

<B>CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE STUDY AND FOR WHOM</B>
<P>
We assembled a study of materials used in three major parts of
storage media: disk and tape substrates, coatings, and protective
covers and devices.  We present a worldwide industry structure,
examine the competitive aspects of the industry, analyze the
current markets, and project shipments for each of the material
categories to 1996.  The study will be of interest to those who
manufacture storage drives, disk and tape media, and the various
materials used in media composition: metals, plastics, glass,
ceramics, magnetic coatings, and thin films.  It will also interest
those who apply coatings.<P>

<B>SCOPE AND FORMAT</B>
<P>
The scope of our study encompasses the drives used for computer and
consumer storage, the various kinds of storage media, and the
materials consumed in the manufacture of media.  We analyze the
major components of media: substrates, coatings, and covers.  We
also analyze the growth potential of the eight major technologies
used for computer and consumer storage: the hard and floppy disk,
tape, and optical computer storage; and the videotape, audio tape,
compact disk, and videodisk.  We present forecasts to 1996.
Technological issues are reviewed.  Other influential factors, such
as past growth and the effects of the economic climate, are also
discussed.<P>

Because this is a worldwide industry, BCC analyzes the domestic and
international regulatory and standards situations and their impact
on the magnetic and optical storage business.  The economic
environment and its effect on the business is also reviewed.  BCC
presents an analysis of the driving forces within the magnetic and
optical storage industry and looks at the impact of these forces
for the future.<P>

Since this study concerns the computer and consumer electronics
industries, we discuss factors effecting both parts of the
business.  Computer products consumption is discussed separately
from consumer demand.<P>

<B>METHODOLOGY</B><P>

BCC presents an analysis of the shipments and value of storage
drives and media by major category.  The value of materials used in
the production of magnetic and optical media is detailed by
function and type.  Our estimated value is what manufacturers and
materials providers have paid in current dollars.  Then, based on
our surveys, we analyze storage applications, calculate an estimate
for growth, and forecast shipments of drives and media and the
value of materials for 1996.<P>

<B>INFORMATION SOURCES</B>
<P>
BCC surveyed approximatey 75 companies to obtain the data for this
report.  Included were manufacturers of disk and tape drives,
videotape equipment, audiotape devices, optical drives and media,
plastic, metals, glass and deposition equipment.  We also included
several trade associations, the U.S. Department of Commerce, and
data from financial and industry sources.<P>

<B>STUDY GOALS AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>

Integrated circuit (IC) designers are in full stride.  It seems that every day 
brings an announcement of a new, more highly integrated device touted as the 
future for all the computing and communication devices anyone will ever need.  
The fury with which these devices are being introduced is being matched by 
software and hardware makers alike, whose responsibility it is to keep these 
devices operating regardless of the temperatures they must endure.<P> 

Thus an expansion of the thermal management marketplace was and is inevitable.  
Only a handful of the players involved have recognized its importance and 
moved to capitalize.  For the most part, the expansion is taking place within 
existing market segments. However, in some cases, brand new markets and 
products have arisen.<P> 

This BCC report presents a detailed analysis of the current and future markets 
for the large variety of thermal management products, from heat sink hardware 
design and materials to the future growth of highly conductive substrate 
material.  The study also addresses the potential impact of the latest design 
and fluid dynamics software available for assessing thermal problems. 
Forecasts are presented that project sales and product evolution through the 
year 2001.<P> 




<B>REASONS FOR DOING THE STUDY</B><P>

The study is presented at this time because of the rapid development of highly 
integrated circuits and modules.  New generations of processors are being 
introduced every 6 to 9 months. Whereas just a few years ago, keeping 
components cool was a relatively simple matter, massive increases in 
integration have complicated the matter.<P> 

Until recently, an optimized IC design revolved around area and performance 
rather than power consumption.  The popularity of portable systems has further 
enhanced the need to design low power chips, not only to ensure that the 
components in these machines can be kept cool, but also to maximize battery 
life.<P>  

Current trends indicate that the markets for virtually all products designed 
for thermal management will continue to grow as the overall electronics 
continues to expand.  In addition, new products and product designs will be 
introduced into the marketplace.<P> 


<B>CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE STUDY AND FOR WHOM</B><P>

The cooling of electronics is a necessary evil, but the industry has been 
largely ignored.  For the most part, solutions are enormously inexpensive, 
reliable, and easy to procure and implement.  However, in recent years, chip 
designers and computer OEMs have been caught unawares by overheating ICs and 
the subsequent breakdown of computer systems.  Thermal issues, and the players 
responsible for them, must now be faced.<P> 

This report provides an analysis of those segments of the electronics industry 
bent on keeping devices cool, from such simple devices as heat sinks and fans, 
to the more complex areas of thermal management software and thermally 
conductive substrates. This work also predicts the future use of liquid 
cooling technologies and evaluates new technologies now under development. The 
major players in the largest sectors of the market are also identified and 
profiled and a patent analysis is offered.<P> 

The work is directed to decision makers in the segments of the electronics 
industry concerned with thermal management issues and markets, as well as 
those of the related electronics packaging and materials fields.  They 
include:<P> 

<UL>
   <LI>Computer and communication device developers

<B>SCOPE AND FORMAT</B><P>

This report is an analytical business tool whose primary purpose is to cover 
the growing portable computer industry in terms of application and end-use 
markets.  A market summary follows this introductory section and is followed 
immediately by an overview of thermal management.  Following this segment is 
an extensive review of the technology, which is then followed by analyses of 
the various market segments involved.  The ensuing segments include a patent 
analysis covering the first half of 1990 and an analysis of the industry's 
structure.  The appendices include an extensive directory of related vendors 
and manufacturers of all types of thermal management-related devices and 
products.<P> 


<B>METHODOLOGY AND INFORMATION SOURCES</B><P>

The material presented is based on information gathered from personal contacts 
with participants within the portable computing industry as well as a thorough 
review of the technology gathered from technical papers and industry 
conferences.  Our final analyses and projections are based on a combination of 
a consensus among the primary contacts with our understanding of the impact of 
trends from a historical perspective.<P> 

Additional data were obtained from extensive reviews of secondary sources.  
These include trade publications, trade associations, company literature, and 
on-line databases.  This was done to supplement our understanding of 
applications, markets, and trends in the portable computing and communications 
industries.  All dollar projections presented in this report are in 1995 
constant dollars.<P>

<B>STUDY GOALS AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>

BCC's goal in conducting this study was to determine the current
status of the market for chemical vapor deposition (CVD)
equipment, services and materials deposited and assess the growth
potential over a five-year period from 1995 to 2000.  We were
particularly interested in the types of equipment and kinds of
materials being used for industrial and consumer applications.<P>

Our major objective was to present a comprehensive analysis of
the current CVD industry and project its future course.<P>

This study is part of a three part service:  GB186A - Thin Layer
Deposition: Highlighting CVD, GB186B - Thin Layer Deposition:
Highlighting PVD, and GB186C - Thin Layer Deposition:  Plasma,
Epitaxial.  Pages 1 through 54 are the same for all reports.<P>


<B>REASONS FOR DOING THIS STUDY</B><P>

CVD has expanded significantly over the past several decades.
More sophisticated manufacturing and fabrication techniques and
miniaturized products have broadened the demand for vapor-
deposited materials.  A variety of new and existing materials
requires properties that can best be delivered by chemically
deposited thin films on a wide variety of surfaces.<P>

BCC decided to examine the current position of CVD technologies
and materials used in key industries.  We were interested in what
materials and types of CVD systems were being used to meet the
demands for more sophisticated products.<P>




<B>CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE STUDY AND FOR WHOM</B><P>

We assembled a study of the types of CVD equipment and materials
used in five major industry groups.  We present an overview of
deposition technologies and future trends, and a worldwide CVD
industry structure including leading manufacturers of equipment
and service providers.  Within each industry segment, we present
an overview of key applications, the advantages of using the CVD
process, analysis of market factors that will impact demand and
project shipments of equipment, materials and services to 2000.
This study will be of interest to those in the microelectronics
business, manufacturers of cutting tools, medical instruments and
devices, and makers of automotive and aerospace products.  It
will also be of interest to companies engaged in the manufacture
of deposition equipment and materials, and to surface coaters.<P>


<B>SCOPE AND FORMAT</B><P>

The scope of this study encompasses CVD technologies and
materials in terms of applications, properties and processes.
BCC analyzes the major types of CVD systems and materials used to
manufacture  products in the five key industries.  The
applications are discussed, as are the properties imparted
through CVD.  Trends in demand for various products are also
reviewed and their impact on the CVD process is discussed.<P>

Market drivers within each industry segment are identified.  The
materials deposited by CVD are analyzed by their basic functions
such as dielectrics, conductors, and resistance to abrasion and
wear.  The value of CVD equipment shipments is projected within
each industry by type of reactor.  Material shipment values are
also projected as are CVD services revenues.  Technological
issues and trends are reviewed and other influential factors such
as economic conditions and standards are discussed.<P>

Because this is a worldwide study, BCC analyzes the domestic and
international technological issues and economic considerations.
BCC also presents an analysis of market factors and examines
their impact on the future.<P>


<B>METHODOLOGY</B><P>

BCC presents an analysis of the values of CVD systems, materials
deposited, and services provided by type of reactor, material and
industry segment.  Our estimated value is what manufacturers and
material providers have paid in current dollars.  Then, based on
our surveys, we analyze industry growth in relation to the growth
of CVD technology, calculate estimates for growth, and forecast
shipments for 2000.<P>



<B>INFORMATION SOURCES</B><P>

BCC surveyed approximately 125 companies to obtain the data for
this report.  Included were manufacturers of CVD equipment,
materials, deposition service providers, industrial and consumer
product manufacturing companies, and various end users of the CVD
process.  Additional data for this report was obtained from
government information, trade associations, industry and
financial sources, and an exhaustive review of technical papers.<P>

<B>STUDY GOALS AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>

BCC's goal in conducting this study was to determine the
current status of the market for physical vapor deposition
(PVD) equipment, services and materials deposited and assess
the growth potential over a five-year period from 1995 to
2000.  We were particularly interested in the types of
equipment and kind of materials being used for industrial
and consumer applications.<P>

Our major objective was to present a comprehensive analysis
of the current PVD industry and project its future course.<P>


<B>REASONS FOR DOING THIS STUDY</B><P>

Physical vapor deposition has expanded significantly over
the past several decades.  More sophisticated manufacturing
and fabrication techniques and miniaturized products have
broadened the demand for vapor deposited materials.  A
variety of new and existing products  require properties
that can best be delivered by vacuum-depositing thin films
on a wide variety of surfaces.<P>



BCC decided to examine the current position of PVD
technologies and materials used in key industries.  We were
interested in what materials and types of PVD systems were
being used to meet the demands for more sophisticated

We assembled a study of the types of PVD equipment and
materials used in seven major industry groups.  We present
an overview of deposition technologies and future trends,
and a worldwide PVD industry structure including leading
manufacturers of equipment and service providers.  Within
each industry, we present an overview of key applications,
the advantages of using PVD deposition, an analysis of
market factors that will impact demand and project shipments
of equipment, materials and services to 2000.  This study
will be of interest to those in the microelectronics
business, manufacturers of cutting tools, specialty
packagers, makers of  storage media, manufacturers of
automotive and aerospace parts, medical device makers, and
those in the optics industry.  It will also be of interest
to companies engaged in the manufacture of deposition
equipment and materials and to surface coaters.<P>

<B>SCOPE AND FORMAT</B><P>

The scope of this study encompasses PVD technologies and
materials in terms of applications, properties and
processes.  BCC analyzes the major types of PVD systems and
materials used to manufacture products in seven key
industries.  The applications are discussed, as are the
properties imparted through physical vapor deposition.
Trends in demand are also reviewed and their impact on PVD
is discussed.<P>

Market drivers within each industry are identified.  The
materials deposited by PVD are analyzed by their basic
functions such as abrasion and wear-resistance, conductors,
and corrosion protection.  The value of PVD equipment
shipments is projected within each industry by type of
system.  Material shipment values are also projected along


with PVD service revenues.  Technological issues and trends
are reviewed and other influential factors such as economic
conditions and standards are discussed.

Because this is a worldwide study, BCC analyzes the domestic
and international technological issues and economic
considerations.  BCC also presents an analysis of market
factors and examines their impact on the future.<P>


<B>METHODOLOGY</B><P>

BCC presents an analysis of the values of PVD systems,
materials deposited, and services provided by type of
system, material and industry segment.  Our estimated value
is what manufacturers and material providers have paid in
current dollars.  Then, based on our surveys, we analyze
industry growth in relation to the growth of PVD technology,
calculate estimates for growth, and forecast shipments for
2000.<P>


<B>INFORMATION SOURCES</B><P>

BCC surveyed approximately 130 companies to obtain the data
for this report.  Included were manufacturers of PVD
equipment, materials, deposition service providers,
industrial and consumer product manufacturing companies, and
various end users of the PVD process.  Additional data for
this report were obtained from government information, trade
associations, industry and financial sources, and an
exhaustive review of technical papers.<P>

<B>STUDY GOALS AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>

BCC's goal in conducting this study was to determine the
current status of the market for implantation and epitaxy
equipment (including plasma, thermal and ion), services and
materials and assess the growth potential over a five-year
period from 1995 to 2000.  We were particularly interested
in the types of equipment and kind of materials being used
for industrial and consumer applications.<P>

Our major objective was to present a comprehensive analysis
of the current implantation and epitaxy market and project
its future course.<P>


<B>REASONS FOR DOING THIS STUDY</B><P>

These technologies have expanded significantly over the past
several decades.  More sophisticated manufacturing and
fabrication techniques and miniaturized products have
broadened the demand for implanted and vapor deposited
materials.  A variety of new and existing products require
properties that can best be delivered by implanting or
vacuum depositing thin films on a wide variety of surfaces.<P>

BCC decided to examine the current position of implantation,
epitaxy and related technologies and materials used in key
industries.  We were interested in what materials and types
of systems were being used to meet the demands for more
sophisticated products.<P>


<B>CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE STUDY AND FOR WHOM</B><P>

We assembled a study of the types of implantation and
epitaxy equipment and materials used in five major industry
groups.  We present an overview of deposition technologies
and future trends, and a worldwide implantation and epitaxy
industry structure including leading manufacturers of
equipment and service providers.  Within each industry, we
present an overview of key applications, the advantages of
using a particular technology, an analysis of market factors
that will impact demand and project shipments of equipment,
materials and services to 2000.  This study will be of
interest to those in the microelectronics business,
manufacturers of machine tools, automotive and aerospace
parts, and medical device makers. It will also be of
interest to companies engaged in the manufacture of
deposition equipment and material and to surface coaters.<P>


<B>SCOPE AND FORMAT</B><P>

The scope of this study encompasses implantation and epitaxy
technologies and materials in terms of applications,
properties and processes.  BCC analyzes the major types of
implantation, epitaxy  and related systems such as plasma
deposition and thermal spray, and materials used to
manufacture products in five key industries.  The
applications are discussed, as are the properties imparted.
Trends in demand are also reviewed and their impact on these
implantation and deposition technologies is discussed.<P>

Market drivers within each industry are identified.  The
materials deposited by implantation and epitaxy are analyzed
by their basic functions such as wear-resistance, thermal
control and lubricity.  The value of implantation and
epitaxy equipment shipments is projected within each
industry by type of system.  Material shipment values are
also projected, along with service revenues.  Technological
issues and trends are reviewed and other influential factors
such as economic conditions and standards are discussed.<P>

Because this is a worldwide study, BCC analyzes the domestic
and international technological issues and economic
considerations.  BCC also presents an analysis of market
factors and examines their impact on the future.<P>


<B>METHODOLOGY</B><P>

BCC presents an analysis of the values of implantation and
epitaxy systems, materials implanted and deposited, and
services provided by type of system, material and industry
segment.  Our estimated value is what manufacturers and
material providers have paid in current dollars.  Then,
based on our surveys, we analyze industry growth in relation
to the growth of implantation and epitaxy technology,
calculate estimates for growth, and forecast shipments for
2000.<P>


<B>INFORMATION SOURCES</B><P>

BCC surveyed approximately 120 companies to obtain the data
for this report.  Included were manufacturers of
implantation, epitaxy and related equipment and materials,
service providers, industrial and consumer product
manufacturing companies, and various end users of the
implantation and deposition process.  Additional data for
this report were obtained from government information, trade
associations, industry and financial sources, and an
exhaustive review of technical papers.<P>

<B>STUDY OBJECTIVES</B><P>

With our society's ever increasing use of energy, it has become
apparent over the past few years that serious consideration must be
given to the influence this has on our environment. Although short-lived crises like the recent Gulf War once again emphasized the
dangers of reliance on imported fossil fuels, the ongoing question
is much broader: Can we afford to go on using energy without paying
attention to the damage that unbridled energy consumption will do
to the environment? Be it acid rain and smog caused by the burning
of fossil fuels, the danger of using radioactive materials, or the
large scale destruction of wildlife and native populations'
habitats by changing the flow of major waterways, it has to be
weighed against the goal of increasing our industrial productivity
as well as our personal comfort.<P>

This report addresses these issues that have come to the forefront
in many discussions in the recent past. While no universal solution
can be offered, various directions can be pointed out, and
technological as well as political solutions can be considered. How
can we balance the seemingly contradictory demands of preserving
and improving our standard of living while at the same time not
destroying the place in which we live.<P>


<B>REASONS FOR DOING THE STUDY</B><P>

In the 19 years following the Arab oil embargo of 1973, the U.S.
annual electric generation has increased by 1 trillion kilowatt
hours. Over the same period, oil and gas generation declined by
almost 200 billion kilowatt hours, meaning that over 1.2 trillion
kilowatt hours of "new" electricity were needed to meet economic
growth and to replace oil and gas fired power. Of that total, 59%
came from coal, 36% from nuclear power, and only 5% from other
sources.<P>

The National Energy Strategy is designed to address several
potentially serious energy-related problems:<P>

<UL>-    Pollution and global warming trends. Evidence is mounting of
     environmental damage caused by acid rain and "greenhouse
     gases."<P>

-    Growing dependence on fossil fuels and consequent vulnerability to supply disruptions - a trend dramatically underscored by
     the Gulf War. U.S. net daily consumption of imported oil will
     reach 10 million barrels a day by the end of the decade,
     according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.<P>

-    A lack of alternatives to fossil fuels. Through the 1980s,
     support for commercialization of alternative energy technologies withered, forcing many developers out of business. At the
     same time, the U.S. nuclear industry suffered a series of
     shocks and has not been able to expand beyond 20% of U.S.
     electricity production.</UL><P>

It is also hoped that the strategy will strengthen U.S. competitiveness by bolstering the country's position in emerging clean
energy technologies that could become the basis of multi billion 
dollar industries as countries expand their efforts to reduce
pollution and greenhouse gases.<P>


<B>CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE STUDY AND FOR WHOM</B><P>

This study pulls together achievements in energy technologies and
efficiencies during the eighties. It analyzes the limits and
opportunities for alternative energy sources for the decade of the
nineties. Based on previous usage patterns and technology developments, we then forecast potential use patterns for the nineties
and, in some cases, beyond. Many scenarios exist for the potential
of alternative energy sources and their ability to replace fossil
fuels, as evidenced by materials published by a variety of
organizations. This report summarizes and compares pertinent
scenarios, and we use the most likely scenario for our own
forecasts. We also take into consideration the role of energy
conservation and efficiency, the amount of energy saved in the past
decade using such technologies, and the likely amount of energy not
needed in this decade with new technologies.<P>

We discuss how fossil energy sources impact the environment, in
terms of global warming as well as habitat protection for wildlife
and indigenous people's traditional way of life, and how the use of
alternative fuels and conservation can contribute greatly in our
efforts to preserve the environment. Lastly, we attempt to quantify
the impact of environmental and socioeconomic factors and
incorporate their cost into the price for the different fuel
sources, to create a more balanced comparison of actual costs.<P>


<B>SCOPE AND FORMAT</B><P>

This study is limited to the role of energy used in non transportation applications. These include residential, commercial, and
industrial use, both as direct use of a resource as well as use of
electricity generated by such resources. The study includes
"traditional" fuels as well as "alternative" fuels and the
contribution of energy conservation and efficiency. Whenever
applicable and possible, forecasts are made for the next 5-10
years, based on historical patterns and the consensus of industry
and government experts. As far as available and applicable, various
scenarios are presented, either for different price assumptions or
different policy assumptions. For the overall overview and
prediction, "middle of the road" scenarios are chosen.<P>

The report is presented in three major sections: Fossil Energy
Sources, Renewable Energy Sources, and Conservation. Within each
section, the role of different energy sources is presented and
their impact on the environment is investigated, both from a
qualitative and a quantitative point of view.<P>


<B>METHODOLOGY</B><P>

In assembling this report, published data from various governmental
and private sources were considered for historical purposes.
Projections were established by BCC taking into consideration
projections made by published sources as well as industry consensus
and external influences such as demographic data and likely
political developments.<P>

In calculating environmental and social costs, a number of sources
were considered. A series of articles published in Contemporary
Policy Issues in July 1990 by the Western Economic Association
International examined the topic of social and private cost of
various energy technologies. Another set of articles relating to
the damage of air pollution to agriculture, fishing, and forestry
was published in the American Journal of Agricultural Economics in
May 1986. We adopted some of their findings and, as necessary,
updated them to current price and cost levels. We expanded on some
of their assumptions, which were too regional in nature, by using
data from the Census Bureau and the U.S. Federal Highway Administration to extrapolate to national levels. An example of this is
the impact of acid rain, which was calculated in the above
publications for the Los Angeles Basin only.<P>

Further data were obtained from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission
(concerning the social cost of nuclear energy) and the U.S.
Government Accounting Office (various publications dealing with the
impact of nuclear and hydro energy), the North American Electric
Reliability Council (concerning hydro energy), the Solar Energy
Research Institute (concerning geothermal and biomass energy), and
the Electric Power Research Institute (concerning biomass energy
and conservation). For potential energy savings through conservation, we also relied on reports and findings published by the Rocky
Mountain Institute.<P>

Using these data, we have attempted to quantify, in as much detail
as possible, the environmental and social cost of the different
energy sources. By adding these expenditures to the actual market
price of the energy category, we thus arrived at actual cost
levels. Further consideration was given to the fact that, in using
fossil fuels for electricity generation, about two-thirds of the
energy input is lost. By factoring in the portion of a given fossil
fuel that is used for electricity generation, we then were able to
calculate the total weighted cost for each energy source.<P>

Given that many of environmental and social costs are difficult to
quantify, these environmental price calculations must, by necessity, be incomplete and can only be considered the best possible
approximation given present information. Nevertheless, this is the
first document that quantifies these costs and provides all the
difficult to gather and analyze data in one place. It is an
indispensable tool for today's energy analyst who must consider
energy planning in the context of environmental and social cost.<P>


<B>INFORMATION SOURCES</B><P>

This study relies heavily on the input provided by experts in the
field as well as on the vast scientific and popular literature that
is available. The topic of energy versus the environment is being
addressed by a variety of interested parties, ranging from the
major oil and gas companies to government agencies and environmentalists. It is the subject of controversies and intense practical
and theoretical research. We have attempted to incorporate the
latest thinking on the subject and are grateful for the input of
all those contacted. Data were provided by the U.S. Energy
Information Administration and the U.S. Department of Energy and
its various agencies as well as independent research associations,
trade associations and environmental groups.<P>

<B>STUDY GOAL AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>

BCC's goal in conducting this study was to determine the current
worldwide status of solar thermal and photovoltaic energy and
conventional solar hot water heating and assess their growth
potential over a 6 year period from 1994 to 2000.  We were
particularly interested in the kinds of equipment being used for
each technology and their costs relative to the more conventional
sources of energy.<P>  

Our major objective was to present a comprehensive analysis of
the current solar energy markets and project their future
direction.<P>


<B>REASONS FOR DOING THIS STUDY</B><P>

Concerted efforts to develop solar energy began during the oil
shortages of the 1970s.  When oil prices stabilized, however,
major incentives to use solar systems, such as investment and tax
credits, abated and government funding for research was reduced. 
Despite these changes, development efforts, especially in
photovoltaics, continued.  In the 1990s, R&D funding and industry
activity has increased and solar energy again offers promise for
the future.<P>  

BCC examined the solar industry in 1990 (Report E-036R "Solar
Thermal and Photovoltaics: World Growth Markets) and projected
its growth to 1995.  We were interested in looking at the
industry again, analyzing the key competitive factors, and
looking at its growth prospects to the end of the decade.<P>  


<B>CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE STUDY AND FOR WHOM</B><P>

We assembled a study of the three major types of solar energy. 
We present the industry structure, current and emerging
technologies, market factors, key applications, and then project
shipments of solar energy systems for 1994, 1995 and 2000.  We
present forecasts of photovoltaic modules, solar thermal energy
and industrial systems, and solar water heating equipment.  This
study will be of interest to those who make solar energy and
heating products and related materials, semiconductors, thin
films, electrical devices, and deposition equipment.  It will
also interest utility companies, construction firms, and
companies involved in large scale manufacturing.<P>


<B>SCOPE AND FORMAT</B><P>

The scope of this study encompasses the three major types of
solar energy systems in use: photovoltaic modules, solar thermal
generating systems, and solar hot water heating equipment.  BCC
analyzes each technology, assesses its current market status,
examines its impact on future markets, and presents projections
of growth over a 6 year period.  Various technological issues,
such as new kinds of materials, are discussed.  A thorough
economic analysis of each technology and its impact on future
growth is also presented.<P>  

BCC analyzes the industry on a worldwide basis, including
manufacturing capability, consumption and shipping activity.  We
examine government support, industry activities and standards in
the major regions of the world.  We also discuss the utility
grid-connected and stand-alone potential of the electric
generating capability of photovoltaics and solar thermal
technology.<P>  

Projections of shipments by technology and applications are
presented for each of the three solar systems.  A discussion of
thin films for photovoltaics is included in that market section.<P>


<B>METHODOLOGY</B><P>

BCC presents an analysis, by each solar technology, of the number
of systems shipped in 1994.  Our estimated value is what
manufacturers have paid in undepreciated dollars.  Then, based on
our surveys, we analyze the potential market for each technology,
and forecast shipments for 1995 and 2000.<P>  

We also analyze the costs involved in each kind of solar system
and present an estimated value of shipments for each technology
over the forecast period.<P>


<B>INFORMATION SOURCES</B><P>

BCC surveyed approximately 100 companies to obtain data for this
study.  Included were manufacturers of photovoltaic cells,
modules, arrays and supporting equipment, makers of solar thermal
collectors  for high temperature generating systems and low-to-medium water
 heating systems, manufacturers of structuralequipment and related materials.
We also spoke with companiesspecializing in deposition of thin films.  In addition,
wecompiled data from current financial and trade information and government
sources.<P>

<B>STUDY GOALS AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>

This report provides a detailed and comprehensive multi-client study of the
U.S. market for alternative transportation fuels and potential business
opportunities.  The document includes a thorough coverage of the underlying
social, political, economic, energy, and environmental issues driving the
alternative transportation fuels business, as well as assessments of new and
potential fuels.  Furthermore, the study provides realistic market data and
forecasts for alternatively fueled vehicles (AFVs) and related technologies.<P>


<B>REASONS FOR DOING THE STUDY</B><P>

During the past five years there has been growing concern about the
environment in the United States.  This has manifested itself in the emergence
of Green political initiatives and an expanding number of environmental
standards, air emission targets, and regulations.  For the alternative fuels
business, the most important of these have been the Clean Air Act Amendments
of 1990 and the Energy Policy Act of 1992.  Recent directions in the
legislative and regulatory arena indicate that environmental and energy
conservation pressures--despite the recession--remain important to the
public and legislators.   Lately this has manifested itself in the
Administration's proposed but failed Btu tax.  It is assumed that these
pressures will intensify in the years to come, engendering further changes in
the alternative transportation fuels business.<P>


<B>SCOPE AND FORMAT</B><P>

The alternative transportation fuels industry is not a precisely defined
sector and has not yet been assigned in any of the major economic
classification codes or activities.  As used in this report, alternative
transportation fuels are those fuels developed as alternatives to the
traditional fuels -- gasoline and diesel fuel -- used in automobiles, light
trucks, vans, other trucks, and buses.  Included are ethanol, methanol,
liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), compressed natural gas (CNG), and other fuels,
in addition to electric propulsion systems for motor vehicles.  The report
also includes reformulated gasoline (RFG) and certain additives used in
gasoline to reduce air emissions.  This includes oxygenates such as methyl-tertiary-butyl-ether (MTBE) and various alcohols, among others.   Many of
these fuels are used in other non-fuel purposes such as the catalytic vapor
phase oxidation of methanol into formaldehyde.  Revenues associated with
these other non-fuel uses are not included within the scope of this report.
Other non-motor vehicle modes of transportation--rail, air, inland
waterways, marine, etc.) are also not included within the scope of this
report.<P>

It should be pointed out that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and
the Energy Information Administration (EIA) of the Dept. of Energy (DOE)
have recently initiated efforts to develop statistical reporting programs in
the area of alternative fuels and alternatively fueled vehicles.<P>

The scope of this report is comprehensive, covering the present status of, and
future prospects for alternative transportation fuels in the U.S.
It covers the many issues concerning the merits and future prospects of the
alternative fuels business, including alternatively fueled vehicles (AFVs) and
the numerous sociopolitical, economic, energy, and environmental issues that
so many regard as critical to the industry's current state of change.  The
report provides a review of the alternative transportation fuels industry, its
structure and the many companies involved in supplying these products.   The
competitive position of the main players in the market and the strategic
options they face are also discussed, as well as such competitive factors as
marketing, technology, distribution, and operations.  The report also looks at
the varieties of basic research, product development, and commercialization
that are being conducted in the area of alternative transportation fuels
technology.  The report also examines the state of alternatively fueled
vehicle (AFV) technology, markets, and industry structure.<P>

Unless noted otherwise, all figures represent the consumption of these
transportation fuels (and additives) in either millions of gallons or barrels per day.  The value of consumption (or revenues) for alternative fuels--in millions of U.S. dollars--represents the value of the product sold for motor vehicle fuel purposes.  This value reflects the net sales price, f.o.b. plant or refinery, to the distributor/marketer of the fuel, net of discounts, allowances, and freight charges.  The value of intracompany transfers (e.g. MTBE at an oil refinery) is also included.  For the value of reformulated gasolines (RFG), the value of oxygenates is excluded to eliminate duplication.  As a result, figures associated with RFG represent their processing value.<P>

As used in this study, the term consumption is equivalent to, and used
interchangeably with, the terms demand and sales.  During the discussion of the individual market segments, consumption of fuels (and to a lesser extent revenues) are related to indicators in the tables that are used for comparative purposes.  They do not imply that the indicator used represents the sole market for that product.  In addition, the sum of individual components within a column of a table may not agree with the reported sum at
the top of the table due to independent rounding of the components.<P>

All growth rates mentioned in the tables and in the text are based on the
average annual rate of growth from 1993 through 1998 or from 1998 to the year
2003.  The compounding method of calculating growth rates is used.  Because
current dollar  measures are used in reporting revenues, these growth rates
thus reflect the growth in volume or real growth in addition to growth
including the effects of price changes and changes in product mix.  The
effects of inflation are eliminated by presenting unit consumption data or by
the use of price indexes to provide measures of real growth.<P>




<B>CONTRIBUTION OF THE STUDY</B><P>

This study provides the most complete accounting of ongoing alternative
transportation fuel developments in the United States currently available in a
multi-client format.  The study also provides extensive quantification of the
many important facets of market developments in the United States for
alternative transportation fuels, vehicles, and technologies.  This, in turn,
contributes to the determination of what kind of strategic response companies
may adopt in order to compete in this dynamic market.<P>


<B>INFORMATION SOURCES</B><P>

Initially, a comprehensive and exhaustive search of the literature on
alternative transportation fuel technology was conducted.  These secondary
sources included technical journals, technical books, marketing literature,
other product/promotional literature, annual reports, security analyst
reports, and other publications.  In addition, there were formal and informal
interviews with oil refiners, chemical additive producers, light vehicle
manufacturers, technical experts, government officials, trade association
officials, and personnel of the companies themselves.<P>

<B>STUDY GOAL AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>

The accelerated highways and bridges building programs of the 1960s and 1970s
enabled the nation to build a transportation infrastructure that covers most of its
needs.  While the nation is not in a crying need for more new roads, the need to
maintain them has assumed crisis proportions.  One way or the other highways and
bridges will have to be maintained and business opportunities for suppliers of all sorts
will evolve.<P>

The roads and bridges built in the 1960s and 1970s were not designed to
accommodate 18-wheeler rigs and high volumes of business and pleasure traffic.  They
are breaking down at alarming rates and maintaining them to current and projected
future traffic has assumed very high importance.<P>

Our goal in conducting this study is to evaluate the developments that are the results
of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA) of 1991 affecting the
highways and bridges construction and maintenance industry.  This report details the
extent of the allotments by type that will be made available to the industry in order
to effect the greatest highway remodeling program in history.  While the overall
funds made available from the act will reach $131 billion between 1992 through 1997,
not all of it will translate into business opportunities.  This report focuses on the
seven programs that will result in direct business opportunities, and details how much
will be spent, the types of projects, regions, usage patterns and the most active states
under each program.<P>

This is the first part of a three-part study that examines the impact of ISTEA on
business and the raw materials used in the industry.  It examines the overall effect
of ISTEA programs on the highways and bridges construction and maintenance
industries, and the type of work and the states that offer most opportunities.  Part
2  examines the opportunities available for the suppliers of asphalt and Portland
cement under the appropriate ISTEA programs.  Part 3 examines the market
potentials for the vendors of other raw materials used in the industry.<P>



<B>REASONS FOR DOING THIS STUDY</B><P>

This study measures growth prospects and  direct business possibilities that are
generated by the programs that have been instituted under ISTEA.  Our analyst was
made aware of the difference between the direct and indirect business opportunities
that may result because of ISTEA.  While the overall allotments under ISTEA will
amount to about $131 billion between 1992-1997, a considerable portion of that will
be spent to cover research, experimentation and administrative costs.  Thus, the real
or direct business opportunities will be in some areas only, and our goal is to analyze
the programs that are most attractive for the industry.  This study is a sequel to the
previous studies on the needs of highways and bridges.<P>



<B>CONTRIBUTION FOR THIS STUDY AND FOR WHOM</B><P>

This analysis is based on information carefully generated from interviews with
industry experts, officials of the federal and state agencies, data excerpted from replies
to the questionnaires mailed to industry specialists and other informed individuals,
and analysis of a wide variety of information generated by the industry press and
technology journals. Additionally, select industry experts were approached more than
once to clarify several related issues.<P>

Information was generated from vendors as well as DOTs, and matched to produce
estimates of the most viable areas of business opportunities.  A consensus was
developed to focus on the usage patterns, regional division and most active states in
each category of programs introduced under ISTEA.<P>


<B>SCOPE AND FORMAT</B><P>

This document covers seven ISTEA programs, which are considered the most
attractive areas for business opportunities.  Each program is analyzed, focusing on
the regions, states and usage patterns.<P>


<B>METHODOLOGY</B><P>

BCC presents an analysis, by each program, focusing both on the overall
opportunities, as well as opportunities by region, top 10 states and usage patterns as
appropriate.<P>

Each projection was based on current industry statistics, opinions from industry
experts, and an analysis of information available from several industry sources.<P>

 Where applicable we have taken a general average of the projections provided by
various industry sources and have matched them with the volume of current business
reported from federal, state and trade agencies.<P>


<B>INFORMATION SOURCES</B><P>

BCC has surveyed over 100 sources to obtain data for this study.  These included
federal highway administration agencies, state DOTs, consultants and others.  Major
industry publications, reports from the FHWA and other federal and state agencies,
industry associations and major financial publications were also consulted.<P>

<B>STUDY GOAL AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>

Our goal in conducting this study is to evaluate the results of the
developments of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA)
of 1991 on the use of Portland cement and asphalt in the highways and bridges
construction and maintenance industry.<P>

This is the second part of a three-part study that examines the impact of
ISTEA on the business and raw materials used in the industry.  Part 1 examines
the overall effect of ISTEA programs on the highways and bridges construction
and maintenance industries and the type of work and the states that offer most
opportunities.  Part 2 (this study) examines the opportunities available for
the suppliers of asphalt and Portland cement under the appropriate ISTEA
programs.  Part 3 examines the market potentials for the vendors of other raw
materials used in the industry.<P>


<B>REASONS FOR DOING THIS STUDY</B><P>

This study was undertaken to measure growth prospects and direct business
possibilities that are generated for the suppliers of Portland cement and
asphalt by the programs that have been instituted under the ISTEA.  Our
analyst was made aware of the difference between the direct and indirect
business opportunities that may result because of the ISTEA.  While the
overall allotments under the ISTEA amount to about $131 billion between 1992
and 1997, a considerable portion of that will be spent to cover research,
experimentation, and administrative costs.  Thus, the real or direct business
opportunities for the suppliers of Portland cement and asphalt will be
focussed in some areas, and our goal is to analyze the programs that are most
attractive for the two industries.<P>


<B>CONTRIBUTION FOR THIS STUDY AND FROM WHOM</B><P>

This study is based on information carefully generated from interviews with
industry experts, officials of the Federal and State agencies, data excerpted
from replies to the questionnaires mailed to industry specialists and other
informed individuals, and analysis of a wide variety of information generated
by the industry press and technology journals. Additionally, select industry
experts were approached more than once to clarify several related issues.<P>

Information was generated from vendors as well as DOTs and matched to produce
estimates of the most viable areas of business opportunities.  A consensus was
developed to focus on the usage patterns, regional division, and most active
states in each category of programs introduced under the ISTEA.<P>


<B>SCOPE AND FORMAT</B><P>

This study covers the projected use of Portland cement and asphalt under
programs instituted by the ISTEA which are considered the most attractive
areas for business opportunities for the respective industries. Each program
is analyzed, focussing on the regions, states and usage patterns that offer
the most opportunities for asphalt and Portland cement industries.<P>


<B>METHODOLOGY</B><P>

BCC presents an analysis, by each program, focussing on the overall
opportunities, as well as opportunities by region, top ten states, and usage
patterns, as appropriate for the suppliers of asphalt and Portland cement.<P>

Each projection was based on current industry statistics, opinions from industry
experts, and analysis of information available from several industry sources.<P>

Where applicable we have taken a general average of the projections provided
by various industry sources and have matched them with the volume of current
business reported from Federal, State, and trade agencies.<P>


<B>INFORMATION SOURCES</B><P>

BCC has surveyed over 100 sources to obtain data for this study.  These
included Federal highway administration agencies, State DOTs, consultants, and
others.  Major industry publications, reports from the FHWA and other Federal
and State agencies, industry associations, and major financial publications
were also consulted.<P>

<H3><I>INTRODUCTION</I></H3>
</CENTER>

Business Communications Company has monitored the electric generation industry
for many years.  Many people consider electric generation and electric
utilities as synonymous terms for this industry.  This report, however,
directs our attention to a newly emerging and rapidly growing segment of this
industry -- the nonutility generator (NUGs).<P>


<B>STUDY GOAL AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>

The nonutility generating industry began in the early 1900's.  Manufacturing
firms built their own facilities to supply electricity, as the supply of
electricity from utilities was undependable and often unavailable.  The wide
ranging electric grid system existing today was not in place 90 years ago.<P>

The utility business grew rapidly during the intervening years until the
energy crisis of the 1970's.  Nonutility generating companies existed during
this time but supplied an insignificant quantity of electricity to the
industry.  Nonutility generating facilities began to increase with the passage
of the Public Utilities Regulatory Policy Act of 1978 (PURPA).  This
legislation provided strong incentives for the nonutility field to expand.<P>

Since the late '70's, nonutilities have played an increasingly important role
in meeting this nation's energy requirements.  As of 1993 it is estimated that
NUGs represent some seven % of all installed capacity.  This segment of the
electric generation industry provides a low cost supply of electrical energy
to their captive users and the electrical grid.<P>

Nonutility generating facilities are comprised of a wide variety of
technologies.  Some are as conventional as coal- or gas-fired boilers which
generate steam to drive generators or turbines.  Other technologies, like
solar energy and wind power are still in developmental stages.  Finally, new
fuel sources like biomass or municipal solid waste are becoming more popular
as an answer to environmental problems.<P>

The future growth of NUGs depends upon their continued ability to provide low
cost electricity in a timely fashion, and with low capital costs relative to
electrical utilities. How will the nonutility business fare in the last decade
of the 20th century and the first decade of the 21st?  Are there new
technologies on the horizon?  Which of the existing technologies will grow
rapidly in the next ten years?  These are some of the issues that are
addressed in this comprehensive analysis of the inter-technology competition
and evolving industry dynamics in the nonutility segment of the electric
generation industry.<P>

The objectives of this study include the determination and examination of:<P>

<UL>
<LI>the overall size of the nonutility field in units, dollars, and number of
         facilities;<BR>

<LI>the growth potential for the industry during the next ten years in total  and by segment;<BR>

<LI>the industry structure;<BR>

<LI>the opportunities for suppliers of equipment to this industry;<BR>

<LI>the importance of environmental and legislative issues to the future growth of this industry and its segments;<BR>

<LI>the significant trends affecting the future demand for power generated by
         nonutilities.</UL><P>


<B>REASONS FOR DOING THIS STUDY</B><P>

The reason for examining the nonutility field is to assess an industry which
enjoyed a successful growth record up to the 1930's and then declined until
the late '70's.  Since then, with the help of congressional legislation, the
industry has accelerated from next to nothing in size until today where it is
a major supplier of electricity.  The questions of concern are:<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>"Can the industry maintain the established pace of the last several years?"<P>

     "What will the future bring?"<P>

     ". . . for energy technology?"<P>

     ". . . for each geographical segments of the country?"<P>

     "What are the important market niches, if any?"</BLOCKQUOTE><P>

<B>CONTRIBUTION OF THE STUDY AND FOR WHOM</B><P>

This study is intended to serve persons involved in the nonutility field in
their continual assessment of evolving industry technology changes, growth
prospects by sub-markets, and legislative activities.  It is also intended to
guide decision makers about the choices of technology and locations for
nonutilities in the future.<P>

The study provides insights into the coal, natural gas, wind, etc. segments on
such issues as future growth, major producers, and new technology.

The study is intended for nonutility owners interested in determining how
their facilities fit into the industry and learning what may happen to their
segment in the next ten years.<P>

Suppliers to the nonutility industry will find this report helpful in
determining the potential market size for their products, whether they be
machinery or raw materials. Also data are presented on a state by state basis
which is helpful in allocating sales effort and locating customers.

Investors in nonutilities will find this report useful in understanding the
requirements for investment in a nonutility and the legal basis for a
nonutility's existence whether it is a wind farm, solar facility, or coal
fired generator.<P>

<B>SCOPE AND FORMAT</B><P>

This report describes the nonutility generating portion of the electric
generation industry. The industry is made up of two segments defined by
various laws.  The electric utilities, the major segment but slowest growing,
are those companies allowed to sell electricity via the electrical grid to
industrial, commercial, and residential customers.  They are subject to a wide
variety of regulations of which the most widely known are the limitations and
procedures for changing the price of electricity through appeals to various
utility commissions.<P>

Nonutility generating firms may only sell electricity to an electric utility.
Their pricing structure is usually based on open market negotiations with the
buyer.  Buyers, however, must purchase electricity from a nonutility at
"avoided cost" or market negotiated higher price.<P>

The report includes domestic data on the United States only.

The report begins with an overview of the nonutility industry showing units,
dollars, and prices.  It then moves on to issues of industry size and
importance.  Characteristics of nonutilities are described to help the reader
understand the various industry segments. The report concludes with an
examination of industry participants and future growth rates.<P>

<B>METHODOLOGY</B><P>

The research methodology used a combination of telephone interviews with key
industry personnel and experts and a careful search of published data from the
Energy Information Administration, Department of Energy, Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission, and other government sources.  The number of people
contacted is shown in the table below.<P>

<B>INFORMATION SOURCES</B><P>

Information sources included industry experts, trade associations, and key
personnel at nonutilities themselves.  In addition, information was obtained
from government and trade association data where available.  Sources are
footnoted throughout the report.<P>



<B>MANAGEMENT SUMMARY</B><P>

1.  In 1993, the nonutility industry will have gross revenues of $10 billion
    from the sale of electricity to electric utilities.  This is an increase
    of 18.9 % per year from the 1988 figure of $4.2 billion dollars.
    Electricity sold to utilities was 165 billion kWh (Kilowatthours) in 1993,
    up 18.4 % per year from 1988's figure of 71 billion kWh.<P>

    By the year 2003, the industry is expected to have a gross revenue
    of $18.3 billion on sales of 280 billion kWh to electric utilities.
    The growth in dollars is expected to parallel the growth in kWh as

    Electricity sold by NUGs to utilities in 2003 will represent 7.7 % of the
    total available for sale to industrial, residential, and commercial users
    of electricity. This percentage is 3.2 times greater than the figure for
    1988 of 2.4 %.  From 1988 NUG sales of electricity will increase more than
    five  percentage points in 15 years.<P>

2.  All the electricity generated by NUGs makes up a significant portion of the
    nation's electrical energy supply.   In 1993, NUGs generated 286 billion
    kWh of electricity which represented 9 % of the total.  This percentage
    will increase to 13.0 % of the total by 2003.  Total electricity generated
    by NUGs will be 473 billion kWh in 2003.<P>

2.  Tables B  and C above and D below clearly show a slower growth rate for
    NUGs in the next ten years than in the previous five years.  The demand for
    electricity is expected to slow because the commercial, residential, and
    industrial sectors of the economy are becoming more efficient in the use
    of electrical energy.  Industrial development, a major consumer of
    electricity, is expected to slow further in the decade ahead.  NUGs will
    grow faster than electrical utilities as those utilities will
    use nonutilities as a convenient and inexpensive energy source.<P>

3.  Industry capacity to reach 92 gigawatts by 2003, a gain of about five %
    per year from 1993.  This is a decrease in growth from the 10.2% seen for
    the 1989 to 1993 period as shown in table D below.<P>

    Summary table E on the next page provides information on changes in NUG
    capacity during the next decade.   NUG capacity will increase by 15.3
    gigawatts during the next five years.  This capacity increase represents
    more than 25% of all planned capacity increases during the next five years.<P>

    Almost 90% of all capacity additions from 1993 to 1998 are forecast to be
    cogeneration facilities .  NUG cogeneration capacity will reach 58.7
    gigawatts by 1998.  The percentage of capacity that is cogeneration will
    be 82.7% in 1998 up from 80.8% in 1993.<P>

    Non-renewable fuels will continue to be the major energy source for NUGs
    in the next decade.  About 70% of the NUG capacity is and will continue to
    be driven by non-renewable fuel sources.</PRE><P>

4.  Non-renewable energy sources represent the major portion of industry
    capacity. The capacity of natural gas-fired facilities will continue to
    grow at a 7% pace throughout the next decade.  This will be the
    fastest growth in this segment. Natural gas units will continue to be
    installed because of the ease of using gas and little environmental
    problems.<P>

    In the renewable fuel area, waste fired capacity will grow 8% per
    year during the next decade.  While this is the fastest growing type in
    this segment, wind-powered facilities are also expected to grow at similar
    rates.<P>

    Wind-powered capacity will increase 7.5% per year for the next decade.
    These facilities will benefit from new technology using lower profile wind
    generators. Wood-, hydro-, geothermal-, and solar-fired facilities will
    increase less rapidly.<P>

    Waste-fired facilities will continue to grow as the nation seeks
    alternative methods to dispose of municipal solid waste.<P>

5.  The industry has approximately 3,400 separate facilities in 1993.  This is
    an increase of 8.7% per year from 1989's figure of 2,414 facilities.  The
    number of facilities will grow at a slower rate in the future because of
    the prediction that larger nonutilities will be constructed.  These larger
    units are more efficient and reflect the profitability of nonutilities as
    an attractive investment opportunity.<P>

    By the year 2003, an estimated 5,400 nonutilities will be generating
    electricity to meet the nation's slowly growing electrical demand.<P>

6.  This report understates the importance of utilities in sales dollars in the
    U. S. economy.  For example, nonutilities generated 286 billion kWh of
    electricity in 1993.  Only a portion of this amount, 165 billion kWh, was
    actually sold to electric utilities.  The remainder was used to power
    captive facilities at  nonutility plant sites.  In addition, many
    nonutilities are cogeneration facilities.  Information
    on the economic value of this energy stream is not available.<P>

7.  Coal, natural gas, and biomass facilities can be located in any part of
    the country. Hydro-electric facilities can be placed anywhere there is
    water with a sufficient flow rate.  Wind and solar facilities have
    generally been limited to the West South Central, Pacific, and Mountain
    states, to take advantage of the abundant sunshine and natural wind
    patterns.  Geothermal facilities have also been concentrated in
    these three regions to take advantage of the readily available thermal
    energy from below the earth surface.<P>

8.  The price for electricity sold by nonutilities to utilities varies
    considerably by geographic region but averaged 6.1 cents per kWh in 1993.
    This average price is expected to increase only 0.7% per year to 6.5 cents
    per kWh by 2003.  This estimate reflects the slow growth of electrical
    demand and expected increased competition from nonutilities as they seek
    long term contracts from electrical utilities.<P>

    Regionally, the highest prices received by nonutilities are in the New
    England and Pacific region states.  Prices are estimated to be some 15 to
    20% above the national average.  The lowest prices were found in the
    Mountain states at 3 cents per kWh.  These low prices reflect a lack of
    need for additional electrical power
    and utilities being willing to pay only at "avoided-cost."<P>

9.  The West South Central region is the largest in terms of 1993 generating
    capacity. The total for this region is 14.1 gigawatts.  Next in order is
    the Pacific region with 12.6 gigawatts.  The South Atlantic region is
    third with about 8.4 gigawatts of capacity.  These three regions account
    for about two- thirds of all nonutility capacity.<P>

10. Major legislative acts affecting the nonutility industry include:

<UL>. Public Utility Regulatory Policy Act of 1978 (PURPA), which established
         the nonutility category<P>

 .      Electric Consumers Protection Act of 1986, which provides safeguards for
         fish and wildlife affected by hydro facilities<P>

 .      Clean Water Act which addresses the issue of hydro modification<P>

 .      Clean Air Act Phase I and Phase II, whose objective is to reduce sulfur
         dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions<P>

 .      Energy Policy Act of 1982, which provided tax credits for wind,
        closed-loop biomass, solar, and geothermal facilities<P>

 .      Energy tax proposed at the time of this report<P>

<B>STUDY GOALS AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>

The goals and objectives of this study include a discussion of the background
of fuel cells and how they have been important in the past. This will
introduce the reader to the history of fuel cells, the various types of fuel
cells, and their applications. The study will review the past successful and
unsuccessful uses of fuel cells in various industries.<P>


The study will also look at the technology and use of fuel cells today, the
companies involved in the research and applications, from both a domestic and
international viewpoint, and the reasons for their interest in fuel cells.

The ultimate objective of this study is to reveal the potential for growth of
the fuel cell "industry" and to provide the reader with the information needed
for investment decisions.<P>

<B>REASONS FOR THE STUDY</B><P>

To date, BCC has produced articles in newsletters regarding fuel cells;
however, no full report has yet been published.  This study will attempt to
bring together all current information, from primary and secondary sources,
regarding fuel cells.<P>


<B>SCOPE OF THE REPORT</B><P>

The scope of this report is the subject of fuel cells, their past
applications, future marketability in the United States and in other parts of
the world, concentrating, on Japan and Europe.<P>


<B>METHODOLOGY AND INFORMATION SOURCES</B><P>

The methodology for the study includes an examination of all current
literature for fuel cells, including patents, technical journals, business
journals, BCC's Battery and EV Technology newsletter, and other industry
literature. In addition, certain individuals working in the industry were
interviewed. Future trends as well as current research are discussed. All
resulting information is contained in the study in a manner useful to the
potential investor.<P>

A "value" is assigned to each type of fuel cell and is further categorized by
market segment and application. The value assigned represents the total amount
of dollars exchanging hands, and in most cases is funded research and
development dollars. Since the industry is in the early stages of
commercialization, future sales estimates are not readily available. Budgets
for spending are available. The methodology for determining value is to
consider published spending estimates, verified through conversations with
certain industry experts, and reference to "Value Line" for related industry
information.<P>

<B>STUDY GOALS AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>

This technical/marketing study serves to familiarize the reader with the 
background and development of fuel cells, the various classifications of fuel 
cells, and their applications.  This report focuses on the five main fuel cell 
types: alkaline, molten carbonate, phosphoric acid, solid oxide and the proton 
exchange membrane (or solid polymer) fuel cell.  The ultimate objective of the 
study is to reveal the potential growth of the fuel cell industry and to provide 
the reader with the information needed for investment decisions.<P> 


<B>REASONS FOR DOING THE STUDY</B><P>

Researchers in university and government labs, as well as commercial 
businesses, continue to explore, develop and improve upon the processes and 
technologies needed to make the fuel cell a reliable and cost-effective 
alternative power source. The need for renewable, environmentally friendly 
energy sources is becoming ever more important in today's growing world. 
This BCC technical/marketing study provides an in-depth  analysis of  fuel 
cell technology and its changing role in the power generation market.<P> 



<B>SCOPE OF THE REPORT</B><P>

This technical/marketing report evaluates the progress, problems, products, 
players, and the future of the fuel cell as an investment.  This report 
discusses the technology and the advantages and disadvantages of each of 
the five main fuel cell types. In addition, this report looks at the proof-of-
concept phase that the fuel cell is currently in and the challenges these fuel 
cells must overcome in order to become marketable. The report also analyzes 
the global markets for the different fuel cell types, specifically in military, 
government, transportation, on-site-power and utilities. Finally, this report 
covers the major players currently investing in the future of the fuel cell. 
This covers not only government support, but companies that are currently 
developing and manufacturing fuel cells and components for fuel cells.<P>


<B>METHODOLOGY</B><P>

The methodologies employed in this study include a comprehensive review of 
current research information, including patent information, company press 
releases, government analysis and statistics, and information from BCC 
internal files and a number of monthly newsletters relevant to the field of 
fuel cells. This information, along with some historical data, forms the 
foundation of this report. Interviews with company representatives and 
industry experts have also been included. By compiling and evaluating this 
information, BCC, Inc. has made an assessment of the marketability of the 
fuel cell and its future in the power production market.<P> 

Values that are given for these processes are generally based on the best 
estimates from those involved in the commercialization of the technology. 
These values reflect only the current small U.S. sales figures; however, this 
report makes some reference to the world markets in cases where those 
markets exert substantial influence on the U.S. market sector. Projections for 
the 1996-2000 time period are given in 1995 constant dollars and represent 
real growth. Where precise information was not available, a consensus was 
made, using a formulation of reasonable assumptions and estimates based on 
a baseline obtained from historical data.<P> 


<B>VALUE OF THE REPORT</B><P>

This report compiles a range of industrial and technical information into a 
comprehensive technical/marketing study that should aid investors in 
deciding the investment potential of the fuel cell.  It should be of value to 
companies interested in entering or expanding their involvement in the technologies involved with fuel cells.  This report should also interest those 
companies that wish to keep up with the breakthroughs and improvements 
going on with fuel cells.  It provides market projections for those interested in 
commercialization opportunities., including senior marketing specialists, 
venture capitalists and executive planners.  As for the novice reader who 
desires to understand how environmental and market pressures and 
technology interact in the development of the fuel cell, this report should be a 
key source.<P>

<B>STUDY GOALS AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>


The goal of this report is to provide an analysis of the pertinent
technical and economic forces within the energy-saving devices
industry and to provide market forecasts for each of the separate
technologies involved.  Important statistical and analytical
information will be provided for markets, applications, industry
structure, major players, industry dynamics and technology
developments.<P>


<b>CONTRIBUTION OF THE STUDY</B><P> 

This guide to the energy-saving devices industry is designed to
benefit those companies already involved in the business either as
users or as providers, or companies contemplating entering the
business.  The study focuses on the U.S. business.  This study
offers trends in energy-saving devices and identifies the current
players and their major products and contributions within the
context of the entire market.  Specifically, the present and future
markets for energy-saving lighting products, appliances, HVAC
products and systems monitoring and control technologies, windows
technologies and motor technologies are evaluated.<P>


<b>METHODOLOGY</B><P> 

Market forecasts are made for the energy-saving devices discussed
in this report for a 10-year period.  Analysis covers the market
for the United States, and projections are in terms of constant
dollars.  Historical values are for the year given.  Sales figures
and forecasts are not available at this time for the following
markets: green computers, solar, motors, and low-flow shower heads. 
Figures for energy saved by Demand Side Management programs and
Cogeneration vary greatly from one source to another, therefore
they have not been included in this report.<P>


<b>INFORMATION SOURCES</B><P> 

Information for this report has evolved from a variety of sources,
including interaction with companies active within the industry.
Interviews, conferences, and a review of all the technical and
business literature available make this technical/marketing report
a document of unique value and perspective for industry,
government, and R&D.<P>

Sources include a number of business and trade journals,
publications, and newsletters.  Product literature also played an
important role in the creation of this report.  Government sources
such as the U.S. Department of Energy provided insight into
technological developments.  Other government sources such as the
U.S. Department of Commerce and the Bureau of the Census provided
statistical information on sales and usage of energy-saving
devices.<P>

<B>STUDY GOALS AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>

Reformulated motor gasolines are an increasingly important factor in the U.S. 
(and world) energy equation.  Dictated by environmental and political 
considerations rather than those of the economic marketplace, these gasolines 
(called RFGs) will be required in many of the most populous regions of the 
United States in 1995 and subsequent years.  In this study, BCC presents the 
technical and political background for the manufacture, formulation, and sale 
of RFGs.  This study also includes historical background in RFG components and 
chemicals, especially fuel oxygenates, chemicals which contain oxygen and 
which are claimed to produce cleaner vehicle exhausts when blended into motor 
gasoline ("mogas").<P> 

Primary emphasis is on markets in the U.S., but we also note and 
discuss some of the more important international aspects of RFG supply, 
especially as it affects suppliers and markets in the U.S.<P> 


<b>REASONS FOR DOING THE STUDY</B><P>

Hardly a day goes by without some item in the media regarding RFGs.  This 
subject is a fascinating combination of politics and technology, and is also 
one which affects most of the U.S. population, since virtually everyone either 
drives a car or lives in a region where the air quality is affected by vehicle 
exhausts.  BCC performed this study to provide a comprehensive reference for 
those interested and/or involved in reformulated gasolines; this is a wide and 
varied group of companies and other interested groups ranging from petroleum 
refiners, process technology/equipment designers and marketers, farmers, 
politicians of all stripes, and the general public. BCC has sorted through and 
condensed information from a large amount of literature and other reference 
materials to compile this report.<P> 


<b>CONTRIBUTION OF THE STUDY AND FOR WHOM</B><P>

This report is intended to assist those involved in several different segments 
of the reformulated fuels industry.  These organizations and people include 
those who are involved in the design, selection, construction, and operation 
of facilities to produce RFG components as well as the fuels themselves.  
These include process and product designers, purchasing agents, construction 
and operating personnel, market staff, and top management.  BCC feels that 
this report will be of great value to technical and business personnel in the 
following areas, among others:<P> 

<LI> U.S. petroleum refining companies, which must make and sell the new
   reformulated gasolines.<P>

<LI> Companies involved in the design and construction of facilities to produce 
   RFG components, such as MTBE, as well as the finished RFGs themselves.<P>

<LI>  Organizations involved in basic and applied petroleum and petrochemical
   research.<P>

<LI>  Financial institutions which must finance these new and expensive facilities,
   many of which cost hundreds of millions of dollars.<P>

<LI> Personnel in state and federal governments, ranging from the politicians who
   must pass the legislation which makes RFGs mandatory to the environmental and
   other regulators who must implement and enforce the laws.<P>


<b>SCOPE AND FORMAT</B><P>

This study covers the technological, economic, political, and environmental 
considerations in the RFG industry.  It is primarily a study of U.S. politics 
and markets, but because of the global nature of both the petroleum industry 
and the environmental movement, it touches on some noteworthy international 
activities, primarily those which can have an impact on the U.S. market, such 
as imports or MTBE or RFG.  All market forecasts are given in constant 1993 
dollars and growth rates are all compounded.  All market values are rounded to 
the nearest million dollars, gallons, barrels, etc.  Because of rounding, some 
growth rates may not agree exactly with figures in the market tables.<P> 

This report is segmented into 10 sections, of which this is the first.  Other 
sections include:<P> 

<b>SECTION II</B><P>

The Executive Summary, which encapsulates our findings and conclusions, and 
includes the summary market table.  it is the place where the busy executive 
can find the major findings of the study in summary format.<P> 

<b>SECTION III</B><P>

Section III is an overview of the petroleum refining industry:  its history 
and structure, its importance to the economy, and its major products and 
applications.<P> 

<b>SECTION IV</B><P>

Section IV presents the major driving forces for adoption and use of RFGs.  
These are primarily political, driven by the Clean Air Act amendments of 1990.  
State regulations, especially those in California, have made a complex 
technical and marketing problem even more complicated.  This section contains 
the history, current status, and projected future for implementation of the 
laws which require the manufacture and use of RFG.  It includes discussion of 
several important factors which may affect the outcome.<P> 

<b>SECTION V</B><P>

Section V discusses one means of producing the fuel components for RFGs, by 
modifying and adding to existing petroleum refineries for this purpose.  
Equipment and refinery process modifications are required to reduce and 
replace some mogas components, such as aromatics.  In addition, refiners like 
to have control over their production and economics, and in-refinery 
production of fuel oxygenates is a popular and often less expensive and more 
attractive source of supply.<P> 

<b>SECTION VI</B><P>

Section VI covers the other means of supplying RFG components, that of grass-roots facilities outside petroleum refineries.  At this time these are exclusively fuel oxygenates, both ethers and alcohols; the former is best exemplified by methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE), while today the latter only means ethanol derived from biomass. It is in this arena that the most intense and interesting political wars are now being fought between the petrochemical and refining industry, which prefers petroleum-based materials such as MTBE, and the U.S. farm lobby which wants to sell grain-derived ethanol as the RFG oxygenate, either alone or in the ether ETBE.  In this section we also discuss alternative vehicles (e.g., electric cars) and engine designs, as well as alternative fuels such as natural gas and methanol.<P> 

<b>SECTION VII</B><P>

Section VII discusses and forecasts the markets for RFGs and their components.  
We look at forecast markets for RFGs themselves and for several of the key 
components which are now, or may in the future, find use in RFGs.  Again, 
today these fall into two groups of chemicals:  ethers and alcohols.  MTBE, as 
the leading RFG additive, receives the greatest attention.  We also discuss 
and forecast U.S. markets for other ethers such as ETBE and TAME, "renewable" 
oxygenates (ethanol), refinery modifications, and reformulated gasolines.  
Forecasts are presented for base year 1993 (before mandated RFG use); 1995, 
the first full year of RFG usage, and 1998.  Because of the great 
uncertainties now hovering over the potential market for RFG and its 
components, BCC uses scenario analysis (optimistic, pessimistic, and most 
likely cases) for several of our market forecasts.<P> 

<b>SECTION VIII</B><P>

Section VIII discusses some important international aspects of RFGs.  Because 
of the importance of MTBE, focus is again on manufacture and use of MTBE 
around the world.  The import and export of RFG components and fuels into and 
out of the U.S. is also discussed.<P> 

<b>SECTION IX</B><P>

Section IX consists of brief profiles of many of the companies which are 
leading the way in the manufacture and adoption of RFGs.  These include 
several petroleum refiners which are currently producing fuel oxygenates in 
their refineries, companies which are currently manufacturing motor fuel 
oxygenates (both petroleum and grain-based) for the merchant market, and some 
of the leading companies in the process technology involved.<P> 

<b>SECTION XII</B><P>

 Section XII is an appendix which lists and defines some of the more important 
terms, abbreviations, and acronyms used in the petroleum refining and RFG 
industry.<P> 

The scope of this study is restricted to fuels for spark ignition internal 
combustion engines, those which power most of the automobiles and light trucks 
in the United States.  The manufacture and marketing of fuels for other types 
of vehicles, especially diesel fuel for heavier trucks and some cars, is a 
different technology altogether, and at this time has been exempted from most 
of the implementation requirements of the Clean Air Act amendments.  As 
appropriate, we note diesel and other fuels as they relate to ordinary mogas.<P> 


<b>METHODOLOGY AND INFORMATION SOURCES</B><P>

Searches were made of the literature, including many of the leading trade 
publications, technical compendia, and government publications.  Product and 
market information was obtained whenever possible from the companies involved.  
The information for our corporate profiles was obtained primarily from the 
companies themselves, especially the larger publicly owned firms.  Other 
sources included directories and articles.<P>

<B>STUDY GOALS AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>

Electric vehicles (EVs) were first built in 1886 and have been in common use 
since the beginning of the century, but have not been seen as a serious 
commercial contender since the 1920s.  For almost as long, there have been 
announcements that an EV revival was forthcoming.  These expectations are not 
unreasonable. EVs, by using electric utility charged batteries, indirectly use 
coal, nuclear or hydroelectric power (rather than gasoline).  Pollution is 
transferred from millions of point sources to more easily abated central 
locations.  EVs may be inherently more energy efficient than internal 
combustion vehicles.  When EV batteries are charged at night, they are an 
excellent load leveling technique.  Ultimately, of course, the world's 
petroleum will be consumed.  Enhanced recovery, synthetic fuel, and biomass 
recovery can only extend fuel supplies so far, and are not themselves immune 
to price hikes.  The question, then, is not whether EVs will be adopted, but 
when.  But is "when" now?<P> 

During the late 1970s, in response to the energy crisis, the DOE sponsored a series of research projects designed to develop EV powertrains, components, 
and especially batteries.  It was hoped that prototypes would be available by 1978, government sponsored pilot fleets by 1980, production prototypes by 1982, and commercial models by 1984.  At the height of the energy crisis, it was predicted that by 2000, 50% of the nation's automobiles would be either EVs or hybrid electric/internal combustion powered.<P>

In 1983, DOE's Argonne National Laboratory predicted a national fleet of 3 million, or approximately 2% of the total.  The Electric Vehicle Development Corp. (a group of North American utility companies) planned on introducing hundreds of commercial battery-powered van fleets by 1993.  In 1989, when oil prices again skyrocketed, it was announced that the "Big Three" automakers were once again planning to commercialize mass-produced EVs.  All these optimistic EV scenarios were predicated on higher oil prices.  Each time, when post-crisis oil prices fell, EV plans were shelved or postponed.<P> 

The 1990s EV revival could be different.  Oil prices have remained relatively stable or even fallen.  There has been little apparent incentive to switch from gasoline to electric power based on cost-effectiveness alone.  Rather, the factors encouraging EV commercialization are based on legislation-backed long 
term goals like EV's pollution reduction potential.  EV commercialization is 
now evolutionary, with incremental improvement that should continue 
irrespective of oil price. Such an EV revival would have a profound impact on the automotive industry, the battery industry, and the electric utility 
industry.<P> 


<b>REASONS FOR DOING THE STUDY</B><P>

As battery-powered vehicles become an important component of the nation's transportation infrastructure, automotive, battery, and electric utility players must develop new R&D, marketing, and promotional strategies.  Fundamental realignments in industry structure are possible.  For instance, will EVs be designed and built primarily by the world's internal combustion vehicle companies, or by start-ups specializing in EVs.  Will key EV components, especially batteries, be designed and manufactured by existing automakers or by existing battery makers? What kind of infrastructure will be developed to recharge and service EVs?  Will electric utilities develop a network of retail-level electrical power stations?  And what of the existing gasoline/diesel service infrastructure?<P>  

At the same time these fundamental realignments are occurring, there will also be ample opportunity for competitive relationships to develop within the various EV market segments. Will microcars, sedans, vans, or buses be the optimal sizes for EVs?  What specific battery types will be used, and which materials will be used to manufacture these batteries?  What kinds of battery chargers will be used?<P> 

This Business Opportunity Report is intended to be the most complete technical,
economic and business document of this type on this subject and is designed to
provide information of a professional nature.  The technical data are dependent
on the accuracy of the manufacturers and technical sources that helped make up
the BCC database.  This report is not intended to constitute a legal or 
accounting document, nor is it an endorsement of any given product or process.  
The authors, and BCC Inc. as the publisher, assume no liability for loss or 
damage as a result of reliance on this material.<P>  


<b>CONTRIBUTION OF THE STUDY AND FOR WHOM</B><P>

This report is intended to provide a unique analysis of the U.S. EV industry and
forecast for the U.S. EV market.  It will be of interest to manufacturers of 
internal combustion and battery-powered vehicles, secondary battery makers, 
and battery charger makers.  This report will also be valuable to the electric 
utility and gasoline/diesel industry.  Existing or potential secondary vehicle 
users, including fleet operators, the government, the military, and public 
transportation providers will all eventually have to consider how EVs will 
impact their operations.  BCC wishes to thank those companies, government 
agencies and university researchers who contributed information for this 
report.<P> 


SCOPE & FORMAT

First, this report provides an overview of EV and EV-related technology, 
including a comparison with internal combustion and alternatively fueled 
vehicles.  Next, an overview of EV industry structure and competitive aspects, 
including a discussion of market segmentation, market forces, concentration 
factors, trade practices, channels of distribution, and purchasing influences.<P> 

Then, this report considers the three components that make up the EV market:<P>

<UL><LI> Vehicles & parts
   <LI>  EV batteries
   <LI>  EV battery chargers</UL><P>

Each of these markets is comprised of different market sub-sectors, and each 
is examined in terms of past, present and future sales.  Retail markets for 
1993 (estimated) and predicted for 1994, 1999, and 2004 are provided for 
several possible development scenarios. Predicted markets and average annual 
growth rates (AAGR) are expressed in constant 1994 dollars.  The overall EV 
market is discussed in terms of regional market influences.<P> 

An extensive set of industry profiles for EV and EV-related companies are 
provided. Appendixes provide a list of EV-related patents, summarize selected 
EV market development plans, and present a battery industry market activity 
chronology.  A discussion of the military EV market, non-battery EV power 
supply developments, EV safety standard developments, and a summary of the 
international EV industry are also presented as appendixes.<P> 
 

<b>METHODOLOGY</B><P>

This report is based on a literature review, patent examination, and 
discussions with commercial and government sources.  Throughout the report, 
past market data is expressed in current dollars, and estimates and 
predictions in constant 1994 dollars.  This report defines the markets as 
sales for 1993 and predicted for 1994, 1999, and 2004.  When appropriate, 
optimistic, pessimistic and consensus scenarios are provided.  Totals are 
rounded to the nearest million dollars.  When appropriate, information from 
previously published sources is identified to allow a more detailed 
examination by clients.<P> 


<b>INFORMATION SOURCES</B><P>

The EV battery market assumptions used in this report are based on material 
from BCC's A2GB-086N U.S. Battery Market Business Opportunity Report. The EV 
battery charger market and assumptions used in this report are based on 
material from A3GB-174, The U.S. Battery Charger Industry.  Both reports were 
prepared by this report's author.  Although many segments of the EV are well 
documented, much of this information is based on estimates, not hard facts.  
The distinction between these estimates and hard facts can be vital, and 
wherever possible, sources are identified.  The BCC monthly newsletter 
Battery/EV Technology News provides a valuable secondary source.  The U.S. 
Government Repository Patent Center located at the Fondren Library, Rice 
University, Houston, Texas provided a valuable source of U.S. patent 
information to help characterize the battery charger industry state of the 
art.<P>

<B>STUDY OBJECTIVES</B><P>

This report highlights the increasing level of competition 
that is developing between electric utilities and nonutility 
generators.  The primary focus is on the impact new 
technologies will have on the structure of the electric 
power industry over the coming decade.  The report reviews 
recent developments in capacity and generation by type of 
ownership, by technology, and by fuel between 1984 and 1994.  
It stresses such factors as relative fuel prices, 
technological breakthroughs, deregulation, and the 
developments in renewable resources.  A forecast for new 
capacity, generation, and sales by type of ownership and by 
fuel through 2005 is also included.<P>


<B>REASONS FOR DOING THE STUDY</B><P>

For the last two decades, U.S. electric utilities have seen 
their ability to serve an ever demanding public severely 
tested.  For example, because of ever increasing fossil 
fuel, environmental, and construction costs, utilities have 
had to increase the price of their electricity at rates that 
have often outpaced the more general Consumer Price Index.  
With the hope of regaining the upper hand on the efficiency 
front, utilities voted in favor of building mammoth nuclear 
plants, a move that created a public relations nightmare and 
that did little to redress the utilities' deepening 
financial problems.  Then, in the early 1980s, legislators 
decided that it was time to instill some degree of 
competition within one of the last bastions of monopolistic 
fiefdom.<P>

By the early 1990s, it was clear that the electric power 
industry was changing.  Brash nonutility generators, 
empowered by various legislative edicts and often with 
generous government subsidies if they used renewable 
resources, went on a spending spree.  By 1994, they were 
building most of the new electric generating capacity.  
These intrepid innovators were not relying on nuclear power 
nor were they relying on our vast coal reserves to generate 
their new power plants.  They were availing themselves of 
the newest technologies which included the use of renewable 
resources such as wind, solar, and biomass.  Utilities, 
short of cash and of ideas, were taken aback.  Not only were 
they losing the allegiance of large customers to those 
nonregulated entities, they were also obligated to buy 
whatever power those upstarts wanted to sell them.<P>  

Changes in regulatory thinking promise additional turmoil 
over the coming decade.  Now, several states are considering 
following in the footsteps of California to allow customers 
the freedom to purchase power from whichever generator they 
prefer.  Retail wheeling, when it becomes universal in a few 
years from now, will be the last step towards the complete 
deregulation of the generating sector of the electric power 
industry.<P>  

While deregulatory emphasis may now be on the generating 
sector, it is widely believed that the transmission and 
distribution sectors of the industry will not escape drastic 
structural changes.  Competition at the generation level 
will lead to radical changes in the technology of 
electricity generation.  That in turn will have an impact on 
the need for transmission and distribution services.  
Technological breakthroughs such as photovoltaic cell 
systems, fuel cell systems, modular natural gas turbines, 
etc. will soon lead to a distributed generation network with 
or without the participation of utilities.  Such 
developments may obviate the need for more transmission and 
distribution lines or even a curtailment of such activities.<P>  


<B>CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE STUDY</B><P>

In this report, we aim at answering such questions as how 
much new capacity will be needed over the coming decade to 
meet the increasing demand for electricity?  Who will build 
that capacity and which type of fuel will be used?  Which 
technology will prevail and which ones are on the brink of 
revolutionizing the industry?  We believe that strategic 
planning professionals within the utility and nonutility 
sectors will greatly benefit from our analysis.  The 
information included in this report will prove to be an 
invaluable guide for any analysis of future trends within 
the industry or for planning capital investment projects.<P>


<B>SCOPE AND FORMAT</B><P>

The study beings with an overview of the developments within 
the electric power industry between 1984 and 1994.  Our 
emphasis is on the changes in the ownership of generating 
plants, on the shifts in the use of fuels and of renewable 
resources, and on changes in regulation.  This section is 
followed by a detailed analysis of generating capacity by 
type of fuel such as coal, natural gas, nuclear power, and 
the various renewable resources (hydro, solar, biomass, 
etc.).  In each section, a detailed analysis of past trends 
in capacity and generation is provided, together with 
changes in the industry structure and technological 
developments.  A 10-year forecast for each type of capacity 
is provided, together with an outlook for equipment 
manufacturers.<P>

<B>STUDY GOALS AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>

This BCC report discusses the production and commercial uses of four specific classes of 
coal combustion by-products (known collectively as CCBs) -- fly ash, bottom ash, boiler 
slag, and flue gas desulfurization (FGD) material. Disposal of CCBs represents a 
significant, and growing, environmental problem, in view of the amount of landfill 
space that is required for disposal. Furthermore, with the increasing numbers of flue 
gas desulfurization (FGD) systems, which produce prodigious quantities of waste, 
finding useful applications for CCBs becomes imperative. The development of viable 
markets for the use of the various types and grades of CCBs is, in many cases, 
economically advantageous for both producers and consumers of CCBs. <P>

Both U.S. and international CCB developments are reported. However, the main focus 
is on CCBs generated by the U.S. electric utility sector, as opposed to industrial boilers. 
Co-managed ash wastes, which are materials resulting from the burning of coal with 
hazardous and non-hazardous wastes are generally not dealt with in this report.<P>

This report provides an up-to-date analysis of the pertinent technical and economic 
forces affecting the commercial utilization of CCBs. The report provides market 
forecasts for each of the separate markets and technologies involved. Important 
statistical and analytical information is provided for markets, applications, industry 
structure and dynamics, major players, and technology developments.<P>


<B>CONTRIBUTION OF THE STUDY</B><P>

This guide to the commercial utilization of CCBs is designed to benefit those companies 
already involved in the business either as end-users of CCBs or as CCB generators or 
marketers, or companies contemplating entering the business. The study mainly 
focuses on the U.S., however, in view of the growing internationalization of business, a 
section on international developments is included. This study highlights trends in CCB 
production, technical utilization in commercial products, and R&D and identifies the 
current players and their major products and contributions within the context of the 
entire market. Specifically, the present and future markets for CCBs in construction 
and building materials, non-structural flowable fills, mining, agriculture, and waste 
management are evaluated.<P>


<B>METHODOLOGY</B><P>

Market forecasts and historical data are presented for the CCBs discussed in this 
report for a l0-year period, mainly on the basis of tons of material. Unlike most 
products, no national market exists for CCBs.  The market is extremely localized for the 
most part and most data regarding the value of uses and contracts is closely held, 
particularly with regard to the more novel uses of CCBs. The Department of Energy 
collects only minimal data on CCB production and reuse; no data are collected by the 
government on the value of re-used or recycled CCB materials.<P> 


<B>FORECASTS</B><P>

The study contains forecasts of CCB use (by tonnage) for the major end-use markets, 
including cement/concrete, flowable fill, structural fill, road base, asphalt filler, ice 
control applications, blasting grit, grouting, coal mining, wallboard, waste stabilization, 
and other miscellaneous applications. These forecasts cover these applications in all 
four classifications of CCB, including fly ash; bottom ash; boiler slag; and FGD 
material.<P>

Forecasts for niche market applications, which by their nature are lower volume uses, 
such as certain applications for cenospheres, autoclaved cellular blocks, paints and 
coatings, fillers, ashalloys, and so forth, are dealt with individually in the text of the 
report.<P>


<B>INFORMATION SOURCES</B><P>

Information for this report has evolved from a wide variety of sources, including 
interaction with companies active within the industry. Information gathered from 
telephone interviews and a comprehensive review of all the technical, patent and 
business literature available make this technical/marketing report unique in its global 
perspective of the CCB utilization industry and, hence, valuable to individuals in 
industry, government, and R&D.<P>

Sources include the American Coal Ash Association, the Electric Power Research 
Institute, the Morgantown Energy Research Center of the DOE, the Center for Applied 
Energy Research at the University of Kentucky, the American Ceramic Society, the 
Energy and Environmental Research Center of the University of North Dakota as well 
as hundreds of business, trade, and technical journals and newsletters.<P>

<B>STUDY GOALS AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>

It is a fundamental fact that the market for battery chargers is
driven by the market for batteries.  Batteries are used to accumulate
and transport electrical energy.  These functions--power storage
and power portability--make batteries essential to today's
industrial and consumer-oriented society.  Although simple batteries
have existed for at least two hundred years, the battery industry
traces its roots to the early 1900s.  At that time, the 
commercialization of automobiles and radios created a demand for
automotive (starting, lighting, ignition and generator) batteries and
portable appliance batteries.  These markets, characterized by
primary (disposable) and secondary (rechargeable) batteries, remain
the two areas where most batteries are consumed.  With the growth of
the markets for secondary batteries, especially lead-acid batteries,
the market for lead-acid battery chargers has grown.  Starting in the
1960s, the wider commercialization of sealed nickel-cadmium batteries
and then sealed lead-acid batteries created competition between
primary and secondary batteries for some consumer applications. 
This development also created a market for whole new kinds of
battery chargers.<P>

The U.S. battery market is considered mature, with demand closely
related to the sales of either automobiles or various consumer
products.  Likewise, in many cases, the market for battery chargers is
mature.  During the last few years, there has been a subtle change in
this relationship.  Improved microelectronic battery charger
controller technology is allowing the commercialization of whole new
classes of batteries (notably rechargeable alkaline) and is improving
the marketability of existing battery systems (notably nickel-
cadmium).  This in turn has allowed the commercialization of portable
products that would be impossible without improved battery chargers
(notably portable computers and eventually, electric vehicles or EVs). 
With this in mind, there are areas where the battery charger industry
could experience the explosive growth usually associated with
emerging industries.  Battery designers (mainly electrochemists) and
battery charger designers (mainly electrical and electronics
specialists) will continue to operate together, with new batteries and
battery chargers evolving to produce even higher performance
products.<P>


<b>REASONS FOR DOING THE STUDY</B><P>

Battery and battery charger technical advances and a realignment of
the battery industry players must be matched by new marketing
attitudes. The battery charger market is much more fragmented than
the battery industry it serves.  On the other hand, battery designers
and battery charger designers now must cooperate to meet more
demanding design requirements.  Battery charger customers include
the consuming public, industrial users, and manufacturers who must
consider a charger as an integral part of a product's design.  This
Business Opportunity Report is intended to be the most complete
technical, economic and business document of this type on this
subject and is designed to provide information of a professional
nature.  The technical data are dependent on the accuracy of the
manufacturers and technical sources that helped make up the BCC
database.  This report is not intended to constitute a legal or 
accounting document, nor is it an endorsement of any given product or
process.  The authors, and BCC Inc., as the publisher, assume no
liability for loss or damage as a result of reliance on this material.<P> 


<b>CONTRIBUTION OF THE STUDY AND FOR WHOM</B><P>

This report is intended to provide a unique analysis of the U.S.
battery charger market, and will be of interest to manufacturers of
battery charger and battery charger components.  This report also
will be valuable to those involved secondary battery development and
marketing, as well as those offering competing non-rechargeable
batteries.  Existing or potential secondary battery consumers,
including the automobile, utility, consumer appliance, computer and
medical industries, as well as the military, can determine existing or
potential battery charger markets.  These end users will learn what
charger designs battery systems will, and will not, allow.  BCC wishes
to thank those companies, government agencies and university
researchers who contributed information for this report.<P>


<b>SCOPE & FORMAT</B><P>

First, this report organizes the battery charger industry into five
markets (based on the type of consumer):<P>

<UL><LI> Consumer battery chargers
<LI> Original equipment market (OEM) battery chargers
<LI> Automotive battery chargers
<LI> Traction battery chargers
<LI> Stationary industrial battery chargers<P></UL>

Battery chargers intended for developmental battery markets are
also discussed.  The battery charger component market also is
discussed.<P> 

In some cases, there is an exact intersection between the market-
based and the technology-based organization.  With this in mind, a
market matrix is provided to compare the market organization with the
technological organization.<P>

Each of these divisions is comprised of different market sub-
sectors, and each is examined in terms of past, present and future
sales.  Wholesale markets for 1993 (estimated) and predicted 1994,
1999, and 2004 are provided.  Predicted markets and average annual
growth rates (AAGR) are expressed in constant 1994 dollars. 
Developmental battery/battery charger systems being developed for
electric vehicles, utility load leveling, and remote power storage
stations are a fourth system.  Advanced military applications are
also discussed.  In some cases, several possible development
scenarios are presented.  A detailed discussion of the companies
involved  in the battery industry is provided in this report's
Industry Profiles section.<P> 


<b>METHODOLOGY</B><P>

This report is based on a literature review, patent examination,
discussions with commercial and government sources.  Throughout the
report, past market data is expressed in current dollars, and
estimates and predictions in constant 1994 dollars.  Wholesale
markets for 1993 and predicted 1994, 1999, and 2004 are provided. 
Most market summaries are based on a consensus scenario that
assumes no unanticipated technical advances and no unexpected
legislation.  With this in mind, optimistic, pessimistic and consensus
scenarios are produced for developmental battery/battery charger
system markets.  Totals are rounded to the nearest million dollars. 
When appropriate, information from previously published sources is
identified to allow a more detailed examination by clients.<P>


<b>INFORMATION SOURCES</B><P>

The battery market assumptions used in this report are based on
material from BCC's A2GB-086N U.S. Battery Market Business
Opportunity Report, which was prepared by this report's author. 
Although many segments of the battery industry are well documented,
much of this information is based on estimates, not hard facts.  The
distinction between these estimates and hard facts can be vital, and
wherever possible, sources are identified.  The BCC monthly
newsletter Battery/EV Technology News provides a valuable
secondary source.  The U.S. Government Repository Patent Center
located at the Fondren Library, Rice University, Houston, TX
provided a valuable source of U.S. patent information to help
characterize the battery charger industry state of the art.<P>

PROJECT ANALYST
<P>


<H3><I>INTRODUCTION</I></H3>


<B>STUDY GOAL AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>

As all world markets have become less insular and subject to
increasing international competition and opportunities,  the
need  for international information also is increasing. Many
markets   undergo  important  changes,  as   the   marketing
environment and political framework conditions change.<P>

This  may apply increasingly for the food but also  for  the
animal  feed  market,  and  especially  for  the  respective
ingredient  markets.  With  the  world  split  up  in  major
consumer markets, such as the EU and the NAFTA, and national
regulations  gradually replacing national laws,  the  market
for   food   and  feed  ingredients  is  becoming   complex,
international,  and  competitive.  It  is  more   and   more
essential  for food and feed ingredient suppliers  to  widen
their views.<P>

In  order  to  survive and grow successfully,  organizations
must  not  only take a total view of the market,  they  must
also  be  able  to  digest  greater volumes  of  information
efficiently.  It  is,  however,  not  only  the  volume   of
information  consumed  that will determine  the  ability  to
develop;  it  is  the  need  to have  information  assessed,
interpreted, analyzed, and presented.<P>

The international food ingredient market is composed of many
different  sectors of food ingredients, some  of  which  are
well analyzed. The international feed ingredient market also
is  composed of several different sectors out of which  only
amino  acids, antibiotics and other medicinal feed additives
are well analyzed.<P>


One of the fastest growing sectors, both in food as well  as
in  feed additives, is enzymes. In food, enzymes are used as
processing  aids,  while in feed they  are  used  to  better
digest  feed  stuff. Most of the enzymes used in  feed  have
developed  out of traditional food enzymes such  as  enzymes
used  for  brewing  and  baking.  Therefore  there  is  some
potential for synergies in R&D and production.<P>

Enzyme  production  has  lost some  of  its  attractiveness,
despite  the  interesting growth rates  in  demand,  because
product prices have eroded drastically.<P>

In   consequence,   many  takeovers,  joint   ventures   and
divestitures have taken place in past years.<P>

Food enzymes, as applied in the production of virtually  all
food and drink products, may strategically fit into a number
of  other  food  ingredients and, therefore,  are  preferred
targets  for consideration in diversification and completion
of product ranges.<P>

Feed  enzymes,  although traded and handled as  commodities,
are still specialties and may only fit those companies which
have some experience already in the marketing of specialties
for   the   feed  additive  market.  Many  food   ingredient
specialties  are  used also as specialties for  feed  (e.g.,
vitamins,  some pigments, antioxidants, etc.) and many  food
ingredient   suppliers  are  at  the  same  time   specialty
suppliers for the feed ingredient market.<P>


<B>REASONS FOR DOING THE STUDY</B><P>

This  report  reviews the markets for food and feed  enzymes
such as enzymes used in:<P>

     <UL>

     <LI> Starch conversion
       
     <LI> Dairy and cheese industry
     <LI> Fruit juice, wine and beer manufacture
     <LI> Flour improvement and baking
     <LI> Confectionary and specialty applications
     <LI> Broiler, layer and pig feed.

</UL>

This report tries to give an overview of the global food and
feed enzyme industry. It:<P>

     
       Reviews trends in the relevant food and feed sectors<P>
       
       Estimates the quantities of each enzyme  used  in
       specific applications<P>
       
     
       Analyzes the producing and distributing/formulating
       industry<P>
      
     
       Extrapolates the future of the food and feed enzyme
       business to the year 2000.<P>
       

Special attention is given to feed enzymes. The feed  enzyme
market  is rarely analyzed on a global scale. As the  market
already shows a global sales value comparable to that of the
dairy enzyme market, some special attention is given to  the
specific developments in this area: Details are given of the
development  of individual feed types, which  may  influence
future  growth of enzyme applications, penetration rates  of
different products in different global selling areas  and  a
profound analysis of the companies offering such products.<P>


<B>CONTRIBUTION OF THE STUDY</B><P>

BCC  seeks to provide insight into an industry which  is  at
the  forefront of technology and which is still growing well
above other feed or food ingredients.<P>

This  report is intended to assist companies and players  in
the  food and feed additive market by providing them with  a
comprehensive  overview  of  the  industry.  Strategic   and
business  planning becomes easier and more  reliable.   Also
companies  and  players  active  in  other  food  ingredient
markets that are considering diversification into attractive
and  well-fitting sectors, one of which may be food and feed
enzymes.<P>

        
<B>SCOPE AND FORMAT</B><P>

After  a  review of the food and feed ingredient market  and
the  business environment, each type of enzyme is  discussed
in  relation to its application. The rationale  of  using  a
specific  type of enzyme is shown first, followed  by  price
and  margin  discussions, and estimates on current  use  and
future  developments to the year 2000. A special section  on
the production of enzymes, especially on production costs of
different  types  of enzymes, may complete the  picture  and
demonstrate  that  despite a significant erosion  of  market
prices  there  is still some room for margins. Market  share
estimates  of major and important players, company profiles,
and  a  description of how the industry works  complete  the
picture and conclude this report.<P>


<B>METHODOLOGIES</B><P>

The  methodology  which is applied in this report  is  split
into three major blocks:<P>

     
     1.   Analysis of the markets for which food and feed enzymes
       are  used. Structures and trends in these markets are
       identified. For each relevant food market, developments 
       are discussed and shown.<P>
       
     
     2.   For each of the so defined application fields, the most
       important food and feed enzymes are identified, and
       volumes and values estimated.<P>
       
     
     3.    Price  trends and estimates of production margins
       complement the picture.<P>
       

<B>INFORMATION SOURCES</B><P>

As  there  are only a few players in the producing  industry
and the distributing and application industries, the sources
of information are limited.<P>

In  addition  to  company reports, product brochures,  trade
journals, and many other food ingredient journals as well as
feed  ingredient and feed stuff journals, it is  mostly  the
direct contact with representatives of the relevant industry
that  provided reliable and quantitative information on  the
enzymes that ensure the high quality of this report.<P>

<B>STUDY GOAL AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>

The purpose of this report is to: 1)  update the previous Beverage
Industry: Markets, Players and Packaging Trends study published by
BCC in 1987.  BCC has been following trends in the beverage
industry over time and this report represents the third one
published since 1980; 2) identify, quantify and analyze the market
for non-alcoholic beverages and 3) expand on the previous study by
looking at the latest trends over the past 5 years and determine
where new product growth may come from in this industry.  The
report presents a comprehensive overview of the changing beverage
industry and an outlook for where it may be heading.<P>

It covers 8 non-alcoholic beverages in some detail with a brief
overview of alcoholic beverages and their niches.  In addition to
trends in the traditional markets, new product and existing niches
are analyzed to determine their history and viability within each
of the 9 beverage industries including alcoholic beverages.<P>

<B>REASONS FOR DOING THE STUDY</B><P>

The report brings together and analyzes data and makes forecasts
for all the major beverages consumed in the United States and
compares one with the other.  It analyses sales, growth and 5 year
forecasts for all major beverages consumed in the U.S. including
1991 projections and 1996 forecasts.<P>

We present consumption patterns; production; who's doing what and
why; packaging information; ingredient analysis focused on sugar
substitutes; channels of distribution; advertising data;
demographics; the major players, their brands, market share and
what they're doing; flavor preferences; new products; beverage
niches and import data.  In this way industry analysts can have
most of the pertinent decision making data and information as well
as forecasts on beverages under one cover.<P>

<B>CONTRIBUTION OF THE STUDY AND TARGET AUDIENCE</B><P>

The study serves as an overview of the non-alcoholic beverage
industry, its history and 5 year trends.  It emphasizes key niche
markets within each of the major beverage categories to illustrate
where the mature industry is heading.  The report brings together
data sources on each category under one cover for industry analysts
to use as a handy reference.  Product managers, investors, bankers,
researchers, Wall Street analysts and business libraries with
interests in the beverage industry will find this volume useful to
assess specific beverage product categories and its prospects.   It is recommended for marketing, sales, strategic planning, product
and corporate development  planning and top management in small,
medium or large companies.<P>

<B>SCOPE AND FORMAT</B><P>

The scope of this study includes but is not limited to the major
product groupings mass marketed primarily through the supermarket.
The products include carbonated soft drinks, juice and juice
drinks, powdered drinks, bottled water, coffee, tea and  milk.
Such products included are alcoholic beverage niches like wine
coolers and non-alcoholic beer.  Other channels of importance like
vending and foodservice are covered.<P>

The products chosen for coverage are the ones which follow the
latest trends in health and diet orientation, the direction in
which the beverage market is heading along with other food
products.  However, caffeinated products including soda, coffee and
tea are included: alcoholic products are summarized to round out
the picture of the beverage industry and to examine the
health-oriented trends that are drawing attention to and affecting
the alcoholic beverage industry.<P>

The report covers the following 12 beverage niche categories:<P>

<H3><I>INTRODUCTION</I></H3>
</CENTER>

In his 1991 State of the Union address, President Bush cited the
responsibility of individuals toward maintaining a healthful diet.
Increasing consumer demand for more healthful foods and beverages that
are also good-tasting and convenient was a dominant food trend of the
1980s.  Maturing of the population is the major force behind the
continued strong growth that is forecast for this market segment
during the 1990s.  Recent passage of the food labeling law will not
only benefit the consumer, it will also benefit those food and
beverage suppliers who focus on supplying more healthful foods and
beverages to meet the needs of health-conscious consumers.<P>

<B>STUDY GOAL AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>

BCC attempts to provide in-depth market information and insights into
future directions and opportunities for foods and beverages that have
an overall healthful image.  "Healthy" food is an evolving category
composed of products that the consumer views as being "better for
you."  Today, "healthy" foods tend to be natural products that are
fresh, low in fat or without fat, without cholesterol, relatively low
in sodium, and nutrient-dense or high in specific important nutrients
such as protein, calcium, fiber, and vitamins.  Product categories in
this "Healthy" Foods Update range from fresh fruits and vegetables to
"healthy" snacks and main meals.  They had a total market value
estimated at almost $79 billion in 1990.<P>

Some products such as granola bars, because of a change in the
consumers' image of their healthfulness, are no longer considered a
part of the "healthy" food market.  Orientation has shifted from
natural food suppliers and the health/natural-food stores that
developed the market during the early 1980s to mainstream food and
beverage producers who have achieved strong sales growth through new
product introductions.  In some categories, however, such as "new age"
beverages, emphasis is on small companies that are the leading market
innovators.  Some emerging categories such as nonfat dairy-based
frozen desserts and nonfat salad dressings along with fish/seafood,
poultry, vitamins and nutritional supplements are not included in this
analysis.<P>

<B>REASONS FOR DOING THE STUDY</B><P>

This report is oriented toward the needs of the health-conscious
consumer.  Many competing reports are product-oriented and do not
provide sufficient data to compare "healthy" and regular segments
within product categories.  News reports often indicate that, although
consumers say they are interested in "healthy" foods, purchasing
behavior tends toward high calorie, high-fat foods.  BCC attempts to
present relatively complete market data that substantiate increasing
consumer demand for healthful foods and beverages in the marketplace.
This strong trend is translated into forecasts for various product
segments.<P>

<B>CONTRIBUTION OF THE STUDY AND FOR WHOM IT IS INTENDED</B><P>

Market data from a variety of sources have been analyzed and converted
to information that enables food and beverage suppliers to respond to
the increasing consumer demand for more healthful foods and beverages.
This market analysis points to emerging opportunities for food and
beverage concerns, ingredient suppliers, food consultants and other
food marketers.<P>

<B>SCOPE AND FORMAT</B><P>

This in-depth study analyzes an assortment of healthful beverages, and
fresh and processed foods for which markets are substantially
developed and sizable including:<P>

<MENU>fruit juices and fruit drinks<BR>
bottled water<BR>
sports drinks<BR>
"new age" beverages<BR>
herbal and decaffeinated teas<BR>
skim and low-fat milk<BR>
low-fat, nonfat and aspartame-sweetened yogurt<BR>
reduced-fat cottage cheese<BR>
ice milk and frozen yogurt<BR>
fresh fruits and vegetables<BR>
"healthy" cereals<BR>
healthful variety breads<BR>
"healthy" main meals<BR>
"healthy" crackers, baked snacks, and related products<BR>
dried fruits and fruit snacks<BR>
miscellaneous food products that have a healthful image</MENU><P>

Market data for both the grocery and food-service segments of the
frozen yogurt market are presented, and all distribution channels for
bottled water are covered.  New product trends and market shares for
industry leaders are also included.  In addition, BCC discusses the
impact of technology, health issues, consumer trends, and the economic
and regulatory environments on demand for "healthy" food during the
1990s.<P>

<B>METHODOLOGY</B><P>

For most product segments, BCC presents historical growth trends for
1985 or 1986 through 1989 or 1990, often including both total
consumption and manufacturers' and retail sales.  All sales are in
current dollars.  BCC estimates for 1990 are based on available data.
Market forecasts for 1995 are compounded on an annual basis.
Forecasts take into account changing demographics, consumer trends,
new product developments, expected marketing "push" by market leaders,
the evolving regulatory climate, pricing and other economic trends.
However, the present recession and chaotic pricing for some food and
beverage segments make forecasting uncertain.<P>


<B>INFORMATION SOURCES</B><P>

BCC analyzed and consolidated data from various government and
industry sources including company annual reports, business and trade
journals, government publications and newspapers.  Personal interviews
provided additional information.  The U.S.D.A. and the U.S.D.O.C.
provided production and consumption data.  Market estimates are made
by BCC based on production and market data in government publications,
Supermarket Business, Progressive Grocer, Prepared Foods, Food
Engineering, Beverage Industry, The Wall Street Journal and other
sources besides personal contacts.<P>

<B>RELATED WORK CREDENTIALS</B><P>

The author is a trained food technologist and nutritionist.  She has
prepared numerous business opportunity reports focusing on various
segments of the industry including the "healthy" food market.  Recent
BCC reports include Opportunities in Aquaculture  and  The Fishery
Products Industry and The Seafood Market.<P>

</CENTER>

<B>STUDY GOALS AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>
 
In recent years, health professionals have advised consumers that
more plant-derived than animal-derived foods should be consumed for
a healthier diet. The diets of various nations around the world
have been cited as examples of plant-based foods, and are
correlated with health statistics showing lower incidence of such
major diseases as cancer and heart disease.<P>  
 
In addition to being healthy, ethnic foods offer new taste
experiences for nonethnic consumers. When the foods are marketed as
prepared foods, requiring minimal cooking at home, the extra
dimension of convenience is added for both ethnic and nonethnic
consumers.<P> 
 
The prepared ethnic foods market consists of two categories. One
category is comprised of those foods which are so familiar to
consumers that they are no longer considered to be specialty foods,
but rather mass market or mainstream products.<P>  
 
Prepared Italian, Mexican and Asian/Chinese foods fall into this
category because the ethnic populations have been in the U.S. for
decades and are dispersed throughout the nation. Also, nonethnics
have become familiar with the foods through eating places or
travel. The numerous eating places can include the ethnic
restaurants themselves or mainstream eateries that include the
ethnic items on their menus.<P>  
 
With such familiarity comes wide consumer demand to create large
enough markets that interest the major food processors. The major
companies, in turn, have the clout to sell their products in the
larger grocery stores and supermarkets, thereby expanding product
exposure for nonethnics.<P> 
 
The second group is made up of various ethnic populations that are
small yet growing rapidly, are more or less confined to specific
localities and regions of the nation precluding wide exposure to
nonethnics, and are more likely to have their own stores where they
prefer to buy fresh ingredients for their own food preparation.<P>   
 
Some of these ethnics are just becoming acquainted with the idea of
prepared foods for their own use as well as for nonethnic
communities interested in varying their diets. With such low
demand, major food processors show less interest. Ethnics continue
to shop in their own stores, and nonethnics get little exposure to
them because there are few products in their supermarkets.<P>  

This second group of foods includes some Mediterranean and Middle
Eastern; Caribbean; Asian in a current market consisting of
Japanese and Indian foods, and a potential market of Thai, Korean,
Vietnamese and Indonesian foods; American in a current market of
Cajun/creole and kosher/Jewish, and a potential market of black and
native Americans; and European consisting of western and eastern
foods.<P> 
 
The prepared ethnic foods considered in this report have more
similarities than differences. Most of the basic ingredients are
the same, such as rice, noodles, vegetables, chicken or fish. The
differences lie in the types of seasonings and spices used that
characterize the food's ethnicity, how the ingredients are used and
the ways that the foods are prepared and cooked.<P>   
 
Many of the products resemble one another but are called by
different names. Turnover/pocket type products, for example, are
grain-based products that are rolled and then filled with
vegetables, cheese, meat or fish, and then baked, fried or boiled.
They can be called strombolis, burritos, egg rolls, crepes,
dumplings or blintzes but they are essentially the same type of
product and just about every ethnic group has at least one. In
addition to product similarity, many of the foods touted for their
healthfulness also have some not-so-healthful aspects such as high
salt and fat content, and use of certain fats and oils for frying.<P> 
 
The goal of this report is to learn if each type of prepared ethnic
food comprises a large or small market, or a growing or static
market, and what factors related to ethnic and nonethnic consumers
affect size and growth.<P> 
 

<b>REASONS FOR DOING THE STUDY</B><P> 
 
This report is designed to achieve the following objectives:<P> 
 
<LI> To describe the fresh diets of each ethnic group and show which
products have been selected for marketing as prepared products and
which have not.<P>   
 
<LI> To compare and contrast the range and variety of prepared foods
marketed as belonging to each ethnic group.<P> 
 
<LI> To suggest the market size of each type of prepared food as
influenced by various social and market factors related to both
ethnic and nonethnic consumers.<P> 
 
<LI> To analyze the structure of the industry, and companies involved in
marketing each type of prepared ethnic product, in terms of
perceived consumer demand, real and potential market size.<P>   
 
<b>CONTRIBUTION OF THE STUDY</B><P>
 
BCC seeks to provide insight into one key question: Which types of
prepared ethnic foods can help consumers reach healthful dietary
goals while bringing economic health to their marketers?<P>  
 
The report examines each type prepared ethnic food and then
suggests other types of prepared foods that could be adopted from
the group's fresh diet.<P> 
 
The report presents the various types of prepared foods marketed as
a given ethnic product, and suggests why there are so many or so
few and why some are included and others excluded.<P> 
 
The report discusses the buying and eating habits of ethnics, as
well as certain social and market factors that influence both
ethnics and nonethnics, that help to create consumer demand.<P> 
 
The report analyzes why some food processors have entered the
specific prepared ethnic foods market, why they have marketed
certain products and not others, and how their entrance in specific
markets contribute to market size and growth.<P> 
 

<b>SCOPE AND FORMAT</B><P> 
 
Each type of prepared ethnic food is described in terms of its
basis, such as grains, vegetables or dairy, and then presented as
it is offered to consumers in its prepared form - frozen,
refrigerated or shelf-stable. Then social and market factors
influencing consumer demand and manufacturing trends are discussed.<P>

 

<b>METHODOLOGIES</B><P>

Sales estimates and projections for each type of prepared ethnic
food were presented, some in both current markets from 1993 to 1998
and potential markets for just 1998. Estimates and projections were
developed from such factors as how long the ethnic groups have been
resident in this nation, their immigration rate, their degree of
dispersion around the nation, their buying and cooking habits and
attitudes toward prepared foods, and then how all these factors
shape the type and degree of exposure their foods will have for
nonethnics.<P> 
 
<b>INFORMATION SOURCES</B><P> 
 
BCC first conducted an extensive review of the secondary
literature, consisting of materials gathered from trade journals
and magazines, trade and professional associations, government and
industry sources, and company materials. Subsequently, some one
hundred telephone interviews were conducted with personnel in
technical, marketing and sales departments of large and small food
processors, importers and distributors.<P>

<B>STUDY GOAL AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>

Periodic media reports about the safety of wild fish caught in polluted
waters, the decline of some wild stocks through overfishing, and the growing
seafood component of the trade deficit have contributed to interest in
aquaculture. Water farming can provide such benefits as a year-round supply of
certain species once available only seasonally, and with consistent quality
and stable prices. Safety is also enhanced because the fish and shellfish are
grown under controlled conditions, with farmers monitoring water quality and
feeding.<P>

However, like land farming and animal husbandry, not all species can be
farmed. Species are geographically determined because water of certain types
and temperatures is needed, and not all farmable species will be commercially
viable. Moreover, for even those species which can be farm-raised, there can
be different types of constraints. For example, less costly imports are
impeding the growth of domestic shrimp farming, while it is disease that is
endangering the future industry of oysters grown on the east coast. Lack of
available and appropriate sites are also problems confronting new and
expanding farms of rainbow trout, salmon and shrimp.<P>


Once the site and species have been selected, the farmer has to control
production costs in order to remain competitive with the price of imports or
wild-caught fish, as well as deal with mortality from disease, pollution and
predators, and conflicts with recreational fishermen and environmentalists.<P>

The goal of this report is to understand how farmers of freshwater and marine
species are dealing with each type of situation or problem, and suggest what
this means for the future growth of aquaculture as an industry, as well as for
each farmed species.<P>

Farms are mostly small mom-and-pop operations, often growing only one species.
Often, however, some farms are part of large operations.  Some operations
serve their markets directly while others use wholesalers and distributors to
sell to end-user markets. In some cases, farms have processing facilities on-site. In other situations, processors have agreements with farmers who supply
them steadily  and/or serve as their marketing units.  Farmers as primary processors have a wide range of seafood suppliers serving as middlemen that help bring products to foodservice operators and retailers: secondary processors who prepare the fish in some ready-to-eat form, wholesaler/distributors, trader/brokers or importer/exporters. Some suppliers actually fulfill all these roles, handle many species, and buy from both farmers and commercial fishermen.<P>

In this report, fish and shellfish are categorized as freshwater or
marine/saltwater species. Freshwater varieties include catfish, crawfish,
rainbow trout, hybrid striped bass and tilapia.  Marine varieties include
salmon, shrimp, oysters, clams and mussels. These species are raised in
various types of onshore and offshore rearing units. Depending upon stage of
growth, some species can be grown onshore and then transferred into some type
of offshore unit for continued growth.<P>


<B>REASONS FOR DOING THE STUDY</B><P>

This report is designed to achieve the following objectives:<P>

<UL><LI>To identify which species are the most commercially viable for farmers,
processors and other types of seafood suppliers.<P>

<LI>To describe the domestic factors (geographical location, growing period,
market size, production costs, price and supply of wild stock) and
international competitive factors (price and supply of imports) that farmers
and suppliers must contend with in order to meet production costs and realize
a profit.<P>

<LI>To understand how consumer demand is shaped by regional tastes, income, age,
pricing, health attitudes and safety concerns, and how this demand promotes or
hinders the growth of individual species.<P>

<LI>To discuss the technological and regulatory trends that either foster or
retard the development of farming and marketing farmed fish and shellfish.<P>

<LI>To analyze the structure of the farming and supplier industry, how size and
complexity of farming operations can affect channels of distribution from farm
to end-user. To ascertain opportunities for food processors, suppliers,
cooperatives and farms.</UL><P>


<B>CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE STUDY</B><P>

BCC strives to provide insight into one key question:  With which species can
farmers and suppliers best achieve economic viability, by meeting production
costs and still keep prices competitive and affordable for end-users?  To this
end, the report:<P>

<UL><LI>Compares and contrasts freshwater and marine species in terms of domestic
    and international competitive factors that affect supply, pricing and the
    economic viability of domestic farmers;<P>

<LI>Discusses the demographic, social and economic factors, both in the U.S.
    and in foreign nations, that shape consumer demand for individual species
    from domestic farmers;<P>

<LI>Examines how marketing strategies used by farmers and processors can
    expand markets and satisfy needs and interests of different types of
    consumers, e.g. trading a species up or down to increase sales;<P>

<LI>Explores technological trends that can advance growth of aquaculture, and
    regulatory trends that can impede or promote the status of the industry;<P>

<LI>Describes how size of farming operation, number of species raised and
    marketing strategy influence the use and type of channels of distribution
    from farm to end-user.</UL><P>

<B>SCOPE AND FORMAT</B><P>

This study is confined to aquacultured products only insofar as they  are used
as a food source and not for any other purpose.  BCC discusses each freshwater
and marine species in terms of how it is farmed and produced, market outlook
for farmer and processor sales, market and driving forces influencing the
selection of species and growth of farming, industry structure and types of
suppliers, and international trade environment.<P>


<B>METHODOLOGIES</B><P>

BCC discusses each species in terms of type of rearing unit needed, water,
feeding, problems and conflicts that can arise, and marketing aspects. The
market outlook for each species is then discussed, presenting sales for
domestic farmers and processors, as well as imports and exports. Profiles of
certain farming operations are  presented, either because they are leaders in
their states or are doing something particularly new with a species. Major
suppliers of some farmed species are also described.<P>

BCC sales estimates and projections for each species were calculated according
to historical trends indicated in materials compiled by government and
industry sources, and/or evaluations discussed during interviews with farmers,
processors and other types of seafood suppliers. Some species are not tracked
by government or industry sources, either because they are just beginning to
be farmed or because figures are not broken down into farmed and wild-caught.
In these cases, estimates were made of the percentage of the total represented
by the farmed varieties.<P>


<B>INFORMATION SOURCES</B><P>

BCC first conducted an extensive review of the secondary literature,
consisting of materials gathered from trade journals and magazines, trade
associations, state promotional boards, government and industry sources, and
materials from farm operations and seafood suppliers. Subsequently, some one
hundred telephone interviews were conducted with farmers, marketing and sales
personnel at suppliers, as well as technical, research and development
personnel at farming operations and sea grant programs.<P>

</CENTER>

<B>STUDY GOAL AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>

This study indicates that there is increasing worldwide consumer
interest in weight control products and services because they are
related to healthful living as much as they are to controlling
weight. Specifically, the weight control industry is composed of
separate and distinct industries marketing foods, beverages,
medically and non-medically supervised weight loss programs, and
diet aids that an individual selects in a self-designed,
self-administered weight loss program.<P>

Studies report that the number of people actually on diets slightly
declines each year, suggesting that diet foods and beverages are
being used for purposes other than weight reduction. Consumers
choose diet brands, when available, as alternatives to regular
brands because they reduce or eliminate the intake of certain
ingredients associated with some health risks and disorders, as
well as caloric intake.<P>

For the individual serious about losing weight, there are other
choices in addition to consuming diet foods and beverages. They
include a wide range of supervised weight reduction programs in a
variety of settings, and self-selected diet aids in the form of
over-the-counter (OTC) meal-replacements and appetite suppressants.<P>


<B>REASONS FOR DOING THE STUDY</B><P>

* To learn how global media information influences the development
of attitudes regarding the link between obesity and health
disorders as well as the latest diet fad, and how this knowledge
subsequently influences buying decisions of certain diet products
and services.<P>

* To gain understanding of the multi-national, multi-faceted
consumer who strives to be fit on the one hand, and longs to
self-indulge in a calorie-laden taste pleasure pursuit on the
other, thereby enabling both market segments to grow in sales.<P>

* To analyze current diet foods and beverages that best suit
consumer needs in relation to societal and cultural trends, and
expected products from research and technological advances that can
further benefit weight control and health.<P>

* To compare and contrast supervised weight reduction  programs
designed for different types of overweight persons with varying
psychological, social and physiological needs, as well as time and
money allowances.<P>

* To describe the needs and goals of the self-directed dieter, the
various OTC choices available to meet those needs, and to suggest
how product selections are influenced by the success or failure of
food supplements used in the supervised programs.<P>

BCC recognizes the problems and criticisms that periodically bring
to the public's attention certain types of weight loss programs and
foods labelled as diet, low calorie, and the like.  Each situation
is usually characterized by an initial flurry of media coverage,
followed by rejoinders from the companies and persons involved, and
even promises of governmental scrutiny.  This high level of
activity reflects the public's interest in weight loss per se and
as it relates to health, as well as the size of the potential
market for all types of weight loss products and services.<P>


<B>CONTRIBUTION OF THE STUDY</B><P>

* Suggests the impact that health information and diet news have on
consumer buying patterns here and abroad, and how perceived health
and weight loss benefits can contribute to the sales growth of diet
products and services.<P>

* Provides insight into consumers as individuals with sometimes
seemingly contradictory tastes and preferences, so that
international marketers can better understand consumer motivations
and develop products and services to satisfy them.<P>

* Discusses diet foods and beverages that best fit into current
cultural, social and living patterns, and accordingly suggests
areas of growth or decline for specific products.<P>

* Delineates characteristics of the various medically and
non-medically supervised weight reduction programs, discusses their
components and how each is designed to meet certain consumer needs
and interests in the US and foreign markets.<P>

* Explores the motivations of the self-directed dieter, examines
the range of product choices in the OTC diet aid market and
suggests how the role of publicity and media information can
influence sales growth.<P>

<B>SCOPE AND FORMAT</B><P>

This report was confined to diet foods and beverages, supervised
weight control programs and self-administered OTC diet aids. These
products and services are promoted as aids in weight control and/or
healthful living, and marketers use such terms as "diet," "weight
loss," "weight control" or "weight reduction" to describe them<P>.


<B>METHODOLOGIES</B><P>

BCC describes each type of weight control product and service, then
evaluates it in terms of how it fits into various social trends --
current lifestyles, family and household composition, health
attitudes and varying consumer characteristics in the domestic and
foreign markets.<P>

When discussing weight control programs, BCC first estimates and
projects the number of severely and mildly overweight people who
might be interested in entering some type of weight reduction
program, develops average costs for each type of program, and
analyzes social and product trends within each in order to
formulate sales forecasts.<P>


<B>INFORMATION SOURCES</B><P>

BCC first conducted an extensive search of secondary sources,
including the business, consumer and health literature. This was
followed by more than one hundred telephone interviews, including
manufacturers of diet and weight control products, marketing,
technical and sales personnel in industry, trade and professional
associations, independent retailers and service providers. Where
precise information was difficult to ascertain, a common occurrence
in such a highly fragmented industry, BCC attempted to formulate
reasonable estimates and projections.<P>

<B>STUDY GOAL AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>

This BCC study sought to understand how flavor companies are
responding to the changing needs of food and beverage
manufacturers as they, in turn, respond to the shifting needs
and interests of consumers.<P>

The flavor industry is composed of flavor companies, of varying
size and scope, that develop flavors and flavor systems. Food
and beverage  makers are, essentially, in the flavor business,
too, because flavor is actually what they are selling in any
given product. The unique taste of an item is the chief
motivating factor for a consumer to make repeated purchases, and
allows the consumer to associate it with a particular
manufacturer's brand.<P>

Consumers seem to have an almost insatiable appetite for new
flavors incorporated in either new or existing products. But
while new, distinctive flavors have always given manufacturers
their competitive edge, recent techniques of processing,
packaging, and marketing have posed problems with flavor loss or
change that require the skills and expertise of flavor houses.
A customized solution, involving special flavoring substances
and ingredients, or techniques for flavor development, must be
developed in order to fit the individual requirements of that
particular application.<P>

By trying to satisfy consumer demands for more convenient and
healthful foods, while still maintaining flavor, manufacturers
are sometimes forced to look for ways to protect flavor quality.
Consumers want microwaveable, chilled/refrigerated and
shelf-stable foods that can be cooked in the microwave oven or
are otherwise easy to prepare and consume. Consumers also want
healthful versions of regular products that have their fat,
cholesterol, salt and sugar reduced or removed.<P>

For the purposes of this report, BCC has defined two distinct
markets shaped by these differing needs of manufacturers. The
generic flavor market includes those off-the-shelf flavors
developed by flavor companies that are available to all who
request them. The custom flavor market includes flavors
developed specifically upon request, available only to those
contracting for them. Customized flavors can be new flavors
meant to gain market share, or flavors developed as remedies for
a flavor problems.<P>


<B>REASONS FOR DOING THE STUDY</B><P>

To compare and contrast the various forces shaping the generic
and custom flavor markets, for food and beverage makers, in
order to understand what influences each market has on the
development of specific flavor types, food types and flavoring
substances.<P>

To identify the driving forces for flavor houses as they seek to
satisfy manufacturers by determining trends in consumer
preferences, finding new flavors and new sources for flavors,
discovering flavor substances and ingredients that maintain
flavor integrity as well as ensure safety, and devising ways to
protect flavor quality in each type of application that requires
an individualized solution.<P>

To determine the specific consumer attitudes and perceptions
linked to each type of flavor and food type so that flavor
companies and manufacturers can gain insight into how their
flavors and products are viewed in the public mind.<P>

To analyze the structure of the flavor industry, and the nature
and type of flavor houses, in order to gain insight into how
they are able to respond to the demands and concerns of food and
beverage makers.<P>


<B>CONTRIBUTION OF THE STUDY</B><P>

Suggests the demographic, social, economic, regional and
seasonal factors that can shape consumer preferences for
specific flavors, food types and flavoring substances, and how
manufacturers must respond to consumer needs of convenience and
foods with healthful benefits.<P>

Discusses the role of flavor houses and flavorists as they
combine their artistic and scientific skills to translate
consumer demands for various flavors and food types from food
and beverage makers, and accordingly suggests areas of growth or
decline for each type.<P>

Examines the impact of information on the development of
perceptions, and sometimes even misperceptions that, in turn,
influence the formation of consumer demands for given flavors
and food types.<P>

Analyzes the general atmosphere of secrecy and confidentiality
in the flavor industry, and how certain factors such as prices
for raw materials and regulations for manufacturers will
directly and indirectly affect the conduct of the industry's
business.<P>


<B>SCOPE AND FORMAT</B><P>

BCC has defined flavors as the finished flavor blend or mixture
that industrial users will incorporate into a commercially
prepared item,  ultimately to be purchased by a consumer in a
retail setting. We have confined this report to examining
industrial users only, the food and beverage manufacturers,
rather than including food service or retail/consumer users.
While all types of foods are considered, only soft drinks,
bottled waters and teas are considered for beverages.<P>


<B>METHODOLOGIES</B><P>

BCC describes the flavor types and food types in the generic and
custom markets, then evaluates each market in terms of how it is
being shaped by certain market forces exerted by consumers --
current lifestyles, population and social trends, and health
attitudes, exerted on industrial users, and how the latter are
calling upon flavor houses as a means of responding to
consumers.<P>

BCC first makes estimates and projects for the industrial
market, then by type of market for each type of industrial user,
and then used these breakdowns for further analyses of flavor
types, food types and flavoring substances.<P>


<B>INFORMATION SOURCES</B><P>

BCC first conducted an extensive search of the secondary
literature, including business, consumer and technical materials
from the trade and professional press and government sources.
Subsequently, we conducted more than one hundred telephone
interviews with flavor houses, food and beverage makers, and
suppliers, manufacturers and brokers of various substances and
ingredients.  Interviewees included marketing, sales and
technical personnel. Where precise information was difficult to
ascertain, a common phenomenon in such a highly secretive,
competitive business, BCC attempted to formulate reasonable
estimates and projections.<P>

</CENTER>

<B>STUDY GOAL AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>

The goal of this report is to understand how suppliers of
ingredients and additives for the dairy industry are responding to
the changing needs of dairy makers as they, in turn, respond to the
changing needs and interests of consumers of dairy products.<P>

At one time, consumers looked to dairy products as a nutritious,
wholesome part of their diets, and the sole consumer concern was
how a product tasted. However, an increasing body of scientific and
medical evidence pointing to the dangers of cancer risks of
chemicals used in foods, health risks of fat, cholesterol and salt,
and health and weight problems associated with sugar and fats, has
influenced the development of certain consumer attitudes toward
dairy foods. These attitudes have shaped preferences for what
consumers demand and expect from dairy products.<P>

Essentially, today's consumers are concerned with what is taken
out, left out, and put into dairy foods. But they also care
strongly about what is left in, and are unwilling to compromise on
flavor, texture, appearance and safety. With such strong consumer
demands and expectations, dairy makers have been forced to change
formulations, and they look to their suppliers to provide them with
the necessary materials.<P>

Suppliers, then, are required to develop and market ingredients and
additives that will enable dairy makers to deliver products that
meet consumer demands. The supplier industry is highly fragmented
and composed of flavor houses, food and dairy processors -- some
with ingredient divisions -- ingredient suppliers and growers,
chemical and pharmaceutical companies. Any one type of company can
be involved in marketing one or more kinds of substances.<P>

In this report, BCC has defined ingredients and additives as those
substances that can change or improve a product component, namely
its flavor, texture, color-appearance, safety and nutritional
value. Further, ingredients are defined as those substances used
for their flavoring properties, and which could be consumed on
their own, such as a fruit.  Additives are defined as substances
used for their technological effects, not to be consumed on their
own, and include all natural and synthetic substances used for
flavoring, texture, color, as preservatives (mold/yeast inhibitors)
and as nutrients (vitamins).<P>

<B>REASONS FOR DOING THE STUDY</B><P>

The report was designed:<P>

<MENU><LI>To identify specific areas of concern for consumers
     regarding health, nutrition and food safety, and analyze
     how these concerns affect consumption of various dairy
     products.<P>

<LI>To gain understanding of consumer interests in product
     appeal, flavor, nutrition, safety and healthful, light
     versions of regular products and to suggest how these
     interests affect ingredients and additives marketed by
     suppliers and used by dairy makers.<P>

<LI>To learn how the economic, regulatory and technological
     climate helps or hinders dairy makers in the development
     of products that consumers want.<P>

<LI>To analyze the role of supplier as problem-solver, and
     the structure of the supplier industry as it tries to
     help dairy makers develop products that consumers demand
     by providing functional, cost- competitive ingredients
     and additives.</MENU><P>

<B>CONTRIBUTION OF THE STUDY</B><P>

BCC sought to provide insight into one key question: How can
suppliers help dairy makers( and with what types of ingredients and
additives) develop and market products that satisfy consumer
demands? The study:<P>

<MENU><LI>Discusses the medical, health, demographic, social and
     economic influences that contribute to the development of
     attitudes and preferences about the components of dairy
     products, and how they affect consumption patterns.<P>

<LI>Suggests how these consumption patterns will affect the
     markets for certain ingredients and additives required by
     dairy makers from suppliers, and how these markets could
     grow or decline in the future.<P>

<LI>Examines how the prices of raw materials, the force of
     regulations,  research and technological developments can
     limit or aid dairy makers in the development of products.<P>

<LI>Describes how suppliers are similarly constrained or
     helped in their pursuit of ingredients and additives that
     could solve development problems for dairy makers.</MENU><P>

The insights and conclusions developed in this study can be of
value to suppliers who are trying to meet the needs of dairy makers
who are themselves trying to understand what consumers want from
dairy foods. This information can serve as a guide to suppliers who
must develop ingredients and additives that will best serve their
clients.<P>

<B>SCOPE AND FORMAT</B><P>

BCC has confined this report to examining the need for ingredients
and additives only for processed dairy products and excluding fluid
milk products. Included for consideration are cultured products,
such as cottage cheese, sour cream and yogurts; processed cheese
and cheese products; frozen desserts, such as ice cream, ice milk,
frozen yogurt, frozen dairy desserts, novelty bars, sticks and
cones.<P>

Further, BCC is concerned with the non-milk solid components of
these products. Specifically, the flavor section deals with all
those ingredients and additives meant to influence taste. The
texture section is chiefly concerned with "light" products, the
textural changes occurring from the reduction or removal of fat,
cholesterol, sugar and salt, and how fat replacers, sugar
substitutes and bulking agents are compensating for the losses. The
section dealing with colors describes the various natural and
certified colors used in dairy products. The section on
preservatives includes only mold/yeast inhibitors, and the section
on nutrients discusses only vitamins.<P>

<B>METHODOLOGIES</B><P>

BCC describes the ingredients and additives used in each component
of dairy products, then evaluates each in terms of how it is being
shaped by consumer demands, then discusses how dairy makers are
working to satisfy these demands and how suppliers are responding
to the needs of dairy makers. Estimates and projections of sales
for ingredients and additives were calculated according to expected
growth or decline in  consumption patterns of certain dairy
products, and the perceived  need for substances in these products
in relation to various consumer, dairy manufacturing and supplier
trends.<P>

<B>INFORMATION SOURCES</B><P>

BCC first conducted an extensive review of the secondary
literature, and obtained materials from trade and professional
associations, government and industry sources and company reports.
This review was followed up with one hundred telephone interviews
with personnel in technical, quality control, marketing and sales
departments and food science and with dairy researchers working at
academic sites.<P>

<B>STUDY GOALS AND OBJECTIVES</B>


<P>This study is designed to provide facts and highlight issues to help you make better
business decisions -- to help you discover farm machinery opportunities through
information on:</P>

         <P>1.       Trends in domestic farm machinery demands</P>

         <P>2.       How the industry is structured, and how it's changing</P>

         <P>3.       Emerging farm machinery technology</P>

         <P>4.       The impact of new laws and regulations</P>

         <P>5.       What equipment is hot and what's not</P>

         <P>6.       Major shifts in the worldwide farm machinery trade.</P>


<B>REASONS FOR THE STUDY</B>

<P>One, changing domestic farming practices are dramatically changing the demands for
farm machinery.  Economics and regulations, such as the Conservation Compliance
Provision and various environmental laws, will continue to drive farmers to purchase
different types of machines.</P>

<P>Second, new farm machinery technology is emerging, such as sensors that more
accurately measure soil fertility and other field conditions, navigation systems
operating from space satellites that locate the tractor's field position, and precision
devices controlling tillage, seeding, and chemical applications.</P>

<P>Third, farm machinery sales have been slow for several years, farmers have postponed
machinery purchases, and the stock of farm machinery is aging.  How long can the
trend continue?  When will the market turn around?</P>

<P>Fourth, worldwide food demands are growing, but the availability of additional arable
and irrigated lands are limited.  Since crop yields can't be easily increased through
more chemicals without environmental degradation, use of more farm machinery may
well be the answer.  Also globalization and liberalization of markets are having an
impact on farm machinery trade.</P>

<P>Moreover, most of the major farm machinery manufacturers also produce construction
equipment such as bulldozers, graders, etc. -- equipment used in building highways,
railroads, and utility lines.  The demand for this type of equipment should improve
by 1994 as Clinton's program for rebuilding the country's infrastructure is
implemented.  Chapter VIII on company profiles provides information on the extent
to which individual farm machinery firms produce construction equipment.</P>

<B>SCOPE AND FORMAT</B>

<P>This study covers primarily machinery used in field crop production and harvesting -
- tillage, seeding, chemical applicators, cultivators, haymaking, and combines.  To a
lesser degree, it covers irrigation equipment.  It does not cover post harvesting,
livestock, or dairy equipment.  All statistics refer to new as opposed to used machinery
unless otherwise noted.  In the report the term "farm machinery" usually means farm
machinery and equipment.</P>

<B>METHODOLOGY</B>

<P>This research is based on a review of the literature, a survey of knowledgeable people,
and collection and analysis of statistics -- the various sources listed in the next
section.  A survey was made of experts in major agricultural producing states.   The
experts include more than 120 county agricultural extension agents plus agricultural
economists, agricultural and mechanical engineers, farm equipment dealers,
manufacturers, and other specialists.   Discussions were held with officials of: USDA,
Department of Commerce, various think tanks, trade associations, Congressional staff,
the World Bank, and USAID.  In addition, time series and regression analysis were
used to project demand.</P>

</CENTER>

<B>STUDY GOAL AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>

     The goal of this  report is to understand  how suppliers  of
     nutritional ingredients and  additives used by food and
     beverage makers are responding  to their changing needs, as
     they in turn, respond to the changing needs and preferences of
     increasingly health-conscious consumers.<P>

     Although taste  is still king, consumers have been paying more
     and more  attention to  what they eat and how it affects their
     health. With  health professionals  advising consumers what to
     consume and  what to  avoid, the media highlighting the latest
     scientific and medical evidence about substances in foods that
     pose health risks, and the government taking a direct interest
     in food  labeling and  health claims,  the consumer has become
     highly aware  of what  goes into food and what should be taken
     out.<P>

     This heightened  awareness has  influenced the  development of
     attitudes, preferences  and  demands  for  certain  foods  and
     beverages. Today's consumers want products that promote health
     by providing  the extra  bonus  of  nutrition  and  protective
     influences against certain disorders.<P>

     Foods and  beverage makers can foster this desired wellness in
     two basic ways. One way is to fortify products with substances
     that provide  protective influences  against certain  diseases
     and conditions.  These protective  substances are  included in
     two groups.  One group  includes currently marketed fortifiers
     that  are  accepted  by  health  professionals  as  protective
     influences, such  as vitamins,  minerals, proteins,  fiber and
     omega-3 oils. The other group includes substances still in the
     research stage,  such as  extracts of  garlic, certain spices,
     caffeine and  tea, to  determine if  they can be extracted for
     later incorporation  as protective  influences into  so-called
     designer foods.<P>

     The second  way to  market healthful  products is to reduce or
     remove those  ingredients that  are related  to health  risks.
     Fat, cholesterol,  sugar and  salt are ingredients linked with
     such conditions  as cancer, heart disease, obesity and related
     problems, and  hypertension. In  order for  consumers to lower
     their intake  of these ingredients, manufacturers must develop
     "light" versions  of the  products containing  them, and  this
     requires  the   use  of   various  types   of  replacers   and
     substitutes.<P>

     While the  consumer does  want to  reap health  benefits  from
     foods, this  does not  mean that  there can be any compromises
     with flavor, texture and appearance. In order to fully satisfy
today's savvy  consumers, manufacturers  must offer  all these
characteristics  in   addition  to   health   benefits.   This
formidable task,  then, falls  to  suppliers  to  develop  the
substances that  will enable  manufacturers  to  deliver  what
consumers want.<P>

The highly fragmented supplier  industry is composed of small
companies  serving  niche  markets,  and  giant  companies  or
company divisions  that offer  the whole  range of nutritional
ingredients  and   additives.   Suppliers   include   chemical
companies, food  and beverage makers, ingredient suppliers and
flavor houses.<P>

In this  report, BCC  has defined ingredients and additives as
those substances  that  can  change  or  improve  a  product's
nutritional and  health value  either  by  theirtcw  addition,
reduction or  removal. In  some cases,  the  terms  were  used
interchangeably, but  generally the  additives  refer  to  the
current and  future protective  substances  incorporated  into
products, while  the ingredients  refer to the substances that
are to be reduced or removed.<P>


<B>REASONS FOR DOING THE STUDY</B><P>

The report was designed:<P>

<MENU><LI>To  identify  specific  areas  of  concern  to  consumers
     regarding  nutrition,   health   promotion,   risks   and
     benefits, and  analyze how  these  concerns  have  shaped
     attitudes that,  in  turn,  have  influenced  buying  and
     consumption patterns of foods and beverages.<P>

<LI>To gain understanding of consumer demands that influence
     consumption patterns  in order  to suggest  how they will
     affect  manufacturers   who  will   ultimately  rely   on
     suppliers to  provide them with the necessary ingredients
     and additives.<P>

<LI>To learn how  the  social,  economic,  regulatory  and
     technological environment  aid or hamper manufacturers in
     the development  and marketing  of  products  that  would
     satisfy consumer demand.<P>

<LI>To analyze  the role  of suppliers,  the structure of the
     supplier  industry,  and  indicate  how  the  efforts  of
     suppliers are  moving in  various directions  in order to
     develop the  ingredients and additives needed by food and
     beverage makers.</MENU><P>


<B>CONTRIBUTION OF THE STUDY</B><P>

BCC sought to provide insight into one key question:  How, and
with what types of ingredients and additives, can suppliers
serve food and beverage  makers interested in satisfying
consumer demands for healthful and health-promoting products?<P>

<MENU><LI>Discusses  the   medical,  health,  social,  demographic,
     marketing and  economic influences  that  shape  consumer
     preferences and  demands for  foods  and  beverages  that
     foster good  health and  reduce the  harmful  effects  of
     certain ingredients.<P>

<LI>Suggests how  consumer  shifts  in  attitudes  result  in
     shifts  in  consumption  patterns  that  will  ultimately
     affect manufacturers' higher or lower demands for certain
     ingredients and additives from suppliers.<P>

<LI>Examines the  key ingredients and additives as related to
     factors, such  as price,  functionality, caloric content,
     ability to cause flavor or texture problems, and how they
     affect choices  made by  food and  beverage  makers  from
     their suppliers.<P>

<LI>Analyzes such  market forces as regulations, research and
     technology,  and   how  they  either  advance  or  retard
     development of  new, and  growth of existing, ingredients
     and additives  that suppliers  can provide  to  food  and
     beverage makers.</MENU><P>

The insights and conclusions reached in  this study can be
valuable to suppliers of food ingredients to food and beverage
makers.  They can help them develop  products that will enable
the latter to stay competitive or even gain a competitive
edge.<P>


<B>SCOPE AND FORMAT</B><P>

BCC has  confined this  report to  examining only  nutritional
ingredients and  additives, those current or future substances
that can either promote health through fortification, or serve
as replacers  for substances  reduced or  removed in  order to
minimize health risks.<P>

The first  section deals with the vitamins, minerals and
proteins that are current,  familiar  fortifiers.  The next
section deals with some recently identified fortifiers in use,
namely fiber and omega-3 oils, as well as those natural
protective substances  that are being researched for their
value as future fortifiers. The final section is called risk-
reducers because the ingredients related to health risks are
reduced or removed and are replaced with a variety of
substances, including full and partial fat replacers,
artificial sweeteners, bulking agents and salt substitutes.<P>


<B>METHODOLOGIES</B><P>

BCC describes the ingredients and additives in each section by
evaluating each in terms  of its health benefits or risks for
consumers, the need for fortification or replacement of each,
its nutritional and functional value for manufacturers and any
disadvantages or  technical problems each can pose, its use in
processed foods  and beverages,  and the market forces shaping
consumer interests.  Then, there is discussion of how food and
beverage makers are trying to satisfy these demands, what they
require from  their suppliers, and how suppliers are trying to
develop the  desired substances.  Estimates and projections of
sales  for   each  ingredient  and  additive  were  calculated
according to  expected growth  or decline  in  consumption  of
certain foods  and beverages;  taking into account advantages,
disadvantages, limitations,  price and  technical problems for
manufacturers,   health    problems   for    consumers;    and
manufacturing and supplier trends that exert influence on each
substance.<P>

<B>STUDY GOAL AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>

The main goal of this study is to provide a guide to business
opportunities in the new convenience food industry.  It examines
each of the major categories of convenience foods, discusses past
trends, and details the prospects for future growth.<P>

A secondary goal is to inform readers in business and government
about the new convenience food industry. This industry is not
tracked as a separate category by any trade association, government
agency, or company.  Data were gathered through firsthand
interviews with experts in business, government, and on Wall
Street, in addition to primary sources such as company data,
libraries, and private research reports.<P>

This comprehensive study:<P>

<DD>1) Defines the new convenience food industry;<BR>
<DD>2) Provides insight into technological developments and their
   impact on the industry;<BR>
<DD>3) Examines each segment of the industry and its relationship to
   the industry as a whole;<BR>
<DD>4) Explores government regulation of the food industry as it
   relates to new convenience foods;<BR>
<DD>5) Analyzes the industry by types of companies involved, areas
   of fast and slow growth, and influencing factors, including
   mergers and acquisitions, the environmental movement, the
   economic climate, and research and development;<BR>
<DD>6) Examines the impact of consumption trends on the new
   convenience food industry;<BR>
<DD>7) Discusses international developments and their relationship
   to the U.S. convenience food industry;<BR>
<DD>8) Makes informed forecasts about the direction of the industry
   as a whole, and of individual segments.<P>


<B>REASONS FOR DOING THE STUDY</B><P>

This study to provides an in-depth guide to the past, present and
future of the new convenience food industry, and identifies
business and marketing opportunities for those involved in the
industry.<P>

The study was also done because there is no single source of
information on the convenience food industry.  Some industry
segments, such as frozen foods, are tracked by trade associations
and the government.  However, there is no "umbrella" source for
data on convenience foods, partly because the category (as defined
in this report) is relatively new, having emerged in tandem with
the microwave oven.<P>

Changing American lifestyles are increasingly putting a premium on
quick preparation of food.  Two income families, single parents,
school-age children home alone, and other lifestyle changes have
worked to make the convenience factor crucial in food preparation,
superseding price in many instances as the most important factor in
deciding which foods to buy.<P>

At the same time, food technology and the popularity of the
microwave oven have substantially improved the quality of
convenience foods, and made preparation quicker and easier in the
average kitchen of the average consumer.<P>


<B>CONTRIBUTION OF THE STUDY AND FOR WHOM</B><P>

This study focuses on the industry these developments have created,
and, where appropriate, identifies marketing opportunities that are
developing as the industry evolves.<P>

This study is intended for those in the private and public sector
who need to know about, or have an interest in, new convenience
foods, including securities analysts, food company executives, food
researchers, trade association executives, specialty librarians,
government regulators, and others with a need to be informed about
cutting-edge developments in the food business.<P>


<B>SCOPE AND FORMAT</B><P>

This study aims to cover the entire new convenience food industry,
which includes new prepared foods that put a premium on quickness
of preparation.  In many instances, this means microwavable.  For
example, in the area of new frozen convenience foods, the
definition of convenience is that the food is intended primarily
for the microwave oven.  This is also true for most new chilled and
shelf-stable convenience foods.<P>

The format of the study is a chapter-by-chapter treatment of each
of the main categories of new convenience foods, including:<P>

<MENU>New frozen convenience foods<BR>
   New chilled convenience foods<BR>
   New sous vide convenience foods<BR>
   New shelf-stable convenience foods<BR>
   New aseptically packaged foods<BR>
   New microwavable snacks<BR>
   New processed meats, poultry, and seafood<BR>
   New convenience dairy foods</MENU><P>

The study also contains chapters on government regulation, the next
generation of convenience foods, the structure of the industry, and
the most important companies in the industry.<P>


<B>METHODOLOGY</B><P>

The methodology used in the preparation of this study was to gather
data from as wide a range as possible of primary and secondary
sources, then organize the data, prepare an outline, and write the
report.  As the need arose, supplementary information was sought in
the process of writing this report.  In preparing the tables, all
of the forecases were made in current dollars.<P>


<B>SOURCES OF INFORMATION</B><P>

This study was prepared using both primary and secondary sources of
information.  Primary sources included personal and telephone
interviews with government officials, company executives, trade
association executives, researchers in private industry and at
universities, securities analysts, and other food experts.<P>

Secondary sources included magazines, trade journals, investment
house research reports, other research reports, government reports,
newspapers, electronic data bases, annual reports, filings with the
Securities and Exchange Commission, and other written material.<P>

<B>STUDY GOAL AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>

The recession  and increasing  competition  among  foodservice
establishments, either  as single  factors or  in combination,
have affected  foodservice sales in commercial, non-commercial
and institutional markets. This report analyzes and quantifies
how these   segments  are responding with marketing strategies
designed to  change menus,  styles, price,  and on-premise and
off-premise services  in order  to attract  an  ever-shrinking
number of  consumers willing  to spend money on food away from
home.<P>

The recession  has affected  customer traffic  levels  at  all
types of  facilities as  people choose  not to  spend money on
food away from home, or attend activities where foodservice is
provided. Lower  customer traffic levels have been reported at
separate eating  places and  retailing sites.  Lower occupancy
rates at  lodging places, lower attendance at some leisure and
recreational sites,  and lower volume of business and pleasure
travelers have affected in-transit foodservice.<P>

In  addition,   the  recession   has   caused   business   and
institutions to  suffer budget  and staff cutbacks that reduce
customer volume.  For example,  fewer employees at offices and
factories  mean   fewer  customers   for  on-premise  employee
cafeterias, mobile  carts and  vending machines, as well as at
nearby, off-premise commercial eating places.<P>

Hospitals are closing, keeping patients for shorter stays, and
reducing  personnel   which  affect  patient  and  non-patient
foodservice.   Subsidy cuts  at schools  mean fewer  lunch and
breakfast programs.  Even military  foodservice is  slated  to
suffer because of base closings and personnel cutbacks.<P>

More pervasive  is the  lack of confidence in the economy that
makes consumers  spend less,  once they  have decided to spend
money on  food away  from home. Changing patterns can be noted
as consumers  scale down  by going  to less  expensive  eating
places and trade down by ordering less costly items. Corporate
and social  party planners,  too, are asking caterers for less
elaborate menus and service.<P>

The competition  from the  increasing  number  of  foodservice
sites has  meant that  many  different  types  of  places  are
serving similar  menus and  providing similar services. Eating
places that once had a specific menu identity are now blurring
their images as they expand menus to attract customers looking
for greater  variety. Similarly, many establishments providing
only eat-in  service  are  now  looking  at  such  off-premise
activities as  takeout, delivery,  mobile and social catering,
in order to reach customers that might not visit the premises.
Even on-premise  services are changing as places move to self-
service, buffets, casual dining or fast food operations.<P>

In order  to maintain  the high  profits  of  the  foodservice
industry, where  wholesale value  can  range  from  33-55% of  sales, operators have been forced to rethink their marketing strategies.   The  newly focused  aim is to meet the needs, interests  and lifestyles of today's consumers who have certain perceptions  and expectations  about the experience of eating outside  the home.  Foodservice operators  seek to make their settings  more appealing  to  consumers  so  that  after entering, they  will upgrade  to items with higher prices, and
then, perhaps,  take advantage  of a  variety  of  convenience services offered for off-premise consumption.<P>

In  this  report,  BCC  defines  three  market  segments:  The
commercial segment  includes those places where foodservice is
the  prime  activity  (separate  eating  and  drinking  places
located at  various fixed  sites, independent caterers, mobile
caterers  and   vending  machines).  Separate  eating  places,
include various  types of  restaurants/lunchrooms, cafeterias,
fast food  places, ice cream/frozen yogurt shops, and drinking
places (bars and taverns serving food).<P>

The non-commercial  and institutional  segments include places that provide   foodservice  as  a  secondary  activity.  Non-commercial foodservice  is provided  at business  and industry sites, as  a transportation/in-transit service, and at various leisure, recreation and   sports   sites.   Institutional foodservice is  provided at  educational, healthcare, military and prison facilities.<P>

With so  many different  types of  facilities within segments,
the foodservice  industry is  a highly  fragmented industry in
which chains,  independent/family-owned  businesses,  contract
feeders and  self-operating facilities  tend to  specialize in
certain market segments.<P>


<B>REASONS FOR DOING THE STUDY</B><P>

This report is designed to achieve the following objectives:<P>

<UL>  (1) To understand how recession and competition have affected
     foodservice facilities,  and to  identify the  changes in
     menu, service, style, price and off-premise services that
     have been  subsequently developed  in order  to  maintain
     profits.<P>

  (2) To describe  how foodservice  is used as a marketing tool
     in places  where it is not the prime activity, such as at
     lodging places, retailers, drinking places, sports arenas
     and   institutional    facilities,   and   how   consumer
     expectations and  tastes are influenced by foodservice in
     places for which it is a prime activity.<P>

  (3) To learn  what consumer  perceptions  and  attitudes  are
     toward quality  and how certain marketing strategies will
     promote  or  retard  traffic  volume  and  sales  growth,
     particularly at  those sites  which are not linked in the
     public mind with quality foodservice -- vending machines,
     convenience   stores,    railroads,    healthcare,    and
     educational institutions.<P>

  (4) To analyze which marketing strategies best fit the needs,
     interests, and lifestyle demands of today's consumers, in
     each type of foodservice facility.<P></UL>

<B>CONTRIBUTION OF THE STUDY</B><P>

BCC seeks to provide insight into one key question: What types
of menus,  on and off-premise services, styles and prices must
foodservice operators offer in order to encourage consumers to
spend money  on food  away from  home, and patronize any given
establishment?<P>

The study  discusses the  recessionary and competitive factors
most directly  influencing each  type of  foodservice facility
within each  market segment,  as well  as the most influential
market forces,  consumer attitudes  and  demographic  factors.
Further, sales  for  segments  and  subsegments,  most  active
companies   and    ownership/management    arrangements    are
delineated.<P>

The insights  and conclusions  reached in this study can be of
special value  and import  to foodservice operators looking to
expand current  facilities or  enter new markets, and food and
equipment suppliers  interested  in  learning  where  business
opportunities may lie.<P>


<B>SCOPE AND FORMAT</B><P>

BCC confines  this report  to examining  foodservice  only  in
terms of the delivery and sales of foods and beverages, rather
than  specific   types   of   each   at   various   types   of
establishments. Foods  and beverages  are  described  as  they
relate to  marketing  strategies  designed  to  meet  consumer
preferences and  interests at  different types  of foodservice
operations in the three major market segments.<P>


<B>METHODOLOGIES</B><P>

BCC  describes   foodservice  facilities  within  each  market
segment, their market conditions shaped by recessionary and/or
competitive factors,  and subsequent  marketing strategies  to
sustain growth.  Estimates and  projections are  made for each
type  of   facility,  and   where  applicable,   by   consumer
demographics,  type   of  dining,   and  on   and  off-premise
activities. Sales  and market analyses are based upon previous
rates of sales growth, expectations of expansion in the number
of units,  marketability, effectiveness and competitiveness of
marketing strategies, and various consumer factors.<P>


<B>INFORMATION SOURCES</B><P>

BCC first  conducted an  extensive  review  of  the  secondary
literature by  gathering materials from the library, trade and
professional associations,  government and  industry  sources.
This review  was  then  followed  up  with  some  one  hundred
telephone interviews  with personnel  in marketing,  sales and
marketing communications  departments of  companies owning  or
operating foodservice establishments.<P>

</CENTER>

<B>STUDY GOAL AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>

Changing consumer  interests  and  needs  have  brought  about
changes in preferences for certain types of food. At one time,
consumers asked  only that  a food look appealing, taste good,
and  keep  them  nourished    until  the  next  meal.  Today's
consumers, however,  are demanding  more from food processors,
so food processors are demanding more from their suppliers.<P>

Media  messages   from  health  professionals  and  government
agencies make  consumers aware  that food  content can  be  an
instrument for  good or  ill health.  This does  not mean that
taste and  overall quality  are now  secondary  considerations
because the  ever-demanding consumer  wants no  sacrifice in a
product's flavor, texture, or appearance.<P>

Rather, these  traditional requirements  now head  the list of
additional demands:  that foods  provide nutritional benefits,
eliminate or  reduce health  risks by removing or reducing fat
and  sugar  levels,  contain  only  natural  ingredients  that
replace chemicals  in food that could pose health dangers, and
cook equally  well  in  both  conventional  and  fast-heating,
convenient  microwave   ovens  so   that  coping  with  hectic
lifestyles can be facilitated.<P>

Food processors  look to  their suppliers  for the ingredients
needed to  develop products  that will  satisfy these  varying
consumer demands.   The  task set  for suppliers is to develop
and market  ingredients that  are  the  functional  and  price
equivalents of  ingredients with  which  food  processors  are
familiar, so  that ease  of use is maximized and reformulation
is minimized.<P>

The goal  of this  report is  to understand  how suppliers  of
gums,        starches/starch         maltodextrins,        and
emulsifiers/emsulfier-types are  responding to  these  varying
demands from  food processors.  The  supplier  industry  is  a
highly fragmented  one, composed of such companies as chemical
companies manufacturing  raw materials,  flavor and stabilizer
houses, millers,  food processors  with ingredient  divisions,
and an array of middlemen serving as importers and brokers.<P>

In  this   report,  BCC   defines  four   main   food   types:
conventional,  lowfat/fat-free,  microwave-specific,  and  low
sugar/sugar-free.   In a  section devoted  to each  food type,
there are descriptions of gums, starches, and emulsifiers that
suppliers are  recently marketing  to food  processors.  These
can be  either familiar  ones with  improved functional values
and/or  intended   for  new  use,  or  totally  new  types  of
ingredients for use in new food applications.<P>

The ingredients  are  broadly  described  in  terms  of  their
marketing and  promotional characteristics.  Some  ingredients
are marketed  as generic  and have  applicability to  all food
types. Suppliers  do not necessarily promote these ingredients
for their  effectiveness in  one food  type over  another, but
rather recommend  when requested  from food processors what an
ingredient can  or cannot  do. Specialty ingredients, however,
are developed  as finished products and, usually, are intended
for use  in one  or more  specific food applications. Some can
also be recommended for use in one or more food types.<P>


<B>REASONS FOR DOING THE STUDY</B><P>

This report is designed to achieve the following objectives:<P>

<UL><LI>To identify  consumer  interests,  needs,  concerns,  and
     preferences for  certain food types and applications, and
     analyze  how   they  shape  demands  and  attitudes  that
     influence consumption and sales.<P>

<LI>To gain insight into how these consumer demands influence
     food processors  in their  development of  products,  and
     suggest how  processors, in  turn, make  demands on their
     suppliers to  provide them  with ingredients  that can be
     used as marketing tools.<P>

<LI>To  delineate   the  social,  economic,  regulatory,  and
     technological  climate   that  either  helps  or  hinders
     development and marketing of products by food processors,
     and how  the outcome  ultimately  affects  the  level  of
     demand from suppliers.<P>

<LI>To analyze  the role of suppliers, the structure of their
     industry, how  and why  they market a specific ingredient
     as generic or specialty, and to show how the intensity of
     development activity  moves in  tandem with  the pressure
     from food processors.<P></UL>


<B>CONTRIBUTION OF THE STUDY</B><P>

<UL><LI> BCC seeks to provide insight into one key question:  How,
     and with  which gums,  starches/starch maltodextrins, and
     emulsifiers/emulsifier-types, can  suppliers best provide
     food processors interested in satisfying consumer demands
     for a  broad range  of  quality,  healthful,  convenient,
     reasonably priced foods?  Furthermore the report:<P>

<LI> Discusses the  demographic,  social,  technological,  and
     regulatory factors  that influence  consumer demands  for
     foods that are flavorful, are appealing in appearance and
     texture, promote  good health,  are easy  to prepare, and
     meet needs  for self-reward  and even  a new and exciting
     eating experience.<P>

<LI> Suggests how  consumer attitudes and perceptions not only
     influence consumption  of certain foods, but also the use
     of ingredients  that are cited on labels and perceived as
     helpful or  harmful to  health, and  how that  ultimately
     affects demand from suppliers.<P>

<LI> Explores  the  additional  influences  of  functionality,
     price, nutritional benefits, caloric content, and ability
     to cause  flavor or  texture problems on the selection of
     ingredients by food processors   from their suppliers.<P>

<LI> Examines  how  such  market  forces  as  regulations  and
     technological advances, both within the food industry and
     without (such  as in the packaging industry), can advance
     or hamper the development of foods by food processors and
     the demand for ingredients from suppliers.<P></UL>


<B>SCOPE AND FORMAT</B><P>

This report  examines how gums, starches/starch maltodextrins,
and emulsifiers/emulsifier-types  are being  used and marketed
as ingredients  in conventional,  lowfat/fat-free,  microwave-
specific, and low sugar/sugar-free foods.<P>

The first section deals with these ingredients used in a broad
range of  conventional foods.  The next  section describes how
some of  these ingredients  are being  marketed  as  specialty
ingredients for  use as  fat replacers,  while others  are the
same  generic   substances  used   in  other  food  types  but
recommended for use in lowfat/fat-free applications.<P>

The third section discusses microwave-specific foods, designed
for cooking  only in  the microwave  oven, and the generic and
specialty ingredients  used in  their development  in order to
overcome certain  deficits of  microwave cooking.   The fourth
and final  section deals  with low  sugar/sugar-free foods and
how these ingredients are being used with sugar substitutes.<P>

This  report   describes  the  ingredients  in  terms  of  how
suppliers  are  promoting  them  as  recent  developments  for
generic or  specialty use,  their functional  value in certain
applications, their  nutritional  and  price  advantages,  and
other positive  or negative factors that could influence usage
by food  processors.   It then  discusses how consumer demands
are shaped by various demographic and social factors which, in
turn, become  demands placed  upon food  processors to develop
and market  specific types  of foods. The discussion continues
with a  description of  how suppliers  are responding  to food
processors with   ingredients that will enable food processors
to deliver foods to satisfy consumers.<P>


<B>METHODOLOGIES</B><P>

Estimates and projections of sales for each type of ingredient
were calculated  according to  various factors,  such as sales
for main product applications and expansion of applications as
new product introductions due to such factors as technological
advances in  packaging or ingredients, taking into account the
functional,   price,   supply,   nutritional,   and   consumer
perceptual advantages and disadvantages for each.<P>


<B>INFORMATION SOURCES</B><P>
BCC first  conducted an  extensive  review  of  the  secondary
literature  consisting   of  materials   gathered  from  trade
journals and  magazines, trade  and professional associations,
government  and   industry  sources,   and  company   reports.
Subsequently, one  hundred telephone interviews were conducted
with personnel  in technical,  marketing, sales,  research and
development departments of food processors and suppliers.<P>

<B>STUDY GOAL AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>

In recent  years the  escalating costs  of  health  care  have
shifted the  focus from treatment of diseases to prevention by
promoting   wellness   and   overall   good   health.   Health
professionals, nutritionists,  government and special interest
groups have  sought to  educate consumers  about the values of
vitamins, minerals,  proteins and  amino acids  in  the  diet,
obtained   from   fortified   foods   or   dietary/nutritional
supplements.<P>

Media  attention  directed  toward  specific  nutrients,  when
research discovers  linkages with  specific disorders, further
heightens consumer awareness of health benefits. Awareness and
knowledge is  then  translated  into  positive  attitudes  and
consumer demands  from food and beverage makers and supplement
marketers.<P>

Foods and  beverages are  fortified to  compensate for  losses
during their  manufacturing, and  because processors  want  to
market nutrition.   Maintaining  the nutritional integrity and
quality of  products is now of prime importance to processors,
even when  foods appear  healthful in  non-nutrient ways.  For
example, the  new  lowfat  foods  are  responses  to  consumer
demands  for   reducing  health  risks.  However,  fat-soluble
vitamins are  removed with  the fat, and minerals and proteins
are removed  along with  dairy products  removed for lower fat
content. Food  processors use  health as  a key marketing tool
would be interested in adding lost nutrients.<P>

Supplement  makers   are  also  compensating  for  losses  and
marketing nutrition.  They offer  consumers the opportunity to
make up  for real or perceived losses in the diet. Supplements
provide  higher   potencies  of   nutrients  than  regular  or
fortified foods,  allow for  an easier  way to  obtain  higher
amounts  of  nutrients  believed  to  provide  greater  health
benefits, and  allow  consumers  to  believe  that  are  doing
something positive for their health.<P>

The sources  from which  nutrients are  derived  can  also  be
important to  consumers. Health professionals stress lower fat
intake from  animal sources  in the  diet and higher intake of
vegetable and  plant  sources.  Consumers  have  responded  by
demanding ingredients derived from vegetable and plant sources
for use  as fortifiers  and in  dietary supplements.  Consumer
interest in  natural ingredients  to reduce health risks posed
by the  use of  chemicals has  also meant manufacturing use of
ingredients  linked   in  the  public  mind  with  health  and
nutrition.<P>

Suppliers of vitamins, minerals, proteins and amino acids play
a key  role in  satisfying consumer demands. Food and beverage
makers, as  well as  dietary/nutritional supplement marketers,
rely on  their suppliers  for nutrients  of high quality, easy
availability, in  forms that are easy to handle, ship and use,
and at  prices that  allow the  finished  products  to  remain
competitive.<P>

The goal  of this  report is  to understand  how suppliers are
satisfying   demand from  their clients. The supplier industry
is a  highly fragmented  one, including  manufacturers of  raw
materials  and  bulk  ingredients,  makers  and  suppliers  of
premixes, distributors,  importers, brokers, and manufacturers
of finished  products. Many  nutrients are  imported,  thereby
subject  to   economic  and   political  constraints,  forcing
suppliers to deal with price and supply problems.<P>

In this  report, each  nutrient is  discussed in  terms of two
chief reasons  for use:  fortification of foods and beverages,
and use  in dietary/nutritional  supplements. In the case of a
nutrient used  as a  fortifier, consumer  demand is  just  one
determining influence  because nutrients  also have functional
value. The  food  and  beverage  maker  has  to  decide  which
nutrient is needed in order to maintain the product's quality,
and which nutrient will be most consistent with consumer image
of the product.<P>

No such conditions exist for marketing supplements because the
manufacturer relies  solely on consumer initiative to make the
purchase in  the OTC  segment.  The  marketer  offers  a  wide
variety of forms and potencies to suit variability in consumer
choices. (The  smaller Rx  market relies  on the  judgment  of
health professionals.)<P>


<B>REASONS FOR DOING THE STUDY</B><P>

This report is designed to achieve the following objectives:<P>

<LI> To identify  which nutrients  attract the  strongest  consumer
attention  and   interest  so  that  manufacturers  of  foods,
beverages and  supplements can use them as marketing tools for
increasing consumption and sales.<P>

<LI> To understand how consumer demand is shaped by media messages,
how the intensity of demand can be correlated to the intensity
of messages,  and how  this demand influences manufacturers in
the development  of products  using ingredients  obtained from
their suppliers.<P>

<LI> To discuss  the social,  demographic, economic,  manufacturing
and regulatory  trends  that  either  promote  or  hamper  the
development and  marketing of  products, as  well  as  produce
changes in  development, and  how these  factors  subsequently
impact on demands from suppliers.<P>

<LI>To  analyze  the  structure  of  the  supplier  industry,  its
environments and  channels of  distribution from  raw material
manufacturers to end-users.<P>


<B>CONTRIBUTION OF THE STUDY</B><P>

BCC seeks  to provide  insight into  one key  question:   With
which nutrients  can  suppliers  best  help  manufacturers  of
foods, beverages  and supplements  satisfy consumer demand for
products that  promote and  maintain good  health?  The report
also:<P>

<LI> Discusses  the   demographic,  social,   manufacturing   and
  regulatory trends  that help to shape consumer attitudes and
  demands for  products  that  are  equated  with  health  and
  nutrition.<P>

<LI> Examines how  consumer  demands  for  foods,  beverages  and
  supplements are  influenced  not  only  by  an  interest  in
  general health  as defined by health professionals, but also
  by specific  needs dictated  by a particular lifestyle, such
  as taking part in sports and exercise activities, or dieting
  and weight control.<P>

<LI> Suggests how  attitudes toward  sources  of  ingredients  in
  general will   also  be applied to sources of nutrients used
  in foods,  beverages and  supplements, and  how that affects
  the development of nutrients by suppliers.<P>

<LI> Explores how  other issues  such as  price, availability  of
  supply and  usage  levels  in  a  formulation,  influence  a
  manufacturer's choice in developing the product.<P>


<B>SCOPE AND FORMAT</B><P>

BCC discusses  each nutrient  classification in  terms of  its
value for  bodily functions,  health benefits  both known  and
suggested by  recent research findings, applications in foods,
beverages and supplements, forms available, market and driving
forces exerted  on the  supplier industry  and the  industry's
complex structure.  In the  case of  fortification,  nutrients
were examined  only in terms of their addition for nutritional
value, rather than functional value.<P>


<B>METHODOLOGIES</B><P>

Within each nutrient classification, BCC describes the various
types   in terms  of their  value and  importance to  the body
which, in  turn, influence  their use and need as fortifier or
supplement.  Nutrients   performing  important  functions  and
needed in  significant amounts  by the body, therefore, are in
wider use  and promoted  more heavily  by  manufacturers,  and
subsequently in greater demand from suppliers.<P>

BCC sales  estimates and projections for each type of nutrient
were calculated  according to  these bodily  needs and various
other  factors   such  sales  of  main  product  applications,
development of  new types  of products  whose quality would be
enhanced by nutrients, and development of different supplement
forms available to suit a wide range of consumer needs.<P>


<B>INFORMATION SOURCES</B><P>

BCC first  conducted an  extensive  review  of  the  secondary
literature  consisting   of  materials   gathered  from  trade
journals and  magazines, trade  and professional associations,
government  and   industry  sources,   and  company   reports.
Subsequently, 100 telephone interviews were conducted
with personnel  in technical,  marketing, sales,  research and
development departments of manufacturers and suppliers.<P>

<B>STUDY GOAL AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>

Pet owners  and owners of horses and food animals want to keep
their  animals  healthy  by  preventing  nutritional  diseases
caused by  deficient amounts  of vitamins,  minerals, proteins
and amino acids in their diets. Growth, overall health, energy
levels,  production  and  reproduction  will  be  hindered  if
nutrient intakes do not meet the requirements of each species.<P>

For pet  and horse  owners, keeping  their animals on balanced
diets will  help the  animals   live longer,  healthier lives.
For farmers with food animals, keeping animals healthy means a
faster return  on an  investment because  only healthy animals
are marketable.  Both types  of owners will also want to avoid
the high costs of veterinary services needed during illness.<P>

Providing animals  with  complete,  balanced  foods  that  are
fortified with  nutrients in amounts recommended to meet daily
requirements  will  prevent  the  development  of  nutritional
deficiencies that  lead to  various disorders and debilitating
conditions. Pet  food manufacturers are able to offer owners a
premium  product   at  little  extra  cost  for  animal  grade
nutrients used to fortify foods. Feed mills adding premixes of
nutrients to feeds similarly are able to market nutrition with
a quality  product.  Both  types  of  manufacturers  are  also
compensating   for    nutrient   losses    occurring    during
manufacturing and storage.<P>

Marketers of dietary/nutritional supplements serve the various
needs and  interests of  animal owners. For some pet and horse
owners, supplements  are given  as preventives,  on  the  same
assumption of  providing insurance against disease that humans
use when  they take  supplements. For  the more cost-conscious
farmers, supplements  are more often given to food animals for
therapeutic  purposes,   when  signs   of   deficiencies   and
imbalances are observed.<P>

Suppliers of  nutrients to  manufacturers play a vital role in
containing costs,  maintaining supply  and availability. Price
fluctuations and supply disruptions can be due to weather, and
political and  economic conditions  here and abroad. Moreover,
suppliers must  keep abreast  of research  reports  and  media
messages regarding  the purported  health benefits of specific
nutrients so  that they  are prepared to satisfy the interests
and demands of animal owners.<P>

The goal  of this report is to gain insight into how suppliers
are  satisfying   demand  for  nutrients  from  pet  food  and
commercial (fortified) feed makers, and farmers who make their
own complete, fortified feeds. The supplier industry is highly
fragmented, one  that includes  manufacturers of raw materials
and bulk  ingredients, a variety of middlemen such as brokers,
importers,  distributors  and  premixers  selling  to  end-use
manufacturers and farmers.<P>

In this  report, each  type of nutrient is delineated in terms
of reasons  for use:  as a  fortifier  in  pet  foods  and  in
commercial  feeds,  and  as  dietary/nutritional  supplements.
Fortified pet foods and commercial feeds are used by owners as
preventives,  as   insurance  against   the  animals  becoming
deficient in  nutrients. Supplements  can be  used  either  as
preventives or  therapeutics, when  animals are  perceived  to
have,  or  actually  do  have,  symptoms  of  deficiencies  or
imbalances. Animal owners or vets can make decisions about the
use of foods and supplements.<P>


<B>REASONS FOR DOING THE STUDY</B><P>

This report is designed to achieve the following objectives:<P>

<LI> To discuss the nutrient requirements of each animal species so
that suppliers  can direct  their marketing  strategies toward
different types of food and feed manufacturers.<P>

<LI> To understand  how changes  in animal  production and  use  of
nutrients are affected by changes in the human sector, such as
declining consumption  of dairy  products and beef as a source
of red  meat causing farmers to raise more animals with leaner
meats.<P>

<LI> To gain  insight into  how owners'  attitudes toward their own
intake of  nutrients affect  the use  of nutrients  for  their
animals, such  as pet  owners giving  healthy animals the same
type of  nutrients that  they take,  and how  media  attention
relating specific  nutrients to  purported health benefits can
help to develop new attitudes.<P>

<LI> To  discuss   the  demographic,  economic,  manufacturing  and
regulatory trends  that either  foster  or  hinder  growth  of
nutrient use  by manufacturers  and owners,  and how they will
impact on demand from suppliers.<P>

<LI> To describe  the structure  of the  supplier industry, how raw
materials and  bulk ingredients pass from manufacturer through
different types  of  middlemen  to  end-users  -  namely  food
manufacturers and farmers.<P>


<B>CONTRIBUTION OF THE STUDY</B><P>

BCC seeks to provide insight into one key question: With which
nutrients can  suppliers best  help manufacturers of pet foods
and commercial  feeds, as  well as  owners of pets, horses and
food animals,  maintain the  growth potential  and  health  of
their animals?<P>

Discusses how  the standards  and regulations  established for
nutrient intake  for each  type of  animal helps  to set usage
levels for  fortification of  pet foods,  commercial feeds and
separate premixes used to make a complete feed or supplement.<P>

Describes how trends and behavior patterns in the human sector
affect how animals will be owned, produced, fed and cared for,
and  how   these  factors   will,  in  turn,  affect  nutrient
suppliers.<P>

Examines  how   economic  and   manufacturing   trends   among
manufacturers of  foods for  animals will  shape  demands  for
specific types of nutrients from suppliers.<P>

Delineates how price, availability, regional and international
conditions, weather  and crop  conditions  can  influence  the
choice and usage level of nutrients demanded from suppliers.<P>


<B>SCOPE AND FORMAT</B><P>

BCC first discusses the nutrient requirements for each type of
animal, the  health benefits of each nutrient for each type of
animal,   the    conditions   resulting   from   deficiencies,
applications in foods, feeds and supplements, forms available,
market and  driving forces  shaping the  supplier industry  as
well as its fragmented structure.<P>

The terms pet foods and commercial feeds are used in the sense
that they  are complete,  finished products to which nutrients
have been added. Our concern here, however, is the addition of
nutrients to  whatever will  be consumed by an animal. Whether
the addition  takes place  by a  manufacturer who packages the
complete, fortified food in a can or bag, or by the farmer who
simply adds  a nutrient  premix to  grains and  makes his  own
complete food, is immaterial.<P>


<B>METHODOLOGIES</B><P>

Within each  nutrient classification, BCC describes each type,
its bodily  function for each species, conditions and diseases
produced by nutrient deficiencies, possible toxic effects from
MEGAPHONES,  natural   food  sources,   reasons  for   use  by
manufacturers of  pet foods  and  commercial  feeds,  and  the
structure of the supplier industry that meets their needs.<P>

BCC sales  estimates and projections for each type of nutrient
were calculated  according to  nutrient requirements  for each
animal,  and   consideration  of   such  factors   as   animal
production, changes  in feeding patterns by farmers, trends in
ownership of  pets and  food animals,  and  price  and  supply
conditions of nutrients.<P>


<B>INFORMATION SOURCES</B><P>

BCC first  conducted an  extensive  review  of  the  secondary
literature  consisting   of  materials   gathered  from  trade
journals and  magazines, trade  and professional associations,
government and  industry sources.  Subsequently,  one  hundred
telephone  interviews   were  conducted   with  personnel   in
technical,  marketing,   sales,   research   and   development
departments  of   nutrient  and   food   manufacturers,   feed
companies, and various types of nutrient suppliers.<P>

</CENTER>

<B>STUDY GOAL AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>

Growing public awareness concerning the health risks posed by fat,
cholesterol, salt, sugar, and high caloric intake has led to certain consumer
demands. Consumers want light and healthy processed, packaged foods that
either reduce or eliminate these ingredients linked with certain health
disorders in order to help them maintain good health and minimize health
risks.<P>

Responding to consumer concerns, many food and soft drink processors jumped on
the bandwagon and marketed so-called healthier versions of regular products.
However, two problems arose with this flurry of product activity. The first
problem was that some manufacturers misled consumers by giving false or
confusing nutritional information on their product labels.<P>

The outcome was that the FDA developed the Nutrition Labeling and Education
Act of 1990 (NLEA). These new regulations not only set labelling guidelines
for processors, to be effective on May 8, 1994, but are designed to help
consumers create more healthful diets. Health-conscious consumers will now
have clear, nutritional information on labels that allows them to evaluate
their intake of these ingredients and compare that intake among brands
marketed by different processors. For their part, processors now have a level
playing field as a result of the NLEA  and have the incentive to develop
healthful products.<P>

The second problem is related to technology and is less easily resolved. There
are periodic reports about some light/healthy products having disappointing
sales because they reportedly fall short of consumer expectations of quality
and value. The reason is that while consumers are increasingly health-
conscious, taste still remains supreme with them. While they are demanding
more healthful items so they can create proper diets, consumers want the
benefits with absolutely no sacrifice in taste or texture. In other words,
product quality should be indistinguishable from their regular counterparts,
but with the added value of high nutrition.<P>

The challenge for food and soft drink makers is to use existing technology, or
develop new technologies, that will allow the development of light/healthy
products that match the quality and value of the regular versions. In a few
cases, ingredients or technologies are awaiting FDA approval, thereby holding
up product development.<P>

The goal of this report is to learn which, and why, certain types of foods and
soft drinks are experiencing wide consumer acceptance and strong sales growth
while others are lagging. Food and soft drink processors generally make up two
separate industries, with the exception of one or two giant beverage makers
that may also have a food division.<P>

To date, the light/healthy foods industry is dominated by national brands from
companies that are market leaders in their given food categories. Some
companies are marketing whole lines and sub-lines of light/healthy foods, a
few even having new brand names. Diet soft drinks also are dominated by the
leading beverage companies, but this market is seeing heavy participation from
lower-priced private label brands.<P>

In this report, BCC examines various food and soft drink categories. Included
as food products are dairy, meat/poultry, baked, candy/ confections,
condiments, and products classified in a single section as "other types of
foods," which includes soups, cereals, pancake syrups/fruit syrups,
jams/jellies/fruit spreads, puddings, and dessert toppings. Soft drinks
include the various types and flavors of diet products, including colas,
pepper-types, 7-Up/citrus types, and fruit juice added/others.<P>

The range of products in light/healthy versions are referred to as "Low and
Free" and include: lowfat, fat-free, low cholesterol, cholesterol-free, low in
saturated fat, low calorie, low sugar, sugar-free, low salt and salt-free. BCC
classified each product type according to the first descriptor used by the
processor. In some cases, a given product could be promoted with four or five
descriptors.<P>


<B>REASONS FOR DOING THE STUDY</B><P>

This report is designed to achieve the following objectives:<P>

<UL>
<LI>Identify consumer needs, interests and preferences for light/ healthy versions of certain types of foods and soft drinks, and analyze how         they shape demands and attitudes that affect consumption and sales.<P>

<LI>Gain insight into how perceived consumer demand, as well as real
          market   size for the overall category, influence processors in the
         development of certain light/healthy products.<P>

<LI>Discuss the regulatory, technological, social and economic
         forces that either foster or hamper the development and marketing
         of light/healthy products by processors.<P>

<LI>Describe the structure of the industry, the companies involved, and the
         competitive factors, such as marketing from private label brands and
         rivalling a processor's own regular brands, that shape the industry
         environment.</UL><P>


<B>CONTRIBUTION OF THE STUDY</B><P>

BCC seeks to provide insight into one key question: What types of light/healthy
products, and in what food and soft drink categories, are there winners because
they're enjoying wide consumer acceptance and losers because they fail to meet
consumer expectations?  Furthermore, the report:<P>
<UL><LI>Discusses the social and demographic factors that influence consumer
         demands for products that are tasty, price-competitive,
         convenient, possibly self-indulgent treats, and provide health
         benefits -- all at the same time.<P>

<LI>Suggests how consumer attitudes and perceptions toward certain types of
         foods and soft drinks influence processors, which in turn, form their
         perceptions of consumer demand and potential market size, and thereby
         decide which type of light/healthy product should be marketed.<P>

<LI>Describes the regulatory and technological forces driving
         processors, and how they provide incentives or disincentives
         to develop light/healthy foods and soft drinks.<P>

<LI>Examines the needs of processors to develop marketing strategies that
         enable them to compete with lower-priced regional and
         private label brands, and how the availability of technology and
         market size help to determine participation of these brands.</UL><P>


<B>SCOPE AND FORMAT</B><P>

Each food category is described in terms of the various types of light/healthy
versions being marketed with some examples marketed by the leading processors.
The industry structure for each food category is delineated in terms of market
forces shaping consumer attitudes, driving forces for processors, most active
processors, market leaders and shares, and industry environment.<P>


<B>METHODOLOGIES</B><P>

Sales estimates and projections for each type of light/healthy food were based
on one or more factors: size of market for regular products and perceived
demand for light/healthy versions; historical trends and sales patterns of
each regular and light/healthy food and soft drink categories; technological
availability and cost, and discernible consumer consumption patterns.<P>

<B>INFORMATION SOURCES</B><P>

BCC first conducted an extensive review of the secondary literature consisting
of materials gathered from trade journals and magazines, trade and
professional associations, government and industry sources, and company
materials. Subsequently, some 100 telephone interviews were conducted with
personnel in technical, marketing, sales, and research and development
departments of food and soft drink processors.<P>

</CENTER>

<B>STUDY GOALS AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>

Media messages linking such disorders as heart disease, cancer and
obesity with high fat intake have influenced the development of
consumer demands for lowfat and fat-free foods. Today's consumers
are health-conscious consumers who want processed foods that help
them minimize health risks.<P>

Food processors began to respond to these consumer demands in the
late 1980s. However, since that time two conditions have occurred
which influenced the need for specialty ingredients. Specialty
ingredients are designed to provide specific purposes and functions
that arise from the reduction or removal of fat. These specialty
ingredients include flavors, flavor enhancers, fat replacers, and
certain ingredients produced by special technologies.<P>

The first condition is that consumers complained about many of the
reduced fat foods because their taste and texture failed to meet
expectations. The need for ingredients specially designed for these
applications was thereby created.  Taste is the number one priority
for most consumers. While they also want health benefits, they mean
health benefits with no compromise in taste or texture. In other
words, consumers want the same quality products as the full-fat
versions, but now the products must have the additional value of
good nutrition.<P>

The second condition was that some food processors tried to falsely
market nutrition by putting misleading health claims or confusing
nutritional information on their product labels. The result was
that the FDA stepped in to protect the consumer and issued the
Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990 (NLEA), due to take
effect on May 8, 1994.<P>

Food processors now report that the NLEA is the single most
influential factor in product development, which includes
reformulation of existing products and to a lesser degree
development of new products. The new regulations will not only set
guidelines for product labels but will provide nutritional
information to help consumers create healthy diets. With clear,
easy-to-read and easy-to- understand listings of ingredients and
numerical values, the consumer will be able to compare nutritional
contents among many products marketed by different food processors
to determine which provides the most healthful item.<P>

This anticipated consumer behavior not only gives food processors
a clear incentive to create healthful products, but also to use
ingredients that help the product appear healthful. The choice of
ingredients, then, becomes one of utmost importance because a high
amount of fat or a "zero" next to the protein or fiber listing, for
example, could make a product look "bad" or "unhealthy".
The demand for quality foods from food processors, in turn, has
created demands from suppliers for the necessary ingredients that
would enable reduced fat foods to match the quality of their
full-fat counterparts. Many food processors found that conventional
ingredients failed to adequately address the deficits caused by the
loss of fat.<P>

Suppliers have responded with specialty ingredients that include
flavors that mimic the taste and texture of fat or oil, impart the
specific flavors of high fat content ingredients, strengthen the
product's overall flavor, or combination flavors that provide both
flavor and one or more properties of fat; flavor enhancers to
enhance specific flavors and/or mimic the flavor and mouthfeel
properties of fat; fat replacers to mimic the properties of fat or
serve more as fat reducers because they help to lower the product's
fat content in some way; and ingredients produced by special
technologies such as defatted ingredients, a processing aid to
lower cholesterol content, substances to improve flavor and texture
or otherwise serve such specific function.<P>

In order to more effectively serve the needs of food processors,
many companies in the highly fragmented supplier industry have
undergone restructuring. The supplier industry is composed of large
and small companies serving niche and mass markets. These companies
can be flavor houses, ingredient suppliers, food processors,
chemical and biotech companies and even academic institutions.<P>

The goal of this report is to learn which, and why, certain
specialty ingredients are meeting with the satisfaction of food
processors and thereby experiencing good growth, while others are
expected to grow more slowly.<P>


<B>REASONS FOR DOING THE STUDY</B><P>

This report is designed to achieve the following objectives:<P>

<LI> To identify the various needs of food processors for specialty
ingredients that can serve specific purposes and functions in
lowfat and fat-free foods.<P>

<LI> To describe the various types of specialty ingredients that
suppliers are offering to food processors in order to help them
develop quality foods that meet with consumer approval.<P>

<LI> To learn the regulatory, technological, social and economic forces
that either promote or hinder the development and marketing of
lowfat and fat-free foods by food processors.<P>

<LI> To analyze the supplier industry that seeks to meet the needs of
food processors, and delineate its role and structure for
delivering  products and services needed by food processors.<P>

BCC seeks to provide insight into one key question: How, and with
what types of specialty ingredients, can suppliers best serve food
processors interested in developing quality lowfat and fat-free
foods?<P>

Examines each type of specialty ingredient in terms of its special
purpose, function and value in the development of lowfat and
fat-free foods.<P>

Describes each type of specialty ingredient in terms of derivation,
suggested applications, usage level, price per pound and major
suppliers.<P>

Discusses the regulatory, social and technological forces that
drive processors, and how they provide incentives or disincentives
to develop lowfat and fat-free foods.<P>

Analyzes the role of suppliers, value and importance to food
processors as they increasingly rely on suppliers' technical
expertise in the wake of cutbacks in R&D personnel at food
companies.<P>


<b>SCOPE AND FORMAT</B><P>

Each specialty ingredient is described in terms of its purpose and
function to food processors, how it differs or compares with its
conventional counterpart, some examples of the ingredient and its
suppliers, and its derivation and/or technology used to develop it.
Then the industry structure for each type of specialty ingredient
is delineated in terms of market forces shaping consumer attitudes
that affect food processors, driving forces for suppliers serving
food processors, usage level and costs per pound, industry
environment for suppliers and most active suppliers of each type of
specialty ingredients.<P>


<b>METHODOLOGIES</B><P>

Sales estimates and projections for each type of specialty
ingredient were based on one or more factors: size of market for
the ingredient in its conventional form, usage level in a reduced
fat application,  sales patterns of main reduced fat applications
that use the ingredient, technological availability, and cost
factors.<P>


<b>INFORMATION SOURCES</B><P>

BCC first conducted an extensive review of the secondary literature
consisting of materials gathered from trade journals and magazines,
trade and professional associations, government and industry
sources, and company materials. Subsequently, some one hundred
telephone interviews were conducted with personnel in technical,
marketing, sales, and R&D departments of food processors, as well
as researchers at universities, marketing boards and biotech
companies.<P>

<B>STUDY GOALS AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>
 
Consumers are continually given messages by the media, health professionals 
and the government that they can take control of their health, and prevent 
certain major disorders that incur high health costs. One of the ways that 
consumers are advised to achieve this goal is to plan a proper diet, since 
diet and nutrition are increasingly linked with disease prevention and 
treatment in clinical studies.<P>  
 
Through research, certain naturally occurring substances are showing purported 
protective influences against such life-threatening conditions as heart 
disease and cancer. The studies seek to identify the natural substances, 
referred to as phytochemicals, with the intention of extracting them for use 
as fortifiers to be incorporated into foods and beverages, once approved by 
the FDA. The fortification process would be similar to the current industry 
practice of using nutrients as fortifiers to prevent deficiencies such as 
vitamin C to prevent scurvy.<P> 
 
The fortifiers would be classified as nutraceuticals, which are defined in 
this study as parts of foods rather than actual processed foods or beverages. 
The nutraceuticals would be added to foods as fortifiers for the express 
purpose of producing a health benefit and not for any functional or technical 
value. As such, they would be an alternative to drugs but not their 
replacements, and their usage as preventive medicine would be to supplement 
medical science and not replace it.<P> 
 
In most cases, the nutraceuticals discussed in this report are marketed 
already in some other form and used by consumers or manufacturers. The 
nutraceuticals include certain nutrients, food substances, and foods and 
beverages consumed as such.<P>   
 
The nutrients include vitamins, minerals, proteins/amino acids, which 
consumers know as supplements and processors know as fortifiers and additives.  The food substances include fiber sources, some of which consumers may use as supplements, and omega-3 oils, which consumers may know as cooking oils or supplements. Processors know both these sources as fortifiers for nutritional value and as additives. Also included are herbs/spices which consumers know as seasonings, and processors know as ingredients and additives.<P>  
 
Foods include certain vegetables and fruits which consumers use raw or cooked, and beverages include certain non-alcoholic and alcoholic products which consumers drink, both of which are used by manufacturers as ingredients. As this listing suggests, nutrients and fiber sources are currently used as fortifiers, and some omega-3 oils are used for fortification/nutritional value. Most, however, are still in the research stage as to their links to health benefits. This group includes some omega-3 oils, herbs/spices, and those phytochemicals derived from foods and beverages.<P> 
 
These current and potential nutraceuticals are supplied by various segments of the raw materials, processing and marketing industries, such as chemical companies, biotechnology companies, food and beverage processors, ingredient 
suppliers, distributors and brokers.  A given supplier may be involved in 
supplying one or more types of nutraceutical. 
 
The goal of this report is to learn why each type of nutraceutical, whether 
currently marketed or still in the research stage, is being considered as a 
fortifier and what factors affect its present or future level of consumer and 
processor acceptance.<P> 
 

<b>REASONS FOR DOING THE STUDY</B><P> 
 
This report is designed to achieve the following objectives:<P> 
 

<LI> To describe the different types of nutraceuticals that are being 
  investigated for their purported protective influences against  major disease that incur high health costs<P>
 

<LI> To compare and contrast each type in terms of suitability as a fortifier or    unsuitability due to inherent self-limiting factors, such as flavor, odor, consumer perceptions, availability and price<P>

<LI> To learn the regulatory (health claims), technological, social, demographic, and economic factors that are either promoting the nutraceutical industry, including identification, extraction, FDA approval, and marketing, or hampering it<P>
 
<LI> To analyze the structure of each industry interested in 
     developing, marketing and/or using nutraceuticals as fortifiers.<P> 
 

<b>CONTRIBUTION OF THE STUDY</B><P> 
 
BCC seeks to provide insight into one key question:  How, and with which 
nutraceuticals, can marketers help consumers contain high health costs while 
both demonstrating social responsibility and realizing a profit?<P> 
 
The report examines each type of nutraceutical and its purportedly  protective 
influence against various types of major diseases, with the view that each is 
a current or potential fortifier.<P> 
 
The report presents the various advantages and disadvantages that processors 
may confront while using each nutraceutical as a fortifier, and factors that 
could influence its limited or wide usage in food and beverage applications.<P> 
 
The report discusses the regulatory, technological, social, demographic and 
market trends that provide incentives or disincentives for the development and 
growth of the nutraceuticals as fortifiers industry.<P> 
 
The report analyzes the roles of interested parties, such as government, 
various types of manufacturers and academic institutions, in influencing the 
marketing of current nutraceuticals and those still in the research stage.<P> 
 

<b>SCOPE AND FORMAT</B><P> 
 
Each type of nutraceutical is described in terms of its purported influences 
against specific major diseases as determined by recent clinical 
investigations, possible dual/multifunctionality for processors, social and 
market forces influencing usage, and regulatory and technological forces 
affecting the development and growth of the nutraceutical industry.<P>

<b>METHODOLOGIES</B><P> 
 
Sales estimates and projections for each type of nutraceutical were presented in two scenarios. Scenario one took a business as usual approach and made sales estimates and forecasts based on current social and market trends influencing usage by processors.  Scenario two took the view that certain regulatory and technological changes will occur between 1993 and 1998 that will affect higher sales and faster sales growth. The assumed changes will be the result of pressure from health professionals taking note of clinical research data, and from consumers who learn about the research from the media and demand them.<P>  
 

<b>INFORMATION SOURCES</B><P> 
 
BCC first conducted an extensive review of the secondary literature, 
consisting of materials gathered from trade journals and magazines, trade and professional associations, academic institutions, government and industry 
sources, and company materials. Subsequently, some one hundred telephone 
interviews were conducted with personnel in technical, marketing and sales 
departments of food and beverage manufacturers, and food science/nutritional 
specialists in academia and professional groups.<P>
