<H2>Weekly Digest of Economic and Financial Developments</H2> 
<H3>Toronto, June 23, 1995</H3>


<p>Investors continued to hope for an easing in U.S. monetary policy at the
FOMC meeting on July 5-6 in the light of U.S. economic data released this
week. <B>However, investors may be overly optimistic, for the data were not all
unambiguously weak.</B> Initial unemployment insurance claims rose by 20,000 in the week
ended June 17th, and the four-week moving average climbed above 380,000 from
its recent low of almost 320,000 in October. The latest initial claims
report covers the same week as the June non-farm payrolls survey and suggests that
the June employment data may be quite soft. Although U.S. housing starts remained
weak in May, the increase in housing permits, especially for single-family
units, may be an indication that the housing sector has begun to stabilize.
Another positive sign was the National Association of Home Builders housing
index, which indicated that sub-indices for traffic of buyers in new homes
and single-family sales rose in June. 

<p><B>The U.S. merchandise trade deficit
rose to US$16.5 billion in April</B> from US$14.7 billion in March, and reached
US$56.5 billion for the first four months of 1995, compared with US$44.0
billion a year earlier. <B>Trade with Mexico,</B> which has been adversely affected by 
the poor economic conditions in that country and the devaluation of the
Mexican peso, <B>accounted for nearly half of the US$12.5 billion deterioration.</B> In
the January-April period, U.S. exports to Mexico fell by just over 8 per cent,
while imports from Mexico were approximately 30 per cent above year-earlier levels.
In contrast, U.S. exports to most other major areas rose rapidly, indicating that 
foreign demand for U.S.-made products remains strong. At the same
time, growth of 18.7 per cent in total U.S. merchandise imports in the first
four months of 1995 is not indicative of severe weakness in the U.S.
economy. 

<p>According to the <B>Federal Reserve's "beige book",</B> released this
week, <B>economic activity in May and early June remained at very high levels
in most districts, except in the interest-sensitive sectors.</B> Employment
growth was evident in several districts and is expected to continue
throughout 1995. Shortages of skilled workers were reported in several
areas. New orders for manufactured capital goods were strong, an indication that
business investment remains a source of strength for the U.S. economy. <B>In
summary, the Fed report did not suggest that the U.S. economy was slipping into
recession.</B> This view was further enhanced this morning with the release of
data on durable goods orders in May. New orders jumped by 2.5 per cent in
May after declining in April, and non-defense capital goods orders rose
by an even larger 6.8 per cent, more than offsetting the decline in
April. Total shipments rose marginally in May, while unfilled orders were
unchanged. 

<p><B>Canadian economic data released this week were mixed. Canada's
merchandise trade surplus slipped to C$1.8 billion in April</B> from its recent
high of C$2.0 billion in February. In volume terms, exports continued to 
decline, falling by 2.1 per cent in April, while imports
were virtually unchanged following two consecutive monthly declines. Both
exports and imports reflected the weakness in the North American automotive
sector. With the expected revival in the auto and housing sectors in both
Canada and the United States later in the year, Canada's merchandise
trade surplus for 1995 should exceed the C$15 billion
surplus recorded last year. <B>Canadian retail sales, after falling
during the first three months of 1995, showed a modest gain of 0.2 per cent
in April,</B> or by 0.4 per cent, if motor vehicle dealers, whose sales
continued to drop, are excluded. However, a good part of the gain appeared
to reflect higher prices for food and gasoline, rather than a pickup in
sales volume. It will be some months before the recent decline in
Canadian interest rates translates into stronger consumer
spending.

<H3>SHORT-TERM INTEREST RATES:</H3>

<p>Canadian short-term interest rates continued their downward trend on
Monday and Tuesday, prompted by investor expectations of a further easing of
monetary conditions by the Bank of Canada. Accordingly, the Bank Rate tumbled by
20 basis points, to 6.99 per cent, its lowest level since last December.
Chartered banks left their prime rates unchanged despite a widening of the
prime rate-Bank rate spread to 176 basis points. This suggests that the
chartered banks may be awaiting the outcome of the U.S. Federal Reserve
policy meeting on July 5-6 before implementing any further prime rate
reductions. Canadian short-term rates fell further throughout the remainder
of the week, despite Bank of Canada efforts to slow their descent, assisted
by a firmer Canadian dollar and a rally in the U.S. money market. U.S.
short-term rates ended the week 8-27 basis points below last Thursday's
levels, fuelled by a resurgence of investor hopes that the Federal Reserve
would cut short-term rates at the July FOMC meeting.

<H3>BOND MARKETS AND YIELD CURVES:</H3>

<p>After drifting slightly lower during the first half of the week, Canadian
bond prices rallied on Wednesday and Thursday. Fuelling the advance was a
successful 5-year Government of Canada bond auction on Wednesday and rising
U.S. bond prices. The Canadian yield curve shifted downward, and remained
inverted between the 3-month and 1-year maturities. U.S. bond prices rose
on Wednesday, as some investors interpreted a speech by Federal Reserve
Chairman Greenspan as an indication that the Fed would reduce short-term
rates at the July FOMC meeting. On Thursday, the rally gained momentum with
higher-than-expected weekly U.S. initial unemployment insurance claims
and comments by a Federal Reserve Bank President implying that the Fed must
pursue job creation as well as low inflation. The U.S. yield curve shifted
downward significantly during the week to Thursday. However, both Canadian
and U.S. bond prices fell early this morning, following release of
stronger-than-expected U.S. orders for durable goods in May.

<H3>CANADIAN DOLLAR: </H3>

<p>On Monday, the Canadian dollar opened at 72.29 US cents, down 0.28 US
cents from last Thursday's close. Downward pressure was apparently in
reaction to expectations of a further reduction in short-term interest
rates by the Bank of Canada and falling Canadian bond prices. However, the
Canadian dollar recovered most of the loss by Tuesday, supported by
heightened belief that Canada-U.S. short-term interest rate spreads would
widen if U.S. short-term rates were lowered at the July FOMC meeting. The
Canadian dollar strengthened on Thursday, up by more than one-third of a US
cent. A stronger U.S. dollar vis-a-vis the German mark and Japanese yen,
boosted by rumours of international central bank intervention to support the
U.S. currency, as well as talk of a German short-term interest rate
reduction, seemingly spilled over into the Canadian foreign exchange market.
The Canadian dollar remained firm this Friday morning, opening at 72.82 US
cents.

<H2>Weekly Digest of Economic and Financial Developments</H2> 
<H3>Toronto, June 16, 1995</H3>


<p><B>The U.S. economic data released this week provided further evidence of the
inventory adjustment taking place in the United States in the second quarter of
this year.</B> Manufacturing and trade inventories and inventory/sales ratios rose in April.
Although the combined inventory/sales ratio was not high by historical standards, 
ratios for automotive dealers and retailers of home furnishings were well
above year-earlier levels and clearly higher than desired. As a result, U.S.
industrial production fell in May for the third consecutive month. The 0.2 per cent
decline in aggregate production was slightly milder than anticipated, but
the drop in the production of autos and trucks was much more pronounced as motor vehicle
manufacturers endeavoured to bring inventories under control. The 0.5 per
cent rise in sales by automotive dealers reported in May, which helped to
lift total retail sales by 0.2 per cent, was a mildly encouraging sign that progress is
being made in the necessary inventory adjustment. 

<p>The fall in industrial
production further reduced the capacity utilization rate in May. It dropped
to 83.7 per cent below its recent peak of 85.5 per cent but still above long-term
average of 82.0 per cent. The decline in capacity utilization suggests that
price pressures in the United States are past their worst. Nonetheless, the
consumer price index (CPI) rose by 0.3 per cent in May and the 12-month rate of inflation
rose to 3.2 per cent from 3.1 per cent in April. Excluding food and energy,
the CPI was 3.1 per cent above its May 1994 level, but over the last 6
months the annualized core rate of inflation has accelerated to almost 3.5 per
cent. <B>Given these price data and an unemployment rate of 5.7 per cent (still
below the estimated non-inflationary rate of 6.1 per cent), the Federal
Reserve appears content to leave its current monetary policy stance
unchanged at the moment.</B> Investors, however, judging by the renewed rally in
the U.S. debt markets, appear once again to be hoping for a reduction in the
fed funds rate at the FOMC meeting on July 5-6.

<p>While the Fed still seems
disinclined to ease, <B>the Bank of Canada is actively fostering easier
monetary conditions in Canada</B> in the light of the latest national accounts
data, which showed that Canadian real GDP barely rose in the first quarter
of 1995 and that what growth there was came from a very large buildup in inventories. 
The first-quarter data showed how vulnerable to interest rate
increases the heavily-indebted Canadian consumer has become. The surge in
Canadian interest rates in the latter part of 1994 and the early
months of 1995 caused Canadians to cut their spending on durable goods, 
especially motor vehicles, and in hotels and restaurants. Residential construction activity, 
including sales of existing homes, plummeted. First-quarter data also
showed the high dependence of the Canadian economy on trade with
the United States. While real exports continued to rise in the first
quarter, the rate of expansion slowed sharply, in line with U.S. demand, and
this too restrained economic activity in Canada.

<p>On the basis of the first-quarter numbers, <B>it
appears that Canada has a more severe inventory adjustment problem than the
United States,</B> one that could well result in a contraction in real GDP in
the second quarter of the year. With the Canadian economy still far
from full employment, and with price increases remarkably
modest for a country that has experienced a 20 per cent depreciation of its
currency over the past three and half years -- the core rate of inflation
was 2.7 per cent in May -- <B>we can expect further
easing in monetary conditions in coming weeks so long as the Canadian
exchange rate remains stable.</B> The reduction in Canada's current account
deficit to C$15.8 billion (SAAR) in the first quarter of 1995 from a
downwardly revised C$22.3 billion for 1994, should provide some
support for the Canadian currency.

<H3>SHORT-TERM INTEREST RATES:</H3>

<p>On Tuesday, the Bank of Canada lowered its target range for overnight
funds by 25 basis points, to 7.0-7.5 per cent. This immediately triggered
a cut in chartered banks' prime rates from 9.00 per cent to 8.75 per cent,
and a reduction in mortgage rates. Later on Tuesday, the Bank Rate tumbled
by 19 basis points, to 7.19 per cent. Canadian short-term interest rates
continued to decline until Thursday morning, supported by a firmer Canadian
dollar. However, Bank of Canada intervention, and downward pressure on the Canadian
currency in response to the downgrade of the province of Quebec's long-term
debt by Moody's Investors Service, halted the rally. Nonetheless, Canadian
short-term rates ended the week 26-38 basis points below week-earlier
levels. U.S. short-term interest rates also fell significantly during the
week, pushed by the weaker-than-expected U.S. retail sales and consumer
price data for May, which rekindled investors' hopes that the Federal
Reserve would cut short-term interest rates soon.

<H3>BOND MARKETS AND YIELD CURVES:</H3>

<p>Canadian and U.S. bond prices recovered on Monday and Tuesday, after
falling sharply last Friday in response to unsubstantiated rumours that
Japan's Ministry of Finance had recommended that Japanese investors stop
buying U.S. government debt securities. The renewed rally was a result of
expectations --later realized-- of weak U.S. economic data. On
Thursday, Canadian bond yields rose slightly in response to the Moody's
downgrade. The Canadian bond market also appeared to be adversely affected
by falling U.S. bond prices following release of a smaller-than-expected
fall in U.S. industrial production and comments made by the U.S. Federal
Reserve vice-chairman suggesting that the Fed would not lower interest rates
soon. The Canadian yield curve steepened significantly during the week, as
it pivoted around the 10-year maturity. The U.S. yield curve also steepened
considerably and shifted downward except for the 30-year bond yield, which
was virtually unchanged.

<H3>CANADIAN DOLLAR: </H3>

<p>On Tuesday, the Canadian dollar came under downward pressure as Canadian
T-bill yields tumbled following the reduction in short-term interest rates
by the Bank of Canada. After reaching the week's low of 72.23 US cents, the
Canadian dollar reversed course Wednesday morning, lifted by overseas buying
and expectations of Bank of Canada foreign-exchange market intervention.
The currency continued its movement upward against the U.S. dollar on
Thursday, despite heavy Canadian dollar selling on Thursday afternoon,
following the announcement of Quebec's debt rating downgrade. The Canadian
dollar opened at 72.44 U.S. cents this Friday morning, down significantly in
overnight trading. Overseas investors were apparently nervous ahead of this
morning's release of Canadian consumer price data for May, because of the
likelihood of further easing in monetary conditions by the Bank of Canada if
inflation remained subdued.

<H2>Weekly Digest of Economic and Financial Developments</H2> 
<H3>Toronto, June 9, 1995</H3>


<p><B>The hopes for an immediate easing in U.S. monetary policy, which fuelled last
week's powerful rally in the U.S. debt markets, evaporated this week, and
U.S. interest rates and bond yields moved back up to their end-of-May
levels.</B> Comments by Federal Reserve Chairman Greenspan at mid-week,
indicating that the U.S. economy is not expected to slip into recession
despite evidence of a severe slowdown in the pace of economic expansion in
the second quarter of 1995, made it clear that <B>the Fed is not planning to
cut its Fed funds rate target now.</B> According to Mr. Greenspan business inventory buildup
in the first quarter was the problem, and with moderate production cutbacks
in the second quarter, inventory levels are being brought into line faster than
earlier expected, greatly reducing the probability of an inventory-induced recession in
the United States.

<P>Incentive programs by many U.S. auto makers enticed
customers back to the showrooms in May, as total new passenger car sales
rose by 8.0 per cent from April levels. This improvement in sales combined
with planned cutbacks in third-quarter production levels by auto makers
suggest that inventories in the auto industry are beginning to move to more
comfortable levels. The U.S. producer price data released this morning
indicate some deceleration in inflation for both intermediate and crude
goods in May. The core rate of inflation for intermediate goods was 0.2 per cent
for the month, down substantially from the 0.8 per cent monthly gain in April.
The year-over-year increase in prices of intermediate goods excluding food
and energy was unchanged at 7.8 per cent in May, but the annualized rate
for the latest three months fell to 5.5 per cent. A similar deceleration in
price increases was evident for crude materials. The core rate of inflation
for finished goods was 0.3 per cent in May and 2.0 per cent for the last
twelve months, but there are indications of some additional price increases
to come. <B>The Fed is unlikely to loosen monetary policy until there is much
stronger evidence of diminishing price pressures.</B>

<P><B>In Canada, the economic
data released this week pointed to very slow growth in the second quarter.</B> 
Canadian employment was unchanged in May, but with more people looking for
work, the unemployment rate edged up to 9.5 per cent. Employment in the
manufacturing sector rose sharply in May, more than offsetting the declines
recorded in March and April. However, employment in the construction
sector continued to decline, and with housing starts collapsing to a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of a mere 101,800 units in May,
the near-term outlook for employment in this sector is poor. Lower consumer
confidence levels and higher car prices contributed to the decline of 9.2
per cent in April sales of new motor vehicles in Canada. Sharply lower
sales of minivans and sport utility vehicles resulted in a 12.7 per cent
plunge in truck sales in April. Although the rate of capacity utilization
for all Canadian industries remained unchanged in the first quarter of
1995, a substantial improvement by primary textile industries
and chemical industries pushed the factory utilization rate up by
0.4 per cent, to 85.7 per cent, in the manufacturing sector. However,
rising inventories and sluggish economic growth in the United States, a
major market for Canadian manufacturers, suggest that capacity
utilization rates in Canada will decline in the second quarter.

<P>Given the
weakness evident in the latest Canadian economic data, it is not
surprising that the Bank of Canada moved late last week to encourage lower
interest rates. <B>Provided that the Canadian dollar remains stable, the
Bank could well foster further gradual reductions in Canadian short-term
interest rates in coming weeks.</B>

<H3>SHORT-TERM INTEREST RATES:</H3>

<p>On Monday, yields on Canadian 6-month and 1-year T-bills fell sharply, as
last Friday's strong rally in the Canadian money market continued. Demand
for Canadian short-term instruments was apparently related to speculation
that the Bank of Canada would continue to ease monetary policy in view of a
marked deceleration in Canadian economic growth. Despite a weakening
Canadian dollar, the Bank Rate tumbled by 26 basis points on Tuesday, to
7.38 per cent. On Wednesday, Canadian short-term interest rates rose in
tandem with U.S. short-term yields, partially offsetting the earlier
gains. However, a late-week rebound in the Canadian currency and rally in
the money market enabled short-term interest rates to end the week 13-20
basis points below last Thursday's levels. U.S. short-term interest rates
rose significantly during the week in response to remarks by the Federal
Reserve Chairman indicating that an early cut in the U.S. fed funds rate
was unlikely. As a result, Canada-U.S. short-term rate spreads narrowed
considerably.

<H3>BOND MARKETS AND YIELD CURVES:</H3>

<p>Canadian bond prices soared early in the week, fuelled by the strong
rally in the Canadian money market. However, the bond market faltered in
the second half of the week, in line with the downward movement in U.S.
Treasury prices. Losses were most pronounced among longer-dated maturities,
as short-term bonds received support from the firmer Canadian dollar
and lower short-term interest rates. The negative slope of the Canadian
yield curve between the 1-month and 1-year maturities steepened slightly,
while shifting downward significantly. Canadian bond yields beyond the
2-year maturity were little changed during the week. Despite a U.S. bond
market rally early in the week, yields on U.S. Treasuries ended the week
significantly above last Thursday's close -- except for the 30-year bond
yield, which posted no change. U.S. bond prices fell as investors realized
that the U.S. Federal Reserve was unlikely to reduce short-term interest
rates in the near future.

<H3>CANADIAN DOLLAR: </H3>

<p>The Canadian dollar tumbled by 0.24 US cents on Tuesday, as investors
appeared concerned that the Bank of Canada would soon encourage further
cuts in Canadian short-term interest rates. After reaching a low of 72.37
US cents on Tuesday, the Canadian dollar reversed direction and remained
firm through this Friday morning. The rally was supported by expectations of a
Progressive Conservative victory in the Ontario election on June 8 
-- which were realized -- and comments made by the Governor of the Bank of
Canada, indicating that he is optimistic about federal and provincial
deficit reduction measures. The Canadian dollar opened at 72.72 US cents this
morning, up 0.11 US cents from the same time last Friday.

<title>Weekly Digest: Toronto, June 2, 1995
</title> 
</head> <BODY BGCOLOR="#ffffff"> <h2>Weekly Digest of Economic and Financial
Developments</h2> <h3>Toronto, June 2, 1995</h3>


<p><B>U.S. debt markets feasted on reports of economic
weakness this week.</B> The bond market rallied as fears of a serious
acceleration in U.S. inflation diminished, and the money market began to
expect an easing in monetary policy and a reduction in the Federal Reserve's
federal funds rate target. 

<p><B>Many of the U.S. economic statistics for April and
May released during the week signalled very slow growth in the second
quarter.</B> Most significant was the drop of 101,000 in non-farm payrolls in
May, primarily in the manufacturing and construction sectors. Almost as
important to the debt markets was the decline in the National Association
of Purchasing Management (NAPM) index to 46.1 in May. Both these releases
contained reassuring news on the inflation front. The price component of the
NAPM index fell for the 5th consecutive month, and average hourly earnings
declined fractionally in May. Signs of second-quarter weakness were also evident in
the U.S. index of leading indicators, which fell 0.6 per cent in April, the
third consecutive monthly decline, and in the dip in sales of new family
homes. 

<p><B>Other U.S. economic data were less depressing.</B> Non-farm payrolls may have
declined in May 1995, but they were <B>revised upward for 1994 by more than
600,000 a month on average.</B> The unemployment rate declined to 5.7 per cent
in May, still below the estimated non-inflationary rate. New construction
spending rose by 0.4 per cent in April, the first increase since December, 
as a drop in residential construction was more than offset by gains
in non-residential activity. Partial data on sales of new motor vehicles in
the United States suggest that there was a modest pickup in sales in May.
Revisions to the first quarter 1995 GDP data were also heartening. Although
the growth in total real GDP was revised down fractionally from 2.8 per
cent to 2.7 per cent, it still remained above the long-run potential growth
rate of the U.S. economy. Moreover, growth in real final demand was revised
upward to 2.5 per cent from the initially-reported 1.8 per cent, while
the rise in inventories was revised downward from $63.0 billion to $52.3
billion. While the rise in inventories was clearly more than desired in
the first quarter of 1995, the overrun was not as great as feared and the
inventory correction now underway should be completed quite quickly. The
expectation of an early reduction in the fed funds rate, as evidenced by
the drop in 3-month Treasury bill yields to well below the current fed
funds target rate of 6.00 per cent, may be premature. Nonetheless, <B>the
decline in U.S. interest rates is good news for the Canadian economy, which
is still operating well below full-employment levels.</B> 

<p><B>In early 1995,
Canadian economic activity was adversely affected by the sluggish U.S.
economy as well as by labour disputes in Canadian transport services.</B>
Real gross domestic product (GDP) at factor cost fell by 0.7 per cent in
March after declining by 0.2 per cent in February. In the first quarter
of 1995, real GDP at factor cost rose by a modest 0.2 per cent,
following gains of 1.1 per cent in each of the previous two quarters.
Growth in the manufacturing sector slowed to 1.2 per cent in the first
quarter, as motor vehicle production was curtailed to reduce high inventory
levels. Slower economic growth, combined with a lower exchange value for
the Canadian dollar, caused Canadians to curtail their spending on travel
abroad, while foreign visitors to Canada spent a record $2.8
billion during the first quarter of 1995. This improvement in the
travel account, combined with a larger surplus in merchandise trade, <B>bodes
well for a substantial improvement, of approximately $4 billion, in Canada's 
international current account balance on goods and services
in the first quarter of 1995.</B>

<H3>SHORT-TERM INTEREST RATES:</H3>

<p>After rising moderately last Friday in conjunction with weakness in the
Canadian dollar, Canadian short-term interest rates remained relatively
stable until mid-week. As expected, the Bank Rate declined by 7 basis
points, to 7.64 per cent, on Tuesday. On Thursday, Canadian short-term
yields fell sharply in tandem with U.S. short-term rates, apparently
propelled by weaker-than-expected U.S. factory orders and purchasing
managers' data for May. After intervening several times on Thursday to cool
the money market rally, the Bank of Canada reduced the target range for
overnight funds by 25 basis points this Friday morning to 7.25-7.75 per cent. 
This immediately triggered announcements of a 25-basis-point cut in
chartered banks' prime rates to 9.0 per cent. The U.S. money market
significantly outperformed its Canadian counterpart this week, as
indications that U.S. economic growth continues to decelerate outweighed
some investor disappointment that the German Bundesbank did not reduce
short-term rates at mid-week.

<H3>BOND MARKETS AND YIELD CURVES:</H3>

<p>Canadian bond prices rose during the week with the exception of the
2-year bond, which suffered a sharp sell-off last Friday ahead of this
weeks' Government of Canada 2-year bond auction. Weaker-than-expected
Canadian GDP data for March and a rising U.S. Treasuries market fuelled the
advance in prices of other maturities. The slope of the Canadian yield
curve steepened up to the 2-year maturity, but flattened over the
remainder of the curve. Following Monday's Memorial Day holiday, U.S. bond
prices rose sharply, buoyed by this week's soft U.S. economic data which
encouraged speculation about an interest rate reduction by the U.S. Federal
Reserve later this year. The U.S. bond market was also fuelled by
significant international central bank foreign-exchange intervention in
support of the U.S. dollar. The U.S. yield curve shifted downward, with
significant steepening beyond the 1-year maturity. Both U.S. and Canadian
bond prices soared this morning upon release of weaker-than-expected U.S.
employment data.

<H3>CANADIAN DOLLAR: </H3>

<p>In the first part of the week, the Canadian dollar came under
intermittent downward pressure, as investors appeared hesitant ahead of
this week's major U.S. and Canadian economic data. On Wednesday, the Canadian 
dollar recovered most of its loss from the previous day, as the
successful international central-bank support of the U.S. dollar appeared
to spill over into the Canadian foreign exchange market. The Canadian dollar
reversed direction again on Thursday, seemingly weighed down by investor
concerns that slower-than-expected economic growth in Canada might make it
difficult for the federal and provincial governments to meet their deficit
targets. After opening stronger this Friday morning, at 72.93 US cents, the
Canadian dollar dipped by about 0.20 US cents following release of the U.S.
employment data. The U.S. dollar is also markedly weaker against the
overseas currencies this morning, heightening skepticism of the sustainable
impact of central-bank intervention in preserving a currency's value.

<title>Weekly Digest: Toronto, May 26, 1995
</title> 
</head> <BODY BGCOLOR="#ffffff"> <h2>Weekly Digest of Economic and Financial
Developments</h2> <h3>Toronto, May 26, 1995</h3>

<p>With several major financial centres closed for various holidays this week
and next Monday, trading in North American financial markets was somewhat
erratic during the week. <B>The U.S. Federal Reserve left its federal funds
target rate and discount rate unchanged,</B> at 6.0 per cent and 5.25 per cent
respectively, following Tuesday's meeting of the Federal Open Market
Committee (FOMC). The brief announcement of no change in monetary policy
gave no indication of how the Fed assesses the current state of the U.S.
economy or what its next move might be. Investors were left on their own to
decipher the April data for U.S. new orders and home resales, both of
which declined. 

<p>The U.S. bond market appeared to interpret the <B>declines in
durable goods orders and housing resales</B> as signs that the "soft-landing" scenario
for the U.S. economy was becoming harder. The larger-than-expected 4.0 per
cent fall in new orders for durable goods between March and April was most
pronounced in the sector, where weak consumer demand has caused a buildup
of dealer inventories. The sharp drop in sales of existing homes in April
-- down by 6.4 per cent -- did not reflect the recent decline in mortgage
interest rates, since sales are recorded as of the closing date of the
transaction. Given the lag between the consumer's decision to buy and the
closing date, the effect of the recent fall in mortgage rates is unlikely
to appear in housing sale data for another few months. 

<p>It is not clear
whether the currently weak U.S. economic data indicate continued
deterioration or merely a pause that will end around mid-year. At the same
time, the depreciation of the U.S. dollar could exacerbate the price
pressures that are evident at the producer level in the United States. In
this uncertain environment, the Fed will be scrutinizing carefully the May
employment numbers, to be released next Friday, and the May data on
consumer and producer prices, to be released during the following two
weeks. <B>Unless both employment and price data are exceptionally weak, no
change in Fed policy is likely.</B> 

<p>In Canada, higher prices for food, new
motor vehicles and gasoline resulted in an escalation of the year-to-year
increases in the consumer price index (CPI) in recent months. The
seasonally adjusted month-to-month rise in the CPI in April was 0.4 per
cent, the largest monthly increase since last December, as food prices
soared by 0.8 per cent in the month. On a year-over-year basis, the total
index rose by 2.5 per cent, the largest gain since late 1991. Excluding
food and energy, <B>consumer prices rose by only 0.2 per cent in April, half
the March gain, for a year-over-year increase of 2.2 per cent. This is just
slightly above the mid-point of the Bank of Canada's 1-3 per cent target
range.</B> At the producer level, inflationary pressures appear to be
moderating, as a result of the recent appreciation of the Canadian dollar
and declines in lumber, aluminum and copper prices. Prices of
manufacturers' finished goods fell slightly in April, and as a result, the
year-over-year rate of change eased to 2.7 per cent. <B>Prices of
intermediate goods</B> were little changed in April and <B>still 13 per
cent higher</B> than year-earlier levels, indicating that there are still some
potentially inflationary pressures in the price pipeline. This suggests
that the <B>Bank of Canada will remain very cautious, and reluctant to
countenance pronounced weakness in the Canadian dollar.</B>

<H3>SHORT-TERM INTEREST RATES:</H3>
<p>Canadian short-term interest rates changed little
in the first part of the holiday-shortened week, despite the sharp fall in
the Canadian dollar in foreign markets on Monday. Nonetheless, the rise in
Canadian money market rates during the previous week triggered an
11-basis-point increase in the Bank Rate, to 7.71 per cent, on Tuesday. On
Wednesday, Canadian short-term rates tumbled by 15-24 basis points as a
spillover from a rally in the Canadian bond market appeared to more than
offset any expectation of higher short-term rates arising from the increase
in the rate of inflation in April. Some of this decline in short-term
interest rates was reversed late in the week, prompted by further weakness
in the Canadian dollar. U.S. short-term interest rates on paper of less
than 1-year's maturity were stable during the week, seemingly unaffected by
weaker-than-expected U.S. economic data and surging U.S. bond prices.

<H3>BOND MARKETS AND YIELD CURVES:</H3>

<p>Buoyed by soaring U.S. bond prices, Canadian bond prices rose sharply at
mid-week. However, the Canadian bond market retreated on Thursday, amid
rumours that a Japanese fund will likely redeem a large holding of
Canadian bonds maturing on June 1. The inversions of the Canadian yield
curve between the 3-month and 2-year maturities became more pronounced, but
the slope of the curve for longer maturities steepened. Despite the new
supply of U.S. Treasury notes, U.S. bonds performed well. U.S. longer-term
bonds significantly outperformed their Canadian counterparts, and the
Canada-U.S. 30-year bond spread reached its widest level since the height
of the Mexican peso crisis last January. The heavy buying pressure on U.S.
bonds was sparked by weaker-than-expected U.S. economic data released this
week and recent progress made by the U.S. Congress toward elimination of
the budget deficit. The slope of the U.S. yield curve flattened, and
shifted downward slightly.

<H3>CANADIAN DOLLAR: </H3>

On Monday, the Canadian dollar tumbled by 0.38 US cents in overseas trading,
apparently in reaction to a report by a New York investment dealer lowering
its outlook for the Canadian currency from positive to neutral. The
Canadian dollar recovered slightly at mid-week, assisted by strength in the
Canadian bond market. On Thursday, the Canadian dollar continued its
downward course, slipping below 73 US cents, weighed down by renewed
weakness of the U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen and German mark.
Rumours of large Japanese sales of the Canadian dollar appeared to place
additional downward pressure on the currency. The Canadian dollar opened at
72.92 US cents this Friday morning, down 0.85 US cents from its
week-earlier level.

<title>Weekly Digest: Toronto, May 19, 1995
</title> 
</head> <BODY BGCOLOR="#ffffff"> <h2>Weekly Digest of Economic and Financial
Developments</h2> <h3>Toronto, May 19, 1995</h3>

<p> The rally in the U.S. bond market in the first part of this week
seemed to reflect some optimism that omic growth in the United States had slowed
sufficiently to permit the Federal Reserve to ease monetary policy slightly at
the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) on May 23rd. However, the <B>economic data
released this week suggest that the Fed is unlikely to alter its monetary policy at
the present time. Although the pace of growth has slowed in recent months, the
levels of economic activity and resource utilization remain high</B>. 

<p>Industrial production fell by 0.4 percent in April, mainly at the manufacturing level,
reflecting efforts by firms to reduce high inventory levels, particularly in the
auto industry. As a result, <B>the capacity utilization rate in all industries fell
to 84.1 in April. However, it is still well above its long-term average rate of
82.0</B>. Even in the sluggish auto sector, where the capacity utilization rate fell
to 83.7 in April, it too remained well above the long-term average of just over
76. With lower interest rates and somewhat improved consumer confidence levels
set to revive consumer expenditures on autos and other durable goods in coming months,
further sustained declines in capacity utilization rates are unlikely. <B>A small
uptick in housing starts in April may signal the end of the deterioration in
residential construction activity</B>. Rates on U.S. 30-year fixed-rate mortgages
continued to decline, and by mid- May were at levels not seen since early 1994.
Rates on shorter-term mortgages are also much lower than those prevailing in late
1994 and in early 1995. Consistent with these lower mortgage rates, building
permits rose slightly in April. However, builders will likely remain cautious
until the high inventories of unsold homes are further reduced. <B>Merchandise trade
data for March indicated that demand for U.S. products remained strong</B>. Growth
in exports outpaced that of imports, resulting in a modest improvement in the
merchandise trade deficit. Export demand should continue to rise for the
remainder of the year, boosted by the lower U.S. dollar and faster economic growth in
most overseas countries. 

<p><B>The latest Canadian economic data continue to show the
adverse effects of the slowdown in the U.S. economy in the early months of 1995.
Canadian manufacturers were especially hard hit</B> by the sluggish
housing and auto sectors in the United States, with Canadian shipments falling by
0.6 percent in March after a substantial decline in February. High inventory
levels contributed to a decline in new orders in March, but unfilled
orders rose marginally. Canada's composite index of leading indicators rose only
slightly in April, indicating a continuation of the slower growth trend evident
in recent months. Canada's merchandise trade balance fell slightly to $1.9
billion in March, as both exports and imports declined. Auto exports were
adversely affected by the sluggish U.S. market, while grain and lumber exports
were depressed by strikes of rail and dockworkers. With these disputes resolved
and a modest revival seen for the U.S. housing and auto sectors, demand for
Canada's exports is expected to remain strong in coming months. <B>Canadian retail
sales fell for the third consecutive month in March</B>, as the rise in interest
rates in the first quarter in 1995 and sluggish employment growth weakened 
consumer confidence. Recent declines in mortgage rates and a
modest acceleration in negotiated wage increases should encourage some
pickup in consumer spending in coming months.

<H3>SHORT-TERM INTEREST RATES:</H3>
Last week's strong rally in the Canadian money market
came to a halt early this week when Canadian short- term interest rates moved
upward in reaction to a weaker Canadian dollar. Accordingly, the Bank Rate rose
by 13 basis points, to 7.60 percent, its first increase in 6 weeks. Canadian
short-term yields continued their ascent in the latter part of the week, as some
weakness in the recent Canadian bond market appeared to spill over into the
money market. By Thursday's close, short-term rates were 11-29 basis points
above week-earlier levels. During the week, U.S. 3-month T-bill rates rose only
modestly, while yields on 6-month and 1-year paper declined fractionally,
possibly in response to speculation about a cut in German short-term interest
rates. As a result, Canada- U.S. short-term interest rate spreads widened
considerably.

<H3>BOND MARKETS AND YIELD CURVES:</H3>

The Canadian yield curve flattened substantially
during the week to Thursday. Canadian long-term bond yields ended the week
slightly below last Thursday's levels, assisted by the U.S. bond market rally
that continued throughout much of the week. In contrast, yields on Canadian
shorter-term bonds rose sharply, as the market absorbed the new supply
following Wednesday's domestic and global 5-year Government of Canada bond
issues. The U.S. yield curve also flattened during the week, with U.S. bonds
significantly outperforming their Canadian counterparts. U.S. bond prices
rallied around Tuesday's release of weak U.S. industrial production and
capacity utilization data for April, which helped to assuage inflation fears
arising from April's U.S. price data. Nonetheless, speculation about foreign
central-bank selling of U.S. Treasuries during the week moderated bond price
advances.

<H3>CANADIAN DOLLAR: </H3>

On Monday, the Canadian dollar fell sharply against the U.S.
dollar in tandem with the weakness of the U.S. currency against the Japanese yen
and German mark. The end of last week's U.S. dollar rally appeared to reflect
investors' concerns that efforts to balance the U.S. budget were vulnerable to
compromises and delays. The Canadian dollar recovered to the 73.80 US cent level
on Tuesday, boosted by rising Canadian bond prices, then remained relatively
stable during the rest of the week. Investors seem to have been content to
maintain their current positions in U.S. and Canadian dollars ahead of next
Tuesday's FOMC meeting. The Canadian dollar opened at 73.77 US cents this Friday
morning, down 0.12 US cents from the same time last week.

<title>Weekly Digest: Toronto, May 12, 1995
</title> 
</head> <BODY BGCOLOR="#ffffff"> <h2>Weekly Digest of Economic and Financial
Developments</h2> <h3>Toronto, May 12, 1995</h3>

<p> <B>This week North American financial markets saw further
indications that the pace of the U.S. economic expansion slowed significantly in the
first part of 1995</B>. The Beige Book, prepared by the Federal Reserve Bank of
Philadelphia, indicated continuing gains in economic activity from March through
April but at a more moderate rate. According to the Fed survey, manufacturing
activity remained strong, especially in the capital goods and electronic goods
industries, but growth in retail sales remained sluggish. Commercial real estate activity
improved in most districts, but residential construction showed little strength in most
regions. Industrial and commodity prices showed moderate increases, but in most cases
these were not reflected in finished goods prices. The U.S. Department of
Commerce reported a 0.4 percent decline in the value of total retail sales in April,
with sales by automotive dealers down by 2.0 percent from March levels. In
response to these signs of slow growth, the U.S. bond market continued to rally
early in the week, and the yield on the U.S. benchmark long-bond fell below 7 per
cent for the first time since March 1994. 

<p><B>Data on U.S. producer and consumer
prices released later in the week were a reminder to investors that, while economic growth is
slowing, some price pressures remain</B>. Prices for finished goods at the producer
level rose by 0.5 percent in April, the largest month-to-month increase since
November. When the volatile food and energy components are excluded, April prices
increased by 0.3 percent, modestly more than market expectations. Prices for
goods at the intermediate level of production, which have been rising quite
rapidly since mid-1994, were 6.7 percent above year-earlier levels in April.
When the food and energy components are excluded, the year-to-year increase was
an even higher 7.8 percent, the largest 12-month gain since 1981, an indication
that further price hikes for finished goods are likely. Price increases at the
consumer level accelerated in April. The total Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose by
0.4 percent in the month and by 3.1 percent on a year-over-year basis,
exceeding the 3 percent level for the first time since late 1992. The core rate
of CPI (excluding food and energy prices) also jumped by 0.4 percent in April
and by 3.1 percent from April 1994. Prices paid for goods at the consumer level
rose sharply in April, and on a yearly comparison basis rose by over 2.6 per
cent, reflecting the rise in producer prices. <B>In the face of these price data,
North American bond markets retreated on Thursday and Friday as investors
realized that the likelihood of the Federal Reserve easing monetary
policy at its May 23 meeting had evaporated</B>. 

<p><B>The Canadian economy remained
sluggish in March and April, but the drop in mortgage interest rates in recent
weeks, with 1-year conventional mortgage rates falling to 9.0 percent by the
end of April from a high of 10.0 percent in January, should help to improve
consumer confidence and encouage consumer expenditure overall</B>.
Housing starts revived slightly in April, climbing to a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 113,300 units from 108,200 units in March.
Motor vehicle sales dropped in March, but this reflected a shortage of
popular models as well as sluggish consumer demand. 

<p><B>The Quebec budget</B>,
brought down on Tuesday, forecasts a reduction in the deficit in the current
fiscal year. However, the relatively weak performance of the Canadian bond
market compared with the U.S. market suggests that international investors
remain uneasy about Canadian government debt levels. Nonetheless, the Canadian
dollar rose sharply, perhaps reflecting relief that the budget
season is over and that <B>the combined federal-provincial budget deficits
will decline for the third consecutive year in fiscal 1995-96</B>.

alt="[Graph of Canadian and US Labour Markets]"></center></p>

<H3>SHORT-TERM INTEREST RATES:</H3>
On Monday, the Bank of Canada lowered its target
range for overnight funds by 25 basis points, to between 7.5 and 8.0 percent,
following last Friday's strong rally in the Canadian money market. Canadian
chartered banks responded shortly afterward, reducing mortgage rates by up to
five-eighths of a percentage point. Despite attempts by the Bank of Canada to
moderate the decline, downward pressure on Canadian short-term interest rates
continued unabated through Wednesday. As a result, the Bank Rate tumbled by 53
basis points, to 7.47 percent, its largest weekly decline in more than two
years. Although Canadian short-term yields beyond the 3-month maturity rose on
Thursday, in line with weaker Canadian bond prices, short-term interest rates
ended the day well below week-earlier levels. U.S. short-term interest rates
below the 1-year maturity rose slightly during the week, despite a firmer U.S.
dollar vis-a-vis the major overseas currencies.

alt="[Graph of Canadian and U.S. Yield Curves]"></center></p>

<H3>BOND MARKETS AND YIELD CURVES:</H3>

The Canadian yield curve shifted downward and
remained inverted out to the 2 year maturity this week. Yields fell sharply
for instruments of 5 years or less, but long-term bond yields declined only
slightly. U.S. long bonds outperformed their Canadian counterparts, as yields
tumbled in the first half of the week, propelled by additional evidence that
U.S. economic growth has slowed. On Tuesday, the yield on the 30-year U.S.
Treasury bond dipped below 7 percent for the first time in over a year.
However, bond prices gave up some of their gains later in the week, following
the U.S. Treasury 10-year note auction and slightly stronger-than-expected U.S.
producer price data for April. The slope of the U.S. yield curve flattened, as
it pivoted at the 1-year maturity. This morning, both Canadian and U.S. bond
prices fell following the release of stronger-than-expected U.S. consumer
price data for April.

<H3>CANADIAN DOLLAR: </H3>

The Canadian dollar weakened on Monday and Tuesday, offsetting much
of last Friday's rise. The Canadian currency was apparently weighed down by the
precipitous fall in Canadian short-term interest rates and by some uncertainty
preceding the Quebec provincial budget, which was brought down late Tuesday
afternoon. However, the positive tone re-emerged in the latter part of the
week, despite falling Canadian bond prices and sharply narrower Canada-U.S.
short-term interest rate spreads. On Thursday, the Canadian currency surpassed
74 US cents for the first time since last October. The Canadian currency opened
slightly lower this Friday morning, at 73.84 US cents, as Canadian bonds were
sold-off ahead of the U.S. consumer price data. Efforts by the Bank of Canada to
moderate the fall in Canadian short-term interest rates suggest that the Bank is
content with a stronger Canadian dollar, given continued economic expansion in
Canada and strong world commodity prices.

<title>Weekly Digest: Toronto, May 5, 1995
</title> 
</head> <BODY BGCOLOR="#ffffff"> <h2>Weekly Digest of Economic and Financial
Developments</h2> <h3>Toronto, May 5, 1995</h3>

<p><B>Data releases this week in the United States added to the evidence of a
slowdown to more sustainable rates of economic growth in the first quarter 1995,</B> and also
indicate that the growth rate in the second quarter will be similar to that in the
first quarter. Both of these observations are consistent with this department's
forecast U.S. economic performance for 1995. New residential construction
investment rose at an annualized rate of 3.0 per cent, about half the increase in
the final quarter of 1994. <B>The impact of the slowdown in residential investment
and in consumer expenditure in the first quarter resulted in a decline in non-farm
payrolls in April</B> as construction and non-durable manufacturing industries
reported a significant fall in employment levels. These declines were partially
offset by increased payroll employment in the service-producing industries. It
should be noted that the April employment may be underestimated as both Easter
and Passover occurred during the reference week for data collection. Average weekly hours in
manufacturing, as well as overtime hours, continued to decline in April as production slowed to
alleviate mounting concerns about high inventory levels. According to the household
survey, the labour force expanded in April which, when combined with a modest
slowdown in employment growth, resulted in the unemployment rate rising to 5.8
per cent in April from 5.5 per cent in the previous month.

<p><B>A resurgence in U.S. consumer expenditure in the second quarter may well be
possible.</B> Although consumers have refrained from purchases in recent months,
personal disposable incomes have continued to climb and the personal savings rate
is at its highest level in over two years. Increasing consumer confidence levels,
additional incentive programs for new car buyers and lower mortgage interest
rates should contribute to higher personal expenditures on durable goods in the
coming months. Weak auto sales in April reflected shortages of popular models as well
as consumer resistance to high sticker prices. The National Association of
Purchasing Management index rose in April, to 52.0, an indication that production
in the manufacturing sector continues to expand, albeit at a slower pace. The
decline in mortgage interest rates during March, with additional easing expected,
bodes well for sales of new and existing homes in the coming months. The gains in
consumer expenditure and residential investment in the second quarter may well
be offset by business inventory decumulation.

<p><B>In Canada, the drop in the labour force and unchanged employment levels in April
are consistent with a slowdown in employment growth.</B> The slowdown, which began in the first quarter, is
partly the result of higher interest rates over the past 15 months and partly the result of slower growth in 
demand for Canadian exports to the
United States. The drop in the Canadian unemployment rate to 9.4 per cent
in April from 9.7 per cent in March resulted solely from a decline in the labour-force. 
The April employment data showed a decline in full-time employment
and an equal increase in part-time employment. Caution should be exercised in
interpreting these data as labour force data can be volatile during the spring
months as students enter the labour force.

<p>Consumer confidence and spending in Canada have slumped to near-recessionary
levels according to a report by the Conference Board of Canada. <B>Although
consumers have been particularly hard hit by high interest rates and soft
employment prospects in the first quarter, the announcement of a 50-basis-point
reduction in Canadian chartered banks prime lending rate today, to
9.25 per cent, will benefit the interest-sensitive sectors of the
economy.</B> According to a survey by Statistics Canada in early April,
manufacturers have a worsening view of production prospects in
the second quarter. The recent sharp decline in housing starts, the slump in
motor vehicle sales and the higher prices for raw materials added to the
pessimism felt by manufacturers.

<H3>SHORT-TERM INTEREST RATES:</H3>
Propelled by a sharp rise of the Canadian dollar, Canadian
short-term interest rates declined early in the week. The positive tone in the
Canadian money market continued throughout the rest of the week, fuelled by a
buoyant performance in the Canadian and U.S. bond markets. On Thursday, the Bank
of Canada intervened in the money market in an attempt to cool the rally.
Canadian short-term rates ended the week to Thursday 16-30 basis points below
their week-earlier levels. A further 17-basis-point fall in the Bank Rate this
week, to 8.00 per cent, and a strengthening dollar led to the announcement on
Friday of a 50-basis-point decline in chartered bank prime rates. U.S.
short-term rates fell markedly during the week, pushed downward by expectations
of weak U.S. employment growth for April. Nonetheless, Canada-U.S. short-term
interest-rate spreads narrowed significantly.

<H3>BOND MARKETS AND YIELD CURVES:</H3>

Canadian bond prices surged during the week to
Thursday, lifted by a barrage of mid-week data releases offering further
evidence that U.S. and Canadian economic growth is slowing to a sustainable
rate. A successful 10-year Government of Canada bond auction on Wednesday and
soaring U.S. bond prices later in the week added further support to the rally.
The Canadian yield curve moved downward and its slope steepened. U.S. bond price
trends mirrored their Canadian counterparts, bolstered by heightened
expectations of weak U.S. employment data for April. This alleviated some
early-week market nervousness following news of a sharp rise in energy prices and
stronger-than-expected U.S. purchasing manager's data for April. The U.S. yield
curve also shifted downward significantly, while the slope flattened. This
morning, Canadian and U.S. bond markets continued their rally on news of a
decline in U.S. non-farm payrolls last month.

<H3>CANADIAN DOLLAR: </H3>

The Canadian dollar rose sharply last Friday, apparently
fuelled by a strengthening of the U.S. dollar vis-a-vis the major overseas
currencies. After reaching 73.82 US cents on Monday, its highest level since last
October, the Canadian currency retraced all of its early-week gain on
Wednesday. Contributing to the downward pressure was a recommendation by a New
York Investment dealer to switch from Canadian bond and currency holdings into
Australian debt securities. After falling slightly on Thursday, the Canadian
dollar soared about 0.50 US cents this Friday morning in European trading. It
appeared that the Canadian dollar's strength was being driven by strong demand
for Canadian bonds.

<title>Weekly Digest: Toronto, April 28, 1995 </title> </head> <BODY BGCOLOR="#ffffff"> <h2>Weekly
Digest of Economic and Financial Developments</h2> <h3>Toronto, April 28, 1995 </h3>

<p><B>Real U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) advanced at a slower-than-expected
annualized rate of 2.8 percent in the first quarter of 1995,</B> down from an
increase of 5.1 percent in the previous quarter. Although the rate of growth was
less than expected, the composition of real GDP growth was in line with market
expectations. <B>Domestic demand advanced by 2.7 percent</B> as weakness in the consumer
sector and a decline in residential investment was partially offset by continued
expansion in business investment. <B>The deficit in international trade in goods and
services soared</B> to $119.7 billion from $107.1 billion in the final quarter of 1994.
Total exports declined marginally in the first quarter of 1995 as a modest increase
in goods was more than offset by a decline in services. Total imports rose by $11.6
billion, led by non-petroleum products. The negative impact of the larger trade
deficit resulted in final demand rising by only 1.8 percent in the first quarter,
compared with growth of 5.7 percent in the last quarter of 1994. As expected,
<B>inventory accumulation increased</B> in the first quarter of 1995, adding an additional
$13.6 billion to real GDP. The increase of 2.2 percent in the GDP implicit price
deflator indicated that inflationary pressures remained under control in the first
quarter. However, with implicit price deflators for both exports  and imports
increasing by over 3 percent in the quarter, inflationary pressures will continue to
be closely watched by the Federal Reserve.

alt="[Graph of U.S. Economic Growth]"></center></p>


<p><B>The 19.3 percent increase in real business investment </B>in the first quarter,
following a gain of 17.6 percent in the previous quarter, <B>bodes well for continued
expansion in the U.S. economy in the coming quarters</B>. Business investment growth may
not maintain its recent pace in the second and subsequent quarters, but the
relatively high rate of personal savings in the first quarter, the apparent
resurgence of consumer confidence and some reductions in mortgage interest rates may
encourage more rapid spending by consumers, especially on durable goods. These
trends, along with some decumulation in business inventories, may result in total GDP
expanding in the second quarter at about the same rate as in the first quarter. <B>In
Canada, real gross domestic product at factor cost declined and retail sales dipped
in February</B>. Slow employment growth, a slump in the housing sector and sluggish
automotive production and sales contributed to the weakness. The level of industrial
production also receded in February but was still over 9 percent higher than
year-earlier levels. Manufacturing output was adversely affected by a drop in motor
vehicle sales in North America in recent months. Continued weakness in manufacturing
activity is expected in March in view of rising inventories of finished goods, slower
growth in unfilled orders and the labour dispute in rail transport last month.


<p><B>SHORT-TERM INTEREST RATES</B>
<p>Canadian short-term interest rates declined only
modestly in the first half of the week, despite a sharp rise in the Canadian dollar,
as the Bank of Canada maintained its target range for overnight funds. As a result,
the Bank Rate fell by a mere 1 basis point, to 8.17 percent. On Thursday, Canadian
short-term yields rose in anticipation of the release of the Province of Ontario's
economic statement and this morning's U.S. GDP data. Nonetheless, Canadian short-term
interest rates ended the week to Thursday slightly below week-earlier levels. U.S.
short-term interest rates (beyond the 1-month T-bill) moved up sharply during the
week in the face of data releases showing stronger-than-expected U.S. consumer
confidence, housing resales, and durable goods. Despite a positive initial reaction,
this morning's weaker-than-expected first-quarter data appear to be having little
impact on the Canadian and U.S. money markets.

<p><b>BOND MARKETS AND YIELD CURVES</b>
<p>During the first half of the week, Canadian bond prices
rose, spurred by the strength of the Canadian dollar. Some of the earlier gains were
offset on Thursday, as Canadian bond yields moved upward in concert with rising
Canadian short-term yields and falling U.S. bond prices. The Canadian yield curve
shifted downward and the slope flattened during the week, as yields fell by between 2
and 6 basis points. U.S. bond prices declined during the week, weighed down by
stronger-than-expected U.S. data and a mediocre response to the U.S. Government's
2-year note auction. The slope of the U.S. yield curve flattened, and shifted upward
significantly below the 10-year maturity. This Friday morning, Canadian and
U.S. bond markets appear to be relatively unmoved by U.S. first-quarter GDP data,
and February GDP data for Canada.



<p><b>CANADIAN DOLLAR</b>
<p>After rising sharply earlier in the week, the Canadian dollar
continued its rally on Wednesday, apparently supported by a rebound of the U.S.
dollar against the Japanese yen. Rumours of coordinated central-bank intervention in
the wake of a unified call by G-7 economic ministers for a stronger U.S. dollar may have
lifted the U.S. currency. The Canadian dollar remained firm throughout the remainder
of the week despite upward pressure on Canadian T-bill rates and bond yields on
Thursday. This Friday morning, the Canadian dollar opened at 73.41 US cents, up by 0.35
US cents from the week-earlier level.

21, 1995 </title> </head> <BODY BGCOLOR="#ffffff"> <h2>Weekly Digest of Economic
and Financial Developments</h2> <h3>Toronto, April 21, 1995
</h3>

<p>Several major U.S. data releases this week confirmed that the
rate of growth in the U.S. economy slowed significantly in the first quarter of
1995 after reaching 5.1 percent in the final quarter of 1994.
Industrial production fell and the rate of industrial capacity
utilization dipped to 84.9 in March, down from the high of 85.6
in January, although still not below its previous cyclical peak.
Housing starts fell sharply in March, but with mortgage lending
rates now down near year-earlier levels, activity in the housing
sector is likely to rebound. <B>Financial markets received news of
the declines in industrial production, capacity utilization and housing
starts with caution rather than enthusiasm.</B> Investors seem to be wary of
the potentially stimulative economic impact of the lower U.S.
dollar and the recent decline in mortgage lending rates and bond
yields. The improvement in the U.S. merchandise trade deficit in
February partially offset the deterioration reported in January.
The trade deficit averaged $14.6 billion a month over the past three
months, and even with no further deterioration, this implies an
annual deficit of $175 billion for 1995, larger than the $167
billion merchandise trade deficit recorded in 1994.


<p><B>Economic activity in Canada in the first quarter of 1995 was
adversely affected by the lull in U.S. economic growth as well as
a high degree of consumer caution in Canada.</B> Shipments by
Canadian manufacturers declined in February, reflecting weak
motor vehicle sales and plummeting housing starts in both Canada
and the United States. Manufacturers' new orders also fell in
February, largely the result of the recent drop in motor vehicle
sales. Although the value of both Canadian exports and imports
declined in February -- mainly the result of weak motor vehicle
sales on both sides of the border -- the merchandise trade
surplus rose slightly, to $2.4 billion. Exports for the first two
months of 1995 were nearly 37 per cent above year- earlier
levels, imports were almost 28 per cent higher and the trade
surplus was almost triple what is was in the first two months of
1994. However, in March, both exports and manufacturing activity
were probably adversely affected by the national rail strike and
the dockworkers dispute at the Port of Montreal. With a record
number of foreign visitors to Canada in February and a further
drop in Canadian visits to other countries, a reduction in Canada's
international travel account deficit is expected for the first
quarter of 1995. This, combined with an increase in the
merchandise trade surplus, could result in a further improvement
in Canada's current account balance in the first quarter of
1995.

<p>Canada's consumer price index (CPI) rose by a seasonally
adjusted 0.3 per cent in March, partly as a result
of the increases in gasoline and tobacco taxes introduced in
the federal budget and an additional hike in tobacco taxes
in Quebec. A large jump in cablevision rates also contributed
to the March rise. On a year-over-year basis, the inflation rate
climbed to 2.2 per cent from 1.8 per cent in February. The <B>slow
growth in the incomes of Canadian consumers and strong
competition for their retail dollars makes an inflation outburst
at the consumer level unlikely,</B> but the disinflationary
trend seems to be over. Wage increases in collective
bargaining settlements in Canada in February rose to 1.2
per cent from 0.5 per cent in January. Given the very small
number of employees covered (about half the usual monthly
average), the February data should be treated with caution.
Nonetheless, settlements in recent months, in conjunction with
Canada's economic expansion and falling unemployment
rate, do suggest that the 4-year decline in negotiated wage
settlements has run its course. <B>In this price and wage
environment, the Bank of Canada is likely to become more vigilant
against cost and wage pressures.</B> This is consistent with the very
modest decline in the Bank Rate in spite of the rise of the
Canadian dollar in recent weeks.

<h3>Short-Term Interest Rates:</h3> <p>On Tuesday, Canadian
short-term interest rates rose in reaction to the falling
Canadian dollar, offsetting the sharp decline in short-term
yields on Monday. As a result, the Bank of Canada Rate fell by
only 12 basis points, to 8.18 per cent. Although Canadian
chartered banks responded by reducing mortgage rates by up to one
half a percentage point, prime lending rates were left unchanged
at 9.75 per cent. The banks appear to be waiting for a reduction
in the rate on overnight funds before lowering their prime rates.
Canadian short-term interest rates continued their decline on
Thursday, propelled by renewed strength in the Canadian dollar, to
end the week below last Thursday's levels. U.S. short-term
interest rates fell slightly during the week to Thursday as
still-weak U.S. economic data increased confidence that the U.S.
Federal Reserve would not tighten policy at the next FOMC meeting
in May.

<h3>Bond Markets and Yield Curves:</h3> 
<p>Canadian bond prices
rose modestly during the week to Thursday, assisted by the
strength of the U.S. short- to medium-term bond market and a
successful 30-year Government of Canada bond auction on
Wednesday. The Canadian yield curve shifted downward slightly and
steepened during the week to Thursday, as the Canadian money
market outperformed the bond market. The yield curve is currently
inverted between the 6-month and 2-year maturities. In the United
States, the yield curve steepened beyond the 6-month maturity
during the week. U.S. shorter-term bond prices rose
significantly, bolstered by a halt in the fall of the U.S.
currency. However, prices of longer-term bonds were weighed down
by fears of the potentially inflationary impact of the weak
U.S. dollar.

<h3>Canadian Dollar:</h3> 
<p>The Canadian dollar rose early in
the week, seemingly spurred by a carry-over of buying sentiment
from the end of last week. Further supporting the Canadian
currency's strength was the Bank of Canada's decision to leave the
target range on overnight funds unchanged despite the willingness
of investors to push money-market yields lower. After reaching a
high of 73.31 US cents on Monday, its highest level since last
November, the Canadian dollar retraced about 0.40 US cents in the
mid-week. It was apparently affected by Wednesday's release of
the report from the Dominion Bond Rating Service (DBRS) on Ontario's
poor fiscal outlook. (It had been written in March, prior to the
DBRS decision to downgrade Ontario's short-term debt.)
Nonetheless, the Canadian dollar and the U.S. dollar ended the
week firmer, ahead of Tuesday's Group of Seven finance ministers'
meeting.

13, 1995  </title> </head> <BODY BGCOLOR="#ffffff"> <h2>Weekly Digest of Economic
and Financial Developments</h2> <h3>Toronto, April 13, 1995 
</h3>

<p><b>Data released this week indicate that the rate of inflation
at the consumer level in the United States remained under control
in March, but that price pressures are still lurking further up the price
chain.</b> The total consumer price index (CPI) rose by 2.9 per
cent in March from year-earlier levels, and excluding the
volatile food and energy prices, was 3.0 per cent higher than in
March 1994. Although prices for finished goods at the producer level rose
by a moderate 1.6 per cent in the 12 months to March, prices for
goods at the intermediate rose by 5.9 per cent. Prices for
intermediate goods excluding food and energy were still rising in
March, although at a slower rate than during the previous seven months,
and on a year-over-year basis prices were 7.1 per cent higher.
The costs to producers for raw materials continued to increase in
March, and producer prices for crude materials excluding food and
energy were 16.5 per cent above year-earlier levels.

<p><b>Some signs are appearing that U.S. consumer expenditures
may have revived somewhat in March from their dismal performance
in February.</b> Total retail sales rose by 0.2 per cent in
March, following a decline of 1.0 per cent in February. While
the dollar value of sales by automotive dealers was flat in
March, the number of motor vehicles sold increased in the month,
as dealer incentive programs encouraged consumers to return to
the showrooms. Another indication that consumer confidence may
have improved somewhat are reports of rising mortgage loan
applications. These reports, combined with the potentially
inflationary impact of the weak U.S. dollar, suggest that
continued vigilance by the Federal Reserve is appropriate.

<p><b>Data released for Canada this week indicate that, although
residential construction activity is weak, the level of consumer
confidence may be improving.</b> Housing starts fell in March,
and for the first quarter of 1995 they averaged only 129,000
units at seasonally adjusted annual rates, down from an average
of 142,000 units in the final quarter of 1994. This drop in
housing starts is not surprising, given the jump in mortgage rates in
late 1994 and early 1995. Nearly half of the sharp drop of 25,100
units (seasonally adjusted at annual rates) in total housing starts
in March occurred in British Columbia, where residential
construction activity returned to a more normal level from its
previously overheated state. Although Canadian consumers
exhibited little interest in housing in the early months of 1995,
their interest in autos showed some signs of revival in
February. Sales of new North American passenger cars rose
in February, although sales of imported cars continued to
decline.

<p><b>The report by Moody's Investors Services on Wednesday
afternoon that it had downgraded Canada's
foreign-currency and domestic-currency debt ratings had little
impact on financial and exchange markets.</b> The damage
to Canadian markets had been done in February when Moody's
first announced that Canada's debt ratings were under
review with negative implications. At that time, Canada-U.S.
short-term and long-term interest rate spreads widened
substantially and the Canadian dollar weakened. Since then, the
federal government has reduced its budget deficit and a number of
provinces have already achieved, or are close to achieving,
balanced budgets. On Tuesday, the Finance Minister for the
Province of Nova Scotia indicated that the province's budget
deficit for 1994-95 was less than previously estimated and that
the province expects to eliminate the deficit by fiscal 1997-98.
This <b> progress toward fiscal responsibility seems to have
helped to cushion Canadian markets from Moody's final downgrading
decision.</b>

<h3>Short-Term Interest Rates:</h3> 
<p>Propelled by the strength of the
Canadian dollar, Canadian short-term interest rates fell sharply on
Monday. As a result, the Bank of Canada Rate tumbled by 24 basis
points, to 8.30 per cent, the following day. Canadian chartered
banks left their prime lending rates unchanged, indicating that
they remain wary of continued volatility in financial markets.
Canadian short-term interest rates initially rose on Wednesday in the wake
of the announcement by Moody's Investors Service that it had
downgraded the Government of Canada's debt. However, they
quickly fell back to day-earlier levels in reaction to the
rebounding Canadian dollar. U.S. short-term interest rates
declined during the week to Wednesday, assisted by more
indications that the rate of U.S. economic growth is slowing, but
not by as much as Canadian rates. As a result, Canada-U.S.
short-term interest rate spreads narrowed significantly during
the week.

<h3>Bond Markets and Yield Curves:</h3>
<p>Canadian bond prices rose on
Monday, bolstered by the soaring Canadian dollar and falling
short-term interest rates. On Wednesday, the Canadian bond market
showed little reaction to Moody's downgrading of the
Government of Canada's debt; the event seems to have been fully
discounted. The Canadian yield curve steepened significantly
during the week as Treasury bill yields declined sharply and bond
yields rose modestly. Although U.S. producer and consumer
inflation data, released in the middle part of the week, were
lower than expected, the news failed to generate a rally in the
U.S. bond market. It appears that the persistence of price
pressures at the intermediate and crude levels of the production
process continues to be of concern to financial markets. The
U.S. yield curve shifted fractionally lower and steepened
slightly during the week.

<h3>Canadian Dollar:</h3> 
<p>A positive tone emerged in Canadian foreign-exchange 
markets on Monday, as the Canadian dollar gained 0.60 US
cents, apparently in response to signs of a rift developing
between the two leaders of the Quebec pro-sovereignty campaign. The
Canadian dollar remained firm throughout the remainder of the
week, despite Wednesday's long-awaited announcement of a
downgrade of the Government of Canada's debt by Moody's. After
falling briefly upon the release of the news, the Canadian dollar
rebounded on Wednesday afternoon. It opened this Thursday morning
at 72.74 US cents, after buying in overseas markets lifted the
currency above Wednesday's close. It appears as if investors
were more relieved that the uncertainty involving the Moody's action
had been dispelled than concerned about the actual
downgrade.

<title>Weekly Digest: Toronto, April 7, 1995  </title> </head> <BODY BGCOLOR="#ffffff"> <h2>Weekly Digest
of Economic and Financial Developments</h2> <h3>Toronto, April 7, 1995  </h3>




<p><b>Data released this week indicate that the pace of economic
activity in the United States slowed in first quarter of 1995 from the rapid
pace of the previous quarter, but that the economy continues to expand.</b> The
much-awaited employment data for March released this morning showed that the
increase in non-farm payroll employment slowed to 203,000 in March, from an
upwardly-revised 345,000 gain in February. For the first quarter of 1995, increases
in non-farm payroll employment averaged 239,000, moderately lower than the average
increase of 309,000 in the final quarter of 1994. Nonetheless, growth in
non-farm payroll employment continued to outpace labour force growth. While
employment in manufacturing industries declined marginally in March, employment in construction
industries, especially by special trade contractors, surged aided by unseasonably warm
weather. Weekly hours worked in manufacturing, although declining on a month-to-month
basis in the first quarter of 1995, aged 42.1 hours, the same as in the
previous quarter, while average overtime hours were marginally higher than in
the final quarter of 1994. 

<p>Other U.S. data released this week point to moderating growth
in the interest-sensitive sectors of the economy in February and March and to
continued, but not accelerating, price pressures. Despite an increase of 0.5 per
cent in personal income in February, consumers postponed purchases of
big-ticket items, which contributed to a rise in the personal savings rate to
4.9 per cent, the highest in nearly two years. The national association of
purchasing management (NAPM) index fell to 51.4 in March, an indication that
the manufacturing sector continues to expand, but at a more moderate pace. With
some survey respondents reporting shorter delivery times and fewer purchasers
paying higher material costs, price pressures may be starting to ease
somewhat. Sales of cars and light trucks are estimated to have declined by 5.3
per cent in March from year-earlier levels, a disappointing result since March is
traditionally the second-busiest month for sales. The continued slowdown in
sales, combined with an increase in marketing incentives to customers, will adversely
affect earnings in the auto industry in the first quarter of 1995. 

<p><b>The only
major economic release in Canada this week was the labour force survey for
March, which indicated little change in labour market conditions.</b> With growth in the
labour force outpacing that of employment, the unemployment rate rose
marginally -- to 9.7 per cent in March from 9.6 per cent in February. The gain
in employment in March, as in the previous six months, was concentrated in
full-time employment. The decline in employment in manufacturing industries in
March, the first drop since last August, may be partly related to
production problems in the auto industry. However, the weakness in
manufacturing employment was more than offset by a large increase in jobs in
the community, business and personal services sector. In the first
quarter of 1995, employment averaged 13,485,000, up 1.1 per cent from the
fourth quarter of 1994, the smallest quarterly gain since the third
quarter of 1993.<b> This indicates that the pace of the Canadian economic
expansion is slowing, as expected, in tandem with the United States.</b>

<p>Foreign exchange markets again provided drama for financial market
observers.<b> Last week's cut in the German discount rate, combined with Federal
Reserve and Bundesbank intervention this week, seems to have
stabilized the D-mark/U.S. dollar exchange rate above DM1.37.</b> The
Japanese yen, however, continued to advance against the U.S. dollar in
spite of frequent foreign-exchange market intervention by the Fed and the
Bank of Japan. On Thursday night, the U.S. dollar hit another post-war low of
Y83.65, and was still under pressure on Friday morning. Clearly <b>problems
exist which are unique to the yen, and expectations are rising that
major Japanese policy measures,</b>  including a discount rate cut and a 
supplementary budget, need to be implemented -- possibly as soon as next week.

<h3>Short-Term Interest Rates:</h3> 
<p>Despite a rallying Canadian dollar, Canadian short-term
interest rates (beyond the 1-month maturity) changed very little through
Wednesday. The Bank of Canada was apparently content to see the Canadian dollar
appreciate and willing to maintain significant spreads between Canadian and
U.S. short-term interest rates. As a result, the Bank of Canada Rate increased
by 7 basis points to 8.54 per cent. However, the momentum created by the
surging Canadian dollar on Thursday spilled over into the Canadian money
market, propelling short-term interest rates sharply lower. Canadian short-term
interest rates ended the week to Thursday 6-12 basis points below week-earlier 
levels. U.S. 1- and 3-month Treasury bill yields fell fractionally during
the week, while yields on longer maturities were up slightly.

<h3>Bond Markets and Yield Curves:</h3>
<p>Canadian bond prices rose in the first half of the week,
buoyed by a rising Canadian dollar and signs of slowing economic growth in the
United States. Further assisted by rumours on Thursday that Moody's Investors
Service would not downgrade the federal government credit rating, the Canadian
yield curve shifted downward during the week. Canadian medium-term bonds posted
the strongest advances, sparked by speculation that the U.S. Federal Reserve
was purchasing 5- and 10-year U.S. bonds on Tuesday as part of its effort to
add reserves to the U.S. banking system. U.S. bond prices also rose
significantly this week, with the 5-year bond significantly outperforming other
maturities as it recovered from last week's poorly received 5-year Treasury
note auction. The U.S. yield curve flattened significantly during the week.


<h3>Canadian Dollar:</h3> 
<p>The Canadian dollar gathered upward momentum in the first half
of the week, apparently unaffected by continued downward pressure on the U.S.
currency relative to the Japanese yen and German mark. On Tuesday, the Canadian
dollar rose by 0.27 US cents, as the U.S. and Japanese central banks intervened
to support the U.S. currency. Although further central bank intervention later in
the week, including efforts by the Bundesbank, failed to stabilize the U.S.
dollar, the Canadian dollar continued to strengthen. Comments made by the
Governor of the Bank of Canada on Wednesday, reiterating the importance of
price stability and mentioning some factors favouring the Canadian currency,
appeared to lift the Canadian dollar higher. The Canadian dollar opened this
morning at 71.94 US cents, up 0.62 US cents from last Friday's
open.

<title>Weekly Digest: Toronto, March 31, 1995 </title> </head> <BODY BGCOLOR="#ffffff"> <h2>Weekly Digest
of Economic and Financial Developments</h2> <h3>Toronto, March 31, 1995 </h3>



<p><b>The Bundesbank again surprised international
financial markets, as it is wont to do, by cutting its discount rate by
half a percentage point to 4 per cent on Thursday.</b> The cut in the
bellwether repo rate was more modest, from 4.85 per cent to 4.50 per
cent. The move is a reflection of the importance of international trade in
the German economy and, hence, the restrictive impact of the sharp
appreciation of the German mark that has occurred since late last
year. The Bundesbank, like the Bank of Canada, recognizes the
appropriateness and usefulness of offsetting moves in exchange rates and
interest rates for the operation of monetary policy. The U.S.
Federal Reserve appears to be less sensitive to the exchange
rate-interest rate interplay, which is not given the relatively
small size of the foreign trade sector in the U.S. economy. In any
event, the sharp decline of the U.S. dollar since late 1994, with
its potentially stimulating and inflationary impact on the United States failed to
impress the Fed, and <b>the U.S. monetary policy stance was left
unchanged following the FOMC meeting on March 28.</b> With the Fed apparently
indifferent to the fate of the U.S. currency and with international
investors concerned about the size of the U.S. budget and trade
deficits, the cut in the German short-term interest rates gave only
transitory support to the U.S. dollar and debt markets. On Thursday
morning, immediately after the announcement of the Bundesbank's
action, the U.S. dollar firmed by about 3 pfennigs and 1 yen, but in
trading this morning it sank to new lows against both currencies.

<p><b>The FOMC decision to leave U.S. monetary policy settings unchanged
reflected the apparent weakness in consumer spending and residential
construction activity in the first two months of 1995.</b> The 14 per
cent drop in sales of new single-family homes in February, announced
this week, confirmed the softness in the residential construction
sector. Data on the state of the consumer's psyche were ambivalent.
The Conference Board reported a small rise in its index of consumer
confidence in March, while the University of Michigan reported a
drop in its index of consumer sentiment. Last week's report of a 0.8 per
cent decline in new orders for durable goods in February was
confirmed by this week's fuller report. However, it also showed a
0.6 per cent rise in new orders for non-durable goods and the sixth
consecutive increase in the backlog of unfilled orders for durable
goods.<b>It is still unclear whether the U.S. economic expansion has
shifted to a slower,more sustainable growth rate or has merely
paused for a month or two before re-accelerating. 

<p>Canadian
bond markets received two more &quot;good news&quot; provincial
budgets this week.</b> Both British Columbia and Prince Edward
Island projected budget surpluses for the fiscal 1995-96 year. This
took some sting out of the announcement by Dominion Bond Rating
Service (DBRS) that it had changed its outlook for Government
of Canada debt from stable to negative. Statistics Canada
reported that <b>real gross domestic product (GDP) at factor cost rose
by a modest 0.2 per cent in January,</b> following gains of 0.5 per cent
in both November and December. Falling output in the finance,
insurance and real estate industries and in community, business
and personal services partially offset strong output gains in mining
and manufacturing. <b>Canadian industries continued to
benefit from higher product prices in February.</b> The industrial
product price index rose by 0.2 per cent in February for a
year-over-year increase of almost 9 per cent, <b>which augurs
well for corporate profit performance this year.</b> As in the
United States, price increases have been greatest for intermediate goods
 -- 12.4 per cent above year-earlier levels -- while
price increases for finished goods and consumer goods have been much
more moderate, so far. <b>Some pass-through of higher intermediate
goods prices to the consumer level can be expected as the year
progresses, but the Bank of Canada should have no difficulty in
staying within the inflation target band of 1-3 per cent.</b>

<h3>Short-Term Interest Rates:</h3> 
<p> Canadian short-term interest rates fell
early in the week, prompted by heightened expectations that U.S.
short-term interest rates would be left unchanged at Tuesday's FOMC
meeting. However, the stronger-than-expected U.S. consumer
confidence index for March, released on Tuesday, sent Canadian
short-term rates sharply upward. As a result, the Bank of Canada
Rate rose by 7 basis points to 8.47 per cent. Canadian short-term
interest rates remained stable throughout the remainder of the week,
despite some volatility in the foreign exchange market. The rise in
Canadian short-term yields during the week ended Thursday was most
pronounced at the short end of the money-market curve. U.S.
short-term interest rates were stable again this week, consistent
with the decision by the Federal Reserve to leave monetary policy
unchanged.

Yield Curves]"></center></p>


<h3>Bond Markets and Yield Curves:</h3>
<p>Canadian bond prices rose
early in the week as weaker-than-expected data for U.S. durable good
orders and sales of existing homes increased expectations that the
U.S. Fed would not increase short-term interest rates at Tuesday's
FOMC meeting. However, the tone in the Canadian bond market
turned negative at mid-week, when short rates rose. In addition, the
announcement by DBRS of its more negative outlook on Government of
Canada debt put further upward pressure on bond yields. Nonetheless,
with the exception of the 2-year maturity, Canadian bond yields
ended Thursday 8-11 basis points below week-earlier levels. The
slope of the Canadian yield curve flattened significantly, as it
pivoted at the 2-year maturity. The U.S. bond market underperformed
its Canadian counterpart and the U.S. yield curve flattened slightly
during the week, with a sharp spike upward at the 5-year maturity. 
North American bond prices tumbled this Friday morning in
reaction to weaker North American currencies.


<h3>Canadian Dollar:</h3> 
<p>The Canadian dollar rose sharply early on Monday in
concert with rising Canadian bonds, but retraced much of the gain in
a nervous market ahead of Tuesday's FOMC meeting. The Canadian
currency rebounded on Thursday in reaction to the Bundesbank's
decision to lower its discount rate, which took foreign exchange
markets by surprise. Further supporting the North American
currencies' strength against overseas currencies was the possibility
that the Bank of Japan would follow the German central bank and
reduce short-term interest rates. The Canadian dollar opened this
morning at 71.32 US cents, down significantly from Thursday's high
of 71.65 US cents. It was apparently affected by repatriation of
Japanese funds on the final day of the Japanese fiscal year and the
failure of the Bank of Japan to cut its discount rate.

<title>Weekly Digest: March 24, 1995</title> </head> <BODY BGCOLOR="#ffffff"> <h2>Weekly Digest
of Economic and Financial Developments</h2> <h3>Toronto, March 24, 1995</h3>


<P>Few key <b>U.S. economic indicators</b> were released this week, but two releases
elicited strong reactions in financial markets. This morning's report of a 0.8 per
cent decline in new orders received by manufacturers of durable goods in February was
weaker than expected. It was interpreted as evidence of a significant slowdown in the U.S.
economy and prompted a sharp rally in the U.S. bond market. However,<b> a small
dip in new orders following three very large monthly increases is not sufficient
proof that U.S. economic growth is sharply decelerating,</b> especially when the
February data are very preliminary and subject to substantive revisions. 

<P><b>The U.S. international trade data for January did not indicate any slowdown in U.S.
domestic demand.</b> The US$4.3 billion jump in the merchandise trade deficit, which
prompted another bout of downward pressure on the U.S. dollar on Wednesday, was not
as bad as it looked, but reflected a rebound from an unusually small deficit in
December. However, the January data did show persistent and broadly-based
growth in imports that is typical of an expanding and fully-employed economy.
With U.S. goods producers operating at very high levels of capacity
utilization, growing U.S. demand has been sucking in imports. 

<P>Many of those
U.S. imports came from Canada and contributed to a 6.2 per cent jump in
Canadian exports in January, led by an 18 per cent rise in car exports that went
primarily to the United States.<b> Canada's trade surplus climbed to a
higher-than-expected $2.4 billion in January</b> from $2.1 billion in December. February's
trade numbers will likely be quite strong as well, but in March, exports are
anticipated to show the negative effect of the strikes that have seriously slowed
rail transportation and temporarily halted activity at both east and west coast
ports. 

<P><b>Canadian retail sales data, like the foreign trade data, were a little
stronger than expected.</b> Total sales rose by 0.8 per cent in January, and sales
excluding those at motor vehicle dealers climbed by 1.0 per cent. In some instances,
gains in sales (which are measured in current dollars) reflected price
increases rather than higher sales volumes. This seems to have been the case
with car sales, where dealers reported a small rise in dollar sales but a sharp
drop in the number of vehicles sold. Further increases in interest rates in
February and March suggest that retail sales gains in coming months
will be smaller. 

<P>The Canadian consumer price index (CPI) rose by a
modest 0.2 per cent between January and February, but the year-over-year
increase jumped to 1.8 per cent from 0.6 per cent in January as the impact of
the February 1994 reductions in tobacco taxes disappeared from the
annual comparisons.<b> Excluding food and energy, the year-over-year increase
in the CPI was a slightly smaller 1.7 per cent, below the official target of 2
per cent.</b> 

<P>The weaker-than-expected data for U.S. new durable goods orders,
following last week's soft numbers for U.S. retail sales and housing starts,
suggest that <b>it will be hard for the FOMC to decide in favour of tightening
U.S. monetary policy another notch at its meeting next Tuesday, in spite
of the evidence that the U.S. economy is still expanding at an unsustainably
rapid rate.</b> A decision by the Fed to hold U.S. short-term interest rates
stable would remove one area of concern to Canadian investors over the
next few weeks, as they await the remaining provincial budgets and Moody's
decision whether to downgrade the federal government's debt.

alt="[Graph of Merchandise Trade Balance]"></center></p>


<h3>Short-Term Interest Rates:</h3> 
<p>Despite a decline in Canadian short-term interest
rates on Monday, due to a rising Canadian dollar, Tuesday's setting of the Bank
of Canada rate was unchanged from last week's 8.40 per cent -- consistent
with a more stable Canadian money market in comparison to recent weeks. Upward
pressure on short-term yields emerged later in the week in reaction to weaker
North American currencies vis-a-vis the Japanese yen and the German mark.
Canadian short-term interest rates ended the week 6-9 basis points above
week-earlier levels, although the 3-month T-bill rose by less. In contrast,
U.S. short-term interest rates fell slightly during the week, an indication
that investors are not expecting the Fed to tighten at next Tuesday's FMOC
meeting.

Yield Curves]"></center></p>

<h3>Bond Markets and Yield Curves:</h3>
<p>Canadian bond prices fell in the first half of
the week, weighed down by investor concern over the outcome of Wednesday's
meeting between Moody's Investors Service and federal government officials.
Canadian bonds recovered slightly toward the end of the week, boosted by a
successful 10-year Government of Canada bond auction. Nevertheless, the Canadian 
yield curve shifted upward and the slope steepened during the week to
Thursday. A wider-than-expected U.S. trade deficit in January, continued fears
about Latin American economic stability, and concerns over next week's U.S.
government note auctions caused U.S. bond yields to rise sharply during the
week to Thursday. The slope of the U.S. yield curve steepened significantly as
money market yields (except for 1-month) declined, whereas yields on maturities
greater than 5 years increased by 7-10 basis points. Canadian and U.S. bond
prices soared this morning following the report of weak U.S. durable goods
orders for February.

<h3>Canadian Dollar:</h3> 
<p>After reaching a low of 70.37 US cents last Friday, the
Canadian dollar rose by 0.51 US cents on Monday and Tuesday, assisted by a
modest recovery in the U.S. currency. A combination of Japanese central-bank
intervention and calls for a stronger U.S. dollar at the European Union finance
ministers' meeting lifted the U.S. dollar slightly against other major overseas
currencies. On Wednesday, the report of a wider-than-expected Canadian
trade surplus in January helped provide support for the Canadian currency against
its U.S. counterpart. The Canadian dollar fell late in the week, weighed down
by rumours that Prime Minister Chretien's meeting with the Managing Director
of the International Monetary Fund was linked to Canada's uncertain fiscal
situation and worries of the federal government's credit rating and not to
reform of international financial institutions. Nonetheless, the dollar opened this Friday
at 71.20 US cents, up 0.62 US cents from the same time last week.

<head> <title>Weekly Digest: March 17, 1995</title>
</head> <BODY BGCOLOR="#ffffff"> <h2>Weekly Digest of Economic and Financial Developments</h2>
<h3>Toronto, March 17, 1995</h3>



 
<p><b>This week's readings on the state of the U.S.
economy were as ambiguous as last week's.</b> Industrial production increased
by 0.5 per cent in February, and the pace of advance accelerated over
the last three months. The rate of capacity utilization for all
industries rose to 85.7 per cent, well above the long-term average and
higher than previous cyclical peaks. In manufacturing the rate of capacity
utilization continued to hover 85 per cent, in line with the previous
peak in 1989. 

<p><b>Other indicators of U.S. economic activity appeared to be
weaker.</b> Business inventories increased in January. The aggregate
inventory/sales ratio rose slightly to 1.39, but remained well below its
year-earlier level of 1.42. Retail sales fell by 0.5 per cent in
February, but January sales were revised upward to a gain of 0.6 per
cent from the initially-reported increase of 0.2 per cent. Auto sales
declined for the second consecutive month, partly in response to
higher interest rates, but possibly as a result of later-than-normal
personal income tax refunds. If slow tax refunds have played a role,
then sales of vehicles and other large consumer durable can be
expected to rebound in the March-April period. U.S. housing starts
declined by 2.6 per cent in February, but housing permits were almost
unchanged, by a fractional 0.6 per cent. Housing starts were
exceptionally strong in the last quarter of 1994 -- above 1.5 million
units at a seasonally adjusted annual rate and well above trend -- so
some weakness in the early months of this year is not surprising and
not necessarily a sign of continuing contraction. 

<p><b>The latest U.S.
price data do not indicate explosive inflationary pressures, but they
do suggest that inflation is likely to become more visible over the
next few months.</b> Prices for intermediate goods at the producer level
continued to rise rapidly in February, pushing the 12-month rate of
increase to 5.7 per cent, while the annualized rate of change for the
3 months ended in February reached 9.9 per cent. Historically, price
increases for intermediate goods have eventually been passed through
to finished goods at the producer level and to goods at the consumer
level. So far in this cycle, producer prices for finished goods have
risen very slowly. In February they were only 1.7 per cent above
year-earlier levels. However, over the 3 months ended in February they
rose at an annualized rate of 4.2 per cent, which suggests that the
rate of inflation at the consumer level is likely to accelerate somewhat
in coming months. 

<p>A key question for Federal Reserve policy makers when
the FOMC meets on March 28 is whether U.S. economic growth is already
slowing enough (and will stay slow enough) to prevent the spread
of inflation, in which case no further increases in the fed funds rate
will be necessary. Given the tone of the latest &quot;beige book&quot;, it is
possible that members of the FOMC will decide to do nothing at this
meeting. The recent fall in the U.S. dollar vis- a-vis the
Japanese yen and the German mark is unlikely to influence the
Fed. <b>However, if inflation becomes more evident at the consumer
level in the next few months and if the economy demonstrates more
stamina than currently expected, the Fed will likely tighten
monetary policy again by late spring.</b></p> 

<p><b>Canadian data released this week
indicated that the economy continued to perform well in the early
months of 1995.</b> Manufacturing shipments, new orders and unfilled
orders all increased in January, the beneficiaries of strong export
demand from the United States and rising prices for many industrial
products. Canada's composite leading indicator rose by 0.5 per
cent in February, about as fast as it has each month since last
spring. <b>However, there are some signs that the goods upward gyrations
in interest rates that have occurred since last autumn are beginning
to dampen activity in some sectors </b>of the Canadian economy --
particularly consumer expenditures and housing.

<h3>Short-Term Interest Rates:</h3> 
<p>Canadian short-term interest rates ended
the week slightly above week-earlier levels in the wake of mixed U.S.
price and retail sales data and a lower Canadian dollar. Nonetheless,
the Bank of Canada rate declined on Tuesday -- by 20 basis points to
8.40 per cent -- due to a rebound in the Canadian dollar and a rally
in the money market in the latter part of the previous week. U.S.
short-term interest rates fell during the week to Thursday. Most of
the decline occurred early in the week, propelled by a New York Times
article which indicated that some members of the U.S. Federal Reserve
were satisfied with U.S. interest rates at current levels. In
addition, weaker-than-expected February U.S. retail sales data on
Tuesday, heightened market expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve
would not increase short-term interest rates at the FMOC meeting on March
28.

Yield Curves]"></center></p>

<h3>Bond Markets and Yield Curves:</h3>
<p>The Canadian bond market advanced during
the week as financial markets interpreted the barrage of U.S. data to
mean that U.S. economic growth is slowing, while focusing less
attention on stronger-than-expected producer price and industrial
output data. On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve's review of regional
economic conditions, the &quot;beige book&quot;, reinforced market consensus
that the U.S. economy was growing less vigorously. The Canadian yield
curve flattened during the week to Thursday with slight increases in
3-month and 1-year yields and modest decreases in yields on maturities
of 5 years and more. However, the yield curve remained inverted
between the 6-month and 2-year maturities. U.S. bonds outperformed
Canadian bonds during the week, as the Canadian bond market continued
to be weighed down by a weaker Canadian dollar. The U.S. yield curve
flattened significantly during the week, with yields on maturities of
over 1 year falling sharply.

<h3>Canadian Dollar:</h3> 
<p>The Canadian dollar remained under intermittent
downward pressure throughout most of the week due to the persistent
threat of a downgrade by Moody's and concern over the upcoming Ontario
and Quebec budgets. On Thursday, the Canadian dollar fell in tandem
with its U.S. counterpart vis-a-vis other major currencies following the
Bundesbank's decision to leave German short-term interest rates
unchanged. However, the Canadian currency recovered later in the day,
strengthening against the U.S. dollar, after rumours of international
central bank intervention to support the U.S. dollar permeated
financial markets. The Canadian dollar opened this Friday morning at 70.58
US cents, down 0.56 cents from last Friday's open, as continued turmoil
in the European financial markets created renewed flight to the German
mark.

<head> <title>Weekly Digest: March 10, 1995</title>
</head> <BODY BGCOLOR="#ffffff"> <h2>Weekly Digest of Economic and Financial Developments</h2>
<h3>Toronto, March 10, 1995</h3>





<p><b>International foreign exchange markets were extremely unsettled again
this week.</b> South and central American currencies remained under pressure, still haunted by
Mexican economic, financial and political problems. Some of the weaker
currencies in the European exchange rate mechanism (ERM) devalued and some had to
be supported by increases in short-term interest rates in the face of a surging
D-mark. <b>The U.S. dollar fell further against the yen and the D-mark in the
first part of the week,</b> but started to revive after mid- week, as U.S.
officials made statements that were interpreted to be supportive of the dollar. The
release of the U.S. employment data for February, which were much stronger than
anticipated, revived expectations of another increase in the fed funds rate.
This, combined with rumours that the Bundesbank might consider lowering
short-term interest rates in Germany to mitigate the restrictive impact of the
rise in the D-mark, also lent some support to the U.S. dollar this morning.
Although the worst of the current movement away from the U.S. dollar may be
over, international currency markets will remain uneasy for some time. 

<p><b>The
U.S. employment report for February, perceived by financial markets as a key
determinant of Federal Reserve monetary policy in the near-term, showed that
the U.S. economy was still expanding at a good pace.</b> Led by strong gains in
services and retail trade, non-farm payroll employment rose by a larger-
than-expected 318,000 in February, and the January employment gains were
revised upward. Although the growth in manufacturing employment slowed somewhat
in February, the pace of job creation in the first two months of 1995 was
almost as strong as in the final quarter of 1994. The unemployment rate fell to
5.4 per cent in February, returning to the December 1994 level after rising to
5.7 per cent in January. Average weekly hours in manufacturing slipped
fractionally to 42.1 hours from the record high of 42.2 hours per week in
January, and overtime hours were unchanged at a very high 4.9 hours per week.
Average hourly earnings were unchanged in February standing at about 2.5 per cent
higher than year-earlier levels. <b>However, with the unemployment rate down to
5.4 per cent and with employment rising much faster than the labour force,the
Federal Reserve will remain concerned about potential inflationary pressures.</b>
Another increase in the target fed funds rate is likely at the FOMC meeting
scheduled for March 28. 


<p><b>Canadian economic data released this
week point to weakness in the interest-sensitive consumer and
residential construction sectors in the early months of 1995.</b> Employment
in Canada fell by 0.2 per cent in February but the unemployment rate dipped
to 9.6 per cent from 9.7 per cent in January as the labour force also shrunk.
The strength of Canada's manufacturing industry resulted in employment gains of
53,000 in that sector in February, but employment in the construction and
trade industries was adversely affected by the impact of higher Canadian
interest rates. The decline in construction jobs is not surprising given
the drop in housing starts in February, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of
135,300 units, down from 142,400 units in January. Another sign of consumer
concern about higher interest rates was the fall of almost 10 per cent in sales
of new motor vehicles in January. The adverse effects of higher financing
costs were compounded by higher prices for new vehicles -- partially the result
of the lower Canadian dollar. 

<p><center><img src="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/Research/Economic_Reports/03-10-95wd/03-10-95graph1.gif" alt="[Graph of US Labour Market]"></center></p>


<h3>Short-Term Interest Rates:</h3> 
<p>Canadian short-term interest rates rose sharply in
the first half of the week in reaction to the precipitous decline of the Canadian
dollar. Despite heavy intervention by the Bank of Canada in the money market
to slow the climb in treasury bill rates, the Bank rate jumped by 58 basis
points on Tuesday to 8.60 per cent. Canadian chartered banks immediately
responded by raising their prime rates by one half of a percentage point to
9.75 per cent. A stronger Canadian dollar in the second half of the week
allowed Canadian short-term interest rates to fall, ending the week to
Thursday only 3-6 basis points above their week-earlier levels. U.S. short-term
interest rates remained relatively stable throughout the week. However,
stronger-than-expected U.S. employment data for February, together with the
sharply weaker U.S. currency, suggest that U.S. short-term interest rates will
rise over the next few weeks.

Yield Curves]"></center></p>



<h3>Bond Markets and Yield Curves:</h3>
<p>The slope of the Canadian yield curve flattened significantly during the week, pivoting around the one- year maturity. Canadian
bond prices survived the wave of selling pressure against the North American
currencies through Tuesday with relatively small declines. In the second
half of the week, bond prices moved sharply higher, bolstered by the turnaround
of the Canadian dollar. U.S. bonds also recovered in the latter part of the
week, as the Federal Reserve Chairman's speech to the U.S. Congress on
Wednesday, emphasizing the Fed's determination to achieve price stability in
spite of the depreciating currency, relieved investor concerns over U.S.
inflation. The slope of the U.S. yield curve steepened slightly and shifted
modestly upward during the week. The potentially negative reaction of U.S.
bonds to the stronger-than-expected U.S. employment data this Friday morning
was offset by the positive impact of the stronger U.S. dollar.





<h3>Canadian Dollar:</h3> 
<p>The heavy downward pressure on the Canadian dollar last week
continued unabated in the first part of this week. Concerns over the Federal
Reserve's willingness to support the weakened U.S. dollar and the apparent
ineffectiveness of international central-bank foreign-exchange intervention
resulted in a sell-off of the Canadian dollar and the other North American
currencies. In addition, the devaluation of the Spanish peseta and Portuguese
escudo on Monday hastened investor flight to quality to the German mark. The Canadian
dollar rebounded on Wednesday from the week's low of 70.26 US cents on Tuesday
following comments by Federal Reserve Chairman Greenspan to the U.S. Congress
linking the strength of the U.S. dollar to domestic price stability. This Friday
morning, the Canadian dollar opened at 71.14 US cents and remained firm against its
U.S. counterpart in morning trading.

<title>Weekly Digest: March 3, 1995</title> </head> <BODY BGCOLOR="#ffffff"> <h2>Weekly Digest
of Economic and Financial Developments</h2> <h3>Toronto, March 3, 1995</h3>


<p><b>In the much-awaited Federal Budget, Canada's Finance Minister announced the
first substantial steps toward a restructured federal government.</b> Based on reasonable
economic assumptions, the budget was well-received in financial markets. The Canadian
budget deficit is estimated at $37.9 billion for fiscal 1994-95, and expected to
fall to $24.3 billion in 1996-97. Increases in interest payments on the public debt will
moderate the positive impact of expected cuts in program spending and increased
budgetary revenues. The level of net public debt is forecast to increase from
$546 billion in fiscal 1994-95 to $603 billion in fiscal 1996-97. Transfers to
provincial governments will not be affected until fiscal 1996-97, at which
time the structure of transfer programs will change and total federal-provincial
transfers will be reduced to $35.4 billion, a reduction of $2.3 billion from fiscal
1995-96 levels. 

<p>The Federal Budget assumed real gross domestic product (GDP) growth
of 4.3 per cent in 1994, but data released later in the week indicated that
<b>the pace of economic activity in Canada was actually a somewhat more robust 4.5 per
cent.</b> In the final quarter of 1994, real GDP grew at an annual rate of 5.9 per
cent and the implicit price deflator declined by 0.3 per cent. Growth in
consumer expenditures and business investment on machinery and equipment contributed
to an increase of 3.6 per cent in final domestic demand in the quarter. Increased demand for
Canadian merchandise exports resulted in a $3.7 billion surplus on net exports
of goods and services, a major contribution to total economic growth. Real GDP at
factor cost in Canada rose by 0.5 per cent in December following a gain of 0.6
per cent in November. The strength evident in the Canadian economy in the
closing months of 1994 is expected to carry forward into 1995, adding credence
to the forecast of a 3.8 per cent rate of expansion in 1995 contained in the
Federal Budget. 

<p>Data indicate that the pace of economic expansion in the United
States was stronger than previously anticipated in the final quarter of 1994.
<b>The revised estimate of U.S. GDP in the final quarter of 1994 was modestly
stronger, with significant revisions to several major components.</b> Business
inventory accumulation was much lower than previously reported, and upward
revisions were reported for consumer spending, federal government purchases
and residential investment. Net exports of goods and services were $14.5 billion
higher than estimated, a result of stronger export growth and somewhat slower
import growth. Final domestic sales rose at a seasonally adjusted annual rate
of 5.3 per cent in the final quarter, much stronger than the
previously-reported 3.7 per cent. Canada's federal budget estimates
are based on the assumption that the U.S. economy will expand by 3.2 per cent
in 1995, compared with 4.0 per cent in 1994. 

<p><b>Financial markets remain uncertain whether there is sufficient evidence of 
slowing U.S. economic growth in early 1995 to alleviate the Federal Reserve's
concern with potential inflationary pressures.</b> Despite an increase in
the number of new single-family homes sold in January, the inventory of
unsold homes rose to the highest level since July 1990. This is consistent
with the decline in construction spending on new housing in January, reported
this week. Personal income rose by 0.9 per cent in January and consumers
allocated much of their increased income to savings, which
boosted the personal savings rate to 5.0 per cent, the highest since
April 1993. This is consistent with the modest declines in consumer confidence
reported in January and February. Personal expenditures rose by some 0.4 per
cent in January, in spite of the second consecutive monthly decline in
purchases of durable goods. The index of leading indicators was unchanged in
January following an upwardly-revised increase in December. The
National Association of Purchasing Management (NAPM) index fell from 57.9
in January to 54.5 in February. With the index still well above 50,
the U.S. manufacturing sector is still growing, albeit at a somewhat
slower pace than in 1994.

<h3>Short-Term Interest Rates:</h3> 
<p>Canadian short-term interest rates fell sharply
early in the week as a rally in the Canadian money markets leading up to the
federal budget was supported by a favourable initial reaction to the budget. On
Tuesday, the Bank of Canada rate dropped by 36 basis points, to 8.02 per cent,
and the chartered banks lowered their prime rates by one-quarter of a
percentage point to 9.25 per cent. However, the tone turned negative in
mid-week due to sharply weaker Canadian and U.S. currencies. In spite of the
Bank of Canada's attempts to moderate the rise in short-term interest rates,
by Thursday Canadian short-term rates were above their week-earlier levels.
U.S. short-term interest rates were little changed during the week to
Thursday, since the U.S. Federal Reserve resorted to foreign-exchange market
intervention rather than higher rates to support the falling U.S. dollar.

Yield Curves]"></center></p>


<h3>Bond Markets and Yield Curves:</h3>
<p>Canadian bonds surged early in the week,
benefitting from pre- and post-budget investor optimism. However, Canadian
bond prices moved downward during the remainder of the week, propelled by
continuing concern over the federal government's debt rating, rumours of
foreign sales of Canadian bonds, and the announcement by Dominion Bond Rating
Service that it had placed Ontario's debt rating under review with negative
implications. In spite of the declines in bond prices on Wednesday and
Thursday, the Canadian yield curve shifted downwards and steepened during the
week to Thursday. Although U.S. bond yields rose on Wednesday and Thursday
amid concern about the falling U.S. dollar and conflicting data on the
strength of the U.S. economy, U.S. bond prices ended the week to Thursday
higher. The U.S. yield curve shifted downward and the slope flattened
slightly.

<h3>Canadian Dollar:</h3> 
<p>Despite currency market jitters on Monday upon the
announcement of the Barings Bank collapse, the Canadian dollar moved sharply
upward, bolstered by positive investor sentiment up to, and immediately
following, the presentation of the Canadian federal budget. The Canadian dollar
reached a high of 71.97 US cents on Tuesday. Downward pressure on the 
Canadian dollar prevailed throughout the rest of the week, as international
investors moved to safety in the German mark. Adding further to the Canadian
currency's weakness were federal and provincial bond-rating concerns, which
pushed the dollar to a low of 71.06 US cents on Thursday. The Canadian dollar
regained some strength this Friday morning, opening at 71.38 US cents,
assisted by Bank of Canada intervention in the foreign-currency
markets.

<head> <title>Weekly Digest: February 24, 1995</title>
</head> <BODY BGCOLOR="#ffffff"> <h2>Weekly Digest of Economic and Financial Developments</h2>
<h3>Toronto, February 24, 1995</h3>


<p>With few major U.S. economic indicators released this week, the attention of
financial markets was focused on <b>Federal Reserve Chairman Greenspan's
Humphrey-Hawkins testimony to Congress.</b>  Mr. Greenspan suggested that the rate
of economic growth in the United States was slowing, and that the price pressures
evident at the producer level need not become entrenched in the economy. <B>Bond
market participants interpreted these remarks to indicate that the Federal
Reserve had won its battle to contain inflationary pressures and that interest
rates were on hold or could even ease somewhat as the pace of economic expansion
slowed.</B> This view was reinforced on Thursday when the Department of Commerce
released its semi-annual survey of business investment intentions for 1995. U.S.
businesses are planning to increase total investment expenditure by 6.6 per cent
in 1995, less than half the estimated 13.7 per cent gain in 1994. Investment
intentions in the manufacturing sector in 1995 are expected to increase by more
than 20 per cent as manufacturers continue to modernize plants and upgrade
equipment to increase capacity. However, capital spending in the mining,
construction and services industries is expected to decline. Also on Thursday it
was reported that initial unemployment insurance claims rose in the week ended
February 17, pushing the four-month moving average up to 335,000.

<p><b>The perception of slower growth in the United States added to downward
pressure on the U.S. dollar,</b> which fell vis-a-vis the major overseas
currencies and the Canadian dollar. The German mark remained the currency of
choice, as international investors continued to fret about political developments in
France, Spain and the U.K., economic problems in Mexico, and fiscal difficulties
in Italy, Canada and Sweden.

<p><b>Late in the week financial market participants began to evaluate Fed
Chairman Greenspan's remarks more cautiously, and the likelihood of monetary
easing by the Federal Reserve became less certain.</b> It seems more likely that
the Fed will wait for additional information on the pace of economic expansion in
the United States before making any change in policy. Indications that the U.S.
economy is still robust were provided in the report on new durable goods orders
for January, released early this morning. New orders for all durables rose by 0.6
per cent, in spite of expectations of a 1 per cent decline. Excluding defense,
new orders increased by a strong 2.6 per cent. Unfilled orders also continued to
increase, led by industrial and electronic machinery and equipment. Some of the
strength in the U.S. durable goods industries reflects strong export demand.

<p><b>In Canada</b>, the first survey of investment intentions for 1995 indicated
that <b>businesses and governments plan to increase capital expenditures in
1995</b> by 3.2 per cent, to an all-time high of $54.2 billion. Machinery and
equipment investment is anticipated to jump by 9 per cent, led by the pulp and
paper industry which is benefitting from higher prices and increased export
demand. In contrast, investment in the interest-sensitive housing sector will
suffer a decline in 1995 as housing starts are expected to remain weak.

<p><b>Canadian consumers ended 1994 on a positive note</b>, increasing their
expenditures on retail goods by 0.7 per cent in December. For 1994 as a whole,
retail sales advanced by 6.9 per cent. Sales by motor vehicle and recreational
dealers rose by 14.3 per cent in 1994, spurred by increased consumer demand and
higher vehicle prices. Continued price pressures at the producer level were
evident in January 1995 as export demand remained strong and the Canadian
currency weakened further against the U.S. dollar. The <b>Canadian industrial
product price index (IPPI) rose by 1.7 per cent in January</b>, and the
year-over-year increase accelerated to 9.4 per cent, the highest increase since
late 1980. Higher prices for export goods such as motor vehicles, forestry
products and primary metals contributed to the large increase in the total IPPI.

Industrial Product Price Index]"></center></p>

<h3>Short-Term Interest Rates:</h3> <p>Bolstered by a stronger Canadian dollar
and speculation that the U.S. Federal Reserve is reaching the end of its
policy-tightening cycle, Canadian short-term interest rates fell sharply during
the week to Thursday. The rally limited the rise in the Bank Rate to 31 basis
points -- to 8.38 per cent -- much less than expected following last week's
decision by Moody's Investors Service to put Government of Canada debt under
review. Canadian chartered banks increased their prime lending rates by
one-quarter of a percentage point to 9.50 per cent at mid-week. In addition,
several financial institutions boosted short-term mortgage rates, while dropping
rates on longer-term mortgages, reflecting the divergence in the behaviour of
treasury bill and bond yields in recent weeks. Despite a sharply weaker U.S.
dollar, U.S. short-term yields remained relatively stable during the week to
Thursday.

<h3>Bond Markets and Yield Curves:</h3> <p>Testimony by the chairman of the U.S.
Federal Reserve Board to Congress on Wednesday, suggesting that U.S. economic
growth was slowing, helped to rally North American bond markets during the week
to Thursday. Supporting the Canadian bond market rally was increased optimism
over Canada's federal government budget to be released on Monday. The slope of
the Canadian yield curve steepened, while shifting downward, with yield declines
most pronounced among the 1-5 year maturities. U.S. bonds also rallied during the
week to Thursday despite some downward pressure from the 2- and 5-year U.S.
Treasury auctions. Like its Canadian counterpart, the U.S. yield curve shifted
downward, albeit less dramatically. As a result, Canada-U.S. interest rate
spreads narrowed along the curve. On Friday, both bond markets weakened slightly
following stronger-than-expected data on U.S. durable goods orders.

<h3>Canadian Dollar:</h3> <p>In spite of a sharply weaker U.S. dollar vis-a-vis
overseas currencies, the Canadian currency soared during the week to Thursday. On
Friday morning, the Canadian dollar opened at 71.81 US cents, up by 1.03 US cents
from last Friday's open. The Canadian currency staged the largest gain of the
week-long rally on Wednesday following U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Greenspan's
testimony which raised the possibility of no further increases in U.S. short-term
interest rates. On Thursday, the Bank of Canada attempted to moderate the rally
by selling Canadian dollars on the foreign exchange market. The Canadian currency
was further supported throughout the week by heightened expectations of a tough federal
budget in light of announcements of balanced budgets in Alberta, Saskatchewan and
New Brunswick.

<h2>Weekly Digest of Economic and Financial Developments</h2>
<h3>Toronto, February 17, 1995</h3>

<p><b>Favourable Canadian and U.S. economic indicators this week were overshadowed by turmoil in global foreign exchange markets.</b> A debt default by a major Mexican conglomerate, combined with investor concern about the status of the international loan package for Mexico, exerted downward pressure on North American currencies as investors fled to the safe haven of the German mark. An announcement by Moody's Investor Services, that the Government of Canada's debt ratings for both Canadian dollar and foreign currency debt were under review with a negative bias, sent the Canadian dollar tumbling to 70.75 US cents on Thursday. In Friday morning trading, however, the Canadian currency recovered to above the 71 US cent level, helped by a rise in Canadian short-term interest rates.</p>

<p><b>Major economic releases in the United States this week indicate that the Federal Reserve's policy of monetary restraint, intended to slow the rate of expansion in the U.S. economy and contain inflationary pressures, may be taking hold.</b> U.S. retail sales in January rose by a weaker than expected 0.2 per cent, although sales for December were revised upward from an initial decline of 0.1 per cent to an increase of 0.2 per from November. Weakness was most evident in sales of interest sensitive goods, such as automobiles and other durables. Higher interest rates also appeared to affect housing starts, which fell by 9.8 per cent in January to an annual rate of 1.38 million units. The decline in housing starts was concentrated in single family units. Building permits also fell sharply in January. The pace of industrial output (all industries) moderated in January, creasing by 0.4 per cent following gains of over 0.8 per cent in the previous two months. Manufacturing output rose by only 0.3 per cent in the month. Nonetheless, the rate of capacity utilization in manufacturing moved up to 85.1 per cent, just below the previous cyclical peak. The deficit on U.S. merchandise trade narrowed to US$7.3 billion in December, from US$10.0 billion in November. An increase of 4.1 per cent in exports combined with a decline of 1.1 per cent in imports accounted for the improvement in the deficit.</p> 

<p><b>There were some signs that inflationary pressures at the producer level are beginning to appear at the consumer level.</b> The U.S. consumer price index (CPI) rose by 0.3 per cent in January, the biggest increase in several months. The CPI excluding the volatile food and energy components rose by 0.4 per cent, its largest monthly increase in over a year. Surveys of business activity in February in several Federal Reserve districts indicate that price pressures remain at the producer level.</p>

<p><b>Recent economic data indicate that the Canadian economy continued to expand at a good pace in the final quarter of 1994 and that labour costs remained subdued.</b> Canada's manufacturing sector ended 1994 with a show of strength. The value of manufacturers' shipments rose by 1.6 per cent in December, following a gain of 3.7 per cent in November. Unfilled orders in December were 2.4 per cent higher than in the previous month, as the value of new orders advanced by 4.4 per cent. Canada's merchandise trade surplus for December was C$2.1 billion, just marginally below the C$2.3 billion surplus in November. Export growth was led by automotive and forestry products, while the robust Canadian manufacturing sector contributed to strong gains in imports of new machinery and equipment, automotive products and industrial goods. Canada's merchandise trade surplus reached C$17.1 billion in 1994, substantially higher than the C$9.5 billion trade surplus in 1993, as exports surged by 21.0 per cent compared with a more moderate 17.7 per cent gain in imports. Annual wage increases negotiated in Canadian collective bargaining agreements in December averaged 0.4 per cent, following a modest 0.2 per cent in November. For all of 1994, wage increases from major collective bargaining agreements averaged a record low 0.3 per cent, following a 0.6 per cent gain in 1993.</p>

<h3>Short-Term Interest Rates:</h3>
<p>The negative tone in the Canadian money market at the end of last week dissipated early this week following the victory of the Canadian federalist Liberals in three federal by-elections in Quebec and the release of weaker than expected U.S. retail sales data. Yields on all shortterm maturities declined on Tuesday, and the Bank Rate was set at 8.07 per cent, up by 15 basis points from the previous week -- only half as much as previously anticipated. Renewed investor unease about Mexico's ability to resolve its financial crisis, combined with an announcement by Moody's Investors Services that the Government of Canada's debt rating was under review, soured sentiment in money markets late this week. The Bank of Canada increased its target rates for overnight financing by 50 basis points on Thursday in order to provide some support for the Canadian dollar. U.S. short term rates were little changed over the week.</p>

<h3>Bond Markets and Yield Curves:</h3>


<p>In the early part of the week, the Canadian bond market performed well, supported by a stable currency and indications that economic expansion continues at a moderate pace. Late in the week, the bond market reacted adversely to sharp downward pressure on the Canadian currency following the announced review of the Government of Canada's debt rating. The slope of the Canadian yield curve flattened substantially on Thursday as yields on short term maturities rose by 50-60 basis points while yields on long term maturities rose by a more modest 25-30 basis points. The U.S. bond market outperformed its Canadian counterpart, supported by economic data indicating that the Federal Reserve has been successful so far in containing inflationary pressures at the consumer level, and that the pace of economic expansion in the United States has begun to slow.</p>



<h3>Canadian Dollar:</h3>

The Canadian dollar opened at 70.78 US cents this Friday morning, down over one half of a US cent from last Friday's close of 71.33 US cents. The Canadian currency stabilized early in the week in the 71.2-71.5 US cent range, but came under downward pressure at mid-week as international investors fled North American currencies for the safety of the German mark on newed unease about the ability of Mexico to solve its financial problems. The threat of a downgrading of Canadian federal government debt put additional downward pressure on the Canadian dollar on Thursday. The Bank of Canada intervened in the money market to provide some support for the Canadian currency which fell to 70.75 US cents, down from a weekly high of 71.52 US cents during trading on Tuesday.</p>

<h2>Weekly Digest of Economic and Financial Developments</h2>
<h3>Toronto, February 10, 1995</h3>

<p>North American financial markets were relatively stable this week, as
investors awaited the first U.S. price data of 1995. The U.S. Treasury $40
billion quarterly refunding was received by the bond market with no major
problems, and President Clinton's budget, presented on Monday, was virtually
ignored. <b>The U.S. producer price index (PPI) for January indicated that the
price pressures evident for some time at the intermediate level have not yet been
passed though to finished goods.</b> The PPI for finished goods rose by 0.3 in
January, for a year-to-year increase of 1.6 per cent. When the volatile food and
energy components are excluded, producer prices rose by 0.2 per cent, or by 1.5
per cent from year-earlier levels. However, inflationary pressures continued to
build further up the production pipeline. Prices for intermediate and crude
materials in January were both 1.0 per cent above their December levels. When the
food and energy components are excluded, intermediate goods prices rose by 1.0
per cent in January and crude material prices by 3.0 per cent. <b>It appears that
competition is still limiting price increases for finished goods, but the
pressures building at the intermediate level will be at least partially passed
along in coming months.</b> This appeared to trouble the U.S. bond market today,
and pushed the yields on long-term bonds up slightly. Investors will be anxious
to see the U.S. consumer price index for January, to be released next
Wednesday.</p>

<p><b>In Canada, a significant increase in the number of persons entering the
labour force pushed the Canadian unemployment rate slightly higher in
January,</b> to 9.7 per cent from 9.6 per cent in December. An increase of 25,000
persons in part-time employment was moderated by a decline of 10,000 persons in
full- time employment. Employment gains in the trade sector and in the
transportation, communication and utilities industries were partially offset by
employment losses in the construction industry and in public administration.
Although employment gains in manufacturing slowed somewhat in January, this
sector has added 85,000 new jobs over the past five months. <b>The latest
employment data suggest that the Canadian economy is growing at a rate of about
3.5 per cent.</b> Prospects for employment growth in Canada in 1995 look good,
with the help wanted index for January almost 16 per cent above its year earlier
level.</p>

<p>Rising employment and moderate growth in labour income in the closing months
of 1994 encouraged Canadian consumers to begin to replace their aged motor
vehicles. The number of new vehicles purchased in December increased by 3.9 per
cent, partially offsetting the decline in November. The impact of higher interest
rates was tempered by sales incentive programs offered by automotive dealers. For
1994 as a whole, new motor vehicle sales were 5.6 per cent higher than in 1993,
but were still some 20 per cent below their peak in 1987.</p>

<p><b>Canadian housing starts rose by 11.2 per cent</b> to 142,400 units in
January from a very depressed December level. January's rebound may reflect the
warmer-than-normal weather in central Canada, rather than a true recovery in
residential construction activity. Mortgage rates need to fall further and stay
down, before there will be a sustained improvement in the housing market.</p>

Growth]"></center></p>


<h3>Short-Term Interest Rates</h3>

<p>Canadian short-term interest rates declined sharply in the early part of the
week, culminating in a 31 basis- point plunge in the Bank Rate, to 7.92 per cent,
on Tuesday. The rally, prompted by a stronger Canadian dollar and heavy demand
for interest-bearing instruments for RRSP investments, encouraged Canadian
chartered banks to drop their rates on residential mortgages by up to one-half of
a percentage point. U.S. short-term rates, after dropping last Friday following
the weaker-than-expected U.S. employment data, changed very little during the
rest of this week to Thursday. This contributed to some narrowing in Canada-U.S.
short-term interest rate spreads.</p>

Yield Curves]"></center></p>

<h3>Bond Markets and Yield Curves:</h3>

<p>Canadian bonds performed better than U.S. bonds, during the week to Thursday.
A rising Canadian dollar and heightened optimism over the coming federal budget
buoyed the Canadian bond market in the first half of the week. Large declines in
yields on short-term and mid-term maturities steepened the slope of the Canadian
yield curve as it shifted downward. The U.S. bond market, after last Friday's
powerful rally, digested the U.S. quarterly Treasury refunding without any
problems. The U.S. yield curve also shifted downward and flattened slightly
during the week to Thursday -- although a particularly strong performance by
mid-term bonds steepened the slope beyond the one-year maturity. On Friday
morning, the prices of both Canadian and U.S. bonds fell in response to U.S.
producer price data that showed that inflationary pressures continued to build at
the intermediate level.</p>

<h3>Canadian Dollar:</h3>

<p>The Canadian dollar opened this Friday morning at 71.31 US cents, up only 0.03
US cents from the same time last week. The Canadian currency strengthened early
in the week, reaching a high of 71.76 US cents on Tuesday, buoyed by a rising
U.S. dollar and comments by the federal Finance Minister that the budget would
contain far-reaching expenditure cuts. The Bank of Canada attempted to dampen the
rally by buying foreign exchange. In the latter part of the week, the Canadian
dollar pulled back slightly in tandem with the weaker bond market. Through most
of this Friday morning, the Canadian dollar remained relatively stable, following
the release of employment data for January which indicated continued moderate
economic growth in Canada.</p>

<h2>Weekly Digest of
Economic and Financial Developments</h2>
<h3>Toronto, February 3, 1995</h3>
<p>
<b>Financial assistance for Mexico and the come of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday contributed to volatility in North American financial markets this week.</b> On Tuesday, markets reacted favourably to President Clinton's alternate plan for aid to Mexico, in which the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) play a large role. On Wednesday, following the FOMC meeting, the Federal Reserve announced a 50 basis point increase in both the discount rate and the fed funds target rate. Major money center banks increased their prime lending rates by 50 basis points, to 9.00 per cent. The question for investors now is whether another increase in interest rates will be required to slow the robust U.S. economy or whether signs of slower growth are already evident.</p>

<p>At first glance, the U.S. employment data for January looks soft , a jump in the unemployment rate to 5.7 per cent from 5.4 per cent in the previous month, an increase in non farm payrolls of only 134,000 and a downward revision to the December gain in payrolls.<b>However, on a 3 month moving average basis, payroll gains continue to hover around 300,000</b> (the monthly for 1994 was 290,000). In addition, the length of the average workweek in manufacturing remained at a 42.2 hours, and average overtime climbed to a new high of 4.9 hours. Even at 5.7 per cent, the rate of unemployment is still below the estimated non inflationary rate.</p>

<p><b>Other data suggest that the U.S. expansion is still strong.</b> The composite index of leading indicators rose by 0.1 per cent in December, an indication that the economy will expand further in the coming months.Personal income rose by a larger than expected 0.8 per cent in December, and consumers continued to increase their expenditures at a steady pace. Moreover, the personal savings rate rose in the fourth quarter to 4.6 per cent, the highest since early 1993, suggesting that U.S. consumers still have some spending power in reserve. Although consumer confidence declined slightly in January, it was still higher than at any time since before the 1990-91 recession. One of the strongest indicators of continued economic expansion was the rise in the National Association of Purchasing Management (NAPM) index to a higher than expected 57.9 in January, an indication that the manufacturing sector continues to expand at a very rapid pace. The only signs of slower growth rate in the United States were the small declines in retail sales and new home sales in December, but both of these series are subject to large revisions.</p>

Compensation costs in the United States appear to have been contained in the closing months of 1994. The modest increase in the employment cost index, up 0.4 per cent from the third quarter and 3.0 per cent higher than a year earlier, reflected a slowing in wage and benefit gains in the final quarter of 1994. Major collective bargaining agreements reached in private industry in the final quarter of 1994 called for average annual increases of 2.5 per cent over the life of the contract, a smaller gain than specified in previous contracts for the same workers. Although compensation costs and inflation at the consumer level appear to be under control, <b>data on producer and consumer prices in the early months of 1995 will be carefully watched</b> for any indication that previous increases in prices of raw materials and intermediate goods are being passed through to the consumer level.</p>

<p>In Canada, real gross domestic product (GDP) at factor cost advanced by 0.4 per cent in November, indicating that <b>the Canadian economy grew at an annual rate of close to 3 per cent in the fourth quarter of 1994.</b> Manufacturing output rose sharply in November and additional employment gains in manufacturing in December indicate further gains in output in late 1994. However, the quarterly survey of manufacturers taken in January suggests that the rate of growth may moderate in the early months of 1995. Building permits rose in December, possibly boosted by milder than normal weather conditions.</p>

<b>SHORT TERM INTEREST RATES:</b>
<p>Announcement of President Clinton's Mexican aid package on Tuesday morning lifted the Canadian currency and propelled short term yields sharply downward. The Bank Rate, however, fell by only 15 basis points, to 8.23 per cent, as the Bank of Canada intervened to temper the fall. With uncertainty over Mexico dispelled, financial markets focused on the U.S. FOMC meeting. On Wednesday, the Fed announced a 50 basis point rise in both the federal funds and discount rates , 6.0 per cent and 5.25 per cent respectively, as expected. The rate increase had little effect on U.S. short term yields, but the Bank of Canada immediately increased the target range for Canadian overnight funds by one half of a percentage point. As a result, Canadian short term interest rates closed on Thursday above last Friday's levels.</p>

<b>BOND MARKETS AND YIELD CURVES:</b>
<p>The Canadian bond market strengthened during the week to Thursday, bolstered by a rising Canadian dollar and a temporary midweek rally in the U.S. bond market. Gains were partially eroded Wednesday upon the announcement of the Fed rate increase, as investors construed the accompanying press release by the Fed to indicate that inflation may still become a problem. Nonetheless, the advance in the bond market flattened the Canadian yield curve over the period, as shortterm yields rose. The U.S. yield curve also flattened, as yields on maturities of 2 years and more declined with little change to the short end of the curve. This Friday morning, both U.S. and Canadian bonds rallied on news of weaker than expected U.S. employment data for January.</p>

<b>CANADIAN DOLLAR:</b>
<p>Strong upward momentum during the week to Thursday pushed the Canadian currency back up to pre Mexican crisis levels. The Canadian dollar opened Friday morning at 71.28 US cents, its highest level for the week, and up 0.62 US cents from the same time last week. The surge was triggered by a North American currency rebound Tuesday following the announcement of the Mexico aid package. The Canadian dollar strengthened further on Wednesday, as the Bank of Canada promptly raised overnight interest rates in lockstep with the U.S. interest rate hike. Unlike the central bank's response to the November U.S. interest rate increase, this approach suggests that the Bank of Canada is now more wary about volatile foreign exchange markets. The Canadian dollar remained firm in the latter part of the week despite a narrowing of Canada, US interest rate spreads.</p>

Digest of Economic and Financial Developments</h2> <h3>Toronto, January 27,
1995</h3>

<p>With no major data releases until Friday morning, Reserve Chairman Greenspan's
testimony before several committees of Congress became the focus of North
American financial markets for much of this week. Mr. Greenspan reiterated the
Fed's view that rates of economic growth in the United States are unsustainable,
even though inflationary pressures at the consumer level are still subdued. He
emphasized that the Fed remains concerned about increased production costs and
their implications for future price increases at the consumer level. <b>Mr.
Greenspan's testimony added credence to the market view that the Federal Reserve
will tighten monetary policy further at the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)
meeting at the end of January.</b></p>

<p>On Friday morning, the preliminary report on real gross domestic product (GDP)
in the United States further increased the likelihood of action by the Federal
Reserve. Real GDP advanced at a 4.5 per cent annualized rate in the final quarter
of 1994, following a 4.0 per cent gain in the previous quarter. When the $68
billion in business inventories is excluded, growth in final demand was 3.7 per
cent in the fourth quarter, a smaller gain than the 4.3 per cent advance in the
third quarter of 1994. Real net exports of goods and services deteriorated
further in the final months of 1994, as growth in U.S. demand for imported
products continued to exceed demand for U.S. exports. Both consumer spending and
business investment continued to advance at a rapid clip in the fourth quarter,
apparently still unaffected by the rise in U.S. interest rates during the
year.</p>

<p>The implicit price deflator for gross domestic product advanced by a
smaller-than-expected 1.6 per cent in the final quarter of 1994. For the full
year, the implicit price deflator for GDP was just 2.1 per cent higher than its
1993 level.</p>

<p><b>The strength of the domestic economy, as revealed in the fourth-quarter GDP
estimate, combined with the December data on high levels of capacity utilization
and continued increases in new orders for durable goods, suggest that the Federal
Reserve will raise the fed funds rate, most probably by 50 basis points to 6.0
per cent next week.</b> A larger move seems unlikely, given the very modest rise
in the GDP price deflator.</p>

<p>Although the Canadian economy continues to benefit from the robust economic
performance of its major trading partner, <b>growth in Canadian consumer spending
appeared sluggish in the final months of 1994.</b> Seasonally adjusted retail
sales in November declined slightly from October levels, as continued weakness in
the housing sector resulted in lower sales of furniture and appliances. The
number of new motor vehicles sold in Canada also declined in November. Canadian
industrial product prices rose sharply again in December, led by large increases
in prices for paper and metal products. The industrial product price index in
December was 7.7 per cent above year-earlier levels, with prices of intermediate
goods up by 10.7 per cent while prices of finished goods rose by a much more
modest 3.3 per cent. <b>The recent gains in industrial product prices augur well
for Canadian corporate profits in the fourth quarter of 1994 and early 1995.</b>
They also suggest that some inflationary pressures are building at the producer
level, but given the very cautious Canadian consumer, it will be difficult to
pass higher production costs through to the retail level.</p>

<p>International foreign exchange markets were quieter this week than last as the
shock of the Kobe earthquake diminished and some progress appeared to be made in
mobilizing financial aid for Mexico through the International Monetary Fund. The
Mexican peso remains under downward pressure as the U.S. Congress continues to
debate the US$40 billion aid package proposed by President Clinton, but the major
currencies appear to have settled down. Early Friday afternoon, the U.S. dollar
was trading against the yen, the D-mark and sterling at levels little changed
from a week earlier.</p>

Growth]"></center></p>



<h3>Short-Term Interest Rates</h3>

<p>Recent market pessimism, which sent Canadian short-term yields climbing last
week, abated during the week to Thursday. Short-term interest rates were down by
about 30 basis points from last Friday's close, assisted by a stronger Canadian
dollar. Early in the week, the Bank of Canada intervened by selling treasury
bills, to slow the decline in short-term yields. The Bank Rate rose by 17 basis
points, to 8.38 per cent on Tuesday. The moderate rise in the Bank Rate, which
was much less than the 50 basis points anticipated last Friday, postponed any
increase in the chartered banks' prime lending rates. U.S. short-term interest
rates were stable over this relatively lacklustre week to Thursday as investors
remained on the sideline waiting for today's U.S. GDP results.</p>

<h3>Bond Markets and Yield Curves:</h3>

<p>Canadian bonds outperformed U.S. bonds during the week to Thursday. The
Canadian bond market, buoyed by a rallying Canadian currency, was further
propelled higher by a late-week surge in the U.S. bond market. Yields on Canada's
30-year and 10-year bonds were down 28 basis points over the period, slightly
less than their short-term counterparts. As a result, the Canadian yield curve
steepened slightly as it shifted downward. U.S. bonds, relatively stable through
Tuesday, strengthened in response to the Federal Reserve Chairman's Senate
testimony and successful 2- and 5-year bond auctions. U.S. Treasuries continued
their advance this Friday morning, moving up sharply on the favourable U.S. GDP
and inflation results. The U.S. yield curve shifted down and flattened over the
week to Thursday, as short-term rates rose and yields on mid-term bonds
declined.</p>

<h3>Canadian Dollar:</h3>

<p>The Canadian dollar opened this Friday morning at 70.66 US cents, up 0.46 US
cents from last Thursday's close. Amid improved market sentiment, the currency
recouped much of the loss sustained over the previous week. A Quebec opinion poll
showing that support for sovereignty appeared to be flat, coupled with increased
market comfort over projected spending cuts in the February federal budget,
fuelled the Canadian dollar's advance. The currency also benefitted from a
calming of the flight to the German mark, which had precipitated a decline in
North American currencies last week. Despite the narrower Canada-U.S. interest
rate spreads, the Canadian dollar remained relatively stable as the week
progressed, falling slightly from Wednesday's high of 70.85 US cents. However,
the Canadian dollar is likely to come under intermittent pressure until the
federal budget is brought down late next month.</p>

<H1>GLOBAL ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT</H1>

<H2>Growth overseas should accelerate moderately in 1996-97</H2>

The economic performance of the major overseas industrialized nations has been uneven in recent years.  After 

recovering in 1994, the economic expansion in these countries (Japan, Germany, France, the United Kingdom and Italy) 

moderated during 1995.  Factors which restrained growth included the effects of a sharp rise in long-term interest rates 

during 1994, a deterioration in overseas competitiveness due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar in 1995, and a general 

decline in business and consumer confidence.

<P>

In spite of sluggish growth in early 1996, economic conditions in the overseas industrialized countries are 

expected to improve in the second half of this year and throughout 1997.  The acceleration in economic activity will be 

supported by low interest rates and the now-stronger U.S. dollar.  The pace of expansion in Europe will also accelerate 

as non-farm business inventories, which accumulated as a result of unexpected weakness in the second half of 1995, 

are drawn down, thereby encouraging further production.  The concurrent  expansion amongst the G-7 countries, 

together with continued robust growth in many developing countries in Asia and Latin America, will stimulate the exports 

of the major industrialized economies over the medium term.   

<P>

<H2>Fiscal consolidation and structural problems remain in Europe</H2>

Despite the positive outlook, several longer-term challenges will have a restraining influence on growth.  In 

continental Europe, the time remaining for achievement of the Maastricht criteria for economic and monetary union is 

running short, increasing pressures for fiscal restraint.  However, implementing measures that will reduce the burden 

of the existing social security systems will prove politically and economically difficult, given the prevailing high 

unemployment rates and weak economic conditions.  In Germany, structural problems such as labour market rigidities 

may also continue to hamper competitiveness -- to the detriment of Germany's international trade performance.

<P>

<H2>The recovery in Japan is still fragile</H2>

Although the surge in economic activity in the first quarter of 1996 shows that a recovery is underway in Japan, 

sustained growth remains a fragile prospect.  The impetus for the recent economic rebound has come primarily from 

the implementation of the public-sector investment program of late 1995, whose impact is beginning to diminish.  As 

a result, growth in the latter part of this year may be restrained if private-sector spending and investment do not pick 

up the slack.  In addition, slower growth in exports coinciding with stronger import growth -- partly the result  of  shifting  

production off-shore to avoid relatively high domestic production costs -- will also reduce the expansion of gross 

domestic product (GDP) in Japan.  Lastly, the fallout from the banking crisis, which left Japan's financial system with 

bad loans estimated at about 8 per cent of GDP, is far from over.  Despite significant first steps, including the writing 

off of one-third of existing bad loans by the banks and the establishment of an emergency fund for bailing out the 

crippled housing loan companies, the problem has not been fully resolved.

<P>

The overseas industrialized economies are expected to benefit from a continuation of a low-inflation, 

low-interest-rate environment over the near term.  Although their prospects for economic growth have improved, the 

pace of economic expansion will remain weak by historical standards.

<P>

<BR><IMG SRC="graphics/glbfl02.gif"  ><BR>

<P>

<H2>The U.S. economy again operating at close to full capacity </H2>

Economic conditions are stronger in the United States than overseas.  Indeed, the U.S. economy has emerged 

from its 1995 slowdown with more vigour than anticipated just a few months ago.  In the first quarter of 1996, real GDP 

grew at an annualized rate of 2.2 per cent, but this deceptively mild rate of expansion masked a strong 3.3 per cent 

rate of growth in final demand and a decumulation of inventories.  Much of the inventory reduction was in the automotive 

sector, where the March strike at GM cut motor-vehicle production and left strong consumer demand to be satisfied 

out of inventories.  The post-strike rebound in auto production added significantly to economic growth in the second 

quarter.  

<P>

Employment growth confirms the strength in the U.S. economy.  During the second quarter of 1996, monthly 

increases in non-farm payrolls averaged 265,000 jobs compared with 200,000 in the first quarter and less than 160,000 

per month in the last three quarters of 1995.  The number of people employed has climbed back to more than 63 per 

cent of the adult population, the peak reached just as the 1995 slowdown began.  The rate of growth in industrial 

production has accelerated sharply since the beginning of the year, and the industrial capacity utilization rate, which 

fell throughout 1995, has begun to rise.  The economic data available by early July suggest that the rate of growth for 

the second quarter of 1996 was close to 4 per cent.  This means that by mid-year the U.S. economy was once again 

operating at very close to full capacity, when the risks of encountering inflationary pressures tend to increase. 

<P>

<P>

<H2>Concerns about inflationary pressures persist</H2>

Inflationary concerns have resurfaced in the U.S. bond market.  Bond yields began to climb early in 1996 in 

response to worries about rising commodity prices, especially for grains and oil.  Although these fears have begun to 

ease along with the prices of many industrial commodities, investors are still worried that the U.S.  economy might 

overheat.  As a result, the yield on 30-year government bonds climbed from just over 6.00 per cent in January to just 

over 7.00 per cent in June.  This rise in long-term interest rates should gradually exert a restraining effect on economic 

activity, so that by the latter part of 1996 the pace of U.S. economic growth should subside to a more sustainable rate 

of 2.0-2.3 per cent.  

<P>

The Federal Reserve, however, may be reluctant to wait for the economy to slow.  Although inflation has 

remained under control during the current economic expansion -- the rate of change in the consumer price index (CPI) 

has averaged just under 3 per cent over the last four years -- it has not decelerated.  On the contrary, during the six 

months ended in May 1996, the annualized rate of change in the CPI climbed to 3.8 per cent, the fastest in any 

six-month span since early 1991.  To the extent that this acceleration reflects the recent surge in world oil prices, it 

should dissipate quickly and not trouble the Fed.  However, the gradual acceleration in average hourly earnings since 

mid-1993 is likely to be of greater  concern.  The  U.S. unemployment rate, which has hovered very close to 5.6 per 

cent during the last 18 months, dipped to 5.3 per cent in June (significantly below most estimates of the non-inflationary 

unemployment rate) and the uptrend in employment compensation may signify increasing inflationary risks. 

<P>

<H2>U.S. monetary policy may tighten; growth will moderate later this year</H2>

With the economy already at close to full employment and showing strong forward momentum, the Fed may well 

tighten monetary policy a notch this summer to insure against overheating.  The upward drift in Treasury bill rates in 

June suggests that financial markets are already beginning to discount such a move by the Fed.  If strong economic 

data continue to be reported over the next several months, debt markets will remain anxious and volatile.  However, 

in 1997, the rate of economic growth should moderate sufficiently to permit a gradual easing in short-term interest rates 

back to their levels in early 1996, as well as a modest decline in long-term bond yields.

<H1>CANADIAN ECONOMIC OUTLOOK</H1>

<H2>Temporary weakness in exports in early 1996</H2>

The Canadian economy moved forward at a very modest pace once again in the first quarter of 1996.  Real gross 

domestic product (GDP) grew at a tepid annualized rate of 1.2 per cent, following a 0.9 per cent rise in the fourth quarter 

of 1995.  However, in sharp contrast to recent years, the first quarter was characterized by marked strength in domestic 

spending, while weakness in exports of goods and services detracted significantly from overall growth.  

<P>

The improved performance of the domestic economy was led by a pronounced rise in spending by consumers, 

whose confidence began to revive in early 1996 following a plunge in 1995.   Consumers benefitted from higher 

employment in the first quarter of 1996 and lower interest rates.  Residential construction activity rebounded, following 

six quarterly declines, and business investment in machinery and equipment continued to grow at a brisk pace.  

Non-farm inventories swelled in the first quarter, as U.S. demand for Canadian exports declined, primarily as a result 

of the automotive strike.  The drop in exports reduced the surplus in merchandise trade, and as a result, Canada's 

international current account deficit increased to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $7.8 billion in the first quarter from 

$1.3 billion in the fourth quarter.

<P>

<H2>The pace of expansion to accelerate</H2>

Canada's economic expansion is forecast to strengthen moderately during the second half of 1996 and continue 

into 1997.  Steady gains in consumer spending are expected as employment rises and short-term interest rates remain 

relatively low.  Consumer confidence and spending growth should also receive a modest boost from the Ontario 

government's plan to reduce the province's personal income tax rate from 58.0 per cent to 40.5 per cent over 3 years.  

About one-quarter of the total cut (or 4 percentage points of the total 17.5 percentage-point reduction) took effect on 

July 1, 1996.  A further 5-percentage-point drop will be implemented on January 1, 1997.  However, the high 

indebtedness of individuals (total household debt as a percentage of personal disposable income rose to a new high 

of 90.1 per cent in the first quarter of 1996), the relatively low rate of personal savings, and concerns about job security 

by public-sector workers suggest that consumers will continue to be cautious spenders during the 1996-98 period.

<P>

A gradual recovery in residential construction activity is expected over the forecast period, prompted by 

moderate growth in demand for new and existing homes combined with the large decline in inventories of new and 

unoccupied dwellings in the first five months of 1996.  Capital spending by businesses will contribute to gains in 

economic activity during the forecast period, but to a lesser degree than in 1994 and 1995.  The projected slowdown 

in capital spending growth reflects the weakness in corporate profits in late 1995 and early 1996 and the significant drop 

in the rate of industrial capacity utilization since early 1995.  At the same time, businesses are likely to slow the rate 

of inventory accumulation in 1996-97, following a substantial buildup over the last two years.  The more modest rise 

in inventories, combined with further fiscal restraint by all levels of government, will constrain overall growth in the 

Canadian economy to about 2 per cent per year over the forecast period.  

<P>

<BR><IMG SRC="graphics/canat03.gif"  ><BR>

<P>

<H2>Canada's international current account to move into surplus in 1997</H2>

Canadian merchandise exports, which rebounded in the second quarter of 1996 following the end of the strike 

at GM, are forecast to advance steadily during the remainder of the 1996-98 period.  Gains will depend primarily on 

the continued economic expansion in the United States, with some additional support in 1997-98 coming from slightly 

faster growth in several overseas economies.  With export growth expected to outpace import growth, Canada's 

merchandise trade surplus should rise steadily over the forecast period.

<P>

Reduced borrowing requirements on the part of Canadian governments, in combination with lower Canadian 

interest rates, are expected to stabilize international debt-service payments over the 1996-98 period following several 

years of sharp increases.  With stable debt-service payments and a rising merchandise trade surplus, Canada's 

international current account is expected to move into surplus in 1997 for the first time since 1982.

<P>

<BR><IMG SRC="graphics/canpa04.gif"  ><BR>

<P>

<H2>Inflationary pressures virtually non-existent</H2>

The Canadian core rate of inflation (measured by the CPI excluding food, energy and indirect taxes) moved into 

the lower half of the Bank of Canada's 1-3 per cent target range in early 1996.  Given the considerable excess capacity 

and the high level of unemployment that still exist in the Canadian economy, gains in negotiated wage settlements 

during the 1996-98 period are expected to remain moderate.  In addition, the inflationary impact of the sharp 

depreciation of the Canadian dollar in 1993 and 1994 has largely dissipated.  These factors should help to keep inflation 

below 2 per cent during the forecast period and support the Bank of Canada's efforts to maintain easy monetary 

conditions.

<P>

<H2>Higher investor confidence and lower Canadian interest rates</H2>

Fuelled by an apparent surge in international investor confidence in Canada, spreads between Canadian and 

U.S. interest rates narrowed dramatically during the first half of 1996.  By June, the Canada-U.S. spread on 3-month 

T-bill rates had plunged to a negative 51 basis points, on average, from a positive 48 basis points in December 1995.  

The spread on 30-year bond yields had shrunk to 111 basis points in June from 165 basis points last December.  At 

the same time, the Canadian dollar remained relatively stable, averaging a little over 73 US cents. 

<P>

Facilitating the narrowing of interest-rate spreads in recent months has been Canada's superior inflation 

performance, both in absolute terms and relative to the United States (the Canadian inflation rate has been lower than 

that of the United States since 1992).  The reduction of federal and provincial government budget deficits and the 

significant improvement in Canada's international current account balance have also contributed to the increased 

attractiveness of Canadian assets.  These improved investment fundamentals are expected to remain intact over the 

forecast period, preserving the negative Canada-U.S. short-term interest-rate spreads and permitting some further 

narrowing of longer-term spreads. 

<P>

<BR><IMG SRC="graphics/canat02.gif"  ><BR>

<P>

<H2>Canadian financial markets still vulnerable</H2>

Nonetheless, with a significant proportion of Canadian debt held by foreign investors, Canadian financial 

markets remain highly vulnerable to shocks.  Concerns about the Canadian constitutional issue, while in abeyance at 

the moment, have the potential to resurface at any time.  Renewed constitutional uncertainty could abruptly damage 

international investor confidence in Canada, putting downward pressure on the Canadian dollar and causing Canadian 

interest rates to rise again relative to U.S. rates.

<H1>INDUSTRIAL OUTLOOK</H1>
The pace of economic expansion in Canada, which accelerated moderately in the first quarter, is expected to 
pick up over the remainder of 1996.  The first-quarter performance, which was fuelled in part by a strengthening of 
consumer spending, took place in spite of strike-related shutdowns in the manufacturing and public sectors.  Over the 
remainder of this year and into 1997, the manufacturing and mining industries will enjoy increased demand from the 
still-healthy U.S. economy.  Conditions will also improve in consumer-oriented industries, spurred by low interest rates 
and the moderate job growth recorded thus far in 1996.  For the year as a whole, real gross domestic product (GDP) 
at factor cost is forecast to increase by 1.6 per cent.  Real GDP is expected to expand by 2.4 per cent in 1997, and 
by 1.9 per cent in 1998.  
<P>
<H2>Operating profits fall again </H2>
Operating profits of Canadian corporations fell in the first quarter of 1996, to $21.6 billion, led by a decline in 
profits in most manufacturing industries.  Operating profits, which plummeted during the recession, rose steadily 
throughout 1993 and 1994, but have been falling since mid-1995 in tandem with a slowdown in economic growth in 
Canada.  In the first quarter of this year, falling pulp prices contributed to the sharp drop in forestry-sector operating 
profits, while the consumer goods industries also saw their profits cut substantially.  Among the industries reporting 
higher profits were the oil and gas sector, which benefitted from improved demand and higher oil prices in the first 
quarter of 1996, as well as the electrical machinery and the finance and insurance industries. 
<P>
<BR><IMG SRC="graphics/indat05.gif"  ><BR>
<P>
<BR><IMG SRC="graphics/indat04.gif"  ><BR>
<P>
<H2>Export demand to boost manufacturing, mining activity</H2>
Activity in Canada's <B>manufacturing sector</B>, which stagnated during the latter part of 1995, rose modestly in the 
first quarter of 1996.  The near-term outlook for Canadian manufacturers remains bright, as the U.S. economic 
expansion continues.  In response to healthy U.S. light vehicle sales, Canadian auto and auto parts producers are 
expected to increase production over the rest of 1996 (please see<B> Automotive Highlights</B>).  The continued strength 
in North American light vehicle markets will also benefit manufacturing industries such as metals, rubber, and plastic 
products -- for whom the auto and auto parts manufacturers represent a major source of demand.  Further healthy 
growth in business investment, both in the United States and in Canada, will support the continued rapid expansion 
in Canada's machinery and equipment industry.  Pulp and newsprint manufacturers have curtailed production so far 
this year in response to high inventories and weakening prices (please see<B> Commodity Price Highlights</B>).  Pulp prices 
fell sharply over the first four months of 1996, but have recovered slightly since then.  
<P>
Canada's <B>mining industry</B> is expected to expand at a moderate pace over the forecast period.  Oil and natural 
gas production continues to rise, propelled in part by brisk demand from the United States.  Crude oil prices, which rose 
sharply over the first four months of 1996, when colder-than-anticipated weather boosted demand for heating oil, 
retreated in May and June.  Although the cold winter weather pushed up natural gas prices on the New York Mercantile 
Exchange, the lack of pipeline export capacity from Alberta has kept western Canadian natural gas prices low in the 
first half of 1996.  Oil and gas drilling activity, which was surprisingly strong in the first quarter, is expected to slow over 
the remainder of this year and into 1997.  Following sharp increases in 1995, prices for Canada's major base metals 
weakened in the first half of this year.  Copper and aluminum prices in particular have dropped sharply, a trend that has 
accelerated in the wake of the Sumitomo copper-trading scandal of early June.  Nonetheless, the outlook for Canadian 
metal mining is quite positive, as global demand for metals and non-metallic minerals is expected to remain healthy 
over the forecast period.  
<P>
<BR><IMG SRC="graphics/indat03.gif"  ><BR>
<P>
<H2>Housing market strengthening</H2>
Activity in the <B>construction sector</B> is expected to fall again in 1996, before rebounding over the 1997-98 period.  
Spurred by lower interest rates, housing starts averaged about 118,000 units (seasonally adjusted at annual rates) over 
the first six months of 1996, which represents a modest improvement from the low levels recorded in the second half 
of 1995.  Housing starts are forecast to average 120,000 units this year, and to rise further in 1997 and 1998.  
Non-residential building construction activity will recover only modestly over the forecast period, as governments cut 
their capital budgets and office vacancy rates remain relatively high in most major cities.  Engineering construction 
activity will decline in 1996, as spending on oil and gas pipeline construction slows, and work on the Hibernia offshore 
oil project is completed.   
<P>
The outlook remains favourable for some of the remaining goods-producing industries this year.  In the 
<B>agriculture sector</B>, cool and damp weather delayed the spring crop planting in most of western Canada and Ontario.  
Prices for a number of major crops, particularly wheat and corn, have risen dramatically over the past year, partly in 
response to low global carryover stocks.  As a result, Canadian farmers have sharply increased the acreage devoted 
to wheat and other cereals this year.  Stock problems continue to plague Canada's <B>fishery</B>, which is expected to contract 
again this year.  Although the worst appears to be over for the east coast fishery, the west coast salmon fishery faces 
sharp reductions in its catch over the near term.  
<P>
<H2>Government spending cuts curtail service-sector growth</H2>
Canada's <B>service sector</B> is expected to expand at a moderate pace of about 2 per cent per year over the 
1996-98 period, constrained by further shrinking in the government services sector.  The communications industry will 
continue to post the fastest growth in the service sector over the forecast period.  The finance, insurance and real estate 
industries will record above- average growth this year, fuelled by surging activity in the resale housing market.  Activity 
in the transportation and wholesale trade industries will pick up over the remainder of 1996, as the manufacturing sector 
strengthens.  The community, business and personal (CBP) services industries will expand modestly this year, primarily 
as a result of continued growth in business services.  Over the forecast period, the other major components of the CBP 
industries -- health and educational services -- will face further public sector spending cuts.

<H1>PROVINCIAL OUTLOOK</H1>

The economic performances of most provinces weakened in 1995, with the most marked slowdowns occurring 

in British Columbia, Alberta and Saskatchewan.  Newfoundland was the only province whose economy contracted last 

year.  For the first time in this decade, Ontario moved into the top growth spot in 1995, as the manufacturing sector 

continued to expand at a healthy pace.  In 1996, economic growth in Canada will continue to be driven by exports and 

business investment, with some strengthening expected in consumer spending.   Ontario's economy will outperform 

the other provincial economies for the second year in a row this year, and Manitoba will be the only other province to 

post above-average growth.  The economies of Alberta and British Columbia will expand at close to the national pace 

this year.  In 1997, Ontario and British Columbia will lead the nation in economic performance<B>. </B>

<P>

<H2>Job growth remained modest in early 1996</H2>

Following a significant rebound in early 1996, employment declined in both May and June.  Total job gains in 

the first six months of 1996 amounted to 52,000, roughly half of the total job gains recorded over all of 1995.  British 

Columbia and Alberta, which together accounted for one-third of the jobs created nationwide in 1995, generated most 

of the new jobs in the first six months of this year.  In Ontario, where employment growth stalled last year, the 20,000 

new jobs generated so far in 1996 have surpassed the 1995 total.  In Quebec, in contrast, employment declined in the 

first six months of 1996, offsetting about half of the net job gains recorded in 1995.  The number of jobs in the Atlantic 

region has fallen sharply in the first half of 1996, particularly in Newfoundland, where the workforce on the Hibernia 

project is shrinking.

<P>

<BR><IMG SRC="graphics/prvat08.gif"  ><BR>

<P>

<H2>Manufacturing propels Ontario economy</H2>

The <B>Ontario</B> economy will be spurred again by steady growth in the manufacturing sector in 1996.  The outlook 

for Ontario's motor vehicle manufacturers has brightened since the spring, as U.S. light vehicle sales have continued 

at a robust clip.  Ontario's shipments of electrical machinery, which have surged in recent years on the strength of rising 

business investment across North America, have increased again so far this year.  The current low interest-rate 

environment has rejuvenated Ontario's resale housing market, and sales volumes have risen dramatically from 

year-earlier levels in the first five months of 1996.  Housing starts are expected to rebound to 43,000 units in 1996, 

up from 35,818 units last year, but still well below their late 1980's peaks.  Government spending cuts will dampen 

economic growth in Ontario over the next few years, although consumers will benefit from a series of reductions in 

personal income tax rates.

<P>

<H2>Slow economic growth in Quebec in 1996</H2>

Weak performances by a number of key industries, combined with continued low business and consumer 

confidence, will slow the pace of economic growth in <B>Quebec</B> this year.  Production at Quebec's sole auto assembly 

plant in Ste-Therese will decline sharply in 1996, reflecting the full-year impact of last October's shift reduction.  In 

response to weak newsprint prices and high buyer inventories, Quebec's newsprint mills, which have cut production 

so far in 1996, may take further downtime later this year.  In the province's mining sector, conditions are mixed.  Over 

the first six months of this year, gold and iron ore prices have remained above their year-earlier levels, but aluminum 

prices have fallen substantially.  Although housing starts in Quebec are expected to rebound modestly this year, the 

housing market remains burdened by a combination of oversupply in the resale market and high apartment vacancy 

rates. 

<P>

<P>

<H2>Forestry sector weakens B.C.'s performance</H2>

Economic growth in <B>British Columbia</B>, which trailed the national average last year for the first time in this 

decade, will remain below the Canadian average in 1996.  So far this year, B.C.'s pulp and newsprint producers have 

responded to industry-wide oversupply by taking significant mill downtime.  Although lumber prices have rebounded 

from their lows of mid-1995, softwood lumber exporters now face a cap on their duty-free shipments to the United 

States.  Over the past two years, housing starts in British Columbia have declined from the record highs of the early 

1990's.  Although B.C.'s new housing market is expected to remain quite healthy over the next few years, housing starts 

will remain well below 30,000 units per year, partly as a result of slower migration into the province.

<P>

<H2>Manitoba to lead the prairies in 1996</H2>

The economic expansion in <B>Alberta</B>, which slowed considerably in 1995, will remain moderate this year.  Oil and 

gas drilling activity, which surged over the 1993-94 period, is expected to decline for the second year in a row this year.  

The oilpatch has enjoyed higher oil prices so far in 1996, and the value of Alberta's shipments of refined petroleum 

products has risen from year-earlier levels.  Economic activity in <B>Saskatchewan</B> is expected to increase at a 

below-average rate this year, in part as a result of reduced drilling for oil and gas.   Wheat prices have risen sharply 

over the past year, prompting Saskatchewan farmers to shift acreage to wheat.  In the province's mining sector, potash 

prices have declined slightly, while uranium prices have risen significantly during the first half of 1996.  <B>Manitoba</B> will 

post the second-fastest growth in the country this year, fuelled by a widespread expansion in the province's diverse 

manufacturing sector.  Steady growth in sales of agricultural equipment across North America will provide a further 

boost to the rapidly-growing machinery industry.  Although the price of nickel -- Manitoba's most important mineral 

-- has declined somewhat this year, it remains well above its 1993 and 1994 levels.

<P>

<H2>Construction projects wind down in Newfoundland, Prince Edward Island</H2>

The <B>Newfoundland</B> economy is expected to contract again this year, as the construction phase of the Hibernia 

project is completed.  Newfoundland's economic performance is expected to improve markedly by 1998, spurred by 

the start-up of production from the Hibernia oilfield.  Economic growth in <B>Prince Edward Island</B> will slow considerably 

this year, and the economy will contract slightly in 1997, when construction activity on the fixed-link bridge comes to 

an end.  P.E.I.'s economy will be bolstered  over the near term, however, by a steady expansion in the food-processing 

industry.  <B>New Brunswick</B> will record the best economic performance in the Atlantic region this year, in spite of 

production cutbacks in the important forestry sector.  The mining sector in New Brunswick has benefitted from relatively 

firm prices for its major minerals, zinc and potash, so far in 1996.  The <B>Nova Scotia</B> economy will post only modest 

growth again this year, partly as a result of declining production in the mining and forestry sectors.  By 1997, however, 

economic activity in Nova Scotia will be boosted by a major expansion of the pulp and paper manufacturing facilities 

in Port Hawkesbury.

Canada's provincial governments have made dramatic progress not only in eliminating deficits, but also in 

restoring financial markets' confidence in their ability and their willingness to balance budgets and reduce outstanding 

debt.  Two provinces -- Saskatchewan and Alberta -- led the way in balancing budgets in fiscal 1994-95.  Six provinces 

(all except Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia and British Columbia) moved into surplus territory in fiscal 1995-96.  Seven 

provinces -- all except Ontario, Quebec and Newfoundland -- have committed to balancing their budgets in the current 

fiscal year.  In sharp contrast to the early 1990's, when virtually every provincial government's credit rating was lowered 

by the major rating agencies, two provincial governments -- Saskatchewan and Alberta -- have had their credit ratings 

raised in 1996.

<P>

<H2>Caution the watchword in the 1996 budgets</H2>

The 1996 budget season provided cautious projections and the fewest surprises of any of the budget rounds 

so far in the 1990's.  With the exception of the Ontario government, which implemented the first stages of a dramatic 

personal income tax cut, most provincial governments introduced 1996 budgets with few major revenue measures.  

All governments were forced to adapt to significant cuts in federal transfers this year and next.  Most governments 

incorporated cautious projections of economic growth and interest rates.  Contingency reserves, which have been used 

by the federal and the Alberta governments in recent years, were added to the Ontario and the Newfoundland budget 

plans this year.  Most provinces have adopted, or plan to adopt, some form of balanced-budget and/or debt-reduction 

legislation, and all have made firm commitments to achieve their budget targets for the 1996-97 fiscal year.

<H2>Federal and provincial governments take action </H2>

Canadian federal and provincial governments have achieved dramatic reductions in their deficits in recent years.<B> 

</B> In the early 1990's, <B>federal and provincial deficits</B> widened sharply, so that the combined government deficit reached 

a peak of 10 per cent of Canadian GDP by fiscal 1992-93.  A number of provinces, including British Columbia and 

Saskatchewan, achieved some deficit reduction by raising tax rates in the early 1990's.  Alberta led the nation in 

implementing sharp expenditure cuts in fiscal 1993-94, a strategy that was also followed by a number of other provincial 

governments.  The federal government's deficit began to narrow in fiscal 1994-95.  By last year, the combined federal 

and provincial <B>deficit-to-GDP</B> ratio had fallen to about 6 per cent, the lowest ratio recorded since fiscal 1989-90. <B> </B>If 

the federal and provincial governments adhere to their current budget targets, the combined deficit-to-GDP ratio will 

decline to about 3 per cent by fiscal 1997-98. 

<P>

<H2>Government debt-to-GDP ratio poised to decline</H2>

The rapid escalation in Canadian <B>government debt</B> from about 75 per cent of Canadian GDP in fiscal 1989-90 

to about 106 per cent last year appears to be nearing an end.  The combined federal and provincial debt-to-GDP ratio 

is expected to stabilize this year, and then fall gradually starting in fiscal 1997-98.  Once budgets have been balanced, 

the next step towards debt reduction is to run substantial budget surpluses.  Alberta and Manitoba, which have adopted 

strict debt-reduction legislation, are leading the other provinces in committing to firm debt-reduction plans over the 

medium term.  The governments of Quebec and Ontario, which plan to balance their budgets by fiscal years 1999-2000 

and 2000-01 respectively, continue to lag behind other provinces in getting their debt burdens under control. 

<P>

Although Canadian governments have made vast progress in reducing the overall government deficit in Canada, 

the debt of Canadian governments remains very high, and a large proportion of government bonds -- about 40 per 

cent -- is held by foreign investors.  Canadian governments, and the Canadian economy in general, will remain 

vulnerable to financial market shocks until the debt burden, as well as the degree of foreign indebtedness, are reduced 

sharply.  In this unforgiving fiscal environment, it is vital that all provinces -- and particularly Ontario and Quebec -- 

budget cautiously, and meet or better their fiscal targets over the next few years.

<P>Distribution of assets that fall under your estate should be outlined in your Will.  This is the only way to ensure that they will be distributed according to your wishes.  There are two ways assets designated in your Will can be distributed: immediately or through testamentary trusts.

<H3>Immediate Distribution:</H3>

<P>Immediate distribution means that your Executor distributes all or part of your estate, outright, to the beneficiaries named in your Will.  If you have more than one beneficiary, you may wish to divide your estate into equal or unequal shares after considering the financial needs of your beneficiaries.  It will be the duty of your Executor to distribute these assets according to your wishes.  While this method of distribution allows you to maintain control over these assets in your lifetime, there may be tax implications involved upon disposal of the assets.

<P>Upon death, assets in your estate are considered legally disposed of, and this means any resulting capital gains tax may have to be paid on them.  Unless your estate has liquid assets available to pay this tax, you could be leaving your estate and beneficiaries with a tax burden.  Life insurance policies are often purchased to ensure sufficient liquidity in your estate for these taxes and other liabilities, such as an outstanding mortgage.

<P>It is important to know that assets distributed through your estate may require "probate".  Probate is a court process that:

<UL>
<LI>confirms your Will is valid; and
<LI>confirms the Will presented is the "Last Will & Testament".
</UL>

<P>Probate fees are payable to the court for validating your Will.  These fees are paid from the proceeds of your estate and vary by province.  In some provinces, they are based on a percentage of your estate value, while in other provinces they are flat fees, or a combination of both.

<H3>Testamentary Trusts:</H3>

<P><A HREF="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/lifepl/estate/testa.html">Testamentary trusts</A> are outlined in your Will and take effect upon your death. 

<P>Trust law is complex and there are a number of legal restrictions to consider.  We recommend that you consult an expert for help in planning, establishing and administering the trust.

<TITLE>Being an Executor
</TITLE>
</HEAD>

<BODY BGCOLOR="#ffffff">
<IMG ALIGN=bottom SRC="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/lifepl/gifs/beexec.gif">
<left><IMG ALIGN=top SRC="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/lifepl/gifs/BREAK.GIF"></left><br>
<a href="http://www.tdbank.ca/cgi-bin/imagemap/nav"><IMG SRC="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/lifepl/gifs/NAV.GIF" ISMAP></a>

<p>Being named the Executor of a Will may make you feel honoured. But
you should know that yours is a demanding, time-consuming, and
often complicated role. It involves dealing with all the legal,
fiduciary, and tax implications of a death, as well as coping
with the financial and emotional needs of beneficiaries.  

<p>In chronological order, here are some of the responsibilities of an Executor:
<ul>
<li>Find and read the Will, then organize a meeting of the family
of the deceased. If appropriate, include friends or business
associates. The meeting should review funeral arrangements, and
allow you to determine the whereabouts of share certificates,
insurance policies, safety deposit boxes, and so on.<p>
<li>Locate all the deceased's assets and ensure they are
protected and sufficiently insured. If the deceased was the owner
of a business and no one is available to assume the role, you
will have to hire a qualified manager on an interim basis.<p>
<li>Hire a lawyer to obtain probate if required. <p>
<li>Advertise for creditors, usually in a local newspaper. If you
do not, and a creditor turns up after all the money in the estate
has been paid out, you as Executor will be responsible for
settling the debt.<p>
<li>Register assets in your name, as Executor of the estate. You
will need to deal with financial institutions, brokers, transfer
agents, and land titles or land registry offices to have this
done, and may need to retain a lawyer to help you.<p>
<li>Prepare the deceased's final tax returns for Revenue Canada
(or Revenue Quebec for that province) and pay the tax due. You
should look for ways to minimize or defer tax, and you may find
you need an accountant's help.<p>
<li>Arrange for the payment of any debts, and funeral and
testamentary expenses, including probate costs.<p>
<li>Arrange for payment of legacies and the distribution of the
residue to beneficiaries.<p>
<li>If the situation calls for it, <A HREF="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/lifepl/estate/trust.html">create a trust</A>. This is a
legal arrangement that requires assets to be held by a trustee
(usually the same person as the Executor) for a specified period.
The income from the assets may be paid out or accumulated in the
trust, depending on the terms of the trust set out in the will, and 
when the trust ends the assets can be distributed to 
beneficiaries.<p>
<li>Administer the trust's assets - a function that may last several years.
</ul>

<p>In addition to these steps, you must maintain regular
communication with the beneficiaries, keep records, file tax
returns for the estate, and prepare statements for review and
approval by beneficiaries.

<p>Being the Executor of an estate is a big responsibility.  Depending on the size and complexity of the estate, an Executor may wish to exercise the option of assigning a trust company to act as his/her agent.  Acting as an <A HREF="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/lifepl/estate/agent.html">Agent for an Executor</A>, a trust company's expertise can be used to facilitate the process and avoid the pitfalls that might diminish the assets of your estate.

<H2>Eyewear By Emery </H2>

<HR>

<H3><A NAME="q1">Background</A></H3>

<P>Emery Krick has been in the eyewear business for 21 years, and he attributes
Eyewear by Emery's success to exceptional customer service.

<P>The eyewear business is highly competitive; you can find an eyewear store
almost as easily as you can find a convenience store. Fortunately, Krick has
built a strong base of loyal customers.  And most new customers are referred by
other customers who've been pleased with the service they've received.

<P>Krick recognizes the importance of his loyal customers, and he keeps them
happy by continually surprising them with service above and beyond what they
expect.  This attention to friendly service is what differentiates him from his
competitors.

<HR>

<H3><A NAME="q2">Issues:</A></H3> 

<P>Krick was happy to offer the convenience of credit card transactions to his
customers.  He was also noticing that debit card transactions were growing in
popularity and wondered if some of his customers who preferred to pay cash but
were uncomfortable carrying a lot of money around might appreciate being offered
a direct payment option in his store.

<P>While Eyewear by Emery is located in an enclosed mall environment where
automated banking terminals could be fairly easily accessed, Krick determined
that the added convenience of offering debit card transactions just might be the
"extra little bit" of customer service that he was regularly looking for.

<HR>

<H3><A NAME="q3">Solution:</A></H3>

<P>Krick decided to pursue the idea and installed a combined <A HREF="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/merchvisa/services/greenpay.html">credit/Direct
Payment terminal</A>.  His customers could now pay
in whatever manner they wished without wasting a moment of their time.  If they
wanted to pay by cash, but didn't have the cash on hand, they would simply use
their bank card and pay for their purchase directly from their accounts.


<HR>

<H3><A NAME="q4">Results:</A></H3>

<P>The system is extremely easy to use, says Krick.  And customers who previously
paid by cash find it much more convenient to simply pull out their debit cards. 
To Eyewear by Emery's customers, it's another demonstration of Krick's attention
to their needs... and another reason to keep coming back.

<H2>The Uptown Senator</H2>
<P>
<UL>
	<LI><A HREF="#q1">Background</A>
	<LI><A HREF="#q2">Issues</A>
	<LI><A HREF="#q3">Solution</A>
	<LI><A HREF="#q4">Results</A>
</UL>

<HR>

<H3><A NAME="q1">Background</A></H3>


<P>Toelmac Enterprises operates five popular Toronto night spots, including the
Uptown Senator.  This restaurant is very busy, and the more staff that can be
freed from administrative duties to concentrate on exemplary customer service,
the better.  Employee satisfaction is also considered a key element to the
restaurant's success; the happier the employees, the happier the customers.

<P>Toelmac itself has hundreds of employees, sales in the tens of millions, and
is rapidly expanding.  In the restaurant and nightclub business, keeping costs
low is the key to success, and they're constantly looking for ways to make their
financial transactions more efficient and effective.
<HR>

<H3><A NAME="q2">Issues:</A></H3> 

<P>The restaurant had always offered VISA payments using traditional processing
methods, and they were definitely interested in the benefits of automatic draft
capture and authorization.

<P>But they faced on ongoing situation unique to restaurants.  When a customer
pays by credit card in a restaurant, she hands the server the card and waits for
the bill.  At this point the server or cash person dials in to authorize the
amount on the bill.  Then the server returns the card and draft slip to the
customer for signing.

<P>If the customer now adds a tip to the total, the authorization is no longer
accurate, and the transaction should be reauthorized.  Of course, this is a
hassle, and busy employees rarely have the time to double authorize, so they
ignore this important step.

<HR>

<H3><A NAME="q3">Solution:</A></H3>

<P>The Uptown Senator discovered the Bank was developing a special terminal
<A HREF="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/merchvisa/services/customized.html">expressly for restaurants</A>, and they were even more interested.

<P>This system offers the benefits of the basic draft capture terminals: 
<P><UL>
<LI>Instant authorization 
<LI>Better cash flow as the money is transferred to
their account much 	more quickly 
<LI>Easier accounting <LI>Less time spent by
the server on a transaction. </UL>

<P>But unlike ordinary draft capture terminals, this terminal authorizes an
additional tip amount to allow for potential tips.

<P>Although the system was still in the development stage, the Uptown Senator was
eager to try it out, and installed an early version of the programme in one of
its locations for a trial run.  With valuable input from the management and staff
of the restaurant, TD's product development department finetuned the programme
operation and the restaurant in-turn implemented the finalized system.
<HR>

<H3><A NAME="q4">Results:</A></H3>

<P>The Uptown Senator is extremely happy with the convenience, speed and
efficiency of the system.  They've seen cash flow improve and accounting time
drop.

<P>Staff appreciate the ease and speed of each transaction, and find they're
spending less time waiting for drafts while food sits under the heat lamps.  They
also say it's nice to know their tip portion of the payment has already been
approved.

<P>The restaurant finds the system highly practical, particularly since it
incorporates features developed to their actual needs, as tested in weeks of
operation.

Market Update
</H2>

<P>The third quarter of 1996 was rewarding for the Fund, as real rates fell throughout the quarter. The Fund returned a healthy 5.04% for the quarter following a 3.46% return the previous quarter.<P>Real rates fell to 4.48% from 4.79% at the start of the quarter. This was the result of an improving fiscal position which drove nominal and real rates down. In addition, the U.S. government announced plans to issue its own real return bonds. This spotlighted Canada's unusually high real rates, bringing in demand from around the globe.<P>The reduction of global interest rates in the past year has stimulated economic growth. Global economies are experiencing the benefit of stable, low interest rates. We feel that North American economies have troughed and economic recovery in the balance of 1996 and through 1997 will be positive for both Canada and the United States. Canada's fiscal position is improving at a tremendous pace. We strongly encourage investors to pay close attention to this as it will bring tremendous benefits for Canadians. One benefit for fixed income investors will be a narrowing of spreads between Canada and U.S. rates. Good economic fundamentals led by low inflation continue to bode well for investors.<P>The Fund is fully invested in real return bonds. Investors with long-term time horizons who are worried about inflation eroding their capital should feel comfortable with the Fund.<P>

<P><B><A NAME="8">Est-il possible d'obtenir des cours obligataires par le biais de

MicroMax et de T&eacute;l&eacute;Max?</b></A>



<p>Saviez-vous que MicroMax et T&eacute;l&eacute;Max fournissent des renseignements sur

le march&eacute; obligataire? Trois cotes de r&eacute;f&eacute;rence sont offertes. Chacune

repr&eacute;sente une obligation particuli&egrave;re du gouvernement du Canada :

l'&eacute;ch&eacute;ance &agrave; court terme est l'obligation &eacute;ch&eacute;ant en

octobre 2001, avec un coupon de 9,5%, et dont le symbole est <b>OBA;</b>

l'&eacute;ch&eacute;ance &agrave; moyen terme est mars 2011, avec un coupon de 9,0 %, et son

symbole est <b>OBK;</b> et l'&eacute;ch&eacute;ance &agrave; long terme est juin 2021, avec

un coupon de 9,75 %, et son symbole est <b>OBV</b>.<br>



<p>Dans MicroMax, vous n'avez qu'&agrave; acc&eacute;der &agrave; l'&eacute;cran du cours

des actions ou des cours d&eacute;taill&eacute;s, puis tapez " <b>. M</b> " et le symbole "

<b>.MOBA</b> ". Par T&eacute;l&eacute;Max, choisissez l'option 1 pour les cours, puis

l'option 5 pour les cours rapides et appuyez sur l'&eacute;quivalent num&eacute;rique de "

<b>M</b> ", suivi du symbole " <b>MOBA</b> ", qui deviendrait 61 63 22 21 sur le clavier du

t&eacute;l&eacute;phone.<br><br>



<P><B><A NAME="9">Comment puis-je voir sur l'Internet une d&eacute;monstration de

MicroMax?</b></A>



<p>Recherchez le fichier MicroMax.exe sur le disque dur.  Vous le trouverez dans le



sous-r&eacute;pertoire appel&eacute; " Download ". &Agrave; l'invite, tapez  " MicroMax "



pour d&eacute;compacter les fichiers de d&eacute;monstration et extraire les fichiers de



commande.



Lorsque l'invite appara&icirc;tra de nouveau, tapez " FDemo " pour lancer la version



fran&ccedil;aise ou " Demo " pour essayer MicroMax en anglais.<br><br>







<P><B><A NAME="10">Quelle est la taille du programme de d&eacute;monstration



MicroMax?</b></A>



<p>Tous les fichiers occupent moins de 1,44 Mo et peuvent &ecirc;tre sauvegard&eacute;s sur



une disquette &agrave; haute densit&eacute;.<br><br>







<P><B><A NAME="11">&Agrave; quel moment le programme de d&eacute;monstration



de MicroMax pour Macintosh sera-t-il offert?</b></A>



<p>&Agrave; l'heure actuelle, le programme de d&eacute;monstration MicroMax n'est offert



qu'en version pour IBM et compatibles. Or, si vous poss&eacute;dez un Macintosh, nous vous



proposons la trousse MicroMax pour la modique somme de 19,95 $, sans frais



suppl&eacute;mentaires si vous ne faites pas le branchement. Alors, commandez-l&agrave;



d&egrave;s aujourd'hui et parcourez le guide de l'utilisateur pour en d&eacute;couvrir toutes les



possibilit&eacute;s. Vous ne payez aucuns frais tant que vous n'&eacute;tablissez pas la

</UL>

<HR>

<H3><A NAME="q1">Background</A></H3>

<P>When Sophie Chapman and her partner opened the Unicorn Trading Company in 1969, they sold "hippie merchandise" such as patchouli oil and beads.  But times change and so did Unicorn.  Today, the shelves hold cut crystal and tailored clothing rather than tie-dye and sandals.  And Unicorn is one of Halifax's more successful high-end clothing/giftware stores.

<P>Recently, Chapman noticed a change in both her clientele and their spending habits.  She took steps to isolate the changes and determine how she could accommodate them to remain competitive.


<HR>

<H3><A NAME="q2">Issues:</A></H3> 

<P>Chapman has an extremely loyal group of local customers.  But Halifax is
growing in popularity as a tourist and convention destination, and out-of-town
customers now make up roughly half her clientele.  Their purchases average $1500 to $2000 each visit.

<P>Naturally, Chapman appreciates the out-of-town business, but this had combined
with another trend to cause a few headaches.  She noted that more and more
customers preferred to forgo their credit cards in favour of cash and cheque
payments.

<P>Taking out-of-town personal cheques is a big risk, considering the high
purchase prices and the time and money involved in tracking NSF cheques.  So
Unicorn does not accept them.

<P>This often killed a sale immediately, but if it didn't there was another
problem.

<P>If customers didn't have the cash on hand, they'd run out to get it from an
ATM.  And far too often, they wouldn't come back.  (There's no ATM nearby, and
Chapman suspects customers ended up at a mall, or ran out of time, or just didn't
want the bother of coming back.  And, as she points out, "It rains a lot in
Halifax.")

<HR>

<H3><A NAME="q3">Solution:</A></H3>

<P>Chapman hoped to make cash payments convenient, so she installed a <A HREF="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/merchvisa/services/posdirect.html">Direct
Payment terminal</A>.  This terminal allows customers to
make direct transfers from their bank accounts with ease.  The customer simply
presents a major banking machine card and punches their PIN number into a
hand-held PIN Pad.

<P>The Direct Payment terminal also allows her to keep her old-fashioned brass
cash register, which is an integral part of the store's decor and atmosphere.

<P>Employees found the system easy to use and they needed only a brief training
period to put it into action.  "If I can catch on," says Chapman, "anyone can."


<HR>

<H3><A NAME="q4">Results:</A></H3>

<P>Sales have increased and out of town customers are happier.  Unicorn is now
more customer-friendly, and their location off the beaten track is no longer an
obstacle.  Chapman says the direct payment solution has proven so popular, these
transactions are quickly catching up to credit card transactions.

<P>And Chapman has found the store's banking administration much easier, since
fewer cheque deposits need be made and tracking NSF cheques is no longer a
problem.

<H2>Question:</H2>
<P><I>Wed Dec  6 17:37:42 EST 1995<BR><A HREF="mailto:affy@calweb.com">affy@calweb.com</A> &lt;Arthur F. Freeman&gt;</I></P><H3>When starting a new business from an office building, what would be the best way to attract a couple investers to help fund the initial cost of equipement and opening few months of operation?</H3><H2>Answer, from Larry Easto:</H2><P>The best and probably only way is to prepare a very detailed business plan that demonstrates how profitable your business will be.  Use the TD Business Planner software that you can download from this site or stop by a branch of the TD and pick up a copy.  When you are in the branch, you might also pick up a copy of How To Succeed in Your Home Business and review chapter 11 and 12. </P>

Market Update
</H2>

<P>After a first half characterized by big gains, Latin American stock markets continued on a more moderate but steady recovery course in the third quarter of 1996. Market fundamentals continue to improve. Growth is picking up in both Mexico and Brazil, which suffered recessions following last year's crisis. Valuations continue to be moderate to low. Expectations remain moderate, and liquidity flows, while positive, are still tentative.<P>The Fund's largest position is in Brazil, which should continue to have moderate and consistent GDP growth for the next three years. Inflation forecasts for 1997 are between 8% and 9%, the lowest since the 1950s. More importantly, Brazil's unprecedented reform agenda should continue given the likelihood that Cardoso will continue as president for a second consecutive term after 1998. The Fund's second-largest position is in Mexico, where strong economic and political reform should lead to healthy growth in 1997. Solid industrial production and GDP growth during 1996 indicate that recovery in Mexico is underway.<P>We remain underweight in Argentina in light of poor GDP growth prospects for 1996 and 1997, a large fiscal deficit and the uncertain political situation. Economic and labour reform currently underway in Argentina will be the key to transforming the country into a competitive international market. Although this should be achieved over the long term, other markets offer more attractive opportunities in the near term.<P>Chile remains slightly underweight in the Fund. Despite strong GDP growth - we estimate 7.9% and 6.1% for 1996 and 1997 respectively - high interest rates continue to plague the markets and ward off investors. We expect interest rates to ease in early 1997. We remain neutral to slightly overweight in Colombia. The political climate has been the primary reason keeping foreign investors out of Colombia. As a result, the Colombian market has very attractive stock valuations. The Fund is well-positioned to take advantage of long-term gains in this market.<P>Finally, we believe the Fund's overweight position in Peru will be rewarded throughout the rest of 1996 and 1997. Rumours of mergers among Peruvian blue-chip companies and forecasts of strong growth for 1997 drove the Peruvian market up 14% in the third quarter. Contributing to the positive tone was the approval by the Peruvian Congress of President Fujimori's bid for an unprecedented third consecutive term in office.<P>The long-term case for Latin America remains intact. Free trade, economic stabilization and democratization strategies are in place virtually across the region. As market-based economic reforms continue, we expect opportunities for significant capital appreciation. We seek out well-managed companies that are producing attractive returns on their invested capital and reinvesting that money to generate future growth. We see the best value in companies with strong market share, pricing power and healthy cash flow.<P>

Market Update
</H2>

<P>The third quarter of 1996 was a disappointing one for Asian stock markets as sluggish trade figures gave investors cause for concern about future economic expansion in the region. We do not believe this to be a long-term slowdown in Asian economic or export growth, but a mid-cycle adjustment to rising wage costs and currency appreciation. These fears overshadowed good first half corporate results from Hong Kong, the Philippines and Malaysia.<P>The main pullback in Asian equity markets occurred in July after a sharp rise in U.S. bond yields led to fears of much slower world demand next year. Hong Kong stocks made good progress against a backdrop of regional economic worries and volatility in stock markets around the world. A higher exposure to property and bank stocks in Hong Kong added positively to performance, while our weighting in Korean stocks remained a significant negative contributor to performance. The Korean market fell 6.06% during the third quarter as local interest rates stayed high.<P>The Fund's low weighting in Thai stocks added to performance as the local SET index fell by 12.15%. The Fund's holdings in Malaysia performed well, compared with the overall performance of the market, which fell 0.78%. We have increased exposure to Taiwan as we anticipate a rebound in the earnings of key industrial stocks. In the near term, Asian stocks may be rangebound, barring a downturn in global equity markets. However, given the outlook for lower interest rates in Asia and moderately positive earnings growth, the markets could make progress early next year.<P>On the inflation front, price pressures continue to ease, notably in Hong Kong, China and Singapore. China cut its interest rates twice in the last nine months in response to lower inflation figures, prompting expectations that the Chinese economy could rebound next year, benefiting Hong Kong. On a more positive note, slower economic growth in Asia this year could allow central banks to ease interest rates next year. The main beneficiaries of this process include Korea, Taiwan and Thailand.

<h1>Bu$inessmatters Spring 1996</h1> <h2>News and Information for TD Bank's

Business Customers</h2>



<p>&quot;In this world nothing can be said to be certain, except death and

taxes.&quot; - Benjamin Franklin, 1706-1790



<br> <h2>You can succeed at succession</h2> 



<p></h4><EM>If Benjamin Franklin were a 20th century entrepreneur, a third certainty might

have found its place on his list - the unavoidable, and crucial, task of succession planning. In

family-owned businesses, a workable solution is critical. Yet many Canadian business owners

wait until they are forced to act - or until it's too late. Fortunately, entrepreneurs facing this

monumental challenge can take steps to make the best possible decisions for the future benefit of

their business and their loved ones.</EM></h4>



<p>It's an unfortunate fact. Many successful family-owned enterprises cease being successful -

or the family loses control - once the business passes into the hands of the second or third

generation. Why? &quot;In a nutshell,&quot; says Barry Tissenbaum, Managing Partner for

Ernst & Young's Entrepreneurial Services, &quot;because families don't plan for the day control

will pass to someone else.&quot; While Tissenbaum acknowledges that many factors affect a

business' success  or failure, &quot;family disagreements are right at the top of the list,&quot; he

says. 



<h3>The future starts now</h3>

According to Tissenbaum, the time to start planning for the future is now.  &quot;No matter

what stage you're at in your business or personal life,&quot; explains Tissenbaum,

&quot;communications are key.&quot; Regular board meetings are an ideal forum for bringing

family members into the equation. &quot;The better informed the next generation is, the more

realistic their expectations for the future will be,&quot; he says. Plus, every company should

have a strategic plan in place. &quot;In a family business, this plan should spell out where the

owner wants to be 5 or 10 years down the road, and specify when major changes will

happen.&quot;



<h3>When the time comes</h3>

Eventually, most founders want to retire or play a less active role in their company. &quot;This is

where things can get interesting,&quot; says Tissenbaum. &quot;Family members will seldom

share the same goals or interests. Trying  to please everyone can complicate matters for the

founder, and make it difficult to do what's best for the company.&quot; Although many issues

must be dealt with at this stage, &quot;some are highly personal, much more than straightforward

business decisions,&quot; says Tissenbaum. &quot;If a family can talk things out, and if

members demonstrate a real willingness to work with each  other, they're in a good position 

to succeed. This process can be guided by an objective facilitator.&quot;



<h3>From avoidance to awareness</h3>

Dr. Paul Druckman has been a practicing psychiatrist for 25 years. Six years ago, he established

Consultant Family Concerns Ltd. to provide counselling services to families that own private

firms and face the intensely personal issues involved in succession planning. 



<P>Dr. Druckman often works with professional firms like Ernst & Young to facilitate

communication. &QUOT;My job is to help make them aware of the issues, and to get around the

tendency to avoid potentially messy decisions,&QUOT; he explains. In many cases, it's difficult

to separate  personal and business issues. &QUOT;That's why it's extremely important for

family members to air their opinions and concerns,&QUOT; he says, &QUOT;no matter how

painful the process may be.  The outcome will be a clear understanding of what everyone

expects - and a realistic picture of what has to be resolved.&QUOT;



<h3>Making the  best decision</h3>

When everyone's expectations are  on the table,' the process of defining the future can begin.

&QUOT;At this point,&QUOT; says Tissenbaum, &QUOT;it's crucial to involve trusted legal 

and financial advisors. These people can provide information on things like shareholder

agreements, financing options and organizational structures.&QUOT;

 

<p>As Druckman points out, handing the business over to family members is only one option.

There are other possibilities, like recruiting professional managers or selling the business. 



<P>Because the founder's decision will affect both the business and the family for many years to

come, &QUOT;it's a difficult position for anyone,&QUOT; says Druckman. &QUOT;But the

question of succession just can't be avoided. An entrepreneur can spend 20 or 30 years building a

successful business only to see it torn apart by fractious family members. The best way to

preserve the value of the business - and family relationships - is to get all the issues out on the

table, and make the best decision possible.&QUOT;



<HR>

<h3>A matter of Trust</h3>

Most people who have spent their lives building up their business have had little time to gain

experience with investments or matters of financial planning. As well, many founders wish to

stay involved in their business, while minimizing their tax burden when they retire or die. 



<P>Techniques, such as an estate freeze, enable a corporate trustee to handle a founder's assets

and hold the interest they intend to pass on to their family, while allowing the founder to retain

control of the company. 



<p>TD Trust Company can act as investment manager and corporate trustee. For more details on

how we can help you succeed at succession, speak with your TD representative.

<b><font size=+2>Break free...</font size></b>of status quo banking with TD Bank<BR>  

<P><i>At TD Bank, we know that the less time our customers need to spend on day-to-day

banking, the more time they have to concentrate on making their business successful. That's why

we're trying to make banking as easy as possible for Small Business. &QUOT;We're looking at

new ways to deliver services to our customers,&QUOT; says Nancy d'Agincourt, Manager, Cash

customers to do business. It's our goal to break out of the traditional ways of delivering banking

services to help our customers do what they do best - grow their business.&QUOT;</i>

<p><b>Get a better return on bank balances:</b><br>

<p><i>For more information on how TD Bank can help you break free of status quo banking,

speak to your TD Account Manager.</i>



<h2>Now may be the time to insure your company against rising interest rates</h2>



<i>TD offers protection from interest rate risk for companies with borrowings exceeding

$100,000. </i>



<p>Interest rates are currently at historically low levels, though they continue to be volatile.

&quot;For this reason,&quot; says Rob Burgess, TD Vice President, Treasury, &quot;now is the

perfect time for businesses to examine their exposure to interest rate risk, and consider

purchasing protection.&quot;



<p><i>Today's low current rates make interest rate protection more affordable than ever.</i>



<p>Companies with floating rate loans face financial risk every time interest rates rise. Higher

loan interest costs directly reduce cash flow and profits. &quot;To help our clients reduce the risk

associated with rising interest rates,&quot; explains Burgess, &quot;we offer a range of interest

rate risk management options that were previously available only to governments and large

corporations.&quot; 



<p>By gaining control over interest costs, your company can reduce cash flow volatility and

withstand higher levels of uncertainty. &quot;This makes an organization more attractive to

lenders and investors.&quot; says Burgess, &quot;and allows management to focus on running

the business rather than watching the markets.&quot; 



<p><i>TD offers several easy and inexpensive risk management options -</i>



<h3>Interest Rate Swaps:</h3>

convert your company's floating-rate loans to fixed rate loans to protect against interest rate

increases;



<h3>TD Rate Protection:</h3>

protects your loans against increases in the Prime Lending Rate for up to five years. TD gives

you an  interest rebate' in the event that Prime rises above the level you specify; 



<H3>Interest Rate Caps:</H3>

limit your loan's interest rate in the event that a reference rate (typically the 3-month Bankers'

Acceptance rate) rises above a specified level;



<H3>Interest Rate Collars:</H3>

ensure your loan interest rate remains within a  specified range.



<p><i>For more information on how to protect your company against interest rate risk,

contact your TD Account Manager.</i>



<h2>TD Group Benefit Program </h2>

<i><h4>No-cost decision-making tools for your employees</h4></i>



<p>In our last edition of Business Matters, we talked about the TD Group Benefit Program, a

no-cost personal banking and investment program designed to enhance your existing employee

benefit program.



<P>&quot;What makes this program really special,&quot; says Greg Levi, Manager, Business

Group Services, Business Banking, &quot;is its recognition of employees as financial services

decision-making individuals.&quot; 



<P>The program provides employees with valuable decision-making tools, like the <i>Banking

Benefit Summary and Financial Information Guide. </I>&quot;This guide outlines the banking

and investment services of TD Bank and its affiliates which are available to you, as well as basic

financial planning principles,&quot; explains Levi. &quot;It's designed to help individuals

develop a personal financial planning framework and gain an understanding of financial

planning.&quot;



<p>Your employees not only save money with this program, but also have an opportunity to

expand their investment knowledge - about RRSPs, mutual funds and other investment products

through free, informative investment seminars.



<p><i>To find out how you can provide your staff with the TD Group Benefit Program, speak

to your TD Account Manager or call TD Bank's Green Infoline at 1 800-387-2092.</i>



<h2>TD/Canloc</h2>

<P><i>Convenient, comprehensive and cost-effective information on federal and provincial

government incentive programs for small business</i> 



<p>Over 500 government business incentive programs distribute $15 billion annually to

Canadian businesses to help them grow and prosper. Now, TD/Canloc provides a comprehensive

database that brings this important information to the businesses these programs are designed to

help. &quot;Many small businesses lack the time and resources necessary to research the myriad

of government incentive programs to find the ones that meet their needs,&quot; says Catherine

Taylor, TD Bank Associate Vice President, Business Banking Services. 



<H3>Fast, convenient and cost-effective</H3>

&quot;Businesses simply fax a completed TD/Canloc business profile to our TD/Canloc service

bureau,&quot; explains Taylor. &quot;Within two weeks, the TD/Canloc database generates an

up-to-date listing of the government incentive programs that match their business profile.&quot;

Along with this list, TD/Canloc also provides eligibility requirements, information on the nature

and value of the programs, and contact names and numbers.



<p>TD/Canloc costs just $129<font size=-2>+</font size> plus GST. If there's no fit with your

business, there's no charge from TD Bank.

<h5><font size=-2>+</font size>Subject to change.</h5>

<h2>TD Bank's award-winning web site</h2>

Last year, TD Bank's site on the World Wide Web garnered international acclaim. CorpFiNet, a

US-based provider of Internet finance information to the corporate and commercial financial

industry, ranked TD Bank's Internet site among the top 10. Point Communications, in their guide

to the best of the Internet, rated our site among the top five per cent of all web sites. 



<P>For Steve Gesner, TD Bank's Associate Vice President of Alternative Delivery Channels, 

the true measure of success is not in the number of awards the site chalks up, but the number of

visitors - and the improved communication. &quot;Our web site is another way we can make it

easier for our customers, and provide them with the information they want and need - when they

need it. Currently, over 40,000 visitors a month browse our site.&quot; 



<p>In our Business Banking Centre, you'll find valuable information to help you manage your

business more effectively and cost-efficiently. Our business forum lets you post questions

pertaining to a home-based business, and get answers from Larry Easto, author of How to

succeed in your home business. Plus you'll find over 3,000 pages of valuable information, as well

as numerous financial planning tools, calculators and downloadable software.<KBD>

Market Update
</H2>

<P>The third quarter of 1996 experienced sharp downward movements in rates. Bond yields fell somewhat, while overnight rates fell sharply, as investors continue to benefit from Canada's fiscal improvement. The net effect on the Fund was positive, as it returned 2.75%.<P>The term of the portfolio remained stable at 1.5 years, as we continued to invest in high quality corporate and government bonds.<P>The lowering of global interest rates in the past year has stimulated economic growth. The global economies are experiencing the benefit of stable, low interest rates. We feel that North America economies have troughed and economic recovery in the balance of 1996 and through 1997 will be positive, with both Canada and U.S. expanding. Canada's fiscal position is improving at a tremendous pace. We strongly encourage investors to pay close attention to this as it will bring tremendous benefits for Canadians. One benefit for fixed income investors will be a narrowing of spreads between Canada and U.S. rates. Good economic fundamentals led by low inflation continue to bode well for investors.<P>Canadian interest rates under 3 years are well through U.S. rates, a direct benefit of Canada's fiscal prudence.<P>

<li>expanded our Equity Research group to 13 analysts, four of whom are ranked in the

<p><h2>Chair's Report</h2>







<h3>TD Securities: Building Momentum in 1995</h3>



<p>We had a great year at TD Securities in 1995   developing the core strengths and strategies



that are setting us apart while accelerating our build in key areas.







<p>We saw growth in revenues, growth in earnings, growth in market share, and growth in



momentum. These results are gratifying, insofar as they indicate that our hard work and strategies



are working. But the most important results are the results we achieve for clients. And during the



year, we helped a growing number of corporations, institutions and individual investors meet



their business, and investing needs.







<h3>Integrated delivery</h3>



<p>We work closely with our clients, tailoring solutions and mobilizing all the resources of TD



Securities and TD Bank to meet their needs; and as an integrated dealer we draw on the capital



markets debt and equity, public and private, institutional and retail, domestic and foreign, bank



and non bank that make the most sense for our clients. 







<h3>Industry specialization</h3>



Industry specialization is a concept we have taken further than others, because we believe that a



full understanding of a client's industry and its particular financing constraints and opportunities



enables us to add exceptional value in advising our clients. 







<h3>Research driven</h3>



Strong equity, fixed income and credit research is essential to the success of our industry



specialization strategy. As well as producing quality research for our corporate, government,



institutional and retail clients, our research people are integral to our relationship teams, and help



define strategies to assist our clients. We are committed to developing outstanding research as a



fundamental part of our business philosophy. 







<h3>Quality execution</h3>



Having the right strategies, focus and knowledge is vital but it is not enough. Our clients must



have confidence in our ability to execute well. As a relatively new dealer, TD Securities has



been concentrating on developing and refining our execution capabilities ensuring we have



excellent sales, research, documentation, syndication, distribution, trading systems and back



office support in each of our major business areas. The essential elements are now in place, and



we are focused on achieving excellence in every area.We will continue to develop our strengths



and capabilities to enable us to add value to our investing and capital raising



clients.<br><br>

Market Update
</H2>

<P>U.S. equity markets continued to exhibit strength, with the S&P 500 Total Return Index adding 3.09% in the third quarter, raising its gain since the start of the year to 13.50%. Markets were volatile early in the quarter, as investors tried to interpret conflicting economic data relating to the strength of the U.S. economy. The volatility was accentuated by low trading volume during the summer months of July and August. Interest-sensitive banks and utilities gained substantially as interest rates declined, fueled further by continuing consolidation in these sectors.<P>Although investor interest and trading volume waned in the summer compared to the record volume and mutual funds flows earlier in the year, fund managers that had held back their purchases provided support to the market. The appetite for new issues, however, continued unabated, with initial public offerings ranging from technology stocks to specialty retail and consumer stocks trading above their original issue price.<P>Technology stocks continued to recover following a correction early in the second quarter. Positive earnings surprises from some major semiconductor and computer manufacturers combined with better than expected demand forecasts for 1997 has helped this sector recover.<P>The outlook for moderating economic growth in the U.S. should extend earnings growth for Corporate America, but at a slower pace. However, with inflation hovering at 3%, any action by the U.S. Federal Reserve is uncertain. This delicate balance provides a neutral environment for U.S. equities. The Green Line U.S. Equity Index Fund offers investors foreign exposure, currency diversification as well as the potential for long term growth associated with investing in major U.S. companies.

Market Update
</H2>

<P>The Canadian equity market moved higher during the third quarter, ending the period up 5.40%. The TSE 300 experienced a broad-based gain, as 11 out of the 14 subindices moved higher. The financial services subindex led the way, up 15.74%. For the first nine months of 1996, the TSE has gained 14.03%, with the financial services subindex up 27.62% during this period.<P>Financial services was the story in Canadian equity markets this quarter as bank stocks surged in August and September. With economic reports in the United States showing subdued inflation and the Canadian dollar strengthening, the Bank of Canada eased interest rates further in a continuing effort to provide monetary stimulus for the Canadian economy. Expectations of even higher record profits in this low interest rate environment, and massive stock buy-back programs propelled the major bank stocks to new highs. Other subindices that performed well over the quarter included the pipelines and oil & gas, as the price of oil rose in response to renewed tension in Iraq that postponed a UN-sanctioned oil-for-aid deal. The pipeline subindex was up 9.13%, and the oil & gas subindex gained 8.02% for the quarter.<P>In terms of weak sectors, the metals & minerals subindex fell 2.19% in the quarter, as the price of base metals weakened. The paper & forest product sector declined marginally over the quarter, as investors continued to worry about the impact on earnings of falling prices for pulp, newsprint and wood products. Paper & forest products has been the worst performing subindex of 1996, down 1.32% since the beginning of January.<P>The outlook for equities remains constructive as the Bank of Canada's monetary policy continues to be accommodative. Domestic growth should revive as the economic expansion in 1997 lifts consumer confidence. The Green Line Canadian Equity Index Fund should interest investors interested in matching Canadian equity index returns and long-term growth.<P>

Market Update
</H2>

<P>North American fixed income markets realized gains in the third quarter as interest rates in North America continued to decrease. The U.S. Federal Reserve did not adjust rates during the quarter, and thus, the debate continues as to when the Federal Reserve will increase rates. There appears to be a consensus within the markets that the future direction of rates in the U.S. will be up, but the timing is in question. The next FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee) meeting is following the November 5th Presidential election. In addition, U.S. economic data released in the past three months have shown mixed results, which has caused market volatility.<P>Canada's economy has begun to show small signs of life but is still lagging the U.S. in terms of expansion. Both the federal and provincial deficit reduction programs, along with the Bank of Canada's "easy" monetary stance, bode well for continued investment in Canada. The Canadian dollar has remained stable as interest rates have moved lower, closing the quarter at US$73.43.<P>Long term rates decreased in Canada by over 40 basis points in the quarter, ending the period with a yield of 7.74%. This was not without volatility, however, as rates spiked as high as 8.28% on inflation fears in the United States. U.S. long rates did not perform as well, ending the period only 9 basis points lower at 6.91%. The trading range was much wider, with a low of 6.70% and a high of 7.19%. As a result of Canada's outperformance in the long end, the Canadian interest rate spread relative to U.S. rates narrowed by 34 basis points, breaking through the 100 basis points level to end the quarter at 83 basis points.<P>In the third quarter, the ScotiaMcLeod Government Bond Index increased by 4.99%, compared with a decrease of 2.0% in the second quarter of 1996. The Fund remains invested in high quality government securities with duration and yield closely matching the Index. Duration was slightly longer at 5.17 years versus 4.95 years, and, on a yield basis, was lower by 74 basis points at 6.44% versus 7.18%. As the Fund is indexed, the characteristics of the Fund closely mirrored the composition of the Index.<P>With the outlook for inflation and growth in check, bonds should continue to post modest gains. Therefore, the Green Line Government Bond Fund should continue to appeal to investors who want to achieve moderate capital gains and coupon income from high quality government securities.<P>

<H2>Question:</H2>
<P><I>Wed Dec  6 02:06:37 EST 1995<BR><A HREF="mailto:dennis.doerksen@t8000.com">dennis.doerksen@t8000.com</A> &lt;Dennis Doerksen&gt;</I></P><H3>OK. If I take your advice, which sounds right, and get a GST number, can I claim back tax on items I purchased this year before I registered for the GST?.</H3><H2>Answer, from Larry Easto:</H2><P>I think not.  GST that businesses pay on purchases is deducted from the GST that they collect.  The balance is then remitted to the federal government.  Although I am not an authority on tax matters, I don't believe that it is possible to recover GST paid before registration.  Best you check with the GST office to clarify this.   </P>

<H2>Question:</H2>
<P><I>Wed Oct 25 15:05:41 EDT 1995<BR><A HREF="mailto:cmc@ERE.UMontreal.ca">cmc@ERE.UMontreal.ca</A> &lt;Conner&gt;</I></P><H3>What would you have done differently if you were starting up you own home office right now</H3><H2>Answer, from Larry Easto:</H2><P>Select a more user friendly computer table and chair.  I still have a tingling thumb as a premanent reminder of a computer caused repetitive strain injury.  I now work from a bright, well lit ground floor office (the family room); when I started, I was in a dark corner of a basement.  In retrospect that office was the pits.  I did however write the first edition of How To Succeed In Your Home Business there so it couldn't have been too bad.  From a business perspective, I am not sure what I would have or could have done differently.  If I think of anything over the next couple of days I will get back to you. </P>

Market Update
</H2>

<P>The Canadian market, as defined by the TSE 300 Total Return Index, has risen 12.95% year to date, driven by the improving fundamental outlook for the Canadian economic and political environment. The improving Canadian fiscal situation, highlighted by a balanced current account and declining deficits, has produced an economic backdrop of declining interest rates, stable low inflation and a strong currency. As a result, Canada is expected to experience moderate growth throughout the year.<P>The Fund has outperformed the TSE 300 Total Return Index with a return of 32.3% year to date. The outperformance can be attributed to the disciplined and focused approach used in managing the Fund. Since January, the number of holdings in the Fund has decreased from 89 to 55 companies. By focusing on fewer companies, the Fund has been able to achieve strong returns, yet still maintain a diversified portfolio. The cash position at September 30 was a relatively high 12.1% as certain holdings were sold or reduced once price targets were achieved.<P>The Fund continues to emphasize companies that are well positioned to benefit from modest economic growth or have compelling valuations. The Fund is currently benefiting from significant weightings in sectors that have been out of favour, such as merchandising and real estate, where we believe there are select, compelling value opportunities. These weightings will be rebalanced as the underlying value of the holdings is recognized in the market.<P>The Fund has significant weightings in consumer products (primarily health care), financial services and communications and media. The Fund's holdings should provide for continued performance based on the quality of the business franchise and favourable relative valuation of investee companies. Investments continue to be made based on individual company analysis, concentrating on companies rather than sectoral weightings.<P>

Market Update
</H2>

<P>Year-to-date, the Fund continued outperforming its benchmark with a return of 25.0% compared with 17.81% in the TSE oil & gas subindex. In the third quarter, the Fund returned 13.4% compared with the oil & gas subindex return of 8.02%. In September, the Fund rose 6.2%, while the benchmark index increased 3.88%.<P>For both oil and gas, demand has been strong as economic growth, particularly in Asia and North America, has fuelled consumption. Oil prices remain high at US$24 per barrel, whereas natural gas pricing is more subdued due to moderate weather in the U.S. The outlook over the medium term for both commodities is good. Although equity valuations are still reasonable, the Fund has maintained a high cash position in light of the sector's traditional seasonal weakness in the late fall.<P>The Fund continues to benefit from its exposure to alternative energy sources, including both uranium and coal. The Fund emphasizes companies with good management and strong resource bases. At various times, certain sectors will be emphasized, reflecting our outlook for commodity prices, seasonal factors and relative valuations.<P>

Market Update
</H2>

<P>
T. Rowe Price is bullish on health care stocks over the long-term. Rapid advances in health sciences, medicine and health care delivery offer substantial opportunities for superior long-term capital appreciation. Through careful selection, healthcare stocks are identified that should be less sensitive to the economy and tend to provide a relatively consistent, growing stream of earnings and cash flow through both good and bad times. This sector will be influenced by other factors such as research results or political events which will lead to short-term volatility.
<P>
<H2>Superior Growth Potential</H2>
The global capitalization for health science companies is estimated at $1.5 trillion  over three times the size of the entire Canadian stock market. In addition to the sheer size of the sector, rapid advances in health care offer substantial opportunities for superior long-term appreciation.
<UL>
<LI>Health care alone is experiencing unprecedented change, driven by consumers, corporations, insurers and governments to slow escalating costs.
Industry consolidation, the shift from medical treatment to prevention, quicker approval of new drugs, the possible restructuring of government health care and privatization will lead to more efficient companies offering high-quality products at competitive prices.
<LI>Demographic trends point to higher spending in health care and medicine. 
</ul>

The aging population in developed nations creates more demand for health care services. In the United States, health care expenditures as a percentage of gross domestic product rose from 7.6% in 1972 to 14.0% in 1992. Many other developed countries, including Canada, the UK, France, Germany and Japan show similar trends as shown in the chart below.

</center>
<P>
Rising populations in developing countries increase demand for basic health care services. Population of those aged over 65 in the developing world during the next 30 years is expected to increase from 200% to 400%.
<ul>
<LI>Advances in science result in more and better health care options. Molecular biology and genetic mapping are increasing the understanding of the disease process. Biosensors, microelectronics and materials science are spurring the growth of medical device technology. These developments are resulting in safer, less invasive and more convenient diagnostics and treatments at lower costs.
<LI>The search for cures, prevention and improved diagnostics continues. Heart disease, cancer, diabetes, Alzheimer's, hepatitis and AIDS continue to affect large segments of the population. Enormous amounts of research and development are required to prevent, treat and cure these serious illnesses.
</ul>

<CENTER><H1>Report On Provincial <BR>Government Finances</H1></CENTER>
<CENTER><B>August 1995</B></CENTER>
<H4>Notes On Government Finance Data</H4>

<P>Federal and provincial government fiscal data current as at July 1995. (Ontario
is scheduled to release a fiscal statement in the fall of 1995.) Fiscal years
begin on April 1 and end on March 31. 

<P>Data may not be strictly comparable across
years. Fiscal data are based on federal and provincial government estimates of
revenues, expenditures and surpluses/deficits. The consolidated surplus/deficit
estimates generally include operating and capital items, and equal consolidated
revenues less consolidated expenditures. Surplus/deficit estimates for some
provinces include a portion of sinking fund earnings. 

<P>Federal expenditures
include federal-provincial cash transfers and provincial revenues include total
federal-provincial transfers. Discretionary expenditures equal consolidated
expenditures less debt-service costs. 

<P>Nova Scotia's revenues and expenditures are
reported on a net basis, but are presented here on a consolidated basis for
comparability purposes only. Ontario's estimates for expenditures and deficits
are presented on a Public Accounts basis, and include adjustments for accrual and
consolidation (which primarily reflect the inclusion of non-budgetary capital
expenditures estimated at $2.0 billion in fiscal 1995-96). 

<P>B.C.'s revenues,
expenditures and surplus/deficit estimates are from its Consolidated Revenue
Fund, which excludes most capital expenditures.


<P>Net public debt is government purpose debt net of the debt of self-financing
crown corporations. Net public debt is approximately the sum of all past years'
deficits and surpluses. Federal net public debt is debt net of financial assets,
while most provincial net public debt is not net of financial assets. Net public
debt for some provinces includes a portion of unfunded pension liabilities.
Reporting differs by province. 

<P>The above net public debt figures are reported as
follows: P.E.I., N.S., N.B.: net debt; Quebec: total debt; Ontario: provincial
purpose debt; Manitoba: general purpose debt; Sask.: general government purpose
debt; Alberta: gross General Revenue Fund debt (not net of Heritage Fund assets
estimated at $11.8 billion for fiscal 1995-96); B.C.: taxpayer-supported
debt.

<P><I>Sat Dec 30 04:26:44 EST 1995<BR><A HREF="mailto:energy@enterprise.ca">energy@enterprise.ca</A> &lt;Mel Nickel&gt;</I></P><H3>What is the best way to keep accounts receivable to a minumum and how do you collect payments from clients that just don't want to pay you?</H3><H2>Answer, from Larry Easto:</H2><P>The best approach is a combination of deposits or advances and interim billing.  Whenever possible require payment in advance.  This achieves two purposes. First it allows you to assess your clients' ability and willingness to pay your fees.  Second, it commits your clients to working with you.  If it is not possible or feasible to obtain advance payment, bill early and bill often.  This will keep your invoices small, making it easier for your clients to pay.  If they have trouble paying small invoices, they will have more trouble paying big ones.  Once a client falls into arrears on paying interim accounts, stop working for the client.  This will allow you to stop working for clients who won't pay your bill and start working for clients who will.  In terms of collecting payments from clients that just don't want to pay, the question becomes how much time, money and energy are you prepared to devote to collections.  By keeping individual accounts receivable at a minimum, it is usually easier to write off smalll amounts and move on with more productive work than trying to collect money from clients who simply refuse to pay.  Although it is possible to sue clients who owe you money, suing these clients and obtaining judgement against them is no guarantee that you will receive your money.  It is often prudent to adopt the principle of cutting your losses and not throwing good money after bad.  Don't let a dispute over unpaid bills become </P>

Let's say I make $100,000/year and I have a corporation.  Is it wise to have half of the money paid directly to me and the other half paid to the corporation?  The money paid out to me will be enough to cover my expenses.  The corporation's income will be banked, invested or used for depreciable capital (car, office, etc.).  Does this sound like a good plan, or should I have the income paid to either me or the corporation?</H3><H2>Answer, from Larry Easto:</H2><P>One reason for incorporating a business is to take advantage of lower corporate tax rates.  (Incorporated businesses pay lower rates of incom etax than do individuals). Instead of splitting income between you and your corporation, it would be better to have all revenue paid to the corporation and for you to receive compensation by way of salary, dividends (on your investment in your corporation) and perhaps bonuses.  The amount of your personal compensation will depend upon factors such as your personal expenses, personal tax deductions and credits and of course the profitability of your corporation.  Any money over and above what you and your business require can be invested by the corporation.  Check with your financial or tax advisor to determine the level of your compensation and how this compensation can be allocated between salary, dividends and bonuses.    </P>

How do I turn down new business and not create bad feelings.</H3><H2>Answer, from Larry Easto:</H2><P>Good question.  Thousands of other businesses would love to have the same problem.  Turning down new business might not be the best approach. One alternative would be to subcontract new business to other independent businesses.  This would involve selecting another business to provide services to your new clients on your behalf.  You would specify the services to be provided and the other business would provide the services subject to your specifications. The other business would bill you; you would add your own charges to the bill that you received and then bill the client.  This route would allow you some control over the services that were delivered.  It would also enable you to maintain a relationship with the client to facilitate future marketing opportunities.  Ensure that your relationship with the other business is clear and well documented.  Other alternatives include joint ventures and part-time staff as outlined on page 144 of How to Succeed in Your Home Business.  Another alternative would be to  refer the new business to other qualified businesses and receive a fee for your referral.  When you do turn new business down, ensure that you leave the door open for future opportunities.  </P>

<H2>Question:</H2>
<P><I>Tue Oct 24 14:30:14 EDT 1995<BR><A HREF="mailto:aa887@durham.org">aa887@durham.org</A> &lt;Gary Williams&gt;</I></P><H3>What is the tax advantage to a home business vs. a business run out of a small office?</H3><H2>Answer, from Larry Easto:</H2><P>The only advantage would be the opportunity of claiming as business expenses part of the expenses that relate to home occupation and maintenance.  These expenses would include mortgage interest or rent, taxes, utilities and repairs and maintenance.  The actual amount is the same percentage as the percentage or the area of your home used for business purposes.  Thus, if you use 10% of the total residence floor space for business purposes and your total home occupancy expenses are $4,000, you can claim $400 as an allowable business expense.  Note however, that if you use part of your home for business purposes even though you do run a business out of an office, you might still be able to claim a portion of your household occupancy expenses as business expenses.  The same principles apply.  For further clarification, check with Revenue Canada or with your own tax advisor.    </P>

You must however be a member of the credit bureau to obtain this information.  If you anticipate having to obtain this type of information about a large number of potential customers, you might consider joining your local credit bureau.  There are also independent businesses that provide this type of service for a fee.  Check the local yellow pages under credit reporting agencies.  You might also check with your bank to see if they can access this information for you.</P>

The first step would be to meet with the lender and to find out what the lending criteria are, what information is required, what format is best for presenting the information and how long the decision will take once the information is presented.  The next step is to gather the information that is required.  The final step is to prepare the loan application, including a business plan.  If you meet the lender's criteria and present the information requested in the format requested, your chances of obtaining a small busines loan are very good.  The TD business planner found elsewhere on this site is an excellent tool that will help you to prepare your application.  The planner can be downloaded.  In preparing your loan application also look at chapters 10, 11, 12 and 13 of How To Succeed In Your Home Business, complimentary copies of which are available at all TD branches.  If there is no TD branch near you, you can obtain a copy at a book store or through book-of-the-month club.  </P>

<h1>TD Business Planner*</h1>
<h2>Your Independent Business Planning Guide and Loan Application</h2>

<p>Version 1.0 for DOS<br>April 1994</p>

<p>TD Business Planner software is DOS-based and will run on most IBM compatible PCs.

<H2>Question:</H2>
<P><I>Wed Dec 13 15:06:23 EST 1995<BR><A HREF="mailto:phaedrus@synapse.net">phaedrus@synapse.net</A> &lt;Jane Desbiens&gt;</I></P><H3>How does one go about becoming a credit card merchant to handle online, electronic payments?</H3><H2>Answer, from Larry Easto:</H2><P>Check with banks that offer VISA and Mastercard services.  Local branch personnel can put you in touch with the credit card representatives.  Be ready for a shock.  As a home business you might be expected to provide very sizable up-front deposit.  

Check directly with American Express (Head Office in Markham Ont) to see what its criteria and procedures are.  

Another avenue might be to check out some of the small business listings on Internet.  I have noticed a number of listings that refer to becoming a credit card merchant.  When following this route, be very very careful.  

I would be very interested in knowing how your enquiries turn out.  Please let me know.</P>

Is it worthwhile?</H3><H2>Answer, from Larry Easto:</H2><P>I don't know if liability insurance for consultants is currently available and if so what the premiums and coverage would be.  My understanding is that liability coverage is not generally available for independent consultants.  What is available is usually very expensive.  I don't know of any independent consultants who carry this kind of coverage.  Check with other consultants in your area and see how they handle the issue of professional liability. </P>

<h5>Winter 1995 - Volume Two - Number One</h5>

<H2>A message from the President</H2>

<IMG ALIGN=left hspace=20 SRC="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/lifepl/gifs/man.gif"><P>As 1995 begins, we at TD Trust look forward eagerly to another
year, and the opportunity to meet our clients' changing needs.

<P>Last year was a banner year. Our personal trust, corporate trust
and custody operations expanded, bringing assets under management
to more than $55 billion and making us the third-largest trust
operation in Canada.

<P>The year ahead promises to be equally strong, both for us and for
our clients. We plan to introduce a number of new programs, 
including the TD Trust Fund Navigator service, to help our 
customers build, preserve, and manage their personal wealth and
tax-sheltered investments. We intend to build on the successes of
1994 and to continue to bring our clients the high level of
service they've grown to expect from us. We wish you the best of
success and good health in 1995.
<br><br>

<H2>Question:</H2>
<P><I>Sat Nov 25 23:04:05 EST 1995<BR><A HREF="mailto:dnordyke@agt.net">dnordyke@agt.net</A> &lt;Darrel Nordyke&gt;</I></P><H3>I just started a small car sales business, that I operate from my home.  To date, after 5 months, I have sold some 60 cars,my purchase was approx $110K for which I received some $150K.  Two questions:  first, can I deduct some expenses related to the house and the garage (I do limited maintenance), and secondly, when do I have to start paying GST (business has been in place from 1 May 95 to current)</H3><H2>Answer, from Larry Easto:</H2><P>Sorry--I missed the first question.  The same comments made above about deducting expenses apply.  Given the growth of your business and the GST issue, you would be well advised to check with your accountant or tax advisor before completing your tax return.</P>

Market Update
</H2>

<P>The sharp stock market correction, which began in late June and was over by mid-July, now seems like ancient history as the market galloped on toward new highs by quarter end. The impetus for the strong performance has been a moderately growing, non-inflationary economy and a continuing deluge of cash into equity mutual funds.<P>We have made few changes in the Fund's strategy in the last several months. However, we note that the growth stock universe appears to be polarizing into groups of momentum stocks and plodders. The momentum stocks feature fast-growing companies with accelerating fundamentals trading at extremely high valuations. The plodders are those companies growing more slowly and less assuredly, but trading at dramatically lower valuations.<P>The increasing popularity of momentum investing, which completely ignores valuation in the stock selection process, is pushing momentum stocks to dizzying heights, while the plodders meander sideways. We see two consequences to the momentum craze. In the short term, we are witnessing more volatility in select individual stocks as momentum investors buy and sell. For example, a stock trading at fifty times earnings that disappoints can easily be cut in half overnight. Longer term, new valuation eras always end badly, though the timing of this is left to conjecture.<P>In managing the Fund, we have always tended to gravitate towards the plodders, and historically, this Fund has generated above-average returns with below-average risk when compared with other growth funds.

Market Update
</H2>

<P>The Fund returned 4.03% after fees which is in line with the benchmark on an after fee basis. Short-term investments and a large global equity exposure offset good Canadian equity and bond returns. While the TSE 300 marginally outperformed bonds, both were significantly ahead of returns for global markets and cash. Returns for the Fund on a year-to-date and annual basis remain ahead of their benchmark before fees.<P>The major event of the quarter was the aggressive reduction in short-term interest rates by the Bank of Canada which had no major impact on the Canadian dollar. For the first time in many years, the Canadian prime rate and short-term interest rates in general are below those in the United States. This reflects on the improved fiscal picture in Canada and the extent of underutilised capacity in the Canadian economy. Both auger well for Canada going forward.<P>In earlier communications, we indicated that we are in an extended non-inflationary global recovery and this continues to be our view. We continue to favour equities over fixed income although we are using a little more short-term investments than in the second quarter. We remain biased to Canadian exporters and well-capitalized resource companies. However, stock selection proved to be more important as stocks such as Fairfax Financial, Canadian Oil Sands, Power Financial and YBM Magnex performed very well.<P>Little change occurred in our global equities. We noted previously that we have more invested in Asia than in the U.S. based on our economic and demographic outlook. It is a stance that did not pay in the third quarter as the U.S. substantially outperformed Asia.

Baril&gt;</I></P><H3>Can a numbered company use any operating name it chooses with either the Inc. or Ltd. extension?</H3><H2>Answer, from Larry Easto:</H2><P>The terms Inc. and Ltd. are short forms for Incorporated and Limited.  Some variation must be used in the legal, or incoporated, name of the company.  Thus with a numbered company, one of these terms or a variation of them must be the last element.  Conversely, no form of incoporated or limited can be used in the business or operating names of incoporated businesses. </P>

The question of associations is discussed on pages 155-158 of How To Succeed In Your Home Business.  In your case, a useful starting point would be the small bussiness self help office in either Huntsville or Barrie.  Either consultant should be able to put you in touch with the local Homeworks group.  </P>

<H2>Question:</H2>
<P><I>Fri Dec  8 14:13:04 EST 1995<BR><A HREF="mailto:holtby@unbc.edu">holtby@unbc.edu</A> &lt;Bob Holtby, Regency Consultants Ltd., UNBC&gt;</I></P><H3>Response:  If the question from the new consultant regarding expectations of billable time was asked for budget purposes, the answer could be as follows:  find out what the going rate is for consultants in your line of work.  How many hours do you have to bill to break even?  Is that feasible?  Do you have to increase your rate?  Do you have to diversify in order to meet your costs?  What about the market?  All of these questions should be answered as part of a business plan.</H3><H2>Answer, from Larry Easto:</H2><P>Good response.  The approach that you describe is ideal for setting goals that will form part of the business plan.  However as we all know there is invariably a difference between numerical goals that we set and what we actually achieve. The question now becomes how many billable hours do consultants actually have in their first year?  Does anyone have any specific numbers?</P>

<h5>Summer 1995 - Volume Two - Number Three</h5>

<H2>The case for Canada</H2>

<P>For most of recent memory, the Canadian and U.S. equity markets have moved pretty much in tandem. When the New York Stock Exchange rose or fell, the Toronto Stock Exchange followed suit.

<P>All that changed in 1989 when the U.S. market began to outperform its Canadian cousin by a significant margin. How significant? 
<P><H3>Performance Gap: TSE 300 vs. S&P 500</H3>
<CENTER><IMG ALIGN=bottom SRC="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/lifepl/gifs/summer.gif"></CENTER>

<P>From January 1, 1989 to April 30, 1995, the Standard & Poor's 500 Index generated a compounded total return of 13.70% a year. That compared with a paltry 7.10% for the TSE 300 Index.
Why? At the risk of oversimplifying, there are three fundamental reasons. First, the Bank of Canada embarked on an inflation-fighting policy. Higher interest rates boosted the Canadian dollar to such a level that goods produced in Canada were uncompetitive in international markets. As a result, the equities of companies that manufacture goods for export be-came less attractive than fixed-income alternatives. Second, the recession of the early '90s reduced corporate profits to their lowest level in decades. Third, federal and provincial government finances deteriorated sharply, straining our capital markets. 

<P><B>Time for change</B><br>
That U.S. stocks will outperform their Canadian brethren has 
become an article of faith among many investors. This reflects their recent experience. But if there is one truism in investment, it is that once a view comes to represent conventional wisdom, it is no longer wise.

<P>In our view, Canadian stocks should soon begin outperforming their American counterparts. Canadian companies are now very competitive, thanks to a relatively low Canadian dollar, gains in cost control, and improved corporate productivity.

<P>Shares of Canadian companies now trade at very reasonable 
multiples of earnings and cash flow. Furthermore, corporate earnings will continue to improve, 
as will balance sheets and dividend payments, although the rate of improvement may ease. The 
TSE generally outperforms other markets when commodity prices are strong, since it is heavily weighted with cyclical resource-based companies.

<P><B>Good news ahead</B><br>
The bigger picture is also brightening. The federal and provincial governments' capital requirements should continue to drop this year in response to lower deficits. 

<P>At the same time, our international current account deficit-the difference between what we pay foreigners for goods and 
services, and what we receive-continues to shrink. While much needs to be done to ensure these gains become part of a longer-term trend, the signs are encouraging.

<P>Finally, foreign buyers have been largely absent from our 
equity markets in recent years. 
A resurgence of interest could result in large-scale buying.

<P>Problems? No doubt about it. Our government deficits and ac-cumulated debt are too high, and political uncertainties remain. In addition, our cost of capital is higher than our key trading partners'.

<P>Notwithstanding these issues, the changes to our landscape 
are very positive. Investors have good reason to be optimistic 
about the future.

<P><I>Thu Oct 26 09:57:45 EDT 1995<BR><A HREF="mailto:deborah@netnorth.com">deborah@netnorth.com</A> &lt;Deborah Robinson&gt;</I></P><H3>What's the best way to get my clients focussed on other things besides price?</H3><H2>Answer, from Larry Easto:</H2><P>Good question.  The most successful businesses are those businesses that concentrate on meeting clients' needs and wants.  To focus clients on things other than price make sure that you know what clients need or want.  With this knowledge you can then customize your services to meet these needs and wants.  Ensure that your individual clients are aware of how you and your services are meeting their needs and wants.  Ensure also that your clients are well aware of the benefits that they are receiving from having your services meet their needs and wants.  In this manner you should be able shift their focus from the cost of your services to the value or benefits that they are receiving from your services.   </P>

<H2>Question:</H2>
<P><I>Mon Oct 23 21:51:42 EDT 1995<BR><A HREF="mailto:duras@inforamp.net">duras@inforamp.net</A> &lt;David Secord&gt;</I></P><H3>I've just started a computer consulting business at home.  There is a good chance that I won't make $30,000 in my first year of operations, should I be charging G.S.T.?</H3><H2>Answer, from Larry Easto:</H2><P>As you are aware, it is not necessary to charge G.S.T. if your revenue is less than $30,000 per annum.  Even though your revenue might be below this level there are two reasons why you should consider obtaining a G.S.T. number and collecting the tax.  

First, with the number you will be able to recover any G.S.T that you pay on purchases.  If you anticipate making any purchases, such as computer equipment, that will require the payment of significant amounts of G.S.T., you can only recover the tax paid if you have a G.S.T. number.  

Second, by not having and using a G.S.T. number you are giving your clients the message that you are really quite small.  This might not be the kind of marketing message that you would like to give out.  

As a rule, I believe that it is preferable to register for G.S.T. to recover the tax that you have paid and to present your business as successfully as possible.   </P>

Market Update
</H2>

<P>Global bonds yields were lower in the third quarter, led by gains in Canada and Italy, with other countries following. The U.S. yields were unchanged, as continued economic growth kept investors cautious. The currency markets generally favoured the dollar-bloc currencies, mainly Canada and the U.S., with continued strength from the British pound. The Japanese yen and the Deutschemark remain the weak currencies.<P>The combination of lower yields and good country selection allowed the Fund to post a healthy 3.49% return for the quarter. The Fund is well positioned with a higher exposure in the dollar-bloc countries and an aggressive weighting in the Gilts markets. It remains unweighted in Germany and Japan. An Italian exposure continues to contribute to Fund returns.<P>Lowering of global rates in the past year is fueling growth. From the economies of Japan to the United States, we are experiencing the positive effects that sustained lower rates bring. We feel comfortable with the U.K. as they continue to experience low inflation coupled with high real rates.<P>

<H2>Question:</H2>
<P><I>Sun Nov 26 13:58:57 EST 1995<BR><A HREF="mailto:kschaus@bconnex.net">kschaus@bconnex.net</A> &lt;Karen Schaus&gt;</I></P><H3>How often do you review your financial position and with whom?</H3><H2>Answer, from Larry Easto:</H2><P>Reviewing the financial position of a business is a management responsibility.  The purpose of the review is to assess how well the business is doing as compared to its plans.  It is usually worthwhile to review financial operations quarterly, half yearly and annually.  Although some people like monthly statements, they are most useful to compare the operations of one month to those of the same month in the preceeding year.  Financial statements are reviewed with accountants or other people who can interpret the statements and give some explanation as to what they mean.</P>

Market Update
</H2>

<P>Science and technology stocks plunged early in the third quarter on worries of industry slowdown and poor second quarter financial results. Since bottoming in July, they have retraced all of their earlier losses.<P>All sectors, except media and telecommunication companies, contributed positively to Fund performance. Semiconductor, software and data services companies performed particularly well. Aside from building reserves to accommodate opportunistic purchases during what we expect to be a difficult earnings report season, the underlying profile of the portfolio remains unchanged.<P>We continue to believe that 1996 is a transition year for the science & technology sector and are therefore holding fast to our strategy of "counter punching" to achieve incremental performance. Accordingly, we are managing individual exposures, sector weightings, and our reserve positions to take advantage of swings in investor sentiment toward particular companies and the overall science & technology sector. We remain hopeful that most of the challenges in 1996 will abate during 1997 and that the sector will be enveloped by a more favourable environment. We continue to believe that improving sector fundamentals on the heels of less aggressive valuations and against easier earnings comparisons will make 1997 a less challenging year for science and technology stocks.

<H2>Question:</H2>
<P><I>Thu Nov 30 16:43:56 EST 1995<BR><A HREF="mailto:nstn4213@fox.nstn.ca">nstn4213@fox.nstn.ca</A> &lt;Mark Hemphill&gt;</I></P><H3>What is your opinion on Network Marketing such as Glentel, Amway etc?</H3><H2>Answer, from Larry Easto:</H2><P>I have major reservations about Network Marketing.  I have encountered many network marketers who are very, very enthusiastic about the potential of what they are doing.  Unfortunately, I have yet to meet any one who has been as successful as anticipated.  I recall reading something on Internet that approximately 98% of individuals who get involved in networking marketing fail to achieve their goals.  I guess I just haven't met the other 2%.  Numbers aside, most of us know network marketers.  How many of us know successful network marketers?  Most of the material that I have seen that promotes network marketing has a get rich quick flavour about it.  My experience tells me that get rich quick elements are seldom if ever found in successful businesses.  What is your opinion?  </P>

Market Update
</H2>

<P>The third quarter of 1996 experienced sharp downward movements in rates. Bond yields fell somewhat, while overnight rates fell sharply, as investors continued to benefit from Canada's fiscal improvement. The effect on the fund was positive, achieving a return of 5.42% for the quarter.<P>The sensitivity to interest rates was maintained at a high level throughout the quarter as market conditions remained favourable. The duration was maintained at 7 years. The Fund continues to maintain a high exposure to corporate bonds as the incremental yield will provide greater income.<P>The reduction of global interest rates in the past year has stimulated economic growth. Global economies are experiencing the benefit of stable, low interest rates. We feel that North American economies have troughed and economic recovery in the balance of 1996 and through 1997 will be positive for both Canada and the United States. Canada's fiscal position is improving at a tremendous pace. We strongly encourage investors to pay close attention to this as it will bring tremendous benefits for Canadians. One benefit for fixed income investors will be a narrowing of spreads between Canada and U.S. rates. Good economic fundamentals led by low inflation continues to bode well for investors.<P>Your Fund benefited from market movements during the third quarter such as lower rates and a continuing of spread tightening between corporate and provincial bonds. Spread tightening has the effect of making the Fund's bonds more valuable.<P>We feel the strong pressure on North America economies to raise rates can be comfortably offset by the dramatic improvement in Canada's fiscal position. It is quite possible that the federal government's net borrowing needs for fiscal 1997-1998 could be zero.<P>We have positioned the portfolio to take advantage of this fiscal position. We feel a slightly longer duration, coupled with high corporate exposure provides incremental returns with low incremental risks.<P>

<h5>Spring 1995 - Volume Two - Number Two</h5>

<H2>Taking your lead from the smart money</H2>

<P>Stock market forecasts abound, and no two are exactly alike. So if
professionals don't always agree, how can the average investor
stay on top of market movements?

<P>One suggestion is to watch what the experts are doing, rather than
what they're saying. And among the best experts to watch are
those who represent the &quot;smart money&quot; - the corporate
investors, such as company directors, board members and executive
officers, who are closest to the action.

<P>By looking at whether they're buying or selling, you can generally
gauge whether stocks represent good value, poor value, or
something in between. Right now, indications are bullish.

<H3>Takeover activity</H3>
<p>The recent level of takeover activity in Canada tells us that
corporate buyers have perceived value that stock market investors
have not yet been willing to pay for. For example: 
<ul>
<li>Canstar Sports is being bought out by Nike at a price of $27.50 
a share. That's roughly 66% higher than the price per share before the bid.
<li>Shareholders of Hayes-Dana, the Canadian auto parts
manufacturer, have received a bid of $17.50 a share from Dana
Corp., the U.S. majority shareholder, for the shares it does not
already own. That price represents a premium of about 52% over
the prevailing market price of $11.50.
<li>Software developer Alias Research has received a bid from
Silicon Graphics at a significant premium to market price.
<li>MacMillan Bloedel purchased Green Forest Products at a price
well above market.
</ul>

<p>These transactions demonstrate that stock prices are often below
the actual value of the business to well-informed prospective
buyers.

<p>This will increasingly be the case with German firms, which find
Canadian companies relatively inexpensive, in part as a result of
the rising value of the German mark versus the Canadian dollar.

<p>On another front, many companies are now purchasing shares of
their own stock at prevailing market prices. The companies 
then cancel these shares, leaving the remaining shareholders with
a bigger piece of the company.

<p>Typically, companies take this action when they feel the shares
of their company are undervalued, and therefore constitute one of
the best investments they can make.

<p>Northstar Energy and Slocan Forest Products are two companies
that are or recently have been engaged in share buyback programs.


<H3>Reading the signs</H3>

<p>What do these takeovers and share buyback programs tell us as
investors? Simply, that many companies' share prices are
unsustainably low, and at some point will rise to reflect their
true value.

<p>Look for further mergers and acquisitions among the natural gas
producers and forestry companies in the months ahead. And as
values become more widely apparent, look for stock prices to
rise.

<H4>Bob Gorman is Senior Vice President, Investments, TD Trust Company.</H4>

<H2>Important news for stock market investors</H2>

<p>Significant changes to securities trading regulations are
scheduled to come into effect in June 1995. The settlement period
for trades will be shortened to three days (&quot;T+3&quot;),
from the current five days (&quot;T+5&quot;).

<p>This means that investors will receive trade proceeds, 
and will have to pay for their acquisitions, sooner.

<p>This is an important date to remember if you hold individual
stocks and bonds in your investment portfolio.

<H3>Lessons from Latin America</H3>

<P>The recent sharp downturn in Latin American markets is a reminder
of the risks of investing in emerging markets. These markets are
highly volatile.

<P>In addition, emerging markets are thinly traded. So when market
sentiment turns negative, the downturn can be surprisingly swift.

<P>Finally, a change in investors' perceptions of one emerging
market will frequently have a spillover effect on other markets
in the region. The recent selloff in Brazil in the wake of
Mexico's difficulties is a good example.

<P>Anyone with holdings in emerging markets should be prepared to
invest for a number of years. Ultimately, the rapid growth of
these economies and the resultant rise in corporate earnings
should translate into superior returns for investors. 

<P>But along the way, investors must be willing and 
able to ride out the inevitable ups and downs.

Existing home coverage should be adequate.  If you will be seeing clients at home or taking their property there, you are increasing the risk of being liable to injury to others and damage or loss of property belonging to others.  In either of these cases, you might check with your insurance agent to determine whether or not you need additional coverage.  You might also check with your insurance agent to see that the existing coverage is adequate to cover loss of any of your business equipment such as computers and books and records.  If possible you could also arrange some business interuption insurance.  This will cover your losses if your home business is interupted for any reason.</P>

<P><I>Fri Jan  5 02:39:30 EST 1996<BR><A HREF="mailto:kwa@accent.net">kwa@accent.net</A> &lt;Winny Kazan&gt;</I></P><H3>What are the first steps into starting a home business?</H3><H2>Answer, from Larry Easto:</H2><P>The first step is to determine if you are well suited to running your own business.  You can do this by working through the Entrepreneurial Assessment found on this web site.  Next, consider what you would like to do in your business.  Do you want to provide goods or services and to whom do you want to provide these goods or services?  Once you have addressed these questions, prepare a business plan, using the TD Business Planner software and How To Succeed In Your Home Business book, also found elsewhere on the site.  Good Luck!</P>

<P><I>Wed Oct 25 15:02:52 EDT 1995<BR><A HREF="mailto:dea@compuserve.com">dea@compuserve.com</A> &lt;Daphne&gt;</I></P><H3>What are my potential liabilities in setting up a home office. </H3><H2>Answer, from Larry Easto:</H2><P>You could be liable if any visitor--client, sales person, supplier etc.--to your office is injured.  Similarly, you could also be liable for damages if any property belonging to others is damaged or lost while in your possession at your home office.  In each case, it is a good idea to discuss potential liability with your insurance agent or broker.  Some insurance companies offer special policies for home businesses that cover a wider range of risks than basic home policies. If available these are best for home businesses. </P>

I suggest that you ask each province how it can help you.  Once you have the responses, you can make your own selection based on your own criteria.  Contact whatever department or agency looks after economic development for each province.  You can probably get the appropriate names and addresses from each province's web site.</P>

<H2>Question:</H2>
<P><I>Wed Oct 25 15:08:42 EDT 1995<BR><A HREF="mailto:sbrady@io.org">sbrady@io.org</A> &lt;Stu Brady&gt;</I></P><H3>Should I incorporate?</H3><H2>Answer, from Larry Easto:</H2><P>I beleive that it is always better to incorporate a business, regardless of the size or business activity.  Incorporation is the best method of protecting personal assets from business failure.  Assuming that there are no personal guarantees, personal assets cannot be used to satisfy the obligations of an incorporated business.  If you are the only person operating the business, you can complete the incoporation paperwork yourself.  Most stationery stores and libraries have incorporation guides that will help you with the process.  Alternatively, many independent businesses offer incorporation services.  It is not always necessary to hire a lawyer to complete the paperwork to incorporate a business.    </P>

<h5>Summer 1995 - Volume Two - Number Three</h5>
<H2>Why everyone needs a will</H2>

<P>If you don't have a will, your family may suffer needless financial and emotional hardship. When your wishes aren't on paper, they may not happen.

<P>Take the case of &quot;Henry&quot; and his wife, &quot;Nancy,&quot; who have two small children. If Henry died unexpectedly without a will, this is what could occur:  
<ul>
<li>Bank accounts in Henry's name are frozen. Nancy has no access to this cash. She must apply to the courts to be appointed administrator for the estate, a process that can take several months. 
<li>Henry's estate is distributed according to the laws in his province of residence.
<li>The two children each get a share, which is administered by the public guardian and trustee or other government official at a low statutory rate of interest until they reach the age of majority. The children then receive a lump sum, but may be too young to manage it wisely. 
<li>Henry's parents, whom he had intended to help, get nothing. 
<li>Nancy is burdened with unnecessary financial and administrative duties at a difficult time in her life. 
</ul>

<P>For your family's well-being, it's important that you have an up-to-date will. TD Trust assists clients by acting as their executor or co-executor and can review an existing will or help prepare a new will. Please inquire about this service through any TD branch.

Market Update
</H2>

<P>The third quarter of 1996 experienced sharp downward movements in rates. Bond yields fell somewhat, while overnight rates fell sharply, as investors continued to benefit from Canada's fiscal improvement. The effect on the Fund was positive, achieving a return of 3 .05% for the quarter.<P>The term of the portfolio was increased sharply from 2.3 years to 3.0 years during the quarter, as availability of mortgage-backed securities increased. As well as, there was a desire to increase term due to favourable market conditions.<P>The reduction of global interest rates in the past year has stimulated economic growth. Global economies are experiencing the benefit of stable, low interest rates. We feel that North American economies have troughed and economic recovery in the balance of 1996 and through 1997 will be positive for both Canada and the United States. Canada's fiscal position is improving at a tremendous pace. We strongly encourage investors to pay close attention to this as it will bring tremendous benefits for Canadians. One benefit for fixed income investors will be a narrowing of spreads between Canada and U.S. rates. Good economic fundamentals led by low inflation continues to bode well for investors.<P>Your Fund benefited from the market trends considerably during the third quarter, as we were able to reach our target term early in this quarter. We increased the mortgage-backed weighting by 5% and we expect to increase it even further during the next 5 years. The sharp decrease in mortgage rates has led to an increase in product availability.<P>We feel the strong pressure in North American economies to raise rates can be comfortably offset by the dramatic improvement in Canada's fiscal position. The target term of the portfolio is 3 to 3.5 years. We feel the Fund can benefit from higher yields that a slightly longer term view provides, with minimal incremental risk, given our fiscal position.<P>

Market Update
</H2>

<P>Year-to-date, equities have outperformed bonds, as the TSE 300 and the S&P 500 have advanced 14.03% and 13.50% respectively versus the 6.72% return for the Scotia Capital Markets Universe. The Fund has appreciated 12.77% after fees since the beginning of 1996, as a result of holding a higher proportion of assets in equities versus bonds. Performance was also enhanced by good stock selection within the Canadian equity component of the Fund. In particular, holdings in Newbridge, Trimark, Cameco, Loewen, and high oil and bank stock exposure aided returns.<P>The expression "as good as money in the bank" certainly was appropriate in the third quarter as the financial services portion of the TSE powered ahead 15.74% and, together with other interest sensitive sectors, led the TSE 300 to a 5.40% total return. The Fund has a higher proportion of interest sensitive stocks than the index, and this helped total returns. Metals, papers, golds, industrial products and communications were the lagging sectors during the third quarter, as commodity prices have been weak thereby causing earnings expectations to fall.<P>During the first five months of the year, the fixed income component of the Fund had a below average duration, which reduced the magnitude of the negative impact on the portfolio during the rising interest rate environment. By the end of the second quarter, duration had been lengthened and exceeded the Scotia Capital Markets Universe thereby enhancing returns when interest rates declined. The Universe advanced 5.03% during the third quarter, keeping pace with the TSE 300 return of 5.40%. Inflation indicators remain relatively subdued in Canada, but bear watching in the U.S. as wages are definitely on the rise. However we believe that U.S. GNP growth in the second half of 1996 will be more subdued than in the first half, and the Federal Reserve will not have cause to raise interest rates until after the Presidential election.<P>In Canada, the U.S. slowdown will be offset by the Bank of Canada's aggressive easing, probably keeping us growing at a stronger rate than in the first half of 1996. The Canadian dollar will get stronger, but the magnitude of the improvement will probably be limited until the Bank of Canada is satisfied that domestic growth is strong enough to allow moderate interest rate increases.<P>We are carrying an above average level of cash at this time as equity markets have advanced to fully valued levels. At the beginning of the year we forecast that long term interest rates would be higher by the end of 1996, and at best earnings would be flat. It now appears that earnings in l996 will be below that of 1995, and are expected to rise only modestly in 1997. The main driver of the equity market has been lower short term rates, and liquidity driven markets warrant caution. We have been increasing our bond exposure during the quarter, and would expect to continue in this direction.

Market Update
</H2>

<P>This quarter your Fund returned 4.82% after fees, slightly exceeding the benchmark. Canadian equity returns were strong, offsetting weaker global equities. The returns year-to-date and for one year are strong.<P>The third quarter in Canada began with a poor July, followed by a strong rally during the last two months. The strong stock market was driven by falling interest rates. Consequently, the interest sensitive sections of the market - financial services, pipelines and utilities - were strong. This continued the rotation away from the resource sectors that were very strong early in the year. Energy stocks were the exception to this resource weakness as political events and demand coincided to push up oil prices through the summer.<P>World markets were generally weaker than in Canada. Asia was weaker than Europe and the U.S. with returns from Japan and Southeast Asia negative for the quarter. This was not beneficial to the Fund as we have an Asian bias in the portfolio. We find the long-term investment outlook for Southeast Asia to be compelling based on demographic and growth considerations. Asia, ex-Japan, now represents value due to its weakness over the last two and a half years.<P>Performance from the portfolio was very much a function of stock selection. In Canada, Fairfax Financial, Power Financial, Bank of Nova Scotia, Canadian Oil Sands and YBM Magnex all performed well. In foreign markets IBM, Capital American, Interstate Bakeries and NIKE were strong but our Japanese and Southeast Asian stocks were generally weak, in line with their markets.

Market Update
</H2>

<P>For the nine months ended September 30, 1996, the Fund returned 78.9% compared with a 6.2% return for the TSE precious metals subindex. In the third quarter, the Fund returned 12.5% compared with 0.01% for the subindex. During September, the Fund was down 2.1%, compared with a 5.7% decline in the subindex.<P>The relative outperformance of the Fund is attributable to a number of holdings rather than to events at any one company. In September, the Fund benefited from weightings in cash and cash equivalents as well as diversified mineral companies, which have not been as affected by the declines in gold equities.<P>Concerns relating to the possible sale of 5 million ounces of gold by the International Monetary Fund took some of the sparkle out of gold during September. As a result, investor sentiment has become very negative toward the sector, a situation which may not be reversed until the price of gold rises from its current level of US$380 per ounce. While we continue to view the prospects for silver more favourably, its price has also been hurt by the lacklustre performance of gold bullion.<P>Gold equities are suffering from the recent high level of speculation. In such an environment, stock selection is particularly important and the Fund continues to focus on companies with excellent reserves. Most recently, the element of political risk has emerged as a renewed concern for investors, particularly in Indonesia.<P>The Fund invests in gold, silver, platinum and precious stones, emphasizing companies with superior management and resources. The Fund continues to maintain an above-average exposure to silver and to diamond exploration in the Northwest Territories.

<BODY BGCOLOR="#ffffff">
<CENTER><H1>Report On Provincial <BR>Government Finances</H1></CENTER>
<CENTER><B>August 1995</B></CENTER>
<H2>Federal - Provincial Transfers</H2>
<P>In fiscal 1995-96, total transfer payments under the 
major programs -- <B>equalization, Established Programs 
Financing (EPF) and the Canada Assistance Plan 
(CAP)</B> -- are expected to increase by 2.1 per cent, to 
$37.7 billion.  Transfer payments to all provinces will rise in 
the current fiscal year, with growth ranging from a high of 
7.6 per cent in Saskatchewan to a low of 1.1 per cent in 
Alberta. 
<P>
Equalization payments are made to the "have-not" 
provinces -- the Atlantic provinces, Quebec, Manitoba 
and Saskatchewan -- whose revenue-generating 
capacities are below the national average.  In fiscal 
1995-96, equalization payments will rise by 6.5 per cent, 
to $8.9 billion.  Transfers under the EPF program are made 
to all provinces and are earmarked for health care and 
education.  EPF payments, which have been frozen in 
per-capita terms since fiscal 1989-90, will increase in total 
by 1.2 per cent, to $21.7 billion this year.  CAP is a 
cost-sharing program which funds social-assistance 
programs in all provinces.  Starting in fiscal 1990-91, the 
federal government introduced asymmetry into the CAP 
program by limiting the growth in CAP transfers to the three 
"have" provinces -- Ontario, Alberta and British Columbia.  
In the current fiscal year, total CAP payments will be frozen 
at their 1994-95 level of $8.0 billion.
<P>

<BR>
<IMG ALIGN=bottom SRC="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/library/provincial/gifs/graph2.gif" ALT="Federal-Provicial Transfers after 1995 Federal Budget Measures"></CENTER>
<P>
<B>In the 1995 federal budget, a major 
restructuring of the transfer system was announced.</B>  
The EPF and CAP grants will be combined, starting in 
fiscal 1996-97, and replaced by an unconditional payment 
called the <B>Canada Health and Social Transfer (CHST)</B>.  
The CHST payment in fiscal 1996-97 will amount to $26.9 
billion, $2.8 billion lower than the combined EPF and CAP 
transfer in the current fiscal year.  In fiscal 1997-98, the 
total CHST payment will decline by a further $1.8 billion, to 
$25.1 billion.  In the current fiscal year, the combined EPF 
and CAP payment represents between 17 per cent and 23 
per cent of each province's total revenues, or between 
$928 and $1,042 per person.  <B>The impact of CHST cuts in 
fiscal 1996-97 will be similar across provinces, as 
CHST revenues in every province will decline by 9.4 
per cent, or about $100 per person. </B>
<P>
The reliance on federal transfers varies 
dramatically across the country, with per-capita transfers 
ranging from $2,631 per person in Newfoundland to $928 
per person in Alberta.  These differences are accounted for 
by the wide variation in per-capita equalization payments 
received across provinces.  Payments under the 
equalization program -- which were unaffected by the 
1995 federal budget -- are expected to rise by about 4 per 
cent per year in fiscal 1996-97 and 1997-98.  <B>Total 
transfers, including equalization and EPF-CAP/CHST, 
will fall by about 6 per cent in fiscal 1996-97, and by 
about 4 per cent in fiscal 1997-98, to $33.9 billion.</B>  
Given that equalization payments will continue to rise, total 
transfers to the "have-not" provinces will decline at a 
slower pace than those to the "have" provinces.

Market Update
</H2>

<P>The Japanese market fell during the first two months of the quarter and then recovered somewhat in September to end the period down 4.8% in local currency (down 6.5% in Canadian dollars). Initial weakness was attributable to concern over new equity issues from banks and the government, and selling by foreign investors. Some mixed economic data caused concern about the sustainability of the recovery and 10-year government bond yields fell below 3% for the first time this year. The market's recovery in September reflected a more sanguine view on the degree of new equity issues, the return to net buying by foreign investors and more encouraging economic data.<P>Export-oriented sectors, such as electricals and autos, responded well to the weaker yen. In particular, this led to some positive earnings revisions in the auto sector. Interest-rate sensitive sectors, such as utilities performed well as bond yields fell, although the banks as a group ended the period marginally behind the index. Small companies performed poorly, as doubts grew over the sustainability of recovery, while basic industries were also notably weak on inventory concerns.<P>The Fund was marginally ahead of the index over the quarter, with most of the outperformance coming in July. Holdings in the larger electricals recovered after weakness earlier in the year. Toyota continued to perform well and raised its earnings estimates. Sumitomo Corporation, bought at the end of last quarter, recovered somewhat after disclosing the full extent of its copper trading loss. Small companies fared poorly, generally underperforming the main market index.<P>Changes to the Fund were driven more by individual stock opportunities than by the overall economic environment. The increase in exposure to medium and smaller stocks hurt performance this quarter, but we are staying overweight because this area has tended to outperform when growth expectations rise and vice versa. We remain overweight in electricals, trading companies and insurance, and underweight in banks and utilities.<P>Our forecast for growth in the coming year is substantially higher than the consensus, and as a result, we are relatively optimistic about the equity market. In part, our higher figure is driven by an optimistic view on private capital investment. If anything, we have underestimated the strength of companies' cashflow, which we expect to continue to lead investment spending. We are also more optimistic that the weakness in the yen, which has already occurred, will positively impact trade volumes starting next year.<P>A general election is scheduled for October 20 and is expected to return the LDP to government. The question is whether it will return as now in coalition form or whether it will secure sufficient votes to secure an outright majority. Either outcome is likely to leave the planned increase in the sales tax in place, but it may be offset somewhat from an extension of income tax cuts, particularly as government revenues so far this fiscal year are running well ahead of target. An overall majority for the LDP could lead to stronger government rather than the feeble coalitions of the past few years.<P>

Market Update
</H2>

<P>The U.S. economy appears to have grown at a healthy pace in the third quarter. The U.S. dollar continues to remain firm against most of the major currencies. The U.S. Federal Reserve is maintaining a neutral interest rate policy, having kept rates unchanged throughout the summer.<P>Our analysis continues to point to good economic growth for the balance of the year. This coupled with relatively tame inflation expectations should allow rates to remain stable.<P>The Fund's return for the three months ending September 30, 1996 was 1.08%. The yield rose slightly from the previous quarter, as market uncertainty allowed us to capitalize on higher rates. We continue to invest in commercial paper and corporate bonds which will enhance yield.<P>

Market Update
</H2>

<P>International equities as a whole were almost flat over the third quarter of 1996 despite a period of sharp weakness in July. There was little change in currency markets - the European currencies scarcely moved against the dollar, while the yen fell 1.8%.<P>European markets followed the pattern set by the U.S. UK stocks rose sharply in August and September as excessively pessimistic expectations eased, assisted by strong earnings reports and good inflation numbers. In continental Europe, the two features were the emergence of clearer evidence of recovery in Germany, and the renewed political drive toward monetary union. The former led to modest outperformance of the German and Dutch markets, while the latter caused bond yields in Spain, Italy, Ireland and Sweden to fall relative to those in Germany.<P>The weakness in Japan is attributable to the volume of new equity issues and concerns about the sustainability of recovery. The Tankan business confidence survey suggested that corporate optimism in some industries is fading, but money supply growth is strong, housing starts are rising sharply and the inventory correction is progressing. The weaker data also led to lower interest rate expectations, and the bond market improved substantially. Export-oriented sectors, such as electricals and autos, responded well to the weaker currency.<P>The emerging markets as a group gave up some of their relative strength of the first half of the year, with weakness concentrated in Asia, where concerns about the level of short-term debt in Thailand and the lack of progress on the Indian budget caused particularly sharp falls in these markets. Hong Kong was a notable exception as a result of accelerating growth in China and strength in real estate prices. Elsewhere, Brazil, Mexico and the eastern European markets achieved positive returns.<P>Stock selection continued to contribute positively to Fund performance in the third quarter, albeit at a slower rate than in the first half of the year. Country selection was slightly negative - the positive contribution from the underweighting in Japan was more than offset by the negative impact of the underweighting in the UK, which rebounded sharply, and the overweighting in emerging markets, which lost most of their earlier gains. The contribution to relative performance from currency hedging was neutral over the quarter.<P>Our view of the global economic outlook is based on the assumption that growth in the U.S. will remain robust. Country weightings in the portfolio were largely unchanged in the quarter. We reduced the weighting in continental Europe slightly and increased the UK and Australia. The portfolio is strategically overweight in the emerging markets with the best return prospects in Korea, Thailand, Brazil and Argentina. The currency hedge on the yen was eliminated during the quarter.

<h5>Summer 1995 - Volume Two - Number Three</h5>

<H2>How to tell whether timesharing is for you</H2>

<P>On your last vacation, you may have been approached by a company selling timeshares -- the right to 
spend one or two weeks every year at the same resort. Perhaps you even attended a sales presentation. But is timeshare ownership a good idea?

<P>For some people, timesharing can indeed be a good vacation choice. You can obtain high-quality accommodation and facilities at minimum cost - far less than you would pay for an outright purchase. And your cost is locked in at today's prices. Usually you can &quot;trade&quot; your rights for other timeshares anywhere in the world.

<P>There are several varieties of timesharing: <ul>
<li>Right to use or long-term lease timesharing, the most
common arrangement, is like a prepaid hotel booking for a number of years. You don't own the property, and when your contract expires, the right reverts to the developer. 
<li>Fee-simple ownership is a 
real-estate transaction. You get a deed for your share, which you own and can bequeath in your will.
<li>Clubs are similar to timeshares, but rather than buying into a 
single resort, club members are offered a variety of locations to choose from each year. </ul>

<P><B>Know what you're getting into </B><br>
It's extremely important to investigate before you buy. While 
most timeshare organizations are reputable, the absence of regulatory protection in many regions 
(the U.S. now has extensive timeshare legislation) means that &quot;buyer beware&quot; applies. 

<P>By the same token, you should be aware of the various fees and added costs that might apply. 

<P>For example, trading is easy if you buy into a resort that's part 
of an international timeshare ex-change organization. But you have to pay an extra fee, and you may have to arrange your trade many months in advance.

<P>While timesharing freezes your vacation accommodation costs, it doesn't protect you from increases in transportation, financing, and maintenance costs. Maintenance typically costs $200 to $500 a year, and may increase with inflation. Also, you may be assessed periodically for refurbishment. 

<P><B>Take your time</B><br>
Never let yourself be rushed into making a decision.

<P>Remember, if you really want to make this purchase, you'll want it just as much when you get home from your current holiday.

<P>If possible, rent the property for a week or two, and talk to other timeshare owners. Compare the property with its competitors.

<P>You might even consider a resale unit through a 
private sale-these are relatively inexpensive, because the price usually does not include the substantial sales fee that applies 
to new units.

<P>As with any major purchase, you must take the time to ensure you know exactly what you are getting. That way, you can be sure that your dream vacation will be just as you envision.

Market Update
</H2>

<P>The Fund returned 5.7% over the third quarter of 1996. The Canadian equity component provided significant added value, returning 7.2% compared with 5.4% for the TSE 300 Total Return Index. The U.S. equity component declined 2.3% compared with the S&P 500 Total Return Index (in Canadian dollars), which returned 2.8% for the quarter. However, only 5.5% of the portfolio is currently held in U.S. equities.<P>The TSE is being propelled by strengthening economic trends, robust corporate profits, and a stable Canadian dollar, which is attracting more foreign investors. Interest-sensitive groups continued to lead the market, reflecting the substantial decline in short-term interest rates, improving loan quality and the ongoing shift of savings into mutual funds. Financial services was the top-performing group, returning 15.74% in the third quarter and 27.62% year-to-date. Utilities rose 6.96% in the quarter and 20.59% year-to-date.<P>The resource sector was very mixed. Metals & minerals was the worst performer in the quarter, declining 2.19%, while gold & precious minerals was unchanged. Both groups, after very strong performance in January, are showing only minor increases for the year-to-date. Oil & gas stocks have been the top performers in the resource sector, returning 8.02% in the quarter and 17.81% year-to-date, reflecting strong energy markets, and active exploration and development programs.<P>The U.S. market continued to rise despite more signs that valuation levels have become stretched. Profit growth is slowing. The benefits of corporate restructuring have largely been realized, and the higher U.S. dollar is attracting more competition, particularly from the Japanese. Further market advances will likely depend on a decline in interest rates.<P>In the third quarter, the Fund benefited from overweighted positions in the oil & gas, consumer products, industrial products and merchandising sectors as well as an underweighted position in metals & minerals. Performance was negatively impacted by underweightings in utilities, pipelines and conglomerates. Security selection within the oil & gas, consumer products and financial services sectors contributed positively to performance.<P>We expect the environment for Canadian equities to remain positive over at least the next year. We believe that the Fund is well positioned in the most attractive areas, with a well-diversified portfolio emphasizing the mid- and small-cap leaders in the market. Our research focus has shifted more to domestically-oriented smaller capitalization companies that will likely be prime beneficiaries of the stronger Canadian economy, particularly in Alberta and Ontario. We believe that the U.S. market will consolidate over the next several quarters and continue to decrease the U.S. equity portion of the Fund in favour of Canadian equities.

Market Update
</H2>

<P>The Fund continues to outperform the TSE resource sectors with a year-to-date return of 35.5%. Year-to-date, the TSE oil & gas sector was up 17.81%; gold & precious minerals rose 6.60%; metals & minerals was up 2.62%; and paper & forest products declined 1.32%. In the third quarter, the Fund advanced 12.5% compared with oil & gas up 8.02%; paper & forest products down 0.29%; metals & minerals down 2.19%; and gold & precious minerals flat.<P>Fund performance is attributable to some of the larger individual holdings and to the strength in the oil & gas sector. The Fund has reduced some of its exposure to the gold sector, but continues to hold a sizeable position in Barrick Gold in order to retain an ownership interest in the Pierina gold-silver property (which was acquired through the purchase of Arequipa Resources).<P>We remain market-weighted in paper & forest products because of the attractive valuations in the sector. In base metals, the Fund is selectively increasing its exposure, taking advantage of some seasonal weakness. Because the sector is generally not as cheap as the paper & forest products group, we are taking a stock-picking approach. With continued global economic growth and limited production increases, selected base metals stocks should perform well in the medium term.<P>For both oil and gas, demand has been strong as economic growth, particularly in Asia and North America, has fuelled consumption. Oil prices remain strong at US$24 per barrel, whereas natural gas pricing is more subdued due to moderate weather in the U.S. The outlook over the medium term for both commodities is good. Although equity valuations are still reasonable, the Fund has been selectively reducing exposure to the sector in light of traditional seasonal weakness in the late fall.<P>The Fund continues to invest in companies with good management and strong resource bases. At various times, certain sectors will be emphasized, reflecting our outlook for commodity prices, seasonal factors and relative valuations.

Market Update
</H2>

<P>Ongoing speculation on the timing of U.S. interest rate hikes continued to distract emerging market investors during the third quarter of 1996. Even though the markets have discounted a tightening of U.S. monetary policy, and there have been major structural changes in the markets, a repeat of the 1994 rate hike scenario is feared. The Fund underperformed the benchmark due to an overweight position in India and an underweight position in Malaysia.<P>Performance in the Latin American markets during the quarter reflected divergent economic conditions. The Mexican market was up 1.8% as increased confidence in Mexico's economic recovery has led to large capital inflows, pushing up the peso and easing interest rates. In contrast, Argentina is still feeling the effects of last year's recession with depressed growth prospects pushing the market down 7.5% for the quarter. The Brazilian market, the Fund's largest country allocation, was up 2.3%. Brazil's anti-inflation program has demonstrated continued success - interest rates have been lowered and yearly inflation is moving into single digits.<P>In Korea, the contraction of exports and the growing current account deficit have unnerved the markets. Although investors welcomed the announcement that the government raised the limit on foreign stock ownership, the market was down 9.8%. We are currently using the weakness as a buying opportunity. Thailand's market was hurt by a combination of a general economic slowdown, poor export growth and political turmoil. We remain underweight in Thailand, where the market fell 13.5%. Taiwan's economic recovery has been slower than expected. The market fell 2.0% during the quarter as the government eased monetary policy. By contrast, Malaysia had the only positive return in the region, up 0.4%.<P>The Indian market fell during the quarter, due in part to the political uncertainty surrounding the investigation of conspiracy charges against a former prime minister. In Turkey, government statements asserting that next year's budget would balance and privatization would continue, helped push the market up in September, but returns for the quarter were negative in dollar terms.<P>

Market Update
</H2>

<P>All the world's major bond markets produced positive returns in the third quarter, both in local currency and Canadian dollar terms.<P>Australia was the best-performing market, with Canada among the top performers. In both cases, sluggish economic activity, moderate inflation and improving government fiscal positions allowed authorities to ease monetary policy. In Canada, this has been a year-long phenomenon, which has led to the Canadian bond market outperforming its U.S. counterpart. In Australia, these developments are more recent and have caught many in the market by surprise; hence the sharp rally seen this quarter. The Fund added to its Australian market position during the period.<P>Many of these same economic and policy trends also have been driving European bond markets, which produced good returns during the quarter. Plans to form a common European currency in 1999 have also been a positive factor. In the main European markets, such as Germany and France, faster economic growth is needed to help cut government deficits. To encourage growth, the German central bank found room to cut money market rates again in late August.<P>Both Italy and Spain have shown new determination to join in the common currency at the earliest possible date by proposing larger-than expected cuts in government deficits. This led their bond markets to post especially strong gains, outperforming most other European markets by a wide margin. As these trends became evident, the Fund added to European bond positions, placing particular emphasis on Italy, Spain and Sweden, all of which performed well during the period.<P>The U.S. and Japan were the worst performing major markets during the quarter. Yields in the U.S. have continued to trade around the 7% level. Economic data has remained on the firm side and tightness in the labour market is raising concerns about inflation. The Fund added to its U.S. position as yields rose above 7% on the long bond, but scaled back once they returned below this level. In Japan, the market sold off sharply in July on signs of stronger economic data, but rallied strongly in August on signs of new weakness. With the yen also weak in the quarter, Japan was the worst-performing major market in Canadian dollars. Japan's economic picture remains cloudy, and the Fund continues to have relatively small exposure to this market.<P>The strength of the Canadian and U.S. dollars against the yen and many European currencies reduced returns during the quarter, although successful currency hedging moderated this effect. A firm Canadian currency could continue to detract from returns.<P>

Market Update
</H2>

<P>The U.S. stock market gained 4% during the third quarter of 1996, representing a very strong recovery after the major correction experienced in the summer. The volatile market conditions had been prompted by fears that the U.S. Federal Reserve Board would raise interest rates to slow economic growth and curb the potential build-up of inflation. However, more recent statistics have suggested that the economy is growing steadily, and the Federal Reserve has decided not to raise rates, at least for the moment.<P>By the end of the second quarter, the Japanese stock market had recovered 55% (19% in Canadian dollars) from its level 12 months ago. In the third quarter, however, the momentum was lost and the Japanese market fell by approximately 4% (6% in Canadian dollars). In the short term, the Japanese market could recover modestly, but longer term, we maintain a relatively cautious view and will rely on stock selection rather than market performance to deliver positive investment returns from this region.<P>The UK stock market began the period in an uncertain mood against the background of a highly volatile U.S. stock market, but ended the period in record breaking form, with an overall gain of nearly 5%. Low interest rates and low inflation should prove benign for equities, particularly as the overall valuation of the stock market appears reasonable. Continental Europe is finally showing tentative signs of emerging from recession with a modest pick-up in economic growth promoted by interest rate cuts in a number of countries. We have relatively light positions in Germany and France with heavier relative weightings in Scandinavia, Switzerland and the Netherlands.<P>The emphasis of our emerging market activity remains in Asia rather than Latin America, despite subdued performances in both regions resulting from uncertainty concerning U.S. interest rate trends. Hong Kong appears increasingly attractive, given a recovery in property prices and banking margins, and a relatively modest price/earnings ratio. We believe that the short-term outlook for Asia is somewhat improved and we maintain our considerable long-term enthusiasm.<P>Our overall investment strategy has remained largely unchanged, although recently we slightly increased exposure to Asia at the expense of continental Europe. The Fund's major investment exposure continues to be in North American equities - about 35% of the total - which has continued to add value to the portfolio. The major weighting in the UK has also proved beneficial. Although a smaller investment in Asia would have been better over this particular period, we believe our increased optimism for these markets and our confidence finding stock selection opportunities in Japan justify a continued commitment to this area.<P>Looking at the year ahead, we forecast reasonable but unspectacular returns from the world's equity markets and maintain our long-term confidence in their prospects.<P>

<h5>Summer 1995 - Volume Two - Number Three</h5>

<H2>Spell out investment options in your will</H2>

<P>It may be time you reviewed your will. As a result of a recent court case, many Canadians may need to make minor changes to their wills and trust documents if they want their executor or trustee to invest in mutual funds. 

<P>By way of background, the law places tight restrictions on how executors and trustees may invest money in an estate or trust. This is to protect beneficiaries. 

<P>Unless the will specifies otherwise, the executor can invest 
only in a limited selection of very 
conservative vehicles such as &quot;blue chip&quot; stocks and government bonds, but not mutual funds. 

<P>This recent court decision in Ontario may be viewed as a precedent for other provinces.
Your will should be reviewed 
to ensure that it contains clauses authorizing your executor to 
exercise discretion to purchase among other investments, 
mutual funds. 

<P><B>Will your will be affected?</B><br>
Even if mutual funds aren't appropriate for your estate today, you may want your executors to have that option. In many instances, mutual funds can be an appropriate investment for an estate. The following are just a few examples: <ul>
<li>Money-market funds may offer a better rate of interest than savings accounts. You want your executor to be able to get the best return possible on your estate assets while arranging to distribute them to your beneficiaries.
<li>If your will establishes a trust for your beneficiaries, mutual funds can reduce risk, through diversification, while improving returns.
<li>If a family member or close friend acts as trustee, he or she may lack the time and expertise to monitor a portfolio. </ul>

<P><B>When to review your will</B><br>
It's always advisable to review your will when there's a major change in your life-if you have recently married or had a child, for example. At the very least, you should review your will every two or three years.

<P>In light of the recent court decision, you may want to review your will now, to ensure your executors can invest where they see the most opportunity. Higher returns could mean greater security for those you care about most.

Market Update
</H2>

<P>Mortgage rates fell during the third quarter of 1996, after a stable second quarter. The Fund return for the quarter was 2.56%.<P>The term of the portfolio remained relatively stable during the quarter, as all new purchases were made in five year mortgages. This, coupled with the natural rundown of the portfolio, kept the term at 2 years. The Fund's mortgage weighting was maintained at over 90% throughout the quarter with the balance invested in short-term bonds and cash equivalent investments.<P>The target term of the portfolio is 2.5 to 3 years. We feel the Fund can benefit from higher yields that a slightly longer term view provides, with minimal incremental risk. The Fund will attempt to increase the term from two years during the next quarter if cash flow permits and availability of five year mortgages increase.<P>The lowering of global interest rates in the past year has stimulated economic growth. Global economies are experiencing the benefit of stable, low interest rates. We feel that North American economies have troughed and economic recovery in the balance of 1996 and through 1997 will be positive, with both Canada and U.S. expanding. Canada's fiscal position is improving at a tremendous pace. We strongly encourage investors to pay close attention to this, as it will bring tremendous benefits for Canadians. One benefit for fixed income investors will be a narrowing of spreads between Canada and U.S. rates. Good economic fundamentals led by low inflation continues to bode well for investors.<P>

Market Update
</H2>

<P>European markets rallied in the third quarter of 1996 after a setback in July, ending up 3.8% overall. The recovery was largely due to a rally in bond markets as investors became more sanguine over the prospect for U.S. interest rates. Indeed, there were spectacular gains in the Italian and Spanish bond markets as short rates fell and the differential with German yields narrowed. The Bundesbank cut its repo rate by more than expected, which also helped restore confidence.<P>The problem in Europe is that while monetary policy has eased, fiscal policy remains very restrictive as countries seek to fulfil Maastrict criteria. The impact has been very deflationary, and the question remains whether the pick-up in economic growth will be sustainable when it begins. Against this background, the markets that behaved best were Finland, up 13.69% as Nokia recovered; Sweden up 6.5% and the UK up 8.1%. Despite the rally in bonds, the Italian equity market was weak, falling 2.3% as exporters fell on a strengthening lire. The Fund's main overweightings were in the Netherlands, Italy and Spain. Underweight were Scandinavia, other than Sweden, and the UK.<P>While there may be doubts over the pace of economic activity in Europe, this does create an environment in which rates are more likely to fall or stay stable than to rise. While companies will have to struggle with falling prices, this does not mean that profitability cannot improve. Increasingly, companies in Europe have become more aware of the concept of shareholder value. This, for example, has been behind the 40% rise in the price of German chemical stocks this year.<P>Having repaid debt, European companies are also flush with cash, which has led to a sharp rise in corporate activity. For example, one Fund holding is Autoliv, the seat belt and airbag manufacturer, which merged with Morton of the U.S. airbag division, resulting in a 30% rise in the share price.<P>Overall, the outlook for Europe still appears promising despite the good returns already seen this year with markets such as Italy and Spain looking exceptionally cheap on price cashflows of around 4.5. The Fund continues to have a heavy weighting in chemicals and pharmaceutical stocks, but has increasingly shifted toward manufacturing companies, especially in the UK.<P>

Market Update
</H2>

<P>The Canadian economy appears to have grown at a reasonable pace during the quarter, with inflation remaining benign. The Canadian dollar started to show signs of strength, as economic data slowly became stronger. The Bank of Canada has dropped the overnight lending rates by a full percent over the last three months. Canadian short-term rates remained decidedly below U.S. rates.<P>Our analysis points to stronger growth in Canada during the remainder of 1996. We believe that Canadian growth will be above consensus estimates. Moreover, Canada's fiscal position continues to improve and the government is on track to surpass its deficit targets. Our outlook for the Canadian dollar remains positive. Our growing merchandise trade surplus along with a strong commodity market continue to support a strong currency.<P>In conclusion, the stronger Canadian dollar will support a lower rate environment and the Bank of Canada should remain accommodative into the next quarter. The result of our changing fiscal position has positive implications for the amount of Canadian debt that will remain outstanding or be issued. We view this supply issue as a major determinant of short rates and their stability. As a result, the Fund has increased term to a more aggressive stance from the previous quarter.<P>The Fund's return for the three months ending Sept. 30, 1996 was 1.07%. The yield on the Fund fell from previous quarters as high yielding product matured and was reinvested at lower rates. The Fund will continue to invest in commercial paper and high yielding corporate bonds to enhance yield.<P>

Market Update

<P>The Fund returned first-quartile performance of 6.72% during the third quarter of 1996, outperforming the 5.40% return of the TSE 300 Total Return Index before adjusting for Fund expenses.<P>Fund performance has benefited from lower interest rates. The Fund is skewed toward higher yielding common shares, particularly bank stocks, which outperformed other sectors of the TSE during the quarter. Over two-thirds of the Fund's portfolio is invested in higher yielding stocks.<P>We anticipate that investors will continue to place more of their investment dollars in high-yielding common shares such as those held by the Fund, rather than in low-yielding GICs and money market deposits. The dividend yield on pipeline and utility shares is, in some cases, close to or higher than preferred share yields, an anomaly that is expected to correct over time. As well, banks are expected to continue increasing their dividends and repurchasing capital to the benefit of the financial services sector and Fund unitholders.<P>The Fund continues to offer a lower-risk alternative to general market or sector funds, and we expect the Fund will have a good return for 1996.<P>

<h5>Winter 1995 - Volume Two - Number One</h5>

<H2>Growth to continue through '95</H2>

<p>Economic growth in Canada this past year has been the most rapid
since 1988. Real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) increased an
estimated 4% - a higher rate than in the U.S., Japan, or any of
the major Western European economies. The higher interest rates
we have seen in 1994 and the additional increases likely 
in 1995 will slow Canadian economic growth next year, as will a
moderation of growth in the United States. Nonetheless, 
economic growth in Canada will still be about 3.5% in 1995.

<H3>Interest rate outlook</H3>

<p>We probably have not seen the end of interest rate increases.
There is still a threat of inflationary pressures in the United
States, which the U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to contain by
raising short-term interest rates at least another 50 to 100
basis points (half to a full percentage point) over the next
three to six months.

<p>Short-term rates in Canada will move up at least 50 to 100 basis
points. Investors will require an extra risk premium to
compensate for high government debt levels, 
continuing budget deficits, and the uncertainty generated by the
forthcoming Quebec Referendum.

<p>By late 1995, most or all of the factors contributing to upward
pressures on interest rates should have dissipated, permitting 
interest rates to decline.

<H3>The corporate outlook</H3>

<p>Corporate profits continue to reverse the declines experienced
in the last recession. Pre-tax corporate profits rose by an
estimated 40% in 1994, and this year they are expected to recover
to pre-recession levels. After-tax profits are rising even more
rapidly, as corporations take advantage of tax loss carry forwards
accumulated during the recession.

<H3>Consumer spending</H3>

<p>Encouraged by improved employment prospects, consumers spent
more in 1994. Consumer spending still isn't growing as rapidly as
it did in the mid-to-late 1980s, and it isn't expected to do so
soon. In the short term, higher interest rates will restrain
spending on 
big-ticket items such as houses 
and motor vehicles. But Canadian consumers will continue to 
increase their spending rapidly enough to contribute to Canadian
economic growth.

<h5>Winter 1995 - Volume Two - Number One</h5>

<H2>Looking beyond market anxiety</H2>

<p>Canadian investors could be forgiven for wishing they'd kept their
savings under a mattress throughout the final quarter of 1994.
Markets worldwide moved erratically and generally downward. What
caused this anxiety and what does it mean for the new year
ahead?

<H3>The source of concern</H3>

<p>Investors' prime focus in 1994 was the direction of U.S. inflation
and interest rates. Since early February, interest rates have
risen and markets slumped in anticipation of more of the same.

<p>Ironically, these moves were in reaction to good news: economic
growth in the U.S. and Canada was brisk, unemployment fell, and
more plants and equipment were being utilized. All this
&quot;good&quot; news aroused fears that the U.S. economy might
be growing too strongly, and could result in inflation. That, in
turn, would cause sharply higher interest rates and weak bond and
stock markets.

<p>To forestall these events, the U.S. Federal Reserve Board raised
interest rates - and investors' anxiety levels. Fortunately,
fears of inflation seem to be abating.

<p>Here is a brief review:
<ul>
<li>Inflation: While North American inflation rates have hit their
lows for this economic cycle and will probably edge higher,
prices will not rise dramatically. 

<p>First, global competitive pressures should continue to dampen
inflation. Second, the money supply has been growing slowly in
both Canada and the U.S. Third, leading indicators do not point
to an upsurge in inflation - the price of gold has been static,
while the Commodity Research Bureau price index has scarcely
budged.<p>

<li>Interest rates: Short-term interest rates, such as Treasury
bills and the prime rate, will rise further as a strengthening
economy increases the demand for credit.

<p>Longer-term interest rates, such as those of the 30-year
bench-mark bonds, probably will not exceed current levels. In
this lacklustre bond market, TD Trust will focus on high-quality
corporate issues and short-term and medium-term provincial bonds
to maximize income while minimizing volatility.<p>

<li>Equities: North American stock markets are now in a tug of war
between rising corporate earnings and higher interest rates. 

<p>Since we believe that the recovery in profits will continue
through 1996 and fears of surging inflation will ebb, stocks
should gain strength in 1995. We 
continue to believe that Canadian stocks generally offer better
value than U.S. issues.<p>

<li>International markets: Overseas, Japan seems likely to be the
top performer. Among emerging markets, Brazil and Mexico show
upside potential.
</ul>

<p>Taking all these factors into consideration, the opening months
of 1995 should help dispel the pessimism that had mounted by the
end of 1994.

<h5>Fall 1994 - Volume One - Number One</h5>

<H2>Be prepared to head 
south for the winter</H2>

<p>Planning to drive or fly to the 
sunbelt in a month or three? Following is a checklist of
important actions that will help 
you enjoy a worry-free vacation:



<h3>Your home</h3>
<ul>
<li>Give a trusted individual a key 
to your house and ask him or her to check on it regularly. If you
don't, and if there is an incident that 
leads to a claim against your householder's insurance policy, the
insurer may not be bound to pay. (Check your own policy to be
sure.)
<li>Also ask the person to take in mail and forward it to you.
<li>Cancel newspaper subscriptions.</ul>
<h3>Yourself</h3>
<ul>
<li>Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance. An
out-of-country accident or illness can be very costly if you're
not covered.</ul>
<h3>Your estate</h3>
<ul><li>Make sure that your will is 
up-to-date and that your executor has a copy of it.
<li>If you have not already done so, give someone you trust power
of attorney over your affairs. This is not an action only for
older people - younger individuals can also 
suffer an accident or illness that temporarily renders them
incapable of managing their own affairs.</ul>
<h3>Your finances</h3>
<ul><li>Consider employing TD Trust's Investment Administration 
service to look after your affairs 
in your absence. You still make 
the investment decisions, but this service handles all the
paperwork involved with collecting interest and dividends, as
well as securities safekeeping, and settlement and recording. If
required, it will also pay taxes, 
and any other specified bills.
<li>If you don't feel comfortable making decisions at a distance,
consider 
TD Trust's Investment Management service. Your portfolio will be
managed by an investment professional, who is constantly
monitoring market conditions and adjusting your portfolio given
market and economic factors.
</ul>

<H3>Your tax liability</H3>

<ul><p>If you spend a significant part of the year down south and are
deemed a U.S. resident as a result, you may be liable for
taxation by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service.

<p>To find out whether you might be affected, count the number of
days you will be in the U.S. in the current year, and add
one-third of the number of days you were there last year and
one-sixth of the number of days you were there in the year before
that. If the total equals or exceeds 183 days, and you are
present in the U.S. at least 31 days during the current year,
you're considered a U.S. resident for tax purposes. 

<p>If you are liable for U.S. tax, you may be able to get an
exemption by filing a &quot;closer connection&quot; statement
with the IRS. This statement will demonstrate that you have
closer ties to Canada than to the U.S. It might, 
for instance, show that you maintain a permanent home in Canada,
that you deal regularly with a Canadian financial institution,
and that you possess a Canadian passport and 
driving licence.</ul>

<p>Enjoy your vacation!

<h1>Bu$inessmatters Winter 1994</h1> <h2>News and Information for TD Bank's
Commercial Customers</h2>

<br> <h1>How you can make your business bankable</h1> <I>by Al Title, Partner,
Orenstein & Partners </I> <p> If you are planning to buy, start or expand a
business, chances are at least part of your funding will come from a bank. Banks
are still the most common source of ongoing financing for independent businesses
in this country. <p> <I>Are small businesses treated differently than large
corporations? "Some people think that large corporations get preferential
treatment," says Al Cotton, Vice President, Independent Business. "But we apply
the same lending criteria. Unfortunately, when a big loan goes bad, it gets a lot
of press coverage; people assume the banks are just throwing their money away.
The fact is, we have done our due diligence. We just can't predict the
unpredictable."</I> <p> Banks have to lend money to make money. In fact, they are
generally as keen to lend money as you are to borrow it. So why would they deny a
loan application that you think should be approved? <p> <I>Probably because the
business isn't bankable. </I> <p> Too often, entrepreneurs go to the bank to
secure financing to solve problems. But financing is not intended to correct
flaws in business strategy or management expertise; financing is intended to
contribute to the success of a business and make it stronger. <p> So, if you have
a weak business, you can't look to a bank to support it. Before you search for
financing, refocus your energy to create a business that is built upon sound
business strategies and operated with maximum efficiency and effectiveness. Here
are some of the factors that will ensure that your banker looks positively on
your loan proposal: <p> <B>1. A sound business plan</B> that clearly defines your
goals and objectives. It should include specific strategies for creating a
competitive advantage, taking into account market trends, the company's strengths
and weaknesses, and the competition. <p> <B>2. An appropriate level of working
capital</B> its delicate balance dictates the timing and amount of financing
required. Are small businesses treated differently than large corporations? "Some
people think that large corporations get preferential treatment," says Al Cotton,
Vice President, Independent Business. "But we apply the same lending criteria.
Unfortunately, when a big loan goes bad, it gets a lot of press coverage   people
assume the banks are just throwing their money away. The fact is, we have done
our due diligence. We just can't predict the unpredictable." <p> <B>3. Your
critical, objective evaluation of the bankability of your business</B>   Is your
company an appropriate candidate for financing? Are the elements for future
success in place? Your company may have operating losses, or insufficient working
capital and equity to justify a loan, overly optimistic expansion plans,
inadequate profit trends and margins, or a poorly focused business strategy.
These obstacles must be dealt with. Your primary goal must be to make your
company successful in its own right. By doing this, you will have an opportunity
to secure the bank financing you're after. <p> While your banker is responsible
for helping your business become more successful, you must take responsibility
for giving your banker a success to work with. Only then can you create  
<I>together</I>   a thriving business for the long-term. <p> <I>Al Title, C.A, is
a Partner at Orenstein & Partners, a Toronto-based firm of chartered accountants.
Established in 1926, Orenstein & Partners, with its network of international
affiliates, provides a broad range of accounting and consulting services to
clients in many areas of business.</I> <p> <hr> <h1>Information on your business
bank account any time of the day   or night</h1>

<I>It's 3:00 pm on a Sunday afternoon. You need to know whether your operating
line is at its limit. On Tuesday evening, a meeting runs late and you can't get
to the bank to transfer funds into your payroll account. With TD Business
Bankline, fast, convenient solutions are just a phone call away! </I> <p>

<h2>Designed with business needs in mind</h2>

"TD Business Bankline gives customers access to important information on their
bank accounts and operating loans, 24 hours a day, seven days a week," explains
Royden Ritz, Group Product Manager, Commercial Banking. "It also lets them pay
suppliers and utility bills, and transfer funds between accounts." Even
businesses with rotary telephones can use TD Business Bankline. "For customers
with a touchtone phone, the system is completely automated. But there's also a
personal interface that extends the service to customers with rotary dial
phones," says Ritz.


<h2>Rave reviews</h2>

To date, the service is receiving rave reviews. In Kingston, Ontario, Klean-Brite
Cleaners uses TD Business Bankline daily. According to Secretary-Treasurer
Beverly Biggs, "It lets me check the status of our accounts quickly and
efficiently, whenever I need to. It's a service that really makes sense." And at
Kingston-based Manova Products, a manufacturer of seasonal outdoor products,
secretary Cathy Mayne finds TD Business Bankline very handy at month-end. "One
call gives me all my account entries, which I can enter into my computer and
close out the month. And I can pay utility bills in minutes. It's great!" <p> If
you'd like more information on TD Business Bankline, use the FAXBack service:
<br>FAXBack: 416-982-4356 <hr> <h1>A great idea just got better!</h1>

<h2>TD Business Planner Coming soon on disk</h2>

TD Business Planner is a comprehensive, easy-to-use financial planning guide that
simplifies the planning process   and helps increase the chance that your loan
application will be approved. TD Business Planner will soon be available on
computer disk. "It's the first of its kind," says Royden Ritz, Group Product
Manager, Commercial Banking. "Many clients will find it very useful for analyzing
information and developing a professional looking presentation."


<h2>A host of valuable features </h2> This DOS-based program will include an
on-screen calculator and glossary of financial terms, an integrated spreadsheet
and print preview to allow customers to view the forms they have created. "TD
Business Planner software can help clients prepare a professional business plan,
incorporating financial statements, pertinent details about their business, and
the environment in which they operate," explains Ritz. "And with HP LaserJet and
Postscript support, documents will print on virtually any printer." <p> To obtain

<hr> <h1>Economic Outlook</h1> <h2>We're moving in the right direction!</h2>
<I>by Peter Drake, Vice President, Economic Research, TD Bank</I>

With the federal election out of the way, a major source of uncertainty has been
removed from the Canadian economic and financial outlook. Still, some questions
remain. How will the economic policies of the new government change from those of
recent years?  How will the newly-elected regional interests in the House of
Commons affect government policies?  How will political events in Quebec unfold?
<p> Some things are clear. With the federal deficit in the current fiscal year
running several billion dollars above its original forecast, the new federal
government has little room to manoeuver as it attempts to speed up growth in the
Canadian economy. Any new federal programs will have to be funded from existing
ones. Interest rates must be kept as low as possible in order to help stimulate
economic growth   but financial markets, and especially the Canadian dollar, will
be subject to some volatility in the months ahead. <p> Meanwhile, economic data
will continue to reinforce the trends of the past few months   more sectors of
the economy are showing improvement. Throughout 1994, economic growth will
continue to be slow compared with past economic recoveries, and the national
unemployment rate will remain high.  But the economy is moving in the right
direction, and we expect Canadian economic growth to exceed 3 per cent this year 
 the best economic performance since 1988.


<h2>Freeze on current account charges extended</h2>

Things are getting better, but our economy isn't out of the woods yet. As a
result, we've decided to extend the freeze originally announced in September,
1993. That means service charges will remain as outlined in our Current Account
Service Charges brochure, dated December 1, 1991. If you have a question about
your monthly current account service charges, please contact your TD Account
Manager. <p> <hr> <h1>TD GreenPlan Credit Insurance</h1> <h2>Peace-of-mind for
independent business </h2>

You've put it all on the line. And TD Bank financing is helping to make your
business dreams come true. But what would happen in the event of your untimely
death? Would your business continue? Would your estate be protected? With TD
GreenPlan Credit Insurance, the answer is "Yes!". You can apply for credit
insurance of up to $1,000,000 (as long as it doesn't exceed total eligible
borrowings) at competitive rates. In fact, applying for coverage of up to
$300,000 can be as simple as completing a brief health questionnaire. <p> NEW!
The 'Increase Option' from TD GreenPlan Credit Insurance. For the first time,
insured business owners can increase their coverage by up to $25,000 in each
calendar year, without proof of medical insurability. <p> To obtain further
information on TD GreenPlan Credit Insurance, you can use our FAXBack service at:

<P>Today, credit cards are a very secure way of purchasing the goods and services
you need. With the use of holograms and other technical devices, forgery is
becoming increasingly difficult. And if your card is lost or stolen, a phone call
is all it takes to stop unauthorized use of your card and to get it replaced.

<h1>Bu$inessmatters July 1993</h1>


<h2>News and Information for TD Bank's Commercial Customers
</h2>
<br>
<h1>From The Editor: For our commercial customers</h1>

Welcome to the premier issue of Business Matters, a new semi-annual newsletter specifically for TD Bank's commercial customers. Developing a publication that will appeal to a diverse group of customers is no small task. Fortunately, our customers have two things in common; a desire for high quality products and service, and an interest in sound financial advice. Accordingly, each issue of Business Matters will bring you information about new products and service initiatives. Plus articles designed to keep you informed and help you manage more effectively. 

<hr>
<h1>Cash management TD-style</h1>

In today's business environment, effective cash management is critical to a company's growth and prosperity. TD Bank's electronic gateway, Business Window, is allowing business customers to access a comprehensive range of cash management products from the convenience of their own office. "It's an easy-to-use, menu-driven system that can access a wide range of PC-based electronic banking services," says Nancy d'Agincourt, Manager, Commercial Cash Management Services. 


<h2>Window of opportunity</h2>

One of these services is <b>TD Money Monitor</b>."This makes it possible for customers to get up-to-date account and loan information; things like closing balances, account activity, deposit transfer details," explains d'Agincourt. "Plus, they can print a statement right in their own office." With <B>Transfer Services</B>, customers can deposit cheques or cash in a local Branch, and have the amounts electronically transferred to their commercial account in another Branch. According to d'Agincourt, "This can give customers same-day access to their money." Another service, <B>RapidWire</B>,  enables customers to make fast and accurate payments worldwide. "Smaller companies that regularly pay salespeople or suppliers located outside Canada find this service very useful," says d'Agincourt.

<h1>Taking care of business with the new TD Business Visa Card</h1>

<I>The TD's Visa Card family meets the needs of business people on the go!</I>

"We asked business people what they were looking for in a business card," says Steve Phillips, Product Manager. "Their feedback helped us develop the most feature-packed business card on the market." TD Business Visa Card provides detailed monthly management reports. "This is a key benefit for businesses," explains Phillips. "These reports consolidate the monthly transactions for all Cardholders so they can see who spent what, where and when." Add to these reports easy access to Automated Banking Machines and Cash Advances, the wide acceptance of Visa and a host of other benefits, and it's no wonder TD  Business Visa Card has met with such an enthusiastic response.

<CENTER><H1>Report On Provincial <BR>Government Finances</H1></CENTER>
<CENTER><B>August 1995</B></CENTER>

<H2>Deficits and Debt in Perspective</H2>
In sharp contrast to the recession-plagued early 
1990's, healthy economic growth in 1994 presented most 
provincial finance minsters with higher-than-expected 
revenues, enabling them to speed up the 
deficit-elimination process.  The combined deficit of all 
provinces narrowed for the second year in a row, falling 
from $19.8 billion in fiscal 1993-94 to $15.3 billion in the 
fiscal year ended March 31, 1995.  Please see tables; <A HREF="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/library/provincial/table2.html">Fiscal Positions: Surpluses and Deficits</A> ; <A HREF="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/library/provincial/table3.html">Fiscal Positions: Net Public Debt</A>. Two governments achieved balanced 
budgets in fiscal 1994-95 and the tally is expected to rise 
to six in the current fiscal year.  <B>The combined provincial 
deficit is projected to narrow to $13.1 billion in fiscal 
1995-96, which represents a reduction of about 50 per 
cent from the peak reached three years ago.</B>
<P>
Saskatchewan's government stands out as the first 
provincial government since 1990 to report a <B>balanced 
budget</B> and the only one expecting surpluses for both 
fiscal 1994-95 and 1995-96.  Although the Alberta 
government also balanced its budget last year, the 
province is forecasting a deficit this year based on a return 
to more normal (lower) resource revenues.  Other 
provinces planning to record surpluses in the current fiscal 
year include British Columbia, Manitoba, New Brunswick, 
Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland. Absent from the 
balanced-budget list are Ontario, Quebec and Nova 
Scotia.  In fiscal 1994-95, Quebec was the sole province 
whose deficit not only exceeded its target but actually 
widened compared to the previous year.  Although the 
Nova Scotia government announced plans to balance its 
budget by fiscal 1997-98, the governments of Ontario and 
Quebec, whose relative deficits remain high, are at least 
3-4 years away from eliminating their deficits.
<P>
<CENTER><IMG ALIGN=bottom SRC="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/library/provincial/gifs/table3.gif" ALT="Federal and Provincial Fiscal Positions">
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=bottom SRC="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/library/provincial/gifs/graph3.gif" ALT="Provincial Debt-to-GDP Ratios"></CENTER>
<P>
Canadian provinces have traditionally been 
grouped according to their relative prosperity.  The 
wealthier <B>"have" provinces</B> -- Ontario, Alberta and 
British Columbia -- are characterized by per-capita gross 
domestic product (GDP) which is higher than the national 
average.  In the less-prosperous <B>"have-not" provinces</B> 
-- the Atlantic provinces, Quebec, Manitoba and 
Saskatchewan -- per-capita GDP is lower than the 
national average.  In the current environment of 
heightened concerns about provincial government 
finances, provincial governments can be classified 
according to a very different "have/have-not" criterion:  
Have they or have they not achieved a balanced budget?
<P>
 Although provincial governments are at different 
stages on the path to reducing deficits and debt, they will 
face similar challenges in the years ahead.  All provinces 
will have to cope with <B>reductions in</B> <B>federal-provincial 
transfers</B> starting in fiscal 1996-97.  Governments will 
continue to face the risks of weaker- than-anticipated 
economic growth or higher-than-expected interest rates.  
Provinces which have already balanced their budgets and 
set a clear plan for meeting their fiscal targets will be better 
prepared than provinces which are still struggling with 
deficit elimination.   Over the near term, it will be particularly 
important for Ontario and Quebec -- the two provinces 
which currently have the highest relative deficits -- to 
adopt prudent revenue forecasts as well as to provide 
regular updates of their fiscal progress.  
<P>
<B>Provincial net public debt</B> will reach almost $250 
billion in the current fiscal year, double the level recorded 
six years ago.  Although most provinces experienced 
double-digit annual increases in net public debt during the 
past five years, the rate of growth of provincial debt has 
slowed as deficits have narrowed.  The combined 
provincial debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to stabilize at its 
1994-95 level of 32 per cent this year.  Provincial net public 
debt burdens will range from a high of 55 per cent of GDP in 
Newfoundland to a low of 19 per cent of GDP in British 
Columbia in fiscal 1995-96.  Over the next few years, if 
provincial governments adhere to their announced plans 
to balance budgets and retire some debt, the total 
provincial debt-to-GDP ratio should decline moderately.
<P>
Net public debt at the federal level will climb this 
year to $579 billion, or 74 per cent of Canadian GDP, up 
from 73 per cent of GDP in fiscal 1994-95.  <B>The combined 
federal and provincial debt will reach $826 billion this 
fiscal year, representing 106 per cent of GDP, or about 
$28,000 per person.</B>  Assuming that the federal and 
provincial governments' fiscal targets are met, the 
combined federal and provincial debt-to-GDP ratio is 
forecast to edge down gradually starting in fiscal 1996-97. 
<P>
<B>How high is Canada's government debt relative 
to government debt in the other major industrialized 
(G-7) countries?</B>  Total Canadian government debt rose 
from 59 per cent of GDP in 1984 to 95 per cent last year (on 
a national accounts basis).  Canada's debt-to-GDP ratio 
is now almost 25 percentage points higher than the 
average for the G-7 countries, compared to a differential of 
only 7 percentage points as recently as 1984.  The debt 
burden in Canada is currently the second-highest among 
the G-7 countries, behind only Italy.  
<P>
As Canadian government debt mounted during the 
past decade, a large proportion of this debt was purchased 
by non-residents.  <B>In the past five years alone,</B> <B>foreign 
holdings of provincial government and provincial 
government enterprise bonds</B> <B>more than doubled,</B> 
reaching $143 billion by 1994.  Foreign holdings now 
represent 46 per cent of total provincial government and 
enterprise bonds outstanding, up from 30 per cent in 1989.  
The share of foreign holdings at the federal level has 
remained relatively stable, fluctuating between 32 and 36 
per cent over the past five years.

<P>
<IMG ALIGN=bottom SRC="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/library/provincial/gifs/graph5.gif" ALT="Holdings of Canadian Government Bonds"></CENTER>
<P>
<B>Canada's overall net international investment 
position deteriorated significantly in recent years,</B> in 
step with the sharp increase in external borrowing by 
Canadian governments.  Canada's net international 
liabilities -- including public-sector and private-sector 
debt -- amounted to $342 billion in 1994.  Net 
indebtedness to non-residents as a share of Canadian 
GDP has climbed sharply over the past ten years, rising 
from 34 per cent of GDP in 1984 to 46 per cent of GDP in 
1994.  <B>Canada now has by far the highest net foreign 
indebtedness as a share of GDP of any G-7 country.</B>
<P>
The fact that a substantial proportion of government 
debt is held by foreign investors <B>increases the  
vulnerability of Canadian government finances, and 
the Canadian economy as a whole,</B> <B>to the vagaries of 
international financial markets</B>.  Volatility in Canadian 
interest rates and the Canadian dollar could be 
precipitated either by financial market developments 
abroad or by shifts in the sentiment of non-resident 
investors.  Significant increases in Canadian bond yields, 
or sharp changes in the value of the Canadian dollar could 
have a substantial impact on governments' fiscal 
positions. 
<P>
In the current unforgiving fiscal environment, strict 
adherence to stringent deficit/debt reduction targets by the 
federal and provincial governments is necessary.  In recent 
years, escalating debt-service costs have absorbed an 
increasing share of government revenues, leaving 
governments with a smaller proportion of revenues with 
which to fund programs and capital investment.  <B>Only 
when debt-to-GDP ratios decline substantially -- 
permitting a reduction in the share of revenues 
devoted to servicing the debt -- will governments 
have more room to manoeuvre.</B>  At that point, 
governments will have more options, including enhancing 
programs or reducing tax rates,  than they have had in 
recent years.

<A NAME="q2"><H3>2. Cash advances</H3></A>

<P>Bank credit cards allow you to obtain cash advances, up to a prescribed limit.
It's a bit like getting a small personal loan. The most convenient way to get a
cash advance is to use your card at an ABM (Automated Banking Machine) to access your credit card account.
You simply key in the amount of cash advance you require and it will be charged to
your credit card account. Be aware, however, that interest on the cash advance begins to
accrue immediately - there is no grace period - and the interest rate on credit
cards is usually higher than it is for a personal loan.

<P>Some bank credit cards also function as ABM cards, which means that you can
also access your bank accounts through an ABM - an automated banking
machine.  There are more than 100,000 ABMs across Canada, and hundreds of
thousands more around the world.  They are linked by electronic networks -
such as Interac in Canada - which allow you to access your bank account
through use of your bank credit card at any ABM, even one that isn't owned
by your bank.

<h5>Spring 1995 - Volume Two - Number Two</h5>

<H2>Major changes to trust rules</H2>

<P>The 1995 federal budget brought down by Finance Minister Paul
Martin late in February introduced two significant changes to the
rules governing family trusts. These changes could have an impact
on your tax planning. 

<P>The new rules apply to the 
preferred-beneficiary election and the 21-year rule election.
<ul>
<li>The preferred-beneficiary election will be eliminated for most
trusts starting after 1995.

<P>This election had two main advantages. First, it allowed income
from the trust to be taxed in the hands of low-income
beneficiaries, such as children or dependent senior citizens. 

<P>The second advantage was that income from the trust did not have
to be paid out to the beneficiary. This allowed the assets to
remain under the trustee's control.

<P>It is important to note that while the preferred-beneficiary
election can no longer be applied to children or dependent senior
citizens, you can still use the election for those individuals
who are entitled to the tax credit because they are mentally or 
physically challenged.

<p><li>The 21-year rule election will be repealed effective January
1, 1999. The 21-year rule means that trusts generally have a
deemed disposition of capital property after 21 years. The trusts
then pay capital gains taxes.

<P>Previously, the 21-year rule election allowed the deferral of the
21-year deemed disposition until the death of the last
&quot;exempt beneficiary.&quot; (An exempt beneficiary is a
family member who is not more than one generation removed from
the person who set up the trust.)

<P>Under the new rules, trusts that used the special election to
defer capital gains will now have a deemed disposition of trust
property on January 1, 1999. 
</ul>

<P>We recommend that before you take any action regarding these rule
changes, you consult a legal or tax professional with expertise
in the area of trusts.

<h5>Summer 1995 - Volume Two - Number Three</h5>

<H2>Guarding against our fluctuating dollar</H2>

<P>Financial headlines lately have been dominated by currency exchange rate 
turbulence. This affects 
you even if you rarely spend time abroad. If our dollar is weak against other currencies, interest rates are likely to rise, as are prices for produce, imported electronics, and automobiles. 

<P>Some key factors have contributed to the recent currency 
turmoil:<ul>
<li>International investors have been selling off holdings in countries with large deficits and debts (including Canada and the U.S.).
<li>The devaluation of the Mexican peso last December alarmed international investors, prompting them to sell North American currencies.
<li>Computerization has enabled speculators to trade large sums quickly, altering exchange rates. </ul>

<P><B>How to protect yourself </B><br>
Diversification is the key to 
protecting your investments from 
currency fluctuations. 

<P>If your portfolio holds only Canadian-dollar investments, you are vulnerable to weakness in the currency. That's why TD Trust usually recommends 25% to 33% of a typical non-registered portfolio be invested internationally. (Foreign content in RRSPs or RRIFs is limited to 20%.)

<P><P>You can divide foreign-currency holdings into three categories: <ul>
<li>U.S. equities or U.S. equity mutual funds. These offer a hedge against declines in our dollar, and exposure to industries not well represented in Canadian markets. 
<li>Global bonds. These include bonds issued by foreign governments in their currencies, Canadian bonds denominated in foreign currencies, and Eurobonds (foreign-currency bonds sold to investors outside the country of issue).
<li>Non-North American equities. Allocating a small portion of your portfolio to stocks from Europe and the Far East allows you to participate in overseas grow</ul>

<P>Your investment mix will be dictated by your personal circumstances. TD Trust offers personalized investment management for your portfolio at competitive rates.

<P>An attractive route for investors with smaller portfolios is the TD Trust Fund Navigator service, which allocates your investments among an appropriate group of the Green Line Family of No-Load Mutual Funds. 

<P>For more information, <A HREF="mailto:greeninfoline@tdbank.ca">e-mail us</a> (<A HREF="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/mail.htm">Click here to view E-Mail Notice</A>) or contact TD Trust through any TD branch, or call 1-800-26-TRUST (1-800-268-7878).

administrative costs and the costs of providing
additional benefits. The amount of the annual fee varies. With basic cards it's
as low as $12 and goes up to $100 or more for gold and other premium cards.

<P>Some credit cards include <A HREF="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/Creditctr/prodinfo/tdbeneft/purchins.html">purchase insurance</A> as a standard feature.
The insurance typically covers theft and damage to products you purchased
using your credit card. The insurance carrier will reimburse you for all or part
of your loss. In most cases, the insurance coverage is limited to a period of
time - 90 days, for example - and has certain exclusions, such as not covering
items stolen from your car. If purchase insurance is important to you, be sure to
check the details as it relates to your particular credit card.

<CENTER><H1>Report On Provincial <BR>Government Finances</H1></CENTER>
<CENTER><B>August 1995</B></CENTER>

<H2>Revenues and Expenditures</H2>
<B>The combined deficit of all provinces is forecast 
to narrow for the third year in a row in fiscal 1995-96</B>, 
as total provincial revenue growth of 2.4 per cent 
surpasses modest expenditure growth of 0.8 per cent. 
Please see tables: <A HREF="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/library/provincial/table1.html">Revenues and Expenditures</A>.  Although few new 
expenditure-restraint measures were announced in the 
1995 provincial budgets, most provincial governments 
continue to implement cost-containment programs 
initiated in recent years.  With the exception of Quebec, all 
provinces shied away from increasing major tax rates, and 
several provinces introduced minor tax-reduction 
measures. 
<P>
<B>Consolidated revenues</B> are projected to rise in 
seven provinces in fiscal 1995-96, with growth ranging 
from 7.0 per cent in Manitoba to 2.5 per cent in New 
Brunswick.  Revenue declines are forecast for Alberta and 
Saskatchewan as a result of a drop in oil and gas 
revenues, while accounting changes will contribute to a 
decline in P.E.I.'s revenues.  Modest tax-reduction efforts 
will continue this year, as corporate income tax rates will 
fall in a number of provinces in the 1995 taxation year.  
Quebec was the only province to impose significant tax 
hikes for businesses, including increases in the capital tax 
and payroll tax rates.
<P>
<CENTER><IMG ALIGN=bottom SRC="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/library/provincial/gifs/table2.gif" ALT="Provincial Tax Rates in 1995"></CENTER>
<P>
<B>Total provincial expenditures</B> will increase this 
year, as rising debt-service costs will more than offset 
reductions in discretionary spending.  Debt-service costs 
now absorb more than 15 per cent of revenues in six 
provinces, and less than 10 per cent of revenues in only 
one province -- British Columbia.  Total spending is 
forecast to decline in Alberta in fiscal 1995-96, as well as in 
three other provinces. (In Prince Edward Island, 
accounting changes will contribute to a reduction in total 
spending.)  British Columbia will record the fastest 
expenditure growth, at 2.9 per cent in fiscal 1995-96.  
Although the Ontario government recently announced a 
broad set of expenditure measures, including cuts to 
social-assistance benefits, capital spending and business 
subsidies, total spending will continue to rise in Ontario in 
fiscal 1995-96, by 1.1 per cent.
<P>
Total provincial revenues, which declined in fiscal 
1991-92, have risen by about 4 per cent per year since 
then, in tandem with a strengthening Canadian economy.  
In contrast to rapid expenditure growth of close to 10 per 
cent per year in the early 1990's, total provincial 
expenditures increased by less than 1 per cent per year in 
fiscal years 1993-94 and 1994-95 and will rise modestly 
again this year.  Given the sharp increases in debt-service 
costs in recent years, cuts in discretionary spending have 
been required to contain the growth in total expenditures.  
Cost-reduction efforts in most provinces have included 
cuts in capital spending, as well as some combination of 
wage freezes, layoffs and unpaid days off for public-sector 
workers.  <B>Over the medium term, constraints on 
discretionary spending are expected to remain an 
integral part of provincial governments' deficit- and 
debt-reduction efforts.</B>

<h1>Bu$inessmatters Spring/Summer 1995</h1> <h2>News and Information for TD Bank's
Commercial Customers</h2>

<br> <h1>Going global!</h1> 
<h3>Small businesses gear up to meet the unique challenges of world
markets 
</h3><p><EM>Today, over 55 per cent of Canada's manufactured goods are exported to
foreign markets, compared to only 25 per cent in 1980. Between 1993 and 1994
alone, Canadian exports rose a whopping 21.3 per cent! The numbers tell the tale.
More and more Canadian businesses - large and small - are taking advantage of
opportunities to 'go global!'</EM>
<p>In 1994, over 62,000 Canadian companies took
advantage of the world beyond our borders. "Over the past five years, there
has been a real boom in export activity among small and medium sized Canadian
businesses," says Jason Myers, Chief Economist at the Canadian Manufacturers
Association. "The opportunities are many and varied, but so are the
challenges involved in entering new markets." 

<H3>A world of opportunity - and
challenge </h3>
<p> In the past, Canadian exports have centred around raw materials and
industrial products like auto parts and telecommunications. But in recent years,
rising standards of living in developing economies have sparked demand for
quality consumer goods. According to Pamela Kanter, Regional Manager for Japan,
Korea, Australia and New Zealand, in the Government of Ontario's Trade and
Investment Marketing Division, small exporters face unique challenges in these
expanding markets. "Small businesses often lack the human and financial
resources to do the necessary market research," says Kanter.
"Historically, small businesses have been opportunistic in their approach to
foreign markets. But today, the competition is stiff. So up-front research and a
strategic approach are extremely important." 

<h3>Meeting the challenge</h3>
<p>Vanessa Hammond, Vice President of Business Development for
the Canadian Exporters' Association, advises small business owners and operators
to get to know the market before devoting valuable resources to any exporting
initiative. "Within a foreign market, there can be tremendous variations in
manufacturing standards, approval processes, languages, business practices,
government regulations, tax and financing issues," notes Hammond. "Research is
critical to becoming export-ready. It should receive the same kind of attention
as a new product launch."

<h3>Getting 'export-ready'</h3>
<p>A number of federal and provincial government export and
trade development programs offer free support and information for would-be
exporters. "A wealth of information, from tariffs and duties, to government
regulations and restrictions, to business practices, market accessibility and
industry-specific market studies, is available for the asking," says Kanter. As
well, the Canadian Exporters' Association, the Board of Trade, World Trade
Centres, and the Canadian Manufacturers Association offer seminars, workshops and
literature, and sponsor events for their members. In many cases, a local Canada
Business Service Centre is a good first stop. "These Centres can be very
helpful," explains Hammond. "They're a great source of information on
government-sponsored international trade programs, publications and services."

<h3>The next step</h3>
<p> Once the research has been completed, a small business owner will
be in a position to make informed decisions about how best to approach a
particular market. "Armed with good information he or she can proceed with
confidence," says Myers. "The next step in evaluating the opportunity often
involves an exploratory trip to get a first-hand look at the market, and develop
some key contacts. Without a doubt, good preparation can mean the difference
between a successful venture and an absolute waste of time and money."
<p>
<EM>TD Bank actively supports its exporting clients through international trade
service offices located in major centres across Canada. Each centre is staffed
with knowledgeable specialists who can assist clients with the many complex
issues arising from selling abroad.</EM>

<h3>Focus on Women Entrepreneurs</h3>
<p> TD Bank has recently established a new position to
focus on the needs of women entrepreneurs. Catherine Taylor, TD Bank's National
Director-Women in Business, says, "Women now own 39 per cent of all small
businesses in Canada. They have asked for information seminars and are looking
for networking opportunities. TD branches across Canada will be helping to meet
these needs." 
<p><em>If you have suggestions for how TD can help women entrepreneurs,
please let us know. Call Catherine Taylor at (416) 307-9157, or send a fax to

<h3>TD Bank supports the auto sector</h3>
<b><i>TD Bank introduces a new financing program that
funds the cost of developing tools and molds used to make auto parts</b></i>
<p>Under the
terms of a recent agreement, the Export Development Corporation may, at TD's
request, guarantee up to 50 per cent of the financing provided to eligible
companies. This means that TD Bank may finance up to 100 per cent of the costs of
producing the tools and molds used in production. This is great news for the many
small and medium-sized firms involved in the industry, that are faced with
rapidly increasing development costs. 
<p>Jim Noble, TD Bank's Auto Industry
Specialist, states, "TD Bank recognizes that auto tool and die manufacturers are
a very important sector in Canada. Our program will help companies grow, thereby
creating jobs and stimulating exports." 
<p><em>For more information, speak to TD's Auto
Industry Specialist at (416) 982-7884.</em>

<CENTER><H1>Report On Provincial <BR>Government Finances</H1></CENTER>

<CENTER><B>August 1995</B></CENTER>

<H2>Overview</H2>

<B>Canada's 1995 provincial budget season 

opened with a flourish, as Saskatchewan and Alberta 

announced balanced budgets for fiscal 1994-95.</B>  

Healthy economic growth in Canada of more than 4 per 

cent in 1994 helped fill provincial coffers and brought 

deficit elimination within closer reach.  Six provinces -- 

British Columbia, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, New 

Brunswick, Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland -- 

pledged to record surpluses in the current fiscal year.  The 

final budgets presented in the 1995 budget season were 

those of Nova Scotia, Ontario and Quebec, the only 

provinces not to announce balanced budgets for either the 

1994-95 or the 1995-96 fiscal years.  Expenditure 

restraint remained a dominant theme of provincial budgets 

across the country, and all governments, with the 

exception of Quebec's, refrained from increasing major tax 

rates.

<P>

<B>Total provincial debt -- approximately the sum 

of past deficits -- doubled in the five years between 

fiscal years 1989-90 and 1994-95.</B>  Provincial debt 

burdens, measured as net public debt as a share of 

provincial gross domestic product (GDP), rose 

significantly in all provinces throughout this period.  As 

deficits continue to narrow, the total provincial 

debt-to-GDP ratio in fiscal 1995-96 is forecast to stabilize 

at last year's level of 32 per cent.  Debt-to-GDP ratios vary 

widely across the provinces, with estimates for the current 

fiscal year ranging from less than 20 per cent in British 

Columbia to more than 50 per cent in Newfoundland. 

<P>

Three provinces -- Alberta, Manitoba and New 

Brunswick -- have proposed or already passed 

<B>balanced-budget/debt-reduction legislation</B> which 

formalizes their commitment to balancing the consolidated 

budget and reducing debt over the medium term.  Although 

such legislation does not necessarily guarantee that the 

stated targets will be met, it does provide an indication that 

the political will exists to achieve the objectives.

<P>

One of the key challenges for provincial finance 

ministers will be to adjust to the sharp declines in 

federal-provincial transfers under the new <B>Canada 

Health and Social Transfer (CHST)</B> which will be 

implemented in fiscal 1996-97.  Other potential obstacles 

in the years ahead include slower-than-anticipated 

economic growth and higher-than-anticipated interest 

rates.  Provincial governments who have already balanced 

their budgets, and have in place a clear strategy to reach 

their fiscal targets, will be in the best position to deal with 

these challenges.

<P>

<CENTER><IMG ALIGN=bottom

SRC="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/library/provincial/gifs/graph1.gif"

ALT="Per-Capita Surpluses/Deficits"></CENTER>

<P>

In the wake of <B>extensive foreign borrowing by 

Canadian governments</B> in recent years, which brought 

the share of government bonds held by non-residents to 

almost 40 per cent in 1994, provincial governments' 

financial results have been subject to ever-greater 

scrutiny by financial markets.  Concerns about Canadian 

deficits and debt on the part of international investors have 

acted as a strong motivating force guiding provincial 

governments to undertake meaningful and rapid fiscal 

reforms in recent years.  This pressure will remain over the 

medium term, and will be alleviated only when Canada's 

federal and provincial governments succeed in achieving a 

substantial reduction in Canada's total government debt 

burden.

<P>Many credit cards give you a grace period, which is a length of time from the date of your monthly statement to the date when you have to make a payment and when interest begins to accrue on your purchases.
Grace periods can vary
from two weeks to a month.

<P>When you buy goods and services, you will not be charged interest on the purchase
price until the due date on your next monthly statement. Depending on when you
made the purchase, you may not have to pay for it (or make a partial payment) for
several weeks.

Market Update
</H2>

<P>The Canadian economy appears to have grown at a reasonable pace during the quarter, with inflation remaining benign. The Canadian dollar started to show signs of strength as economic data slowly became stronger. The Bank of Canada has dropped the overnight lending rates by a full percent over the last three months. Canadian short-term rates remained decidedly below U.S. rates.<P>Our analysis points to stronger growth in Canada during the remainder of 1996. We believe that Canadian growth will be above consensus estimates. Moreover, Canada's fiscal position continues to improve and the government is on track to surpass its deficit target. Our outlook for the Canadian dollar remains positive, our growing merchandise trade surplus along with a strong commodity market continues to support a strong currency.<P>In conclusion, the stronger Canadian dollar will support a lower rate environment and the Bank of Canada should remain accommodative into the next quarter. The result of our changing fiscal position has implications for the amount of Canadian debt that will remain outstanding or be issued. We view this supply issue as a major determinant of short rates and their stability. As a result, the Fund maintained an aggressive term for the quarter, which proved to be beneficial.<P>The Fund's return for the three months ending Sept. 30, 1996 was 1.04%. The yield fell marginally from the previous quarter as high yielding T-Bills matured and were replaced by a new lower yielding instrument.

<h5>Spring 1995 - Volume Two - Number Two</h5>

<H2>Holding on to the family cottage</H2>

<P>In many families, a cottage is treated as common property, with
various sons, daughters, and cousins enjoying it over the years.

<P>Difficulties can arise, however, when the actual ownership of the
cottage property passes from one generation to the next. The
reason is that when the property passes to a son or daughter - in
fact, if it passes to anyone other than a spouse - it's treated
for tax purposes as if it has been sold.

<P>If the cottage has increased in value, that means your estate
will have to pay capital gains tax on the deemed sale. If there
aren't enough assets in your estate to cover the liability, your
heirs may be forced to sell the property just to pay the taxes.

<H3>The solution</H3>

<P>One way to avoid this situation is to transfer ownership of the
property while the owner is still alive. There will still be a
deemed sale, and capital gains tax will still have to be paid.
But any future gains will accrue to the beneficiaries, and won't
become payable until they sell the property.

<P>But what if you're not ready to give up control of the cottage?

<P>To transfer the ownership, without transferring control, you can
set up a trust, naming yourself (and/or your spouse) as trustee
and your children as beneficiaries.

<P>Future capital gains will still accrue to the beneficiaries of
the trust, but as trustee, you retain control of the property.

<H3>Potential drawbacks</H3>

<P>Before you set up a trust, have a long talk with your children. Do
they really want the cottage and the responsibility that goes
with it? 

<P>There can be other problems as well, including: cost, family
quarrels over who gets to use the cottage, and family law and tax
complications. (In some provinces, half of your beneficiary's
interest in the cottage could wind up in the hands of his or her
ex-spouse.)

<P>Be sure to consult your lawyer and accountant, as well as your
family, to discuss possible alternatives before you proceed. 

<H4>Deborah Lorant is a TD Trust Branch Manager and Chartered Financial Planner.</H4>



<H2>10 questions to ask before buying a cottage</H2>

<P>There are a number of questions that require consideration when you're 
buying recreational property, including:
<ol>
<li>The building: Is the structure sound? Is the cottage
winterized?
<li>Access: Who maintains the access road? Will you be able to get
to the property year-round?
<li>Water supply: Does the property have reliable access to
drinking water or will you have to truck in bottled water?
<li>Waterfront: Is the lake or river safe and suitable for the
type of recreation you enjoy?
<li>Drainage: Does the property flood every spring? 
<li>Sewage: Is there a well-maintained septic tank?
<li>Facilities: Is the property a reasonable distance from
hospitals, police, and other services?
<li>Neighbours: Are there other cottages nearby? Are you
comfortable with their proximity?
<li>Zoning: Are there any zoning or legal restrictions that might
prevent you from building or adding to an existing structure?
<li>Crime: Do other cottages in the area seem to be a popular 
target for thieves and vandals? 
</ol>

<h1>Bu$inessmatters Fall 1994</h1>

<h2>News and Information for TD Bank's Commercial Customers</h2>

<br>
<h1>Small Businesses Benefit from Technology</h1>
<b>By David Richards, Manager, Information Systems Group, Price Waterhouse</b>
<p>
<I>"Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic".</I>  Arthur C. Clarke
<p>
The technological revolution is in high gear. Micro-computers, modems, sophisticated software, fax
machines and cellular telephones are changing the way people do business. These high-tech tools are
part of what Business Week has termed the Technology of Small. What's so good about small? Some of
the largest and most successful companies have discovered that smaller business units can get closer
to their markets, and react more quickly than large, bureaucratic structures. Throughout North
America, major corporations are busy redefining the way they do business - and, in the process,
becoming much more like the small businesses with which they compete. 


<h2>A Level Playing Field</h2>

This trend to 'small' bodes well for many smaller businesses. Unlike their larger counterparts,
smaller businesses don't have to work at being flexible and market driven - these attributes are a
way of life. Twenty years ago, only the largest corporations could afford computers and other
'high-tech' tools. Today, innovative technologies are within reach of small operations - and are
helping to create a level playing field on which businesses of all types and sizes compete as equals.
 
<p>
Unfortunately, many small businesses do not make full use of the technology they have. While most
have a fax machine, a cellular phone and a computer, few derive maximum value from these tools. All
too often, micro-computers are used for word processing, accounting and little more. While the
technology is well suited to these tasks, it is capable of many other things. Like video
conferencing, electronic data interchange (EDI), electronic banking, 'real time' inventory and sales
management . . . to name a few. The fact is, small business owners could be passing up a golden
opportunity to become more responsive to their customers' needs, and hence more competitive and
successful. 


<h2>Client-Servers Boost Productivity and Efficiency</h2>

For the smaller business, a relatively modest investment in leading-edge technology can have a very
large pay-back. A client-server system is a good case in point. Consisting of a few - or many -
micro-computers networked together, a client-server system can add substantially to the raw computing
power and productivity of any organization. In this system, the micro-computer that sits on an
employee's desk is the 'client'; another micro-computer, the 'server,' is dedicated to storing and
managing data (including documents). 
<p>
A client-server system allows a small business to enjoy computing power that was previously only
available to much larger businesses with mainframe computers. It enables more than one user to access
databases and files simultaneously, thereby greatly increasing productivity and efficiency. With such
a system, accounting or inventory records can be viewed and updated by employees with access
privileges - across the organization. Several sales people can access customer or product files,
prepare quotations and generate letters from their office, or a remote location - at the same time!


<h2>Affordable High-Tech</h2>

Too expensive, you are thinking? On the contrary, in a company with fewer than 20 employees, an entry
level 'server' and the network which connects it to existing 'clients' can be installed for less than
$5,000 - well within reach of many small businesses.

<h1>Strategic alliance with FBDB benefits TD's small and medium-sized customers
</h1>
From time to time, even the most successful entrepreneurs need outside help to bring an issue into
focus. By referring managers to qualified business counsellors, TD is making an effective CASE for
good management.
<p>
TD Bank has teamed up with the Federal Business Development Bank to promote awareness of FBDB's
Counselling Assistance to Small Enterprises (CASE) program. 
<p>
Today, more than 1,000 experienced FBDB counsellors are available to help business owners and
managers capitalize on opportunities and surmount difficulties. CASE is available to all Canadian
companies with up to 200 employees through FBDB's 78 offices nationwide. According to Norma
Passaretti, Vice-President, Management Services, FBDB, "TD's entrepreneurial customers are practical
and resourceful people. But occasionally they come up against a situation that is outside their area
of expertise or experience. In many cases, our counsellors can help point them in the right
direction." Royden Ritz, TD's Senior Manager, Independent Business, agrees. "During the course of a
week or month, our Account Managers talk with many entrepreneurs who need good, pragmatic advise at a
price they can afford. CASE can be just what the doctor ordered." 
<p>
Think your business could benefit from an outside perspective? Ask your TD Account Manager for more
information on CASE.

<h1>Survey of entrepreneurs finds upbeat mood</h1>

An informal survey of 125 entrepreneurs conducted at a recent breakfast forum held by Ernst & Young's
Venture Group demonstrates that the mood amongst entrepreneurs in 1994 is definitely upbeat. Survey
results indicated: 
<p>
Confidence has risen dramatically: 82% expect business conditions to improve in 1994 - up from 60%
last year. 
<p>
Entrepreneurs have been using growth strategies to expand in the last six months: 46% had moved into
new domestic or international markets; 44% introduced new products or services. 
<p>
On the productivity side, 41% of businesses surveyed had upgraded their technology in the last year,
with a similar number indicating this was going to be a continuing focus for the coming year. 
<p>
Expansion is still a hot issue for entrepreneurs: in the coming year, 60% planned to expand into new
markets, many pursuing both the domestic and international arenas simultaneously. 
<p>
The survey respondents made it clear that government deficits were a major concern with 62%
indicating that deficit reduction should be a top government priority. Again, a heavy tax burden was
cited as a disincentive to business by entrepreneurs in every industry sector. Only 10% of those
surveyed thought assistance to small business was critical.

<h1>Hop On The TD Information Highway</h1>
<h2>- TD's new electronic products make business banking easy</h2>

With the release of an enhanced version of Business Window (Version 3.0), and the introduction of
three new electronic banking services - FAXlink, FILElink and EASYREC - a whole new world of
convenience and flexibility is in store for TD business customers. 

<p>
With Business Window 3.0, a PC and a modem, you can gain secure access to many electronic banking
services. For example, you can access services that provide previous-day or on-line balance
information, automatically update your accounting software, make payments, collect receivables,
process invoices or issue securities settlement instructions - all from the comfort of your own
office. In the four weeks following its release, over 600 customers have switched to 3.0. "The new
version of Business Window (3.0) is easier to use, and requires less learning time," says Steve
Gesner, Associate Vice President, Cash Management. "What's more, it allows customers to access our
exciting new electronic banking services." 
<p>
<B>EASYREC</B> - electronically reconciles accounting records to your Bank statements. After
downloading your account activity from the Bank, EASYREC will compare your accounting files to this
information and produce management reports. "Not only is it fast and easy to install and use,
EASYREC reduces costly re-keying time and errors," says Gesner. "Plus, it's compatible with
accounting packages like ACCPAC, Bedford/Simply Accounting and DacEasy." According to Jo-Ann
Heller, Bookkeeper with C&H Fire Suppression Systems Inc. of Kitchener, Ontario, "...what used to
take me four hours at month end now takes me one." 
<p>
<B>FILElink</B> - No more time-consuming calls to your Branch to retrieve valuable account
information. "FILElink gives you quick and convenient access to your previous day's Canadian and US
dollar business and personal accounts, term deposits, GICs and Canadian dollar loan account
information. "This information is available to you through your PC and Business Window when you want
it," says Gesner. Frank Sparks of Foothills Industrial Products (1988) Ltd. in Calgary concurs: "FILElink is perfect for our needs. It requires minimal attention, and minimal personnel qualifications."

<p>
<B>FAXlink</B> - delivers all the information available through FILElink - automatically, via your
fax machine. You can specify where you would like to receive your account information as well as the
time of day and frequency - daily, weekly, monthly, etc. - and FAXlink will do the rest. "The
system is so simple, no customer guide is really needed," says Ian McGuire of Fine Arts Dental Labs
in Edmonton, FAXlink is a "...great idea!" 
<p>
At TD Bank, wer'e committed to delivering the products and services our customers need.  For more

<h1>Product Watch</h1>

<h2>TD Businessline...a flexible line of credit for your growing business.</h2>

Sometimes a growing business needs access to a line of credit but hasn't been able to establish the
track record that a conventional line demands. Or an owner / manager feels they are spending too much
time preparing routine information reports for the bank - time that would be better spent running
their business. TD Businessline can help.
<p>
Secured by assets like term deposits, marginable stocks and bonds or a mortgage on owner-occupied
residential property, TD Businessline can be used for working capital or to finance the purchase of
fixed assets. Best of all, preferred rate of interest applies and there are no account management
fees (unless automatic loan fluctuation is selected).
<p>
Sound interesting? For more information, use FaxBack, or talk to your TD Account Manager.


<h2>Taking care of business with TD Business Overdraft Protection.</h2>

Every business needs a plan. But even the most comprehensive plan can be thrown off-track by an
unexpected expense or a delay in collecting a receivable. That's why we developed TD Business
Overdraft Protection. By providing your business with temporary credit of up to $10,000, TD Business
Overdraft Protection can protect your credit rating, avoid costly NSF charges and help keep your
business on track. Make sure you're covered for the unexpected. Ask your TD Account Manager for
details.

<H2>Point-Of-Sale Direct Payment Options</H2>
<P>TD Merchant Services offers several innovative solutions for adding Interac Direct Payment to a merchant's credit card processing.  These include TD-owned equipment and PC-based software which the Merchant purchases directly from the supplier.

<H3>TD-Owned Equipment</H3>
<P><A HREF="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/merchvisa/services/greenpay.html">TD Green Key</A> terminals provide electronic authorization and deposit for all major credit cards and Interac Direct Payment, which is the hottest new payment option in the Canadian retail market.  
<P>These terminals offer all the features and benefits of TD's credit terminals, with the added feature of a hand-held PIN Pad. This allows the Merchant to offer Interac Direct Payment by accepting all major banking machine cards within the Interac system.
<P>These terminals can use a variety of communication scenarios ranging from standard voice telephone lines (DataPac 3101), leased lines (DataPac 3201) or a terminal-based LAN communications solution.  Perfectly suited to multi-lane and shift environments, some terminals support special functions such as operator identification numbers.
<P>The benefits a merchant realizes when they integrate TD Green Key with Interac Direct Payment are:
<UL>
<LI>Reduced losses from bad cheques as all Direct Payment Transactions are authorized right at the time of the sale.
<LI>Improved cash flow as some cash and cheque sales are replaced by Direct Payment sales which are deposited electronically to the Merchant's TD bank account.
<LI>Improved security and administration with less cash in the till and fewer cheques to deposit.
<LI>Enhanced customer service as the merchant is offering customers another convenient payment option.
</UL>

<H3>PC-Based Solution</H3>
<P>You can also choose to <A HREF="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/merchvisa/services/creditcheq.html">purchase software</A> yourself and add it to your own equipment. TD Visa Merchant Sales and Service has arranged with suppliers to make available a Direct Payment option to all Merchants with IBM-compatible PC's and a modem.  The PIN Pad and software are purchased outright by the Merchant directly from our supplier.All PC-based solutions are supported jointly by the software suppliers and our TD Help Desk.

<h5>Winter 1995 - Volume Two - Number One</h5>

<H2>The fine art of collecting</H2>

<p>If you had bought a certain Goebel Hummel plate when it came out
in 1971, you would have paid $25. That plate is now valued at $910. That's an increase in value of
more than 3,500%. And at a recent Christie's auction, the
original poem 'Twas the Night Before Christmas sold for $255,000
US, while the cast iron Maltese Falcon from the movie of the same
name attracted a whopping bid of $360,000 US.

<p>Big payoffs like these aren't exactly common, of course, but they
do occur. Most collectors get involved, however, because they
love the game. If their beloved collection appreciates in value,
it's a bonus.

<H3>Acquiring a collection</H3>

<p>Whether you're attracted to Meissen china or Canadiana furniture,
your initial aim is to learn as much as you can about your chosen
area of specialization. Read up on the topic. Go to auction previews and dealers' premises to compare prices
and get a feel for the market. 

<p>It's usually wise to buy your first few items from a reputable
dealer. You'll pay a little more, because 
of the dealer's markup, but you'll usually get a guarantee of the
item's authenticity, and an 
accurate idea of its current value.

<p>Public auctions are another possible venue, and you can sometimes
find overlooked treasures this way. Be sure to examine the item
thoroughly, before it goes on the auction block, to decide
whether you're interested in 
bidding on it. Remember that it's easy to get caught up in the
excitement of bidding and pay much more than you intended, so set
a mental limit on what you're willing to pay before the bidding
even starts.

<p>Once you've gained
enough experience to distinguish good quality from bad, or even
forgeries, you can do your buying privately. By cutting out the
dealer, you're usually 
able to get a better price. 

<H3>Protection and care</H3>

<p>Once you've acquired a few 
valuable (or potentially valuable) pieces, adequate insurance is 
a must.

<p>If your collection is worth less than $5,000, you can usually 
insure it for a reasonable price through a &quot;rider&quot; on
your household policy. More valuable pieces are best covered on a
separate policy. In either case, be sure to use a reputable
appraiser, and update appraisals regularly. 

<p>Be certain to itemize your collection; photographic records or
videotapes are advisable. 

<H3>Selling your collection</H3>

<p>Perhaps the greatest drawback to collectibles as an investment is
their lack of liquidity. In other words, it's much easier to
acquire an item than it is to sell it. 

<p>Never count on getting a quick return from your investment. If
you've made wise acquisitions, though, you may well see steady
appreciation over the years.

<H3>Where to learn more</H3>

<p>If you want to find out more about the basics of collecting,
two good reference materials are the Encyclopedia of
Collectibles, from Time-Life, U.S.A., and Miller's International
Antiques Price Guide for 1995, published by Mitchell Beasley,
Great Britain.

<P>There are two basic types of turn key solutions:  TD-owned POS equipment which the Merchant rents from the Bank and PC-based software which Merchants purchase and download themselves.

<H3>TD-Owned Equipment</H3>
<P><A HREF="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/merchvisa/services/greenkey.html">TD Green Key</A> draft capture terminals provide authorization and settlement for all major credit cards.  TD also provides specialized TIPS terminals which are tailored to the restaurant industry.
<P>All Green Key terminals can be used by the Merchant to access most cheque verification programmes.  Working from standard voice lines (DataPac 3101) or leased lines (DataPac 3201), these terminals can be installed quickly at any location.  
<P>The benefits a merchant realizes when they choose draft capture with TD are significant:
<UL>
<LI>Reduced risk of loss from bad credit cards as all cards are authorized electronically at the time of the sale.
<LI>Increased convenience and improved cash flow as the proceeds from credit card sales are deposited electronically to the appropriate bank accounts at the end of the day.
<LI>Increased efficiency and improved customer service as the terminal handles the card authorization component of the Merchant's sale transaction.
<LI>Ease of installation due to TD's commitment to training at installation and the post-installation support of our TD POS Help Desks.
</UL>
<P>And, if a Merchant decides to add a printer to their draft capture terminal, they'll see these benefits:
<UL>
<LI>Additional efficiency as the TD equipment does everything required for 	the card sale from authorizing the transaction to printing the receipt.
<LI>Improved record-keeping by using printed daily reports at the point-of-	sale.
</UL>

<H3>PC-Based Solutions</H3>
<P>Merchants with IBM compatible PC's and a modem can purchase a <A HREF="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/merchvisa/services/creditcheq.html">PC-based package</A> to authorize all major credit cards.  Available in a Windows version, this package affords Merchants the benefit of processing all major credit cards with a solution that maximizes the use of their existing hardware.
<P>As well, TD Merchant Services has established partnerships with third party suppliers which offer a variety of software packages suited to varying client needs.  These can be explored, as <A HREF="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/merchvisa/services/customized.html">customized solutions</A> on a case by case basis with individual Merchants.
<P>All PC-based solutions are supported jointly by the software suppliers and our TD Help Desks.

<P>An affinity card is a bank credit card that's associated with an organization,
such as a professional association, a club, or a university or college alumni
association. When you use an affinity card, a part of the merchant fee goes
toward the support of the organization. With most affinity cards, you pay the same annual fees and charges as you would with other credit cards. Some affinity cards have other
benefits, such as a <A HREF="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/Creditctr/prodinfo/tdcards/tdgm.html">points program</A> for purchasing goods or services related to the
sponsoring organization.

<h5>Summer 1995 - Volume Two - Number Three</h5>

<H2>New name, more service</H2>

<P>Almost 200 Toronto - Dominion Banks branches across Canada are becoming special TD Bank & Trust locations. The branches were chosen for new status because they serve markets with clients who have a greater need for trust services.

<P>The TD Bank & Trust locations have new signs and new logos. Staff in these branches have recieved special training in trust services. They now offer TD Trust resources as well as the full range of banking products and services.

<P> TD Trust can help you plan your will or act as estate executor, as well as administer trust accounts and manage investment portfolios.

<P>If you notice the TD Bank & Trust sign at a branch near you, please drop by to find out how you can use the expanded services. Remember, if you don't see the new sign in your area, you can still access trust - related activities through any regular branch TD Bank.

Market Update
</H2>

<P>
A resilient economy, strong earnings in select companies and record inflows into equity mutual funds has enabled stocks to continue advancing. Inflation remains relatively benign, but the strengthening economy has increased the likelihood of an interest-rate hike by the U.S. Federal Reserve Board.
<P>
Although stock valuations have reached expensive levels, the outlook for U.S. stocks remains reasonably favourable. Earnings are growing rapidly at high-quality companies, and valuations on select companies are still favourable. Many companies appear poised for strong dividend growth and others may engage in share repurchases as a more tax-effective method of returning capital to shareholders. T. Rowe Price targets blue chip companies with leading market positions, seasoned management and strong fundamentals in the belief that they will provide above-average performance and dividend growth.
<P>
<H2>High Growth Potential</h2>
Investors interested in long-term growth often look to blue chip stocks to achieve their objectives. The graph below illustrates that America's biggest and best companies have outperformed their Canadian counterparts over the past 15 years.
<P>
<center>
<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Standard & Poor's 500 Total Return Index vs. TSE 300 Total Return Index<BR>Growth of $1,000 (Cdn)</H3><P>
<IMG SRC="sp.gif" ALIGN=TOP WIDTH="400" HEIGHT="270" BORDER="0">
</center>
<P>
Over the past 15 years, the S&P 500 has provided an average annual compound return of 16.88%.
<P>
Well-established companies with leading market positions will be the core of the Fund's holdings, and preference will be given to companies in industries strategically poised for long-term growth. The Fund has excellent long-term growth potential and is expected to outperform both the stock market and inflation over time.

<H2>Top U.S. Adviser</h2>

Based in Baltimore, T. Rowe Price Associates, Inc. is one of the oldest fund management companies in the U.S. The firm enjoys an enviable track record of performance - 80% of its equity funds outperformed their peer group average in the U.S. for five-year average annual performance as of May 31, 1996 (as measured by Lipper Analytical Services). T. Rowe Price was selected as the 1995 Fund Manager of the Year by Morningstar, a major fund research company, and is also the adviser to the Green Line Science & Technology Fund, one of the top-performing funds in Canada last year.
<P>
T. Rowe Price pioneered the growth style of investing in the U.S. The firm looks for companies with quality management teams, steadily growing revenues, a sustainable competitive advantage and above-average growth in earnings per share. T. Rowe Price currently has over US$86 billion in assets under management.

<h5>Fall 1994 - Volume One - Number One</h5>



<H2>Investing for success
in unsettled times</H2>

<p>The investment climate for the past several months has been
extremely unsettled. Interest rates, stock and bond prices, the
Canadian dollar - all have experienced significant volatility.

<p>While this may be troubling to some, the fact is that market
cycles are a part of life. Fortunately, history has shown that
despite these ebbs and flows, solid investments increase in value
over the long term, especially with good management. <br><br>
<center><IMG ALIGN=bottom SRC="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/lifepl/gifs/graph.gif"></center>
<H3>Our philosophy</H3>

<p>How TD Trust faces these inevitable ups and downs rests on our
investment philosophy. 

<p>First, we believe each individual has unique investment needs and
objectives, which we address by developing a customized
investment strategy. Second, TD Trust stands behind a balanced
approach to investing to help you achieve your financial goals.
Part of that approach is to focus investments domestically while
still recognizing global opportunities. Finally, we believe that
investment success is realized through ongoing relationships with
our clients.

<H3>Investing for the long term</H3>

<p>From a long-term perspective, growth investments - that is,
equities, and equity-based mutual funds - have historically
outpaced fixed-income investments, as well as inflation. That's
why we focus on growth-oriented stocks, and participate in the
market with a view to the long term.

<p>Having been in the financial 
services sector for years, we know from experience that the
recovery that invariably follows a market 
correction often pushes portfolio values to new heights. 

<p>As the chart on the next page shows, a conservative balanced
portfolio not only recovered from three market downturns, it also
made significant gains.

<H3>Diversification is key</H3>

<p>By holding a broad range of investments in both income-producing
and growth-oriented instruments, client portfolios are protected
from potential downturns in any single area. Our clients
generally hold diversified portfolios that include Canadian and
U.S. fixed-income investments and equities, international and
emerging markets stocks, and global bonds.

<p>Our portfolio managers also recognize the importance of
diversifying across different economic sectors to benefit from
economic growth around the world.

<p>Many Canadians are hesitant to take on foreign investments they
know little about. But our international advisors - Lazard and J.
P. Morgan of London, and Morgan Stanley of New York - are among
the best in the world, and provide us with additional expertise
in their respective disciplines. 

<p>To date, our offshore investments, including international
equities, emerging markets equities, and foreign bonds, have
shown very good returns.


<H3>Responding to today's economy</H3>

<p>Interest rates have generally been rising since February, and we
expect rates to edge somewhat higher. Our response? We continue
to purchase shorter-term bonds because they subject clients'
portfolios to less risk should interest rates rise further.

<p>Overseas, both Japanese and European interest rates are also on
their way up. Consequently, we are buying only shorter-term bonds
from these areas. 

<p>Here in Canada, stock prices are beginning to climb back up,
driven by rising corporate earnings and the expectation of higher
earnings to come. TD Trust will continue to focus on domestic
investment, and we expect the equity portion of our clients'
portfolios to benefit accordingly.

<H3>The professional advantage</H3>

<p>At TD Trust, our portfolio managers are at all times up-to-date
on political and economic events that could affect your
investments. Using TD Trust's investment philosophy as their
guide, they adjust your portfolio to take advantage of changing
conditions, while bearing in mind your personal goals and
preferences.

<p>As always, if you have questions or would like to discuss your
portfolio, contact your TD Trust representative.

$97 million or 17% increase from $568 million in the same period last year.

<P><b>T</b>he results of the quarter reflect the trends we have noted in our major markets and
our growth strategies. Traditional banking businesses have been constrained by an economic
environment characterized by slow growth, low inflation and the impact of changing
demographics - with the population shifting its focus from borrowing to investing. These trends -
combined with lower margins due to the recent decline in interest rates - dampened net interest
income. At the same time, we continued to see strong gains in other income during the quarter -
reflecting growth in areas that we have targeted for increased investment.

<p><b>T</b>hese areas include discount brokerage, investment banking, mutual funds,
investment management, computer and telephone banking, and card services. We saw strong
year-over-year growth in all these areas in the quarter.

<P><b>N</b>otably, our mutual funds exceeded the $8 billion mark - exhibiting superior
growth in the Canadian market; we boosted our investment management business and became
Canada's largest index and quantitative investment manager with the acquisition of the
Quantitative Capital Division of AMI Partners Inc. Green Line Investor Services, our discount
broker, opened an office in Hong Kong and showed year-over-year revenue growth of over 30%.

<P><b>W</b>aterhouse Investor Services, Inc., the U.S. based discount brokerage we are in the
process of acquiring, has also demonstrated outstanding growth. We expect to close the
Waterhouse transaction once final regulatory approvals have been received and our listing on the
New York Stock Exchange will proceed tomorrow, August 30.

<P><b>W</b>hile building new businesses and focusing on growth areas where we believe TD
can generate superior returns, we took three major steps to enhance shareholder value during the
quarter:<br>

<ul><li>We announced the largest share buyback in Canadian banking history, calling for the
repurchase of up to 30 million common shares - representing about 10% of TD's outstanding
common shares. This move was designed to improve share value by returning excess capital to
shareholders. Despite this buyback, TD will continue to be one of the most highly capitalized
banks in Canada and  in a strong position to pursue attractive growth opportunities.<br><br>

<li>Our strategy of focusing on growth areas goes hand in hand with the divestiture of businesses
with limited potential for TD. To this end, we announced an agreement to sell our institutional
and pension custody business to Royal Trust. TD had lacked the volumes and economies of scale
necessary for long term superior returns.<br><br>

<li>In our quest to be a low cost producer and improve productivity, we have entered into an
agreement with two other banks to "co-source" document processing services. We are jointly
developing a new company to handle these activities for all three institutions - improving
economies of scale and  reducing processing costs. The new operation will be phased in over the
next three years, resulting in annual expenditure savings of at least 15 per cent.</ul>

<p><b>D</b>uring the quarter, in pursuit of our core strategy of making it easier for our
customers, we launched some important initiatives:<br>

<ul><li>We unveiled TD Access - North America's first fully integrated personal computer
banking and brokerage delivery channel, offering personal and commercial banking and discount
brokerage services all in one Windows-based package. We will be rolling out TD Access, which
is now being test-piloted, nationally this Fall.<br><br>

<li>In our efforts to bring new dimensions to payment services, we announced a new pilot
project with another bank to test EXACT, a computer chip based &quot;smart&quot; card
for small purchases. The one-year pilot project will be conducted in Kingston, Ontario, beginning
this Fall.<br><br>

<li>We formally launched TD Life Insurance Company, a wholly owned subsidiary, with the
announcement of an accidental death plan and an innovative health service called TD LifeLine
which provides toll-free hotline telephone access to a wide variety of health and lifestyle
information. A full range of life and health insurance products will be introduced over the next 
few months.</ul>

<P><b>C</b>urrently, TD Life products are being marketed through direct mail to all TD
customers. Ultimately, we are hopeful that the federal government will approve legislation that
will enable banks in Canada to use our retail branches in the marketing of insurance products.
We believe such a move would benefit consumers while bringing Canada into line with financial
services legislation in other major markets around the world. We are encouraged by the
government's decision to appoint a task force to study the future of the financial services sector
and we are hopeful that the task force will recommend progressive action in the retailing of
insurance.

<P><b>L</b>ower interest rates are good for our customers and for the Canadian economy.
Consumer confidence appears to be improving at last and that should fuel economic growth in
the year ahead. In this environment, we believe Your Bank will continue to generate strong
returns and we will continue on our course to build value, for you, our shareholder.<BR><BR>

<H3><a name="Review">REVIEW OF OPERATING PERFORMANCE</H3>
<p><b>Y</b>our Bank achieved another strong quarterly performance with net income of $223
million for the third quarter of 1996. This is an increase of $3 million from the preceding quarter
and a decrease of $2 million from last year. While net income is similar to last year, the
composition of revenue generated has changed. Other income increased significantly
year-over-year, reaching a level slightly less than the record established last quarter, thereby
increasing its contribution to total revenues from 32% a year ago to 36% this quarter. In addition,
net investment securities gains increased as equity markets were stronger this year than last year.
Partially offsetting these favourable developments was a decline in net interest income due to a
decline in margins.

<p><b>D</b>uring the quarter, the Bank repurchased approximately 10 million of its common
shares as part of a previously announced program which when completed at the end of fiscal
1997 will result in a reduction in outstanding shares of approximately 30 million or 10%. As a
result of fewer shares outstanding and continued strong earnings, net income per share reached a
record level of $.73 in the third quarter of 1996 compared to $.71 a year ago and $.70 for the
preceding quarter. On a fully diluted basis, net income per share was $.71 compared to $.70 last
year and $.69 last quarter.

<P><b>C</b>ompared to last year, return on common equity and return on assets declined from
16.0% to 14.8% and from 0.85% to 0.76% respectively, as this quarter's earnings were generated
from higher equity and asset levels.

<P><b>F</b>or the nine months ending July 31, 1996, your Bank earned net income of $665
million, a $97 million or 17% increase from $568 million in the same period last year. Year to
date earnings per share for 1996 were $2.14 versus $1.79 for the same period in 1995.

<h4>NET INTEREST INCOME</h4>
<b>N</b>et interest income on a taxable equivalent basis was $661 million, down $25
million from last year. This decrease is due to a 40 basis points decline in margins to 2.49%
which more than offset the 12% increase in average earning assets. A combination of factors
contributed to the margin decline. First, interest rates have declined significantly compared to last
year as indicated by the Bank's prime lending rate declining 200 basis points from 8.25% to
6.25%. While good news for our customers, this has reduced the yield on investing our
shareholder's equity and other non-interest bearing or low cost funds. Second, net interest margin
a year ago benefited from high interest recoveries of $46 million compared to only $5 million
this quarter. Third, although total average earning assets increased 12%, lending activity
represented only 1 percentage point of this increase, whereas securities and trading related
activities, which earn a lower interest margin than loans, represented 11 percentage points.
Therefore, the impact of this asset growth on the Bank's net interest income was
relatively small. Securities and trading related assets, as a proportion of the Bank's total average
earnings assets, increased from 28% for the same quarter last year to 35% this quarter. This
significant change in asset mix had an unfavourable impact of approximately 29of the 40 basis
point decline in margin.

<P><b>C</b>ompared to last quarter, net interest income rose to $661 million from $630
million as a result of special dividends received from equity investments and a 5% increase in
average earning assets. As asset growth was primarily in very low margin securities purchased
under resale agreements, margins declined 7 basis points.

<P><b>T</b>he Bank continued to benefit from favourable equity market conditions and
realized $29 million in net investment securities gains. This is the seventh consecutive quarter of
security gains in excess of $20 million.

<h4>CREDIT QUALITY AND PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES</h4> 

<b>N</b>et impaired loans increased $44 million during the quarter to $439 million at July 31,
1996, largely due to business loans to borrowers in Canada. However, net impaired loans as a
percentage of total loans and bankers' acceptances at .5% were unchanged from the previous
quarter.

<p><b>T</b>he estimate of the provision for credit losses for 1996 remained unchanged from
the last quarter at $170 million. One quarter of the estimate, or $43 million, was charged against
income in the quarter. This was $3 million higher than the charge for the third quarter of 1995
which was favourably impacted by the $40 million reduction in the 1995 loss estimate to $200
million recorded that quarter.

<h4>OTHER INCOME</h4>
<b>O</B>ther income continued to be the primary reason for the Bank's strong financial
performance as it increased $58 million or 17% from last year. It is only down $6 million from
last quarter's record level.

<P><b>G</b>reater activity by customers and expansion of operations led Green Line Investor
Services, our discount broker, TD Evergreen Investment Services, our full service broker, and the
Bank's mutual funds management operations to account for 50% of the $58 million increase in
other income. In addition to these operations, growth in investment and securities services
revenue was generated from activities related to mergers and acquisitions, underwriting and
equity sales and trading.
<p><b>D</b>erivative products revenue experienced strong growth due to favourable market
conditions.
<P><b>C</b>ard services revenue grew $4 million or 13%, as consumer activity increased.

<h4>NON-INTEREST EXPENSES</h4>

<b>A</b>s the 10% growth over the same quarter a year ago in expenses exceeded the 4%
growth in total revenues, the Bank's productivity ratio deteriorated from 58.3% to 61.6%. As
with the preceding quarter, two-thirds of the expense increase related to continued expansion and
activity in our securities businesses and to performance related compensation. The remainder of
the increase was largely due to the write-off in the quarter of $5 million of goodwill associated
with the purchase of businesses from AMI Partners Inc., further development of the Bank's
computer and telephone banking systems, and higher government levies.

<h4>BALANCE SHEET</h4>

<b>A</b>t July 31, 1996, total assets were $119 billion, an increase of $14 billion or 13% over a
year ago. While all asset categories increased, over 80% of the increase was due to greater
trading activity undertaken by the Bank resulting in increases in securities, securities purchased
under resale agreements, and cash resources. Residential mortgages grew a strong 7%.

<P><b>P</b>ersonal non-term deposits were up 3% from a year ago. Mutual funds managed by
the Bank continued to post strong growth as they totalled $8.4 billion at quarter-end compared to
$5.7 billion last year.

<P><b>A</b>s a result of a further decline in market interest rates and continued strong equities
markets, the market value of the Bank's securities portfolios held for investment and liquidity
purposes at July 31, 1996 was $15 million above book value, compared to $40 million below
book value at October 31, 1995.

<h4> CAPITAL</h4>

<b>C</b>ommon equity declined $77 million during the quarter as earnings after dividends of
$141 million and unrealized foreign currency translation gains of $23 million were more than
offset by the $244 million reduction related to the share buy back program. Compared to last
quarter-end, risk-weighted assets increased $4.5 billion, primarily due to increased corporate
lending and syndication activity. With these changes, the ratio of net common equity to
risk-weighted assets declined to 6.6% from 7.0% at the previous quarter-end and 6.7% a year
ago.

<h4>WATERHOUSE INVESTOR SERVICES, INC.</h4>
<b>T</b>he Bank's acquisition of Waterhouse is expected to close once final  regulatory
approvals have been received. On August 20, Waterhouse shareholders approved the transaction,
which will cost US$535 million in cash and TD common shares.

<LI><b>N</b>et income per share was $.70 for the second  quarter of 1996 compared to $.52 in

the prior year.

<LI><b>N</b>et interest margin declined in the quarter from 2.74% a year ago to 2.56%.

<LI><b>O</b>ther income increased 33% over the same quarter last year to a new high of $400

million. 

<LI><b>N</b>et impaired loans at 0.5% of loans and bankers' acceptances were at their lowest

level in over  ten years.

<LI><b>L</b>oan loss estimate for 1996 remained at  $170 million.<hr> </UL>



<H3><a name="Letter">LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS</a></H3>

<P><b>Y</b>our Bank continued to generate strong results in the second quarter, with earnings

of $220 million, up 34% from the second quarter of 1995 and return on equity of 15.1%

compared to 12.1% the previous year.



<P><b>W</b>hile delivering these solid year-over-year gains as well as continued improvement

in credit quality in the second quarter, TD made a major step forward with an agreement to

acquire Waterhouse Investor Services, Inc., the fourth largest discount brokerage in the United

States. This move - which with Green Line Investor Services will create one of the largest

discount brokers in the world - reflects our strategies for growth and our vision of the future of

banking.



<P><b>O</b>ur strategy has been to diversify TD's earning sources, entering new businesses

where we could add value to customers and meet their changing needs. Given the economic,

demographic and technological trends - and TD's strengths - our best route to generating superior

shareholder value is to focus on high growth areas which we believe will shape the future of

financial services. The markets we have identified for increased development include investment

banking, mutual funds, investment management, computer and telephone banking, card services

including credit, debit and "smart" cards, and discount brokerage.



<P><b>T</b>he Waterhouse transaction, subject to approval by regulators and Waterhouse

shareholders, will effectively double our size in the rapidly growing discount brokerage business

and create the first North American discount brokerage franchise. Waterhouse - which has

500,000 accounts and 80 offices in 37 states and the District of Columbia - will join forces with

Green Line, Canada's market leader. Both firms will continue to operate under their current

names and management, but we will see considerable sharing of technology and expertise.



<P><b>W</b>e expect to complete the transaction in the fourth quarter at a cost of US $535

million in cash and TD stock - which we plan to list on the New York Stock Exchange. We also

plan to buy back an offsetting number of shares to prevent shareholder dilution. TD's strong

capital position will still provide the scope to pursue other opportunities in line with our growth

strategies.



<p><b>O</b>ur strategies are supported by the steady growth we have seen in other income as a

percent of net interest income - from less than 50% a year ago to over 60% this quarter. Net

interest income in the second quarter, while virtually unchanged from the previous year, was

down 4% from the first quarter due to a 14 basis point decline in interest rate margins, whereas

other income was up 8%.



<p><b>T</B>he strongest gains in other income occurred in:<br>

<ul><li>discount brokerage, where Green Line set new records for revenues and

transactions;<br>

<li>retail brokerage, where TD Evergreen Investment Services - which was recently tied for

number one in key areas important to brokers in an annual "report card" in Investment Executive

magazine - continued to grow rapidly with revenues more than double the previous year and

assets under administration of approximately $5 billion;

<li>mutual funds, which showed continued strength in sales after RRSP season, reached $7.7

billion in assets by the end of the quarter as market share continued to grow;

<li>investment banking revenues in both Canada and the U.S.</ul>



<p><b>W</b>ith the development of our new businesses and increased marketing and

advertising costs, our expense to gross profit ratio deteriorated slightly to 60.7%. Our challenge

is to improve productivity while continuing to make gains in service delivery.



<p><b>O</b>ur branches have been responding well to the challenge and to the changing shape

of banking with expanded mutual fund and trust services and our Main$treet Banking services

for small business. These and other service initiatives have contributed to strong growth in new

accounts and non-term deposits. For corporate clients, we have made strides with our integrated

corporate and investment banking strategy and we have continued to develop services to meet

changing needs. For instance, in the second quarter we continued to accommodate our clients'

global growth with the opening of a representative office in Chile.



<p><b>D</b>uring the third quarter, we will be rolling out our Personal Banker program -

creating new relationship management positions in our retail branches to better meet our

customers' increasingly complex needs; we will be introducing Canada's first PC-based

integrated home banking product with single entry access to business, personal and discount

brokerage accounts; and we are proceeding with smart card development to provide a new

dimension in payment services.



<p><b>W</b>ith these initiatives and strong performances in all our businesses, we believe TD

will continue to outperform the economy this year. However, we are concerned by the continuing

trend by governments in Canada to single out and penalize Canada's banks for profitable growth

that benefits millions of direct and indirect shareholders. New capital surtaxes imposed at the

provincial level in Ontario apply only to banks. We are hopeful that governments in Canada will

begin to see that banks are an important national asset which must remain competitive in a global

marketplace.



<p><b>I</b>n focusing on your Bank's competitiveness, we are working to deliver solid returns

while generating future value for shareholders, and we believe we are on the right

course.<BR><BR>

Toronto, Ontario<br>

May 30, 1996<br>



<H3><a name="Review">REVIEW OF OPERATING PERFORMANCE</H3>

<P><b>N</b>et income for the second quarter of 1996 was $220 million as your Bank continued

to generate strong earnings during a period of moderate economic growth. Net income increased

$56 million over a year ago, and declined only $2 million from the preceding quarter.

Year-over-year favourable results were primarily achieved through record other income, as our

non-interest revenue generating businesses continued to increase their earnings contribution.

Provision for credit losses was lower and interest recoveries were higher as a result of the

continued improvement in the quality of the Bank's loan portfolio.



<p><b>N</b>et income per share for the second quarter of 1996 was $.70 compared to $.52 a

year ago and $.71 for the preceding quarter. On a fully diluted basis, net income per share was

$.69 compared to $.51 last year and $.70 last quarter.



<p><b>T</b>he increase in earnings, year-over-year, significantly improved return on assets

from 0.64% to 0.81% and return on equity from 12.1% to 15.1%.



<p><b>A</b>s a result of the Bank's strong performance in the first half of 1996, net income

increased to $442 million or $1.41 per share compared to the prior year's first half earnings of

$343 million or $1.08 per share.



<h4>NET INTEREST INCOME</h4>

<B>N</b>et interest income on a taxable equivalent basis was $630 million, virtually unchanged

from last year, as a 6% increase in average earning assets was offset by an 18 basis points decline

in margins to 2.56%. The growth in average assets was due to increased securities related trading

activity which earns a lower interest margin than loans. Non-mortgage lending declined from a

year ago due to sluggish economic growth, repayments and a reduction in corporate lending

activity where the return was not commensurate with the risk undertaken. This change of mix in

earning assets combined with considerably lower interest rates and heightened competition,

particularly for quality residential mortgages and term deposits, caused the 18 basis points

decline in the Bank's margin. The lower level of interest rates led to a significant decline in the

yields earned from investing non-interest bearing and low cost funds, including shareholders'

equity.



<p><b>T</b>hese factors, partially offset by an increase in interest recoveries, resulted in

interest margins declining 14 basis points compared to the prior quarter.



<p><b>E</b>conomic conditions continued to have a favourable impact on the equity markets,

and for the sixth consecutive quarter, the Bank realized more than $20 million in securities gains

with $25 million earned this quarter.



<h4>CREDIT QUALITY AND PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES</h4> 

<b>A</b>s a result of continued improvement in the quality of loans to corporate borrowers in

Canada, net impaired loans decreased $97 million during the quarter to $395 million at April 30,

1996. Net impaired loans as a percentage of total loans and bankers' acceptances declined to

0.5%, the lowest level in over a decade.



<p><b>T</b>he estimated provision for credit losses for 1996 remains unchanged from the first

quarter at $170 million. One-quarter of the estimate for 1996, or $42 million, was charged

against income in the second quarter.



<h4>OTHER INCOME</h4>

<p><b>O</b>ther income was a record $400 million in the quarter, increasing $99 million or

33% over the prior year. This surpassed, by $26 million, the previous record of $374 million set

in the fourth quarter of 1995. Other income contributed 38% of total revenue this quarter versus

31% in the second quarter last year. This performance illustrates the importance of investing in

new non-interest revenue generating businesses which help us meet the changing financial needs

of our customers and diversify our sources of revenue.



<p><b>A</b>s a result of higher trading volumes by our customers and expansion of operations,

Green Line Investor Services, our discount broker, and TD Evergreen Investment Services, our

full service broker, realized strong revenue growth. This growth accounted for one-third of the

increase in total other income. The brokerage and mutual funds management businesses were

beneficiaries of a strong RRSP season.



<p><b>F</b>oreign exchange and derivative products revenue and fees for services related to

credit, mergers and acquisitions, and underwriting benefitted from favourable market conditions.

Increased sales activity and number of active cardholders led to increased card service revenue.



<P><b>C</b>ompared to the prior quarter, other income increased $30 million or 8%, with

brokerage revenue representing over 50% of this increase.



<h4>NON-INTEREST EXPENSES</h4>

<b>A</b>s the growth in expenses of 12% over the same quarter a year ago (excluding the

acquisition cost of Lancaster) exceeded the growth in total revenues of 11%, the Bank's

productivity ratio deteriorated from 59.8% to 60.7%. Of the increase in expenses, two-thirds is

attributable to continued expansion and increased activity in our securities businesses and to

performance related compensation. In addition, an enhanced marketing campaign and further

development of the Bank's computer and telephone banking systems led to increased expenses.



<h4>BALANCE SHEET</h4>

<P><b>A</b>t April 30, 1996, total assets were $115 billion, an increase of $11 billion or 10%

over a year ago. The increase in assets was due to greater trading activity undertaken by the Bank

which resulted in increases in securities held for trading, securities purchased under resale

agreements and cash resources. Total loans declined during this period as the increases in

residential mortgages, personal loans and loans to small and mid-sized businesses in Canada only

partially offset the decline in lending to large corporate borrowers in North America.



<P><b>A</b> favourable development was the 5% increase in personal non-term deposits from

a year ago and 4% increase compared to last quarter. Mutual funds managed by the Bank again

exhibited strong growth as customers continued to prefer mutual funds to term deposits in this

low interest rate environment. At quarter end, mutual funds totalled $7.7 billion compared to

$5.1 billion last year. This contrasts with personal term deposits which were virtually flat from a

year ago.



<P><b>A</b>s a result of a further decline in market interest rates and continued strong equities

markets, the market value of the Bank's securities portfolios held for investment and liquidity

purposes at April 30, 1996 was $52 million above book value, compared to $40 million below

book value at October 31, 1995.



<h4> CAPITAL</h4>

<b>E</b>arnings after dividends of $136 million for the quarter primarily accounted for the

increase in common equity during the quarter. Compared to last quarter end, risk-weighted assets

have increased $1.3 billion. With these changes, the ratio of net common equity to risk-weighted

assets remained unchanged at 7.0% from the previous quarter but up from 6.4% a year ago.

<head><title>June/July/August 1992 HOMES</title>
</head>
<p><b>June/July/August 1992</b>
<h1>Insuring Your Mortgage</h1>

<B>by Linda J. Binns</b>
<p>
Not too long ago, Federal Housing Minister Elmer McKay cut the minimum down payment required by the Canada Housing and Mortgage Corporation in half, from 10 per cent to five per cent.  Eligible are first-time home buyers defined as anyone who buys and/or builds a home during the last five years, and intends to occupy it as his/her principal residence.
<p>
This means that the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. (CMHC) will provide guarantees on mortgages covering up to 95 per cent of the price of a home.
<p>
Say a couple is looking at a $200,000 home.  They need as little as $10,000 in cash for a 5 per cent down payment under new federal rules.  The rules don't mention, however, that mortgage insurance will add 2.5 percentage points to the cost of financing.  So a 9.5 per cent five-year mortgage will actually cost a highly leveraged buyer 12 per cent, or an additional $5,000 a year on a $200,000 mortgage.  Depending on your own situation, and how quickly you want to enter the housing market, it might be better to wait and make a bigger down payment.
<p>
Limits of the value of homes eligible for the five per cent down payment vary from a high of $250,000 in the Toronto area to as low as $125,000 in other parts of the country.
<p>
The maximum Gross Debt Service Ratio was raised to 35 per cent, meaning that buyers using First Home Loan Insurance may consume up to 35 per cent of their gross family income for payments of principle, interest, property taxes (P.I.T.) and heating.
<p>
At the time of introduction, CMHC believed this action would convert 10,000 renters to homeowners, which now turns out to be a conservative estimate.
<p>
Since launching the First Home Loan Insurance Plan and the Home Buyer's Plan (whereby you can withdraw up to $20,000 from an RRSP to put towards the purchase of a home), roughly 14,000 Canadians took advantage of these initiatives within the first 30 days.
<p>
Overall, the program is a positive step because it allows qualified purchasers with good incomes and sufficient job stability, particularly young couples, to get into the housing market faster. A few cautionary notes, though.  Be careful not to overextend yourself and remember that the down payment is only the start. Rising property taxes and the ongoing costs to maintain your home must also be considered.
<p>

<h3>Nine Months ended July 31, 1995</h3>


<h3>FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS</h3>

<CENTER><IMG ALIGN=bottom
SRC="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/Research/quarter/gifs/table1.gif"
ALT="Table of Financial Highlights"></CENTER>

<UL> <LI>Earnings per share reached record level of $.71. <LI>Net interest margin
improved 15 basis points from the prior quarter, mainly due to interest
recoveries. <LI>Other income increased 18% over a year ago to a new high. <LI>Net
non-accrual loans decreased $129 million from previous quarter. <LI>Loan loss
estimate for 1995 was reduced to $200 million, the lowest level since 1988.
<LI>Productivity ratio improved from the previous quarter and a year ago to
58.4%.<hr> </UL>

<h3>LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS</h3> <B>TD</B>'s third quarter earnings reached record
levels at $225 million or $.71 per common share, up 42% per share from the third
quarter of 1994. This earnings growth reflected strong performances throughout
the Bank, and improving credit conditions, which led to increased interest
recoveries, higher credit fees and lower loan losses.

<P><B>N</B>on-accrual loans resumed a downward trend as large recoveries and
repayments more than offset a major addition during the quarter. We expect this
improvement to continue, and we have revised our loan loss estimate for the year
to $200 million, a reduction of $40 million. We charged $40 million of the loss
estimate to the third quarter, compared to $60 million in each of the first two
quarters of 1995, and $88 million in the third quarter of 1994.

<P><B>W</B>e are pleased to report that the improvements in TD's financial
performance were widespread - extending through our retail banking, business
banking, corporate and investment banking in Canada and the United States,
brokerage, trust, mutual fund and VISA businesses.

<P><B>H</B>ighlights of activities during the quarter include:

<H3>Investment banking momentum - in Canada and the U.S.A.</H3>

<P><B>O</B>ur investment banking businesses continued to show momentum through
the quarter as our asset securitization group became a leader in the Canadian
market, our institutional sales, trading and research business grew rapidly, our
new merchant banking unit made an exceptionally strong start, and our fixed
income trading and sales operation was significantly expanded in Toronto and
London, England. Just after quarter end, we received regulatory approval to
expand Toronto Dominion Securities (USA) Inc. to underwrite and deal in debt and
equity securities in the United States. Our initial U.S.A. focus will be on high
yield public debt products in sectors where TD has established a strong corporate
banking presence - communications and media, forest products and health care.

<H3>Green Line Investor Services Inc. enters the U.S.A</H3>

<P><B>G</B>reen Line - Canada's market leading discount broker - opened a
subsidiary in the United States during the quarter, to offer a full range of
products and services with particular emphasis on prompt access to the Canadian
market and dual currency accounts. Currently registered in New York, Green Line
Investor Services (U.S.A.) Inc. plans to expand sales to all 50 states.

<H3>Mutual fund performance improvement</H3>

<P><B>O</B>ur Green Line Family of No-Load Mutual Funds showed solid growth
during the quarter, reflecting strong fund performance. Of particular note was
our Science and Technology Fund which topped <I>The Globe and Mail</I> one year
performance category each month over the period.

<H3>"Mainstreet" banking for small and mid-sized businesses</H3>

<P><B>T</B>o build further on the substantial growth we have achieved in our
loans to small and mid-sized businesses - and to enhance service to customers -
we are expanding delivery of Business Banking Services through our branch
network. Our goal is to make business credit and banking services available
through all our 960 branches in Canada, up from 400 at the beginning of the year.
Since March, we have extended this service to 275 branches, bringing the total to
675.

<H3>"Your Bank. Your Way." through satellite banking in the Yukon</H3>

<P><B>I</B>mproving access to banking services is fundamental to achieving our
vision of making TD "Your Bank. Your Way." for every customer, and we moved
forward in the development of convenient electronic services during the quarter
with the launching of satellite banking in Old Crow, a remote community north of
the Arctic Circle in the Yukon. In a community without telephone land-lines,
residents now have access to electronic branch banking.

<H3>Advancement of women</H3>

<P><B>A</B>s we work to be a leader for shareholders and for customers, we are
also committed to being a leading employer. We are therefore taking immediate
action on the recommendations of TD's Task Force for the Advancement of Women to
enhance opportunities for women and improve workplace practices for all employees
of the Bank. We have appointed a senior officer to oversee the process, and we
will report on progress on a regular basis.

<P><B>W</B>hile the economic climate and consumer confidence in Canada remain
uncertain, we expect economic growth to continue into 1996, and we believe TD is
well positioned to build further on the strong performance seen in the third
quarter.

<h3>REVIEW OF OPERATING PERFORMANCE</h3>

<P><B>Y</B>our Bank achieved record level earnings in the third quarter of 1995
of $225 million. Net income increased $63 million or 39% over a year ago and $61
million from the previous quarter. These strong results were primarily generated
by record other income and an improvement in the quality of the Bank's loan
portfolio which led to a lower provision for credit losses and significantly
higher interest recoveries.

<P><B>N</B>et income per share for the third quarter of 1995 at $.71 was
substantially higher than the $.52 earned in the previous quarter and the $.50
reported last year. These improved earnings from a year ago produced increases in
the return on assets to .85% from .66% and in the return on common equity to
16.0% from 12.3%.

<P><B>A</B>s a result of the Bank's performance in the first nine months of 1995,
net income increased to $568 million or $1.79 per share from prior year's $488
million or $1.52 per share despite the $22 million after-tax acquisition costs of
Lancaster Financial Holdings Inc.

<H3>Net interest income</H3>

<P><B>N</B>et interest income on a taxable equivalent basis increased $55 million
to $692 million from a year ago. This increase was generated by a 7% growth in
the Bank's average earning assets to $94.0 billion, and a 5 basis point
improvement in the Bank's net interest margin - the first year over year margin
increase since the first quarter 1994. The margin improvement to 2.92% was
attributable to high interest recoveries totalling over $45 million compared to
$9 million a year ago.

<P><B>C</B>ompared to the preceding quarter, the Bank's margin rose 15 basis
points as a result of a $33 million increase in interest recoveries and a decline
in market interest rates. Branch banking margins remained stable.

<P><B>D</B>uring the quarter, the equities markets in North America continued to
be robust, enabling the Bank to realize $21 million in net investment securities
gains compared to $2 million a year ago.

<H3>Credit quality and provision for credit losses</H3>

<P><B>D</B>ue to the improvement in the financial condition of several large
corporate borrowers and despite a major addition during the quarter, non-accrual
loans declined $129 million to $815 million at July 31, 1995. We expect this
improvement to continue, and we have revised our loan loss estimate for the year
to $200 million, a reduction of $40 million. We charged $40 million of the loss
estimate to the third quarter, compared to $60 million in each of the first two
quarters of 1995, and $88 million in the third quarter of 1994.

<H3>Other income</H3>

<P><B>O</B>ther income for the quarter of $330 million was a record. Compared to
the same quarter a year ago, increases in all categories were experienced except
for revenues from foreign exchange and derivative products which were slightly
lower than a year ago, but the highest in four consecutive quarters. Revenue from
service charges grew as the number of accounts and activity by our customers
increased. Your Bank in both Canada and the United States generated a significant
increase in corporate credit fees. Increased market activity by our customers and
expansion of the operations of TD Evergreen Investment Services Inc., the Bank's
full service broker, led to strong growth in revenue from investment and
securities services. Card services income increased, reflecting continued growth
in usage of the TD/GM Visa Card and the inclusion in the 1994 results of
significant start-up costs.

<H3>Non-interest expenses</H3>

<P><B>N</B>on-interest expenses for the quarter increased 10% over the same
period a year ago. Of this increase, 7% was due to the expansion of our
securities businesses and performance related compensation.

<P><B>A</B>s the growth rate of the Bank's total revenues exceeded that for
expenses, the Bank's productivity ratio for the quarter improved to 58.4% from
60.4% in the third quarter 1994 and 59.9% in the previous quarter.

<H3>Balance Sheet</H3>

<P><B>A</B>t July 31, 1995, the Bank's total assets were $104.9 billion, an
increase of 7% from a year ago largely due to higher levels of trading securities
together with a 5% increase in our residential mortgage and personal loan
portfolio. Business and government loans and bankers' acceptances remained
unchanged from a year ago, but declined $2.0 billion from last quarter as a
result of repayments by large corporate borrowers.

<P><B>T</B>he market value of the Bank's debt and equity securities portfolios
held for investment and liquidity purposes at July 31, 1995 was $109 million
below cost, an improvement of $247 million from October 31, 1994. The improvement
in the market value of the debt portfolio resulted from the continuing decline in
market interest rates during the quarter that increased the value of our Canadian
and U.S. government bonds which have an effective average remaining term to
maturity of 1.5 years.

<P><B>T</B>he Bank's personal deposits increased $1.0 billion or 2% from a year
ago, as individuals increased their investments in term deposits. Compared to a
year ago, the mutual funds managed by the Bank increased 3% to reach $5.7
billion, as an increase of 10% during the quarter more than offset decreases in
prior quarters in 1995.

<H3>Capital</H3>

<P><B>D</B>uring the quarter, the Bank's common equity experienced significant
growth of $159 million, primarily through increased earnings after dividends of
$149 million.

<P><B>A</B>s a result of this growth, the Bank's ratio of net common equity to
risk-weighted assets increased to 6.7% from 6.3% a year ago and 6.4% the previous
quarter.

<H1>TD GOLD TRAVEL CARD</H1>
<H2>Travel Points Programme</H2>

<A NAME="tr"><H3>Redeeming Your TD Points</H3></A>


<P>When you've earned enough TD Points for your TD Travel by Design package or
your own TD Travel by Choice travel selection, simply call our Redemption Centre
to arrange your <A HREF="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/disclaim.htm#free">FREE</A> travel.<BR>


<P>You can use the system to obtain:
<UL>
<LI>your current TD Points balance
<LI>TD Travel by Design information
<LI>general TD GOLD TRAVEL CARD Programme information
<LI>information on special offers
<LI>partner information
</UL>


<P><I>Please note that TD Points may be redeemed for leisure travel
only and only the primary Cardholder may request a redemptions.</I> 

<P>The TD GOLD TRAVEL CARD Redemption Centre will endeavour to book every
request. However, your travel is based on available space and seating, and is subject
to the terms and conditions of the travel supplier.

<P>As payment for any travel booked, the 
TD GOLD TRAVEL CARD Redemption Centre will accept either TD Points only, or a 
combination of TD Points plus "Cash" (i.e. a payment debited to your TD GOLD TRAVEL CARD). In the latter case, you will earn one TD Point for every dollar you spend.

<P>The Cardholder may redeem TD Points for any travel arrangement (i.e. hotel, car rental, etc.) contingent upon the travel supplier accepting prepayment terms and providing there is sufficient time to allow for prepayment processing.

<P>The Redemption Centre will also accept full "Cash" payments for the purchase of companion tickets made in conjunction with a TD Points redemption for an identical trip. In this case, you will earn 5 TD Points for every dollar you spend.

<P>A comprehensive outline of the terms and conditions involved with
booking travel options is available upon request through the TD GOLD TRAVEL
CARD Redemption Centre, or at any TD Bank Branch.

<H1>TD GOLD TRAVEL CARD</H1>
<H2>Travel Points Programme</H2>


<H3>Choosing Your Reward</H3>

<P>To help you enjoy the maximum benefits of the TD GOLD TRAVEL CARD Programme,
we have created two different ways for you to choose your reward.  You can
customize your trip according to your own wishes ("TD Travel by Choice") or
save time and money by choosing from a series of pre-designed vacations, including
travel and accommodations ("TD Travel by Design"). For each option, you
can obtain "<A HREF="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/disclaim.htm#free">Free</A> Travel" by applying your TD Points, or obtain <A HREF="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/disclaim.htm#discount">discounted</A>
travel by using a combination of TD Points plus <A HREF="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/disclaim.htm#cash">cash</A>.

<UL>
<A NAME="tc"><LI><H3>TD Travel by Choice</H3></A>
<P>This option allows you to use your TD Points towards the purchase price of your own custom designed dream vacation.
<P>When you've decided where you want to go, consult the table below to
determine the discount you'll receive.  You may find your trip is either
free or is available at a "discounted" rate.</ul>
<P>
<CENTER>
<table border=1>
<tr><td align=center>Travel Discount</td><td align=center>TD Points Required</td></tr>
<tr><td align=center>$100</td><td align=center>10,000</td></tr>
<tr><td align=center>$225</td><td align=center>15,000</td></tr>
<tr><td align=center>$375</td><td align=center>25,000</td></tr>
<tr><td align=center>$525</td><td align=center>35,000</td></tr>
<tr><td align=center>$750</td><td align=center>50,000</td></tr>
</table>
</CENTER>


<P><I>TD Points totalling less than 50,000 may only be redeemed in the increments shown here.</I>
<P><I>TD Points totalling more than 50,000 can be redeemed by combining point values from the chart above for the maximum dollar value 
(i.e. 55,000 points = 25,000 + 15,000 + 15,000 points = $825). 
</I>
<P>
<P><I>Subject to change with notice.</I>

<P>The TD GOLD TRAVEL CARD Redemption Centre can help you choose the most 
beneficial way of redeeming your TD Points for TD Travel by Choice vacations. You can use TD Points to purchase multiple travel 
tickets. However, each discount increment can only be applied to one ticket at a time.

<P>Please note that if you redeem more TD Points than are required for the total purchase price of your travel selection, there will be no cash refunds nor reinstatement of TD Points to your account for the unused portion.

<A NAME="t1"><H3>Earning TD Points</H3></A>
<UL>
<LI>Purchases made on the Card to supplement TD Points redemption also earn 1 TD Point for every dollar charged to the Card. (TD Points are awarded only for net purchases of goods and services for personal use, or business travel and entertainment.)

<LI>Credits for returned items will reduce or 
cancel the TD Points earned by the amounts originally charged. Under no circumstances will your TD Gold Travel Card Points account go into a negative position. Should credits for returned items reduce your TD Points balance to a negative position, the cash equivalent of the negative balance will be charged to your TD Gold Travel Card VISA account. 

<LI>Cash Advances, annual Card fee, service or interest charges and business purchases (save and except for travel and entertainment) are excluded from earning TD Points. Twin Cheques transactions are also excluded, unless they are used to purchase travel at Carlson Wagonlit Travel from a travel supplier that does not accept VISA as payment.
</UL>

<A NAME="t2"><H3>Earning TD Points with Carlson Wagonlit Travel</H3></A>

<UL>
<LI>5 TD Points are earned for every dollar charged to your Card at TD's travel partner, Carlson Wagonlit Travel, except when you are redeeming your TD Points for a travel discount, in which case you will earn only 1 TD point for every dollar you spend to supplement your TD points.

<LI>Note: Bonus Points are not earned in the following circumstances: Any bookings for travel at corporate rates, hotel, car rental, and/or other purchases that are not or cannot be prepaid by Carlson Wagonlit Travel.

<title>April 1994 HOMES</title>

<p><b>April 1994</b> <h1>GST & Your Real Estate Deal</h1> <b>By Linda J.
Binns</b> <p>

Whether you're buying or selling a home, the Goods and Services Tax, or GST, will
probably apply to the transaction.  However, with GST rebates and exemptions,
figuring out its impact can be confusing.  Real estate professionals know how it
works and can help you understand what it means to your transaction. <p> The
Goods and Services Tax replaced the Federal Sales Tax in 1991.  Although the tax
is collected at a rate of 7% on the sale price of goods and services, it doesn't
apply to every type of home or real estate service. <p> New home purchases are
subject to GST but may qualify for a rebate.  Resale homes are sold without GST. 
Land may be exempt from tax but realtors and other professionals must charge GST
on the services they provide.  If this sounds confusing, let's hope that the
outline below, prepared in part by the Ontario Real Estate Association, helps
answer your questions*.


<h2>GST On New Homes</h2>

When you buy a newly constructed home, condo or townhome, the entire purchase
price, including land, is taxable.  If the property is to be rented to tenants,
the full 7% GST is charged on the purchase price.  However, if the home is going
to be your primary place of residence, it may qualify for a partial GST rebate,
depending upon the sale price. <p> For homes costing $350,000 or less, you will
receive a rebate of 36% of the GST paid, to a maximum of $8,750.  That means you
pay approximately 4.5% GST (not 7%) on the purchase price. <p> New homes selling
for $450,000 or more do not qualify for a GST rebate.  If you purchase a
substantially renovated home from a builder who supplies both the land and the
house as a single transaction, the same GST rebate conditions apply.  Ask your
realtor to explain how the government defines "substantially renovated".


<h2>GST and Land</h2>

Buyers who purchase land separately may have to pay GST on the sale price
depending on the previous use of the land.  When you build a new home on your
land, then you will pay GST on the construction costs of the house, less any
applicable rebate. <p> If you paid GST on the land, the rebate would be the same
as for a new home which means that when the total value of the land and home is
$350,000 or less, the rebate would be 36% of the GST paid on the building to a
maximum of $8,750. <p> If GST was not paid on the land, and the value of the land
and home is $350,000 or less, the rebate would be 10% of the GST paid on the
building to a maximum of $1,720.


<h2>GST and Resales</h2>

You don't have to pay GST on the purchase price of a used residential home. 
Revenue Canada defines "used residential property" to include an owner-occupied
house, condo, apartment, summer cottage, vacation property or non-commercial
hobby farm.  It refers to "used" as residential property that has been occupied
as a residence before you bought it. <p> An owner-occupied home is considered a
residential property when it's used as your primary residence.  So, if you are
self-employed and purchase a resale home that includes a room used as an office,
the entire home still qualifies for the GST exemption. <p> If, however, your
owner-occupied home is not used mainly for residential purposes (for example, a
retail store with a small apartment upstairs), only the residential portion is
exempt from GST on resale.  The non-residential portion of the purchase price is
taxable.

<h2>GST and Real Estate Transactions</h2>

GST applies to most of the services provided in completing your real estate
transaction.  For example, 7% GST is applied to the commission a realtor charges
for facilitating a sale.  The tax is paid by the person responsible for paying
the commission - usually the seller. <p> Realtor commissions are taxable even if
the total GST owed is reduced by a rebate, or the sale of the property is exempt
from GST.   If you sell a used home, the sale price is exempt from GST but the
realtor's commission is still taxable. <p> GST applies to many other services
involved in the real estate transaction.  These include fees for appraisals,
referrals, surveys and legal assistance.  Again, GST is charged on these fees
regardless of whether the house you purchase is exempt from the tax. <p> One
exception is that mortgage broker fees are charged separately from any taxable
real estate commissions.  Additionally, mortgages and interest on mortgages are
GST exempt.


<h2>When is GST Payable?</h2>

GST is normally due and payable when the real estate transaction is completed
i.e. on the closing date.


<h2>More Questions?</h2>

The Ontario Real Estate Association puts out an excellent series of free booklets
on everything from Buying a Home, Selling a Home, and Working with a Realtor to
Affording a Home, RRSP Homebuyers' Plan and GST and Real Estate. <p> Revenue
Canada also produces a free booklet called GST Information for Home Buyers and
it's available from your local Revenue Canada office.



<h2>Example A:</h2>

Let's say that your new home costs $150,000.  The 7% GST is $10,500, less a 36%
rebate of $3,780.  So, you pay $6,720 in GST.  Here's how it computes:

<pre> 1) $150,000 x 7% = $10,500 2) $10,500 x 36% = $3,780 3) $10,500 - $3,780 =
$6,720 </pre> The maximum rebate is $8,750.  The rebate for new homes costing
between $350,000 and $450,000 declines to zero on a proportional basis, using
this formula. <p> Rebate = [$8,750 x $450,000 - (home price)] \ $100,000


<h2>Example B:</h2>

You buy a new home for $400,000.  Your GST rebate is $4,375, and the total GST
owed is $23,635. <pre> 1) $400,000 x 7% = $28,000 (GST) 2) [$8,750 x ($450,000 -
$400,000)] / $100,000 = $4,375 GST rebate 3) $28,000 - $4,375 - $23,635 (Total
GST owed) </pre>

<head><title>How Do I Forward Negotiable Certificates Safely?</title> <h2>How Do
I Forward Negotiable Certificates Safely?</h2>

<p><b>All securities or stock certificates forwarded to Green Line must be in
negotiable form. Here's how to do it safely.</b><br><br> If you deliver them to
your TD Bank branch in person, please do not endorse the certificates 
before you get there.  A branch staff member will be pleased to assist you.<br>
<br>

If you send them to Green Line by regular mail, please do endorse each
certificate as follows:</p>

<ol> <li>Do not fill in the blank spaces on the certificate. <li>Write
"Green Line Investor Services" as Attorney in the space provided on the
back. This gives us Power of Attorney and renders your endorsed certificate
non-negotiable without our signature. It also means you may safely mail the
certificate by regular mail.

<li>Date the certificate. <li>On the back of the certificate 
sign your name exactly as it appears on the front. If a certificate is in the
name of two or more parties, all parties must sign.

<li>Write your Green Line account number below your signature.This will make sure
your certificate is deposited to the correct account. </ol> <br> <b>Important
Reminders:</b> <ol> <li>If the stock is registered in a company name, you must
submit a corporate resolution with each certificate. <li>If the stock is
registered in the name of a Family Trust or Investment Club, provide sample
signatures of signing officers on the proper trust agreement forms or Investment
Club forms available from <a
HREF="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/Greenline/english_/branch_locations.html">Green
Line</a> or any TD Bank branch. <li>If securities are for a <a
HREF="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/RRSP/gen_sd.htm">Green Line
Self-Directed RSP</a> or <a
HREF="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/RRSP/rrif.htm">RIF account</a>, please
indicate the number of the plan and whether the stock is intended as a
contribution or a security swap in or out of the plan. </ol>

The RRSP Home Buyer's Plan is scheduled to expire March 1, 1994 and participants must acquire their homes before October 1, 1994.
<p>
The Plan, which allows individuals to use up to $20,000 from their own RRSP funds towards the purchase of a home, eliminates having to choose between saving for a home and saving for retirement.
<p>
Since it was introduced almost two years ago, the Department of Finance reports that there have been 198,952 withdrawals from RRSP accounts to help Canadian households achieve their home ownership goals.
<p>
In a recent survey of Canadian homebuyers, 17% said the RRSP Home Buyer's Plan contributed in part to their downpayment and 79% said that the Plan was important in their decision to purchase.
<p>
Booklets on the Home Buyer's Plan are available from Revenue Canada and should you have any questions, contact the General Enquiries service of your local taxation office.
<p>
There is a move afoot to have the government extend the program but their are no guarantees that it will happen.
<p>
When qualified OHOSP (Ontario Home Ownership Savings Plan) planholders purchase a first home, an application may be made directly to the Ministry of Revenue for a full or partial refund of the Land Transfer Tax.
<p>
To open a OHOSP, a person must be 18 years of age or older; be an Ontario resident; have a valid SIN; never have owned an OHOSP before; and his/her spouse must not have owned a home since their marriage.  
<p>
OHOSP funds will be released for the purchaser of an eligible home situated in Ontario and suitable for year-round residential occupancy.
<p>
Although December, 1993 is the deadline for opening an OHOSP, the deadline for OHOSP Tax Credit claims is December 31, 1997 and all funds must be removed from OHOSPs by  December 31, 1999.  For more information on the OHOSP program, call 1-800-263-7965. 

<h2>
A House-Hunting We Will Go!</h2>

Finding the right home is a matter of good planning, not good luck.  You can't possibly do it all or know it all so rely on qualified professional assistance.
<p>
Before starting your househunting expedition, take time out to determine how much you can afford.  Based on your income and expenses, your real estate representative or your banker can help you calculate the maximum amount of mortgage you can obtain and, in most cases, can even provide you with a pre-qualification certificate.  Then you can shop with confidence, knowing exactly the amount of mortgage you qualify for, and that you will be able t afford it.
<p>
Here's the quick rule of thumb: if you plan to borrow funds through a conventional mortgage, multiply the money you have available for a downpayment by four and this should equal the cost of your home.  For instance, if you have $40,000, you may qualify to purchase a home with an appraised value of $160,000 ($40,000 x 4 = $160,000).  
<p>
Pre-qualifying for a mortgage also serves another purpose...it shows vendors that you are serious and the validity of your offer can swing negotiations in your favour.


<h2>Selecting A Real Estate Agent</h2>

A good real estate representative will spend a lot of time researching the market for you and looking after your needs.  You may be spending a great deal of time with this person so make sure that you are comfortable with your representative  and that they are familiar with your particular market area.
<p>
It's better to be selective and place your faith in one representative who will look after your needs rather than work with a number of people.
<p>
Some real estate companies also offer value-added programs by networking with other major corporations to save on your moving and household costs.  Make a point to ask about any special offers.

<title>February 1993 HOMES</title>

<p><b>February 1993</b>

<h1>Pay Yourself First</h1> <b>by Linda J. Binns</b> <p>

You may not have realized  it, but you can hold a mortgage on your own home in a
self-directed RSP or retirement income fund (RIF).  Mortgages can be eligible
investments for self-directed RSP of RIF and, depending on prevailing mortgage
rates, can produce better returns for your plan than many other investment
options.


<h2>How it works</h2>

Your self-directed RSP or RIF holds the mortgage as investment.  Every month, you
pay your plan, not your financial institution, the principal and interest due. 
Instead of depositing money with the bank, which in turn makes a mortgage loan to
you, your plan can loan you the money directly. <p> This allows you to enhance
the performance of your plan by paying yourself first.  You'll earn a rate of
return equivalent to current mortgage rates.  If that's better than what you are
currently earning in your plan, then arranging your mortgage through a
self-directed RSP or RIF may help your savings grow faster.


<h2>What you need to pay yourself first</h2>

To hold your own mortgage in your self-directed RSP or RIF, you must meet these
requirements: <ul>

<li>Your self-directed RSP or RIF must have sufficient funds available to make
the mortgage loan.

<li>The mortgaged property must be a residential property located in Canada
(single or multiple units, limited to six units).

<li>The mortgage must be insured by Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation
(CMHC) or the Mortgage Insurance Company of Canada (MICC).  If the mortgage is a
second mortgage, then both the first and second must be insured.

<li>The mortgage must be a new mortgage with terms and rates identical to those
currently available through your bank.  Your present mortgage must be maturing or
open for repayment in order to be refinanced in your self-directed RSP of RIF.

<li>You must meet the usual NHA lending requirements, such as loan-to-value
ratio, total debt service ratio, credit worthiness, insurability, etc. </ul>

<h2>Partially funded mortgages </h2>

Even if you don't have the full amount required for a mortgage in your
self-directed plan, you can still hold a portion of the mortgage. <p> Say you
want to take out a $100,000 mortgage on a property, but you only have assets of
$25,000 in your self-directed plan.  You can still use these funds to partially
finance your mortgage.  You apply $25,000 from your RSP or RIF and, if you
qualify, your bank could lend you the remaining $75,000.  Your regular mortgages
payments will be apportioned between the bank and your self-directed plan.  The
total mortgage must be insured.


<h2>You may also lend to others</h2>

Your self-directed plan can also hold mortgages on properties owned by others. 
Examples include: <ul> <li>A "non-arm's length" mortgage is a mortgage on
property owned by a person who is related to you such as your spouse, children,
grandchildren, or parents.  A "non-arm's length" mortgage must meet all of the
same requirements as your own mortgage, and it cannot be given to a corporation,
even if it is related to you.

<li>An "arm's length" mortgage is a mortgage given to any person not related to
you, and with whom you deal at "arm's length".  Revenue Canada looks at the
interest rate and payment terms to decide you are, in fact, dealing at "arm's
length" with the borrower.  These mortgages need only be secured by real property
located in Canada to qualify.

<li>An "arm's length" mortgage may be given to a corporation, providing you
and/or your relatives to not control it and you are dealing at "arm's length"
with the corporation. </ul>

<h2>What it costs to set up</h2>

Keep in mind that the set-up costs may be offset by a higher rate of interest
from your mortgage investment.  Usually these are one-time only costs. <p> For
instance, with a Green Line Self-Directed RSP of RIF, you will incur the one-time
costs, such as appraisal and legal fees, that are common to arranging any
mortgage. <p> There's also a mortgage set-up fee of $100, and an annual mortgage
administration fee of $200.  These fees are in addition to the regular, annual
administration fees for a self-directed plan.  They may be tax deductible if paid
from funds outside of your plan, provided the mortgage funds your plan loaned to
you are used for investment in securities or in business opportunities.


<h2>Other cost considerations</h2>

Total estimated five-year administration cost is $1,600. <p> Additional fees in
the first year: appraisal (about $175) and legal fees (roughly $600 to $800). <p>
Mortgage insurance, which is usually .50 per cent to 2.5 per cent of the mortgage
loan, depending on your loan to value ratio.  You can pay the mortgage insurance
fee in a lump sum or with your mortgage payments.  For a $50,000 mortgage,
insurance could amount to $500.  Arm's length mortgages do not require mortgage
insurance. <p> The principle amount of the mortgage.  Many of the costs are
fixed, and will represent a larger percentage of a smaller mortgage. <p> The
difference between mortgage rates and other investment rates of return.  A larger
spread will cover the costs more quickly. <p> The term of the mortgage.  A longer
term allows more time to recover your fixed costs. <p> Estimated grant total of
five-year costs is $2,875 or $575 annually.


<h2>More handy tips and benefits</h2>

Here are some final tips, additional background information, and further benefits
of holding a mortgage in a self-directed RSP or RIF. <p> If you and your spouse
are jointly responsible for your mortgage, all-or part-of the funding for your
mortgage can be made from your spouse's RSP, your own RSP, or both. <p> Your
principle and interest payments do not prevent you from making your regular
annual RSP contribution, up to your allowable limits. <p> If you use the mortgage
funds you plan loans to you for investment in securities or in business
opportunities, your interest payments and set-up costs may be tax deductible and
therefore improve your after-tax income. <p> You can pay your annual
administration fees out of your RSP or RIF funds, or pay them yourself.  If
payments are made outside your plan, they generally are tax deductible. <p>
Should you sell a property financed by your plan, you must demand that the
purchase be in cash, and let the purchaser arrange his/her financing. <p> A
"non-arm's length" mortgage allows you to lend money from your plan to yourself
or any other family member without collapsing your plan and paying tax.  That's
because you are substituting a mortgage investment for other investments.


<h2>To find out how</h2>

It may very well be advantageous for you to refinance your present mortgage and
hold it in a self-directed RSP or RIF in order to benefit from better terms and
rates than your present RSP or RIF investments.  Talk to your financial
institution. <p> To find out more about investing in mortgages through a Green
Line Self-Directed RSP or RIF, contact your local Green Line office or nearest TD
branch.

New TD Travel Values&reg; joins our successful TD <A HREF="design.html">Travel by Design</A>&reg; and TD <A HREF="reward.html">Travel by Choice</A>&reg; programmes to give you more flexibility in your travel plans!
<P>
And now until October 31, 1996, you can redeem fewer TD Points than ever before on one or any combination of our four new travel options. With TD Travel Values, you can redeem TD Points to go anywhere, any time of the year. Simply call us with your travel request, and we will arrange a great price for whatever travel plans you want to make, whether it be a <A HREF="#air">flight</A>, a <A HREF="#acc">place to stay</A>, a <A HREF="#rental">car rental</A>, or a complete 
<A HREF="#package">holiday package</A>. 


<P><B>A few days here, a quick flight there...</B><BR>
You can use TD Travel Values to get away for a few days of R & R, book a flight to visit relatives, arrange some personal time around a business trip, or plan the vacation of a lifetime. 


<P>Since you can now travel for fewer TD Points, you can enjoy a travel reward sooner than you thought with TD Travel Values&reg; even when you redeem as few as 1,000 TD Points plus "Cash". It couldn't be any easier than this!
<P>
Just call the TD GOLD TRAVEL CARD Redemption Centre and one of our Travel Representatives will gladly assist you with your request*!

<h1>THROUGH THE MORTGAGE MAZE</h1>
<b>By Linda J. Binns</b>
<p>

Times have certainly changed.  It used to be that the toughest choice you had to make was which of the one to five year fixed rate mortgages you would choose.  Now there's an array of mortgages to consider, but how do you decide which is best for you?
<p>
Should you select an open mortgage, a convertible mortgage, a variable rate mortgage, a multi-rate mortgage or the newest offering...a capped variable rate mortgage.  
<p>
While individual circumstances vary, here's a general "at-a-glance" guide to this myriad of mortgage options.  Not all products are available at all financial institutions.  Your branch mortgage specialist is still your best point of reference for all your financing questions.


<h2>CONVERTIBLE MORTGAGES</h2>

Think rates will decline further before they begin to rise again?  A short-term convertible mortgage may be your answer.  You benefit from the lower rate of a closed mortgage for six months, with the option of converting it to a longer term, at no cost any time during the six months.
<p>
Advantage: You can leave your options open and convert at no cost.


<h2>VARIABLE RATE MORTGAGES</h2>

If you think that interest rates will continue to fall, this may be the right mortgage for you.  If rates drop, more money is put towards your principal balance (which pays off your mortgage faster); should rates rise, more is paid towards the interest.  When you feel that rates are as low as they'll go, you can always convert to a fixed mortgage for a small fee.
<p>
Advantage: You can use the equity in your home to take advantage of declining interest rates.


<h2>CAPPED VARIABLE RATE MORTGAGES</h2>

Like other variable rate mortgages, the rate fluctuates, but with a capped variable rate mortgage, the cap limits how high your rate will go.  Some capped variable rate mortgages remain at their ceiling once it's reached and won't go lower when the prime rate declines, while others drop as prime declines.  Most are available for a five year term with only Toronto Dominion Bank offering both a three-year and a five-year capped variable rate mortgage. 
<p>
Advantage: Projection and flexibility.  You can enjoy the full benefit of declining interest rates with limited risk to rising rates.  


<h2>FIXED RATE MORTGAGES</h2>

Fixed rate mortgages can save you money by providing safe, fixed rate financing with good repayment features.  Such mortgages are available in a range of terms from six months to 10 years. 
<p>
Advantage:  Combines the security of fixed rate financing with good repayment features.  


<h2>ONE-YEAR OPEN MORTGAGES</h2>

Ideal if you will soon be selling your home.  This is a fixed rate mortgage with a one-year term that can be renegotiated at any time should interest rates go down.  
<p>
Advantage: Pay down your mortgage at any time without administration or prepayment costs.


<h2>MULTIPLE RATE MORTGAGES</h2>

You can "custom-build" your own mortgage by dividing your mortgage into parts, each with its own rate,  amortization and term.  Available at Toronto Dominion Bank, Canada Trust and National Bank, only TD lets you split your mortgage up into as many as five parts and, via a special enquiry system, can show you, in minutes, the money-saving impact of your various choices.
<p>
This lets you reduce the risk of putting all of your mortgage into shorter terms by allowing you to lock in a portion of your mortgage into longer terms.  Interest costs can be reduced by thousands of dollars without taking unacceptable risk.  
<p>
Advantage: Lets homeowners pay less interest to interest rates. 
<p>
With mortgages more complex than in the past, it makes good financial sense to discuss your needs with the mortgage specialist in your branch so, together, you can determine the right mortgage for you.

<h2>ON THE MOVE: Ways to Save on Your Mortgage, on Moving Costs, and other Bank Services</h2>
<b>By Linda J. Binns</b>
<p>

One of the best kept secrets is that some financial institutions and moving companies have joined forces to develop special packages that could save you hundreds of dollars.
<p>
For instance, if you arrange the mortgage on your new home with Toronto Dominion Bank through AMJ Campbell Van Lines of Tippet-Richardson, you are eligible for 1/4 per cent off TD's published mortgage rate and a free property appraisal.  Plus, depending on the moving company, you receive a cash rebate equal to 1/4 per cent off the total dollar value of the mortgage deducted from your moving bill, free bonus travel points, free dinners and, in some cases, a reduction off the hourly rate on your move.  Both national moving companies offer other value-added services as well.
<p>
By deducting the cash rebate from your moving bill, you stand to save anywhere from $250 on a $100,000 up to $500 on a $200,000 mortgage.
<p>
The special moving packages vary slightly depending on whether it's AMJ Campbell or Tippett-Richardson, but both these national van lines have solid reputations for service performance.
<p>
You can find out more about these mortgage assistance programs by calling your local Tippet-Richardson of AMJ Campbell office.  You can also contact TD's Bankline at 982-BANK in the Toronto area or 1-800-465-BANK for more details.
<p>
While on the line, ask about TD's Moving Package of free banking services.  When you open or transfer your TD account to your new location, you receive a free order of personalized cheques with your new address and account number, no-charge chequing and safety deposit box storage for three months, and the first $1,000 of your Visa travellers cheques are commission-free.  Best of all, you can receive either the TD Self-Service Plan or the Premium Service Plan, and the services that they encompass, at no charge for three months just to get you settled in your new home and neighborhood.
<p>
If you need it, there is also a special rate moving loan up to $2,500 at TD's prime lending rate plus one per cent per annum.
<p>
Whether you're moving across the street or across the country, moving is hectic but it doesn't have to be disorganized.  There are lots of little details involved, so we put together a couple of convenient checklists to help you plan your move.
<p>

<head><title>How Do I Settle My Trade?</title> </head> <BODY BGCOLOR="#ffffff">



 <h2>How Do I Settle My Trade?</h2>



Green Line is required by industry regulations to close out trades which are not settled promptly.

And, since any losses resulting from these "buy-ins" or "sell-outs" will be your responsibility,

here are some things you should remember.<br><br>



<b>Settlement Dates for Different Investments</b><br> Please make sure that funds for

securities you buy or certificates for securities you sell are in your Green Line account by: 



<ul>

<li>Canadian, U.S. and Foreign Equities - the 3rd business day following the day of transaction 

<li>Mutual Funds - the 3rd business day except money market mutual funds, which settle on the

next business day

<li>Short Term Bonds (3 years or less) - the 2nd business day

<li>Long Term Bonds (over 3 years) - the 3rd business day

<li>Mortgage-Backed Securities - the 3rd business day 

<li>Money Market Instruments - the same day

<li>Canadian and U.S. Options - the next business day 

<li>Gold and Silver Certificates - the 2nd business day </ul> 



<b>Here's what to look for on your trade Confirmation Statement.</b>

<ul> 

<li>Description of securities bought/sold 

<li>Unit price of securities traded 

<li>Settlement date of your trade

<li>Settlement amount including <a

href="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/RRSP/trade.htm">commission</a>

</ul> 



<p><b>Convenient Cash Deposits</b><br> 

You can make a cash deposit to your Green Line account at any TD Bank branch.



<p><b>When Selling</b><br>

To avoid late settlement charges and ensure prompt payment to you, please make sure that

securities or stock certificates you sell are in your Green Line account or delivered to a Green

Line office prior to placing your order.







<p><b>Free Safekeeping</b><br>

For your convenience, we recommend that your securities be lodged in your Green Line account

at all times. That way, you won't have to monitor delivery deadlines and make repeated trips to

the Bank. Green Line provides free safekeeping on all securities held in our nominee name

except gold and silver  certificates.



<p><b>Convenient Transfer of Securities</b><br>

If your securities or certificates are not already in your Green Line account, you may forward

them through any TD Bank branch free of charge, but do allow extra time so that they can be

delivered to our Toronto Operations Centre by settlement date.



<p>You may also forward securities and certificates by regular mail. (Please see <a

href="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/Greenline/english_/How_do_I_forward.html">"How Do I

Forward Negotiable Certificates Safely?"</a> for important details on certificate transfer.)

<head><title>June/July/August 1994 HOMES</title>
</head>
<p><b>June/July/August 1994</b><h1>Make a Dream Home List and Stick to It</h1>
<b>By Linda J. Binns</b>
<p>

Location, location, location. Often referred to as the three most important things about house buying, location says it all.  There's no point considering a house that's on a busy street and next door to a sausage factory, or is wedged between two schools, one hospital and across from a public park.  As a general rule, asking price usually reflects the location.
<p>
Decide what your house must offer you - it could be three bedrooms, a fireplace, lots of storage space and a big yard.  Or it might be a view, sunny exposure, and a large master bedroom.  
<p>
But be realistic.  After searching for a house, you may need to revise the list to better fit your pocketbook.


<h2>Extra Features Add Value</h2>

What features are likely to add to a home's value?  According to a cross-Canada survey of residential appraisal experts who are members of the Appraisal Institute of Canada (AACI), these features include:
<ul>
<li>master bedroom and ensuite bath combination;
<li>separate living room and dining rooms;
<li>family rooms;
<li>garage.
</ul>
These features can improve the chances of resale at a good value in the future.
<p>
For buyers able to afford luxury features, appraisers recommended looking for mainfloor laundry rooms, two-car garages and energy-saving features such as high efficiency furnaces.


<h2>Home Cheap Home</h2>

Everything's relative, right?  Depending on what side of the fence you're on.  Ever thought about setting up house in another country?  Well, consider this.
<p>
How about a nice five-bedroom townhouse in Moscow for $500,000?  Or an apartment in Chelsea, London for a cool $4 million?  A Century 21 survey of executive homes in 21 world cities show even the most luxurious homes in Canada are inexpensive.
<p>
Even a 3,000-square foot home starts at $500,000 in Montreal's Westmount and $750,000 in Toronto's Rosedale area.  On Vancouver's west side, a 4,000-square-foot home starts at about $650,000.  But that's just pennies in your pocket.
<p>
Compare this to Tokyo where a small 1,200 to 1,500-square-foot home starts at $3 million.  And, in Hong Kong, executives pay up to $15 million for a house that's 3,000 to 10,000 square feet.
<p>
In Honolulu, a 3,500-square-foot, four-bedroom home starts at $750,000.  And In Los Angeles' upscale Brentwood, count on $500,000 for 2,500 square feet.
<p>
All things considered, the grass looks pretty green on this side of the fence.


<h2>Tips On Renewing Your Mortgage And Saving Money</h2>

When you renew your mortgage, always ask how much the payments should be if you  shortened the amortization period (the time needed to pay off the mortgage completely) by a few years.
<p>
Also see if you can pay your mortgage weekly or bi-weekly.  Paying weekly means that you will make 13 months of payments each year instead of 12.
<p>
Again, this will save you thousands of dollars in interest and get rid of your mortgage years sooner.  Look, too, for the flexibility to make extra payments at no cost to you.
<p>
One of your best investment strategies should be to pay off your mortgage as quickly as possible.  You probably won't find a risk-free, worry-free investment that will pay you as much after tax as putting money into your own mortgage.

<h2><center>Quels placements puis-je s&eacute;lectionner?</center></h2>



<p>Quels que soient vos objectifs, la Ligne Verte est l'endroit tout indiqu&eacute; en raison de

sa vaste gamme de choix de placement attrayants. Nous sommes en liaison constante avec le

march&eacute; de sorte que vous puissiez obtenir les cours les plus r&eacute;cents et

l'ex&eacute;cution rapide et pr&eacute;cise de vos ordres. Lors de n&eacute;gociations d'actions,

la Ligne Verte vous permet de r&eacute;aliser des <A

HREF="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/Greenline/french/TD_French_brochure.html">&eacute;conomies sur les commissions</a> pouvant atteindre <a HREF="#84">88 %*</a> par rapport

&agrave; celles imput&eacute;es par les courtiers traditionnels au Canada. Vous profitez

&eacute;galement de commissions r&eacute;duites sur les transactions d'unit&eacute;s de fonds

mutuels et d'options.</p>



<h3>Actions canadiennes, am&eacute;ricaines et &eacute;trang&egrave;res</h3>

<p>Toujours en r&eacute;alisant de remarquables &eacute;conomies, vous pouvez acheter ou

vendre des actions sur toutes les bourses nord-am&eacute;ricaines.  De plus, pour vous permettre

d'&eacute;largir vos horizons, nous offrons la n&eacute;gociation en temps r&eacute;el d'actions

cot&eacute;es aux bourses des pays suivants: Australie, Allemagne, Hong Kong, Japon, Suisse

et Royaume-Uni.



<h3>Fonds mutuels</h3> 

<p>Plus de 500 fonds mutuels sont mis &agrave; votre disposition (et la liste s'accro&icirc;t!).

Voil&agrave; une excellente fa&ccedil;on de constituer un portefeuille diversifi&eacute; sans

avoir &agrave; choisir de titres en particulier.</p>



<p>La Ligne Verte vous permet de souscrire et de vendre un vaste &eacute;ventail

d'unit&eacute;s de fonds mutuels canadiens avec frais d'acquisition, toujours en vous faisant

r&eacute;aliser des &eacute;conomies sans pareilles sur les commissions. Vous pouvez

&eacute;galement effectuer votre s&eacute;lection parmi notre liste croissante de fonds mutuels

sans frais d'acquisition, lesquels remportent actuellement un immense succ&egrave;s. </p>



<h3>Obligations d'&Eacute;tat et de soci&eacute;t&eacute;s</h3>

<p>Gr&acirc;ce &agrave; la Ligne Verte, vous pouvez souscrire et vendre diverses obligations

&eacute;mises par le gouvernement du Canada, les gouvernements provinciaux et les

soci&eacute;t&eacute;s. Ces transactions s'effectuent sur le march&eacute; secondaire, et les

coupures sont aussi minimes que 5 000 $. Nous offrons &eacute;galement des obligations

&agrave; coupons d&eacute;tach&eacute;s.</p>



<p>Il est possible de souscrire des obligations dans le cadre d'une nouvelle &eacute;mission ou

sur le march&eacute; secondaire. Puisque les obligations sur le march&eacute; secondaire se

n&eacute;gocient hors cote, les cours sont fix&eacute;s par voie de n&eacute;gociations entre

acheteurs et vendeurs, sans qu'un interm&eacute;diaire n'intervienne.</p>



<p><b>Rappel important :</b> La Ligne Verte n'exige aucune commission pour la

n&eacute;gociation d'obligations, &agrave; l'exception des obligations am&eacute;ricaines, de

celles n&eacute;goci&eacute;es en bourse et des lev&eacute;es d'options sur obligations.</p>



<h3>Titres hypoth&eacute;caires</h3>

<p>Les titres hypoth&eacute;caires, assur&eacute;s par la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; canadienne

d'hypoth&egrave;ques et de logement (SCHL), regroupent &agrave; la fois certains avantages

des hypoth&egrave;ques r&eacute;sidentielles et des obligations du gouvernement du Canada en

vue d'offrir aux investisseurs les caract&eacute;ristiques suivantes : s&eacute;curit&eacute;,

liquidit&eacute;, rendements concurrentiels et commodit&eacute; d'un revenu mensuel.</p>



<h3>Titres du march&eacute; mon&eacute;taire</h3>

<p>En raison de la qualit&eacute; exceptionnelle attribu&eacute;e &agrave; bon nombre de

titres du march&eacute; mon&eacute;taire, des taux de rendement concurrentiels qu'ils

g&eacute;n&egrave;rent et de leur excellente liquidit&eacute;, ces titres constituent

habituellement de bons v&eacute;hicules de placement pour les sommes oisives. Choisissez

parmi des bons du Tr&eacute;sor du gouvernement du Canada et des provinces, des certificats de

placement garanti (CPG) offerts par un nombre croissant d'institutions, des obligations

d'&Eacute;tat &agrave; court terme, des d&eacute;p&ocirc;ts &agrave; terme, des

d&eacute;p&ocirc;ts swap, des acceptations bancaires, du papier commercial et du papier de

soci&eacute;t&eacute;s de financement. Durant la campagne des Obligations d'&eacute;pargne

du Canada et des provinces, nous mettons &eacute;galement ce v&eacute;hicule de placement

&agrave; votre disposition.</p>



<h3>Options canadiennes et am&eacute;ricaines</h3>

<p>La Ligne Verte est membre de Trans-Canada Options Inc. Nous vous proposons des

&eacute;conomies sur les commissions en plus de l'ex&eacute;cution rapide et pr&eacute;cise de

vos ordres d'options sur actions, indices, obligations et m&eacute;taux pr&eacute;cieux et ce, sur

les march&eacute;s canadiens et am&eacute;ricains. Nous pouvons ex&eacute;cuter tout type de

strat&eacute;gies d'options.</p>



<h3>Certificats de m&eacute;taux pr&eacute;cieux</h3>

<p>Vous pouvez, en quelques minutes, vendre ou acheter des certificats d'or ou d'argent en

communiquant tout simplement avec la Ligne Verte. Ces certificats sont immatricul&eacute;s, ce

qui &eacute;limine les co&ucirc;ts li&eacute;s aux lingots ainsi que le risque de perte

mat&eacute;rielle sous les formes suivantes : pi&egrave;ces, plaquettes ou barres.  Veuillez noter

que les certificats d'or et d'argent ne sont pas admissibles

aux RER et aux FRR.</p>



<h3>Nouvelles &eacute;missions</h3>

<p>La Ligne Verte peut, en temps opportun, vous aviser des nouvelles &eacute;missions

d'actions et de titres d'emprunt. Elle peut &eacute;galement ex&eacute;cuter les ordres relatifs

&agrave; de telles &eacute;missions.</p>

 <h2><center>Quels sont les points &agrave; Retenir?</center></h2> 

<h3>Dressez la liste des ordres que vous donnez</h3> 

 

<p>Pour chaque ordre que vous donnez, veuillez noter les renseignements suivants, &agrave;

titre de r&eacute;f&eacute;rences : 

<ul>

<li><A

HREF="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/Greenline/french/quand_devrais-je_placer.html">heure et

avez donn&eacute; votre ordre, &agrave; moins qu'ils n'aient &eacute;t&eacute;

<h3>Informez nous toujours des modifications et des annulations</h3>



<p>De temps &agrave; autre, il se pourrait que vous souhaitiez modifier, remplacer ou annuler

un ordre donn&eacute; ant&eacute;rieurement, ce qui est tout &agrave; fait faisable, avant que

l'ordre ne soit ex&eacute;cut&eacute;. Cependant, rappelez-vous de toujours exprimer clairement

vos intentions &agrave; votre repr&eacute;sentant.</p>



<p>Le fait de passer un nouvel ordre pour un m&ecirc;me titre n'annule pas automatiquement

l'ordre ant&eacute;rieur, et toute perte qui en d&eacute;coule ou toute duplication d'un ordre sera

imput&eacute;e &agrave; votre compte.</p>



<p>Par cons&eacute;quent, si vous placez un ordre identique &agrave; un ordre

d&eacute;j&agrave; transmis, ou s'il s'agit d'un ordre pour un m&ecirc;me titre, mais que le

cours diff&egrave;re, rappelez-vous de toujours nous indiquer s'il s'agit d'un nouvel ordre

(enti&egrave;rement nouveau), d'une modification apport&eacute;e &agrave; l'ordre

pr&eacute;c&eacute;dent ou d'un ordre qui annule un ordre ant&eacute;rieur.</p>



<P>Remarque: Les modifications et les annulations seront effectu&eacute;es dans la mesure

o&ugrave; l'ordre n'aura pas encore &eacute;t&eacute; rempli.

<p><b>September 1991</b>
<h2>The Ins And Outs Of Financing Leisure Property</h2>
<b>By Linda J. Binns</b>
<p>

Your dream of a home away from home - a cosy retreat in cottage country, a winter chalet, or a vacation home you live in half the year - is about to become a reality.
<p>
You've found the right property, now all you need to do is find the right financing, suited to your needs and budget.  Most financial institutions are quite willing to finance leisure property but you should be aware of the criteria that apply.


<h2>What To Expect</h2>

Banks may finance up to 75 percent of the appraised value or the purchase price - whichever is lower.  The same is true if you are building, except that the loan amount will be based on:
<p><ul>
<li>The lower of the total construction cost plus land value.<br>
or...
<li>The appraiser's estimate of the value of the project when completed.
</ul><p>
This means that you must contribute a minimum of 25 percent of the cost from your own resources.  If you are building  your leisure home, this "down payment" may be by way of land value.
<p>
Certain banks may require a larger down payment depending on a variety of circumstances (location, accessibility, quality of property etc.).
<p>
Some builders who erect pre-fabricated homes may have special financing  arrangements in place with a particular financial institution.  If you have a sizeable equity in your principle residence, another approach is to take out an additional mortgage on that property.
<p>
Keep in mind, however, that to meet financing requirements, the vacation property should be serviced by both electricity and drinkable water.
<p>
Lenders will also take into consideration loan servicing ratios to ascertain whether the proposed loan payments can be met.  Known as "Gross and Total Debt Service Ratios", they are calculated as percentage of total family income.  The  Gross Debt Service Ratio includes the carrying cost of the family residence (i.e. mortgage/rent, heating and taxes) while the Total Debt Service Ratio includes the annual carrying cost of the family residence (i.e. GSDR) plus all other monthly debt payments including the proposed loan.  As always, a clean credit history is vital.


<h2>Wide Range Of Loan Options</h2>

You can select either a fixed or variable interest rate and you can choose to repay your loan over an extended time period.  Most banks will provide a personal loan supported by a mortgage as security and allow you to repay the loan over as long as 20 years.
<p>
Keep in mind that with a fixed rate loan your interest rate is typically set for a term from one to five years.  On a variable rate loan,  the rate changes in accordance with the prime rate.


<h2>Time And Convenience</h2>

Most lenders will try to give you tentative approval based on your credit history within a day.  Some banks can arrange your loan over the telephone in under two hours.


<h2>Loan Insurance</h2>

At the same time you arrange a loan, you should also consider protecting yourself with loan insurance.  For just a few extra dollars a month, the insurance will cover your personal loan payments in case you can't as a result of your death or disability.


<h2>Loans For All Seasons</h2>

Whether you are looking to finance a vacation property, recreational vehicle, cars, boats, home renovations or  investments, talk to your financial institution.

<head><title>How Do I Place An Order?</title> </head>

<h2><a href="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/Greenline/english_/electronic.html">How Do I Place An Order?</a></h2>



<p>To place an order, simply call your local Green Line office.Your Account
Representative will guide you through the process, step by step.<br><br>

this is your first trade to the Account Representative.<br><br> <li><b>The account you are trading through</b>.<br>
Cash, Margin, <a
href="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/RRSP/gen_sd.htm">Green Line
Self-Directed RSP/RIF</a>, Quebec
Stock Savings Plan.

If this is your first trade, please note that cash or securities must be in your
account to cover the total amount of the trade (for both margin and cash
accounts).<br><br>

<li><b>Specify: Buy or Sell order.<br><br></b>

<li><b>Specify: Number of units in your order.</b><br> For example, 100 shares.<br><br>

<li><b>Indicate: The security of the company you are trading, including the security class.</b><br>

For example, common or preferred stock.<br><br>

<li><b>Indicate: The type of order you are making.</b><br>

Please say if the order is not a market order and indicate any special terms of
execution (e.g., "all or none").For "Good Till Cancelled" orders, say how many
calendar days you wish the order to remain open (maximum 30). For sell orders,
please say if Green Line is already holding the securities for you.<br>

order.

This is because we cannot cancel an order unless you ask us to, and any losses
that may result from uncancelled orders will be charged to your account.
Similarly, please say if you are simply changing the price of a previous order,
since failure to do so could result in a duplicate order for which you would be
responsible.<br><br>

<li><b>Note: The currency in which you wish to trade.</b><br>

<b>Important:</b> If you're buying U.S. securities and don't have enough U.S.
funds in your account, always say if you want the trade to be settled using the
Canadian dollars in your account. Otherwise, an overdraft in U.S. dollars may
result within your account.</p> </ol>

<title>June/July/August 1991 HOMES</title>
<p><b>June/July/August 1991</b>
<h2>Banking Package Designed To Meet Moving Needs</h2>
<b>By Linda J. Binns</b>
<p>
Moving is a disorganized event at the best of times, even if you are only going across town.  If your moves takes you to another city or province, it seems just that much more complicated.
<p>
That's why TD has put together a package of products and services especially designed to take some of the hassle out of moving.  Just one quick to visit to your TD branch before you move can save you time, worry, and money, leaving you free to attend to other details.
<p>
So whether you're moving across town or across country, here's how TD's moving package can help make it easier.


<h2>Branch Referral</h2>

To save you valuable time and make you feel more at home when you arrive, we will help you select the most convenient TD branch at your new location, as well as provide you and your new branch with a letter of introduction, before you go. We'll also arrange for your funds, accounts, RRSP's and other savings to be transferred.


<h2>Free Cheque Writing</h2>

When we transfer and/or open a TD Investment Builder, Money Builder, Money Manager, or an account with the Personal Service Plan at your new branch, we will drop the service charge for writing cheques on any one of these accounts for six months.


<h2>Free Personalized Cheques</h2>

You'll also receive one free order of personalized cheques from your new branch showing your new address and account number.


<h2>Free Safety Deposit Box Or Safekeeping</h2>

Valuable documents or jewelry are the last things you need misplaced during a move.  The TD Moving Package offers you a free Safety Deposit Box, or the equivalent Safekeeping, for the rest of year (or a minimum six months if you move late in the year ).  Your valuables can be stores ahead of time, if convenient, or as soon as you arrive at  your new location.


<h2>Free Travellers Cheques</h2>

If you're moving across the country or across town, and prefer to carry Travellers Cheques, we'll waive the usual service charge on the first $1,000 of TD Visa Travellers Cheques you purchase.


<h2>Special Rate Moving Loans</h2>

A special rate 90 day moving loan for up to $2,500 with a maximum rate of prime plus one percent per annum is available to help look after some of those unexpected expenses.  you can repay this loan, without penalty, or convert to a monthly payment personal loan any time up to the end of the term (maximum 90 days), subject to normal credit approval.  TD's network of close to 900 branches across Canada ensures that we're able to serve you almost anywhere your move takes you.  And when you get there, you'll find that a TD pre-qualified mortgage simplifies a home buying.
<p>
Just knowing that you'll have a mortgage when you're ready to buy that new home relieves much of the anxiety of house-hunting in a new location.  That's why we've designed our flexible pre-qualified plan around your needs, to give you the maximum flexibility with the minimum fuss.  Simply select the methods that suits you best:
<ul>
<li>If you're in touch with one of our TD relocation centres through your employer, the centre staff will help you.
<li>
You can take advantage of our toll-free Bankline service. Call 1-800-465-BANK (in Toronto 982-BANK) for more information.
</ul></p>
Wherever you live in Canada, your local TD branch can pre-qualify your mortgage and issue you a  confirming certificate.  Then, when you're ready to buy, just call your branch, quote the certificate number, and they will introduce you to a convenient TD branch at your new location and fax your pre-qualification information.
<p>
At your new branch  our people will do everything they can to simplify your move by promptly handling your final application for a mortgage, and helping you choose the TD Equity Builder mortgage that suits your individual needs.
<p>
You can choose from a  range of short term  or long term mortgages with flexible payment options and competitive rates.


<h2>Personal Access Card</h2>

With your Personal Access card (Green Card), you can make a special transfer up to $2,000 from each existing TD account to each new account at your new branch when you arrive.  It means new accounts are ready to use immediately.  Plus, your Personal Access card allows you to do most of your day-to-day banking at The Green Machine.


<h2>Banking On The Move</h2>

A TD Green Visa Card with Green Machine privileges also allows you to bank at your convenience-day or night, at any Green Machine across Canada.  You can withdraw, deposit, transfer money, even pay bills or take a Visa cash advance.

<h2><center>Quels types de comptes puis-je ouvrir?</center></h2>

<p>Lorsque vous effectuez vos placements par l'entremise de la Ligne Verte, vous pouvez ouvrir
un compte au comptant ou un compte sur marge.

<p><b>Compte au comptant</b> 
<p>Vous pouvez ouvrir un compte au comptant si vous envisagez de r&eacute;gler en
totalit&eacute; chaque transaction. Puisque nous ne pouvons accorder de cr&eacute;dit dans le
cadre d'un compte au comptant, veuillez vous assurer que votre compte Ligne Verte renferme les
sommes suffisantes le jour du r&egrave;glement (g&eacute;n&eacute;ralement trois jours
ouvrables suivant la date de transaction) afin de r&eacute;gler les transactions effectu&eacute;es.

<p><b>RER et FRR autog&eacute;r&eacute;s Ligne Verte</b>
<p>Ces r&eacute;gimes complets vous permettent de mettre &agrave; l'abri de l'imp&ocirc;t
votre s&eacute;lection de placements admissibles, y compris les hypoth&egrave;ques.  Vous
recevrez un relev&eacute; mensuel concis et pr&eacute;cis et profiterez d'une gestion absolue et
de services de garde.

<p>Le FRR constitue un moyen s&ucirc;r et souple de mettre &agrave; l'abri de l'imp&ocirc;t
votre capital-retraite et de conserver le pouvoir d'achat de votre revenu de retraite pour les
ann&eacute;es &agrave; venir.  Vous pouvez transf&eacute;rer des &eacute;pargnes
d&eacute;tenues dans autant de RER que vous le d&eacute;sirez &agrave; votre FRR
autog&eacute;r&eacute; Ligne Verte. Aussi, vous serez en mesure de mieux g&eacute;rer les
versements de votre revenu.

<p>Administr&eacute;s par Services d'Investissement Ligne Verte, ces r&eacute;gimes

<head><title>What Types Of Orders Can I Place?</title></head> <h2>What Types Of
Orders Can I Place?</h2> <p>If you're not familiar with the expressions traders
use, here's a quick overview that will help you convey your instructions
precisely and accurately to your Green Line Account Representative.</p>


<h3>Market Order</h3>

<h4>"At the Market" Order</h4> <p>This is an order to buy or sell a security at the best available price. In most
cases, Green Line can confirm a market order while you're still on the
phone.</p>


<p>All orders that don't have a specific price are usually considered market
orders, which could mean paying the "offer" when buying or accepting the "bid"
when selling.</p>


<p><b>Important Reminder: </b>All bond orders are market orders only. All gold and silver orders below 500 oz.
gold and 10,000 oz. silver are market orders only.</p>



<h4>Limit Order</h4> <p>This is an order in which you set the maximum price
you're willing to pay as a buyer, or the minimum price you're willing to accept
as a seller. Except under special circumstances, Green Line does not accept
limit orders more than 10% off the market.</p>


<p>Remember, you can call Green Line at any time prior to
the execution of your trade to cancel or change the price on your limit order
or change it to a market order.</p>


<h4>There are three kinds of limit orders:</h4> <ul> <li><B>Day Order</B> -
valid only for the day on which it is entered. <li><B>Open Order, Good 'Till Cancelled Order (GTC) </b>- usually has a
specific price and remains valid until the order is executed or cancelled. The
order can remain open for a maximum of 30 calendar days and is automatically
cancelled without notice if not filled within that time. You should always keep
a record of your GTC orders. </ul> <h4>Stop Order</h4> <p>There are two kinds of stop
orders:</p> <ul> <li><B>Stop Loss Order</B> - an order to sell which becomes
effective as a market order when the price of a board lot of stock trades at
or below your stated stop price. <li><B>Stop Buy Order</B> - this order is the
opposite of a stop loss order. It is placed by an investor who has sold a
security short, as an attempt to reduce loss (or protect a profit) should the
price rise unexpectedly.</ul>

<p><b>April 1992</b>

<h1>Cashing In On Lower Mortgage Rates</h1>
<b>By Linda J. Binns</b>
<p>


Lower housing prices, lower interest rates, and the reduction in the minimum down payment all point to a very healthy market.  Whether you're renewing your mortgage now or in a few months, here are  some money-saving ideas that you can put to work-even during the term of your mortgage.
<p>
Let's look at Anne and Mike, whose mortgage is renewable in six months, with an outstanding balance of $80,000 and a remaining amortization of 21 years.  Their current rate is 11.5 per cent and their monthly payments are $828.04.  They're looking at a new five-year term at today's rate of 9.75 per cent, giving them a monthly payment of $737.00. 
<p>
Here are some options available to them.


<h2>Pay Principal at Renewal</h2>

The sooner they pay off their mortgage, the more they'll save.  And at renewal, they can pay down any amount they choose.  Even a small prepayment of $1,000 could save over $1,320.92 in interest over the remaining 21 years.  Their new monthly payment would also decrease from $737.00 to $727.29.  If they chose to keep their payment the same, they'd save $6,127.82 in interest over the life of their mortgage. 


<h2>Keep Monthly Payments the Same</h2>

At today's low rates, Anne and Mike can renew at 9.75 per cent.  Instead of letting their payments drop from $828.04 to $737.00, it would be wiser for them to keep their monthly payments at $828.04 and apply the $91.04 potential payment reduction to their mortgage principal.  
<p>
This will shave $32,550.01 from their total interest costs and reduce their amortization period to 15 years, 5 months, provided the 9.75 interest rate stays the same at every renewal.  


<h2>Alter Payment Schedule</h2>

Anne and Mike should switch from a monthly payment of $737.00, to a bi-weekly payment of $368.50 to coincide with their pay periods.  This amounts to one extra payment a year and saves $26,204.67 in interest over the life of the mortgage, as well as trimming 4 years, 18 weeks off the amortization period, providing the interest rate remains the same at every renewal.


<h2>Investigate Early Renewal Option 
</h2>
Many financial institutions also offer an early renewal option that Anne and Mike should take advantage of it if they can.  With mortgage rates at a 20-year low, and only six months remaining until their renewal date, it could be to Anne and Mike's advantage to lock-in now (unless, of course, they firmly believe that rates will fall further still).  There may or may not be an interest penalty-some institutions charge the lesser of either three months interest, the interest rate differential, or a formula based on the remaining term of the mortgage.  Despite the one-time cost, Anne and Mike can rest easy with the interest rate they wanted.  
<p>
Their other option is to wait it out and hope that interest rates continue to drop.  Either way, our couple should talk to their branch representative and have them plug a few "what if" scenarios into the computer to help them decide.


<h2>Other Money Saving Options
</h2>
Anne and Mike could increase their monthly payments, applying the difference to the principal, thereby reducing the amortization period, particularly if their income has increased and they are in a better financial position.
<p>
They should also review their Mortgage Life Insurance; this low-cost life insurance pays off the balance owing on the home should either one of them die, and is especially valuable for younger families with mortgages.  
<p>
Stay tuned next month when we talk about the new 5 per cent downpayment on CMHC-insured mortgages and how to use the money in your RRSP to buy or renovate your home.

<h1>Here's How Big Mortgage Savings Are Made</h1>
<B>by Linda J. Binns</B>
<p>

Most financial institutions offer you a complete range of mortgage products with payment plans to suit your budget.  Depending on the payment plan you select, you can save in interest costs, shorten your repayment period by years and pay off your mortgage more quickly.  Let's look at how the savings add up.


<h2>Weekly Repayment Plan</h2>

With weekly repayment options, you can suit your payments to your income schedule and budget.  Table 1 gives you an idea of the savings you can realize by selecting a weekly repayment option.


<h2>Rapid Paydown</h2>

Many lending institutions offer rapid paydown options.  A key feature is the ability to prepay your mortgage in a couple of different ways, without charge.          
<p>
The Toronto-Dominion Bank's Equitybuilder allows you to make a lump sum payment of up to 10 per cent of the original loan amount.  You can take advantage of this once a year on any regular payment date and it is not cumulative.  If your mortgage was $60,000, you can pay up to $6,000 as your lump-sum yearly payment.
<p>
Another money saving alternative is to increase your monthly payment (once per year on any regular payment date) by any amount up to a maximum of double your original payment over the term.
<p>
For instance, if you have a starting monthly payment of $500 on a three-year term, you can increase it up to $1,000.  You can do so all at once (by $500) in the first year -or by any amounts you choose that total $500 over three years.  And, if you find that the increase put too much strain on your budget, you can decrease it again by any amount down to the original monthly payment.  You can do all of this at no charge.
<p>
Table 2 below shows you some examples of how features like rapid paydown can reduce your mortgage costs.  On a $75,000 mortgage at 10 per cent, total savings can amount to over $101,900.  
<p>
Whether you're a new homebuyer or about to purchase your second or third home, there are several important factors to consider that can make your home financing as affordable as possible.  Make sure to check them out.

<head> <title>What Types Of Accounts Can I Open?</title><head> 



<h2>What Types Of Accounts Can I Open?</h2> 



<p>When you invest through Green Line, you can open a cash account and/or a margin

account.</p>



<h3>Cash Account</h3> 

<p>Open a cash account if you intend to pay cash in full for each purchase. Since we cannot

extend credit in a cash account, please make sure that all payments for your trade purchases are

in your Green Line account by settlement date (currently three business days after trade date).



<h3><a HREF="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/RRSP/gen_sd.htm">Green Line

Self-Directed RSP and RIF</a></h3>



<p>This comprehensive plan lets you shelter from taxes your choice of eligible investments,

including mortgages. You'll receive concise and accurate monthly reporting plus complete

administration and safekeeping.</p>



<p>RIFs are a safe and flexible way to shelter your retirement savings from tax and maintain the

purchasing power of your retirement income in later years. You can transfer savings from any

number of RSPs into your Green Line Self-Directed RIF and exercise more control over the way

your income is paid.</p>



<p> This plan is administered by Green Line Investor Services, which charges an annual

administration fee of $100 + GST.</p>



<h3><a HREF="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/RRSP/mutual.htm">Green Line

Focus RSP and RIF</a></h3>



<p>Green Line Focus RSP/RIF is a low-cost, Self-Directed plan designed to meet the needs of

invesotrs who want to hold some of the most popular registered plan investments. They include

over 500 mutual funds, GICs, Money Market Instruments, Canada and Provincial saving bonds,

corporate and government issued bonds, strip bonds, Mortgage Backed Securities and

cash.</p>



<p>This plan is administered by Green Line Investor Services, which charges an annual

administration fee of $25 + GST.</p></p>





<h3>Margin Account</h3> <p>Open a margin account if you wish to borrow money on

securities you currently own or intend to purchase. You must meet some basic

diversification requirements to trade on margin, but once your margin account is

approved we will make margin loans to you at a competitive rate of interest.</p>





<p>The margin requirement for equities is generally 50% of the market value. This

means you can buy $10,000 worth of marginable securities with only $5,000 cash in

your account when the order is placed.</p>





<p>The margin requirement for option eligible equities is 30%. Please ask your

Green Line Registered Representative about the margin rates that apply to

non-equity securities. Also please note:</p> <ol>



<li>The only stocks eligible for margin trading are those on the <a

HREF="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/Greenline/english_/when_should_i_place_my.html">TSE,

ME, VSE, ASE, NYSE and AMEX </a>and certain stocks on the NASDAQ Stock Market

exchanges. <li>Only stocks with market value of $3 and over are marginable.

<li>Margin accounts are not permitted for Self-Directed RSPs or RIFs. </ol>

<h2>Pre-Qualify for a Mortgage - To Make House Hunting Easier</h2>
<b>By Linda J. Binns</b>
<p>
Beginning your search for a home?  Now may be a good time to consider entering the housing market.  Mortgage rates have levelled off for the time being, housing prices have dropped over last year, and for buyers of new homes in particular, there are good deals to be had.
<p>
According to the Toronto Home Builders' Association's monthly report, new home sales jumped 49 percent in September, while homes sold by Toronto builders outside the greater Toronto region climbed 170 per cent compared to August sales.  And builders continue to entice buyers with perks such as 1991 closings with lower down payments, large lot sizes, free appliances, luxury amenities, and financing options such as buy-down and capped rates.
<p>
If you're uncertain about taking the plunge, you can make your house hunting more worry-free for pre-qualifying for a mortgage before you settle on the house of your dreams.  This means that you can look for a home knowing in advance how much you can expect from your bank.
<p>
How much house can you afford?  Most financial institutions will complete a pre-qualification certificate based on your income, the amount of your down payment, and any current liabilities.  The TD, and many other banks, will even guarantee their terms and conditions at a specific interest rate if you purchase your home and funds are advanced within  60 days of approval.  If rates go up during those 60 days, you receive the approved rate and if they go down, you receive the lower rate.  This means that you could realize substantial savings in interest costs.  If you are buying a new home, this guarantee can be for a longer period of time.  For details, contact your bank manager.
<p>
To determine the maximum amount of mortgage financing for which you qualify, visit your bank where a mortgage specialist will prepare a "purchaser profile" by calculating your gross debt service ration (GDS) and total debt service ratio (TDS).  
<p>
In real terms, most lending institutions look for a GDS ratio in the range of 27 per cent to 32 per cent.  This is the percentage of gross household income that lenders will allow borrowers to direct towards financing to cover mortgage principal and interest payments and property taxes.  Some financial institutions also include heating costs.
<p>
For example, if your gross household income is $100,000 and the GDS ratio is 32 per cent, then the amount available to you to make mortgage and tax payments should not exceed:
<p>
$100,000 x 32% = $32,000 or, a monthly amount of $32,000/12 = $2,666 per month.
<p>
Assuming an interest rate of 13.25 per cent on a five-year term and 25-year amortization (and a monthly loan factor of $11.21), a payment of $2,666 per month will finance a mortgage of $238,000, excluding taxes and heating costs.
<p>
Most financial institutions also use the TDS ratio to determine the maximum monthly debt payment which you can comfortably support.  The TDS is the ratio between gross annual income and total annual debts.  These debts include mortgage payments, credit card payments, loans, car payments and so on to meet the TDS requirements, total annual debts should not exceed 37 per cent of gross annual income.
<p>
In addition to the purchase price of a home, other costs such as land transfer tax, legal fees, appraisal fees, and moving expenses must be added to the total amount of money needed to complete a purchase.  On the purchase of a $200,000 home, these can quickly add up to between $3,000 and $5,000.


<Bz12>Determining your purchaser profile<Bz10>

A mortgage specialist will take you through these steps in preparing a pre-qualification certificate.
<p>
In most cases you can pick up a pre-qualification brochure and complete it at home or you can simply visit your branch and apply.  Pre-qualifying is easy, free and convenient - you should have your pre-qualification certificate in less than 24 hours. The mortgage amount and interest rate that appears on the certificate is subject to the usual credit review and a satisfactory property appraisal at the time of purchase.  
<p>
Completing a pre-qualification does not obligate you to arrange your mortgage financing with that institution if you come upon more favourable terms to suit your needs elsewhere.


<Bz12>Saving time and energy<Bz10>

With your pre-qualification certificate in hand, you have a clear idea of how much you're qualified to borrow, the appropriate price range for your new home, and the size of your mortgage payment.  
<p>
You've saved time because much of the paperwork involved in qualifying for a mortgage is done; you've saved energy because you're shopping with confidence in a price range you know you can afford.
<p>
Now you can relax and concentrate on the choices that exist in today's real estate market and the other more enjoyable aspects of house hunting.

behind the service.  You run around enough trying to find the perfect home.  So
when you finally find it, the next step is to get the best possible mortgage.

<title>April 1993 HOMES</title>

<p><b>April 1993</b>

<h1>Renovate With Ease</h1>
<b>By Linda J. Binns</b>
<p>


Renovations have become a multi-million dollar industry in Canada as homeowners regularly  upgrade the appearance and value of their dwellings.  Whether you're looking at small improvements or a major renovation, you should be able to count on your financial institution to make your financing easy and affordable.


<h2>Financing Options Designed To Fit Your Lifestyle</h2>

There's no point in making improvements if it means leaving yourself with less money to enjoy life.  To make your home improvements affordable, you can arrange your financing with monthly payments to fit your budget.
<p>
With an installment loan, you can choose a fixed interest rate and a term from one to five years so that you know exactly how much you're paying each month.  Or, you may decide on a variable rate that fluctuates with changing interest rates.  You can also use the equity in your home to secure the loan, which will give you the option of smaller monthly payments stretched over a period of up to 20 years.
<p>
Another route to consider is a personal line of credit.  Once established, you simply write a cheque for the funds (up to your maximum credit limit) as you need them.


<h2>Pre-qualify Your Loan For Faster Approval</h2>

Visit your financial institution before you begin your home improvement project to pre-qualify your loan.  This way you can determine exactly what you can afford to spend.  Then you can plan and budget for your renovations with the greatest of confidence.  
<p>
To save even more time, with one simple telephone call, some financial institutions can complete your pre-approval over the phone and even provide quick credit approval without you having to leave your home.


<h2>Competitive Rates</h2>

Shop around for rates just like you would with a mortgage.  There are some good deals to be found especially during this peak renovation season.  And check to see if there are any charges for pre-payment or early payout. One other important point.  Give yourself some peace of mind by insuring your loan.  For only a few dollars more, your loan payments are protected should anything serious happen that would prevent you from meeting your financial obligations.  


<h2>Valuable Information</h2>

Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) offers a variety of publications on just about every renovation subject.  Many of these booklets are free and there are even some "how-to" videos.  To obtain the CMHC catalogue of publications, check with your local CMHC office or order any directly, call or write:  CMHC Publications, 700 Montreal Road, Ottawa, Ontario, K1A 0P7, (613)748-2367.

<h1>Early Renewal Looks Good, But Is It For You?</h1>
<b>By  Linda J. Binns</b>
<p>

Just when you thought you had your mortgage finances in order, interest rates take a nose dive.  Now you're wondering if you should opt for early renewal and take advantage  of the new low rates.  Hmmm.  Sounds tempting, but hold on a minute.  You need to examine your financial goals.
<p>
The cost of mortgage debt is very high, especially in a low inflationary environment, such as now.  The number one way to attack that mortgage debt is to pay your mortgage off quickly.  If this is one of your medium to long term goals, it makes sense to apply any surplus cash directly to your mortgage. 
<p>
If your objective is to lower your mortgage payments to increase your immediate cash flow, breaking your mortgage contract to renew early is not necessarily the best (or only) option available.  If you have an open or a variable rate mortgage, you're on easy street; you can lock-in to a fixed rate mortgage at the low rate without charge.  But if you have a closed or fixed-rate mortgage, you will have to look carefully to see whether it pays to renew your mortgage early.


<h2>Does it Pay?</h2>

And does it pay?  Yes and no.  When you break your mortgage contract to renew your mortgage at a new rate and a new term, you are faced with a prepayment charge to reimburse your financial institution for the lost interest income.  As a basic rule of thumb, the prepayment charge is based on three months interest or the interest rate differential (that's the difference between you present mortgage rate for the balance of your term and the current rate you want to take out), whichever is greater.  
<p>
If your mortgage is insured by the Canadian Mortgage and Housing Cooperation, you pay a maximum penalty of three months interest after the third anniversary date of the interest adjustment period, or after the third anniversary date from your most recent renewal.  
<p>
The amount of the prepayment charge will tell you whether or not you should renegotiate your interest rate.  Generally speaking, the shorter your remaining term - ideally less than a year - the smaller the penalty, and the more attractive early renewal becomes.  On the other hand, the longer the term left on your mortgage, the greater the prepayment charge, which makes early renewal less desirable.


<h2>Weigh Pros and Cons</h2>

Regardless of the size of the prepayment charge, be prepared to pay it out in one lump sum.  Assuming that you have that money readily available in the first place, you will have to take it out from another interest earning investment, losing that income altogether.  You have to weigh what you will lose with what you might gain.  
<p>
If you don't have the money to pay the prepayment charge, you will have to borrow it.  That will likely mean refinancing your present mortgage, assuming you have sufficient equity in your home to cover the prepayment charge.  But then you are no longer renewing your mortgage; you are taking out a new mortgage or amending your existing one.  That adds to your costs because you will have to pay for legal, appraisal and registration fees if you refinance.  This is not the way to pay down your mortgage quickly.  Again, you have to decide if the cost of renewing early is greater than the money you stand to save.  
<p>
If you feel that you will come out ahead, then think about what term you should renew at.  That really depends on interest rates, and whether you think they are as low as they are going to get.  If you think rates have bottomed out, lock-in for the long-term.  Otherwise, keep the mortgage open until you see rates on the rise, and then go long-term.  An open mortgage is also a good idea if you are thinking of selling your home in the near future.  
<p>
If saving money on your mortgage is the goal here, try to keep your payments the same; you will save even more money by paying more towards the principal.  Or you could make lower payments - to ease your short-term cash flow - if your objective is to keep more money in your pocket.  


<h2>Review all Options</h2>

But before you go through the process of early renewal, review all your other options first.  As you can see, depending on your prepayment charge and other costs, refinancing might not make a huge difference to your mortgage.  In some cases it can cost you money.  So go back to square one and ask yourself if you have exhausted all the other opportunities to save money on your mortgage.  For example, if you actually have the cash to cover the prepayment charge, you could take that money and use it to pay off a portion of your mortgage.  This will decrease your principal and save you money in the long-term.
<p>
You can continue to make your pre-payments each year.  (You are allowed to pay from 10 - 15 per cent off your mortgage annually without charge or administration costs).  Still another way to save money on your mortgage is to pay your mortgage off faster with weekly or bi-monthly payments.  Before you consider renegotiating your mortgage, make sure you are doing everything possible right now to reduce the cost of your mortgage.  Then, if there's room to save extra money, see if early renewal is going to pay off for you.

<h3>Comment puis-je envoyer des certificats n&eacute;gociables sans risque?</h3></center>

<p><b>Tous les titres ou certificats d'actions achemin&eacute;s &agrave; la Ligne Verte doivent
&ecirc;tre sous forme n&eacute;gociable. Voici comment proc&eacute;der sans courir le
moindre risque :</b></p>

<p>Si vous les livrez vous-m&ecirc;me &agrave; votre succursale TD, veuillez ne pas endosser
les certificats avant d'arriver &agrave; la banque. L'un des membres du personnel se fera un
plaisir de vous aider.</p>

<p>Si vous les envoyez &agrave; la Ligne Verte par courrier, veuillez endosser chacun des
certificats comme suit :</p>

<ol><p><li>N'indiquez rien dans les espaces laiss&eacute;s en blanc.</p>

<p><li>Inscrivez &lt;&lt; Services d'Investissement Ligne Verte &gt;&gt; en tant que
fond&eacute; de pouvoir dans l'espace r&eacute;serv&eacute; &agrave; cet effet au verso. En
agissant ainsi, vous nous confiez un mandat, et le certificat endoss&eacute; devient non
n&eacute;gociable sans notre signature. Vous pouvez donc acheminer sans crainte le certificat
par courrier.</p>

<p><li>Apposez la date sur le certificat.</p>

<p><li>Au verso du certificat, veuillez signer votre nom tel qu'il appara&icirc;t au recto. Si
l'immatriculation du certificat comprend les noms de deux parties ou plus, tous doivent y apposer
leur signature.</p>

<p><li>Indiquez votre num&eacute;ro de compte Ligne Verte sous votre signature. De cette
fa&ccedil;on, le certificat sera d&eacute;pos&eacute; au compte appropri&eacute;.</p></ol>

<p><b>Rappels importants :</b></p></dd>
<ol><p><li>Si l'action est immatricul&eacute;e au nom d'une entreprise, vous devez
pr&eacute;senter une r&eacute;solution pour chaque certificat.</p>

<p><li>Si l'action est immatricul&eacute;e au nom d'une fiducie familiale ou d'un club de
placement, vous devez fournir des sp&eacute;cimens de signature pour les signataires
autoris&eacute;s et ce, sur les formulaires appropri&eacute;s relatifs &agrave; la convention de
fiducie ou au club de placement.  Vous pouvez vous procurer ces formulaires aupr&egrave;s
de la <A
HREF="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/Greenline/french/branch_locations_fr.html">Ligne
Verte</a> ou d'une succursale TD.</p>

<p><li>Si les titres sont destin&eacute;s &agrave; un <A
HREF="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/Greenline/french/RER_autogere.html">compte RER/FRR
autog&eacute;r&eacute; Ligne Verte</a>, veuillez indiquer le num&eacute;ro du r&eacute;gime
et sp&eacute;cifier si l'action constitue une cotisation ou un swap de titres &agrave;
l'int&eacute;rieur ou &agrave; l'ext&eacute;rieur du r&eacute;gime.</p></ol>

<head><title>Quels types d'ordres puis-je donner?</title></head>



<BODY BGCOLOR="#ffffff">

<h2><center>Quels types d'ordres puis-je donner?</center></h2>

<p>Si les expressions utilis&eacute;es par les n&eacute;gociateurs ne vous sont pas

famili&egrave;res, vous trouverez ci-dessous un bref survol des termes qui vous permettront de

formuler clairement les directives transmises &agrave; votre repr&eacute;sentant Ligne Verte.



<h3>Ordre au march&eacute; ou Ordre au mieux</h3>

<p>Il s'agit d'un ordre d'achat ou de vente d'un titre au meilleur cours possible. Dans la plupart

des cas, la Ligne Verte peut confirmer l'ordre au march&eacute; pendant que vous &ecirc;tes en

ligne.



<p>Tous les ordres qui ne portant aucun cours d&eacute;termin&eacute; sont

g&eacute;n&eacute;ralement consid&eacute;r&eacute;s comme des ordres au march&eacute;, ce

qui peut signifier que l'acheteur paie le prix de l'&lt;&lt;offre&gt;&gt; ou que le vendeur accepte

celui de la &lt;&lt;demande&gt;&gt;.



<p><b>Rappel important :</b> Tous les ordres portant sur les obligations sont exclusivement

des ordres au march&eacute;. Tous les ordres portant sur  l'or ou l'argent et inf&eacute;rieurs

&agrave; 500 onces, dans le cas de l'or, et &agrave; 10 000 onces, dans le cas de l'argent, sont

&eacute;galement consid&eacute;r&eacute;s comme des ordres au march&eacute;.



<h4>Ordre &agrave; cours limit&eacute;</h4>

<p>Ce type d'ordre vous permet de d&eacute;terminer le prix maximal que vous acceptez de

payer en tant qu'acheteur ou le prix minimal que vous &ecirc;tes pr&ecirc;t &agrave; accepter en

tant que vendeur. Exception faite de certains cas particuliers, la Ligne Verte n'accepte aucun

ordre &agrave; cours limit&eacute; si l'&eacute;cart par rapport &agrave; la valeur au

march&eacute; exc&egrave;de 10 %.



<p>Rappelez-vous qu'&agrave; tout moment pr&eacute;c&eacute;dant l'ex&eacute;cution d'un

ordre, vous pouvez communiquer avec la Ligne Verte afin d'annuler un ordre &agrave; cours

limit&eacute; ou d'en modifier le prix, ou pour le remplacer par un ordre au march&eacute;.



<h4>Il existe trois types d'ordres &agrave; cours limit&eacute; :</h4>

<ul>

<li><b>Ordre valable pour la journ&eacute;e</b> - Il s'agit d'un ordre qui n'est valable que la

journ&eacute;e o&ugrave; il est donn&eacute;.

<li><b>Ordre ouvert, ordre valable jusqu'&agrave; r&eacute;vocation </b>- Il s'agit d'un ordre

qui porte g&eacute;n&eacute;ralement un prix d&eacute;termin&eacute; et qui demeure valide

jusqu'&agrave; ce que l'ordre soit ex&eacute;cut&eacute; ou annul&eacute;. L'ordre peut

demeurer ouvert jusqu'&agrave; concurrence de 30 jours civils et devient automatiquement nul,

sans pr&eacute;avis, s'il n'est pas ex&eacute;cut&eacute; pendant cette p&eacute;riode. Vous

devriez toujours tenir une liste de vos ordres ouverts.

</ul>



<h4>Ordre stop</h4>

<p>Il existe deux types d'ordres stop :</p>

<ul>

<li><b>Ordre de vente stop</b> - Il s'agit d'un ordre de vente qui devient un ordre au

march&eacute; lorsque le prix d'un lot r&eacute;gulier d'actions atteint ou franchit le cours limite

que vous aviez stipul&eacute;.

<li><b>Ordre d'achat stop</b> - L'ordre d'achat stop est l'oppos&eacute; de l'ordre de vente stop.

Ce type d'ordre est plac&eacute; par un investisseur qui a vendu des titres &agrave;

d&eacute;couvert en vue de r&eacute;duire une perte (ou de prot&eacute;ger un profit) en

pr&eacute;vision d'une hausse subite des cours.

</ul>

<head><title>What Investments Can I Select?</title></head> 

<h2>What Investments Can I Select?</h2> <p>



<p>Whatever your objectives, one-stop investing with Green Line gives you access to a wide

range of attractive choices. Our contact with the market ensures up-to-the-minute quotes and

prompt, accurate execution of your orders. And with Green Line you enjoy <a

href="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/RRSP/trade.htm">commission discounts

</a>of up to <a href="#q1">88%*</a> over full-service brokers in Canada on equity trades and

reduced commissions on mutual funds and options trades.</p>



<h3>Canadian, U.S. and Foreign Equities</h3> 

<p>At significant commission savings you can buy or sell equities on all North American

Exchange. Real-time trading in exchange-listed securities offers you global advantages when

trading on world markets such as Australia, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, Switzerland and the

U.K. </p>



<h3>Mutual Funds</h3>

 <p>With over 500 to choose from (and still counting!), mutual funds are a good way to build a

diversified portfolio without having to select specific securities.</p>



<p>With Green Line you can buy and sell a wide variety of Canadian load funds with excellent

commission savings.  Or select from our growing number of popular no-load funds.</p>



<h3>Government and Corporate Bonds</h3> 

<p>Green Line's contact with the bond market lets you buy and sell a variety of Government of

Canada, provincial government and corporate bonds on the secondary market in denominations

as low as $5,000. We also offer strip bonds and zero coupon bonds.</p>



<p>You can purchase bonds as part of a new issue or in the secondary market. Because bonds in

the secondary market are traded over the counter, prices are established by negotiations between

buyers and sellers, with no central "exchange."</p>



<p><b>Important Reminder</b>: With Green Line, there are no commissions for bond trading

except for U.S. bonds, exchange traded bonds and option exercise bond transactions.</p>



<h3>Mortgage-Backed Securities</h3> 

<p>Guaranteed by the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), mortgage-backed

securities combine benefits of residential mortgages and Government of Canada bonds to offer

investors safety, liquidity, competitive yields and the convenience of monthly income.</p>



<h3>Money Market Instruments</h3> 

<p>Because many money market instruments are high quality, earn competitive yields and have

excellent liquidity, they're often a good place to invest idle funds. Choose from Government of

Canada and Provincial treasury bills (T-Bills), Guaranteed Investment Certificates (GICs) from a

growing range of participating institutions, short term government bonds, term deposits, swapped

deposits, bankers acceptances, commercial paper and finance company paper. We also offer

Canada and provincial Savings Bonds during campaign periods.</p>



<h3>Canadian and U.S. Options</h3> 

<p>Green Line is a member of Trans-Canada Options Inc. We offer commission savings plus

fast, accurate execution of orders on U.S. and Canadian exchange options including equities,

indices, bonds and precious metals. We can accommodate all types of potential option

strategies.</p>



<h3>Precious Metals Certificates</h3> 

<p>Call Green Line to buy and sell gold and silver certificates in minutes. These certificates are

held in registered form, which eliminates bar charges and the risk of physical loss of bullion in

coins, wafers or bars. Please note that gold and silver certificates are not RSP/RIF eligible

investments.</p>



<h3>New Issues</h3> 

<p>Green Line can provide you with timely notification and order execution on new issues of

equity and debt securities.</p>

<head><title>What Should I Remember To Do?</title></head> 



<h2>What Should I Remember To Do?</h2>



<h3>Keep a Record of the Trades you Enter</h3> 

<p>For your own reference, please make a note of the following details whenever you make a

trade: <ul>

<li><a

HREF="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/Greenline/english_/when_should_i_place_my.html">Date

and time the order was entered.</a> 

<li>Buy or sell. 

<li>Number of shares.

<li>Name of company and type of share. 

<li><a

HREF="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/Greenline/english_/what_types_of_orders.html">Type of

order and comments </a>(e.g. all or none order, how long a non-market order is to remain open). 

<li><a

HREF="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/RRSP/trade.htm">Price or terms agreed

to.</a>

<li>Account and currency. 

<li>Green Line Account Representative's name

<li>Order reference number.</ul>



<h3>Monitor your Open Orders</h3> 

<p>Every open order you make will expire without notice at the end of the period you specified

when you placed the order, unless it is executed or cancelled.</p>



<h3>Always tell us Changes and Cancellations</h3>

<p>From time to time you may wish to modify, replace or cancel an earlier order, which is

perfectly acceptable before the order is executed. But always remember to tell your Account

Representative exactly what you wish to do.</p>



<p>Simply making a new order for the same security does not automatically cancel your

previous order, and any resulting loss or duplicate order will be charged to your account.</p>



<p>So, if you place an identical order to one you've made previously, or an order for the same

security at a different price, always tell us if it's a new (additional) order, a change to the previous

order, or a replacement that cancels the previous order.</p> 



<P> <b>Note:</b> All changes or cancellations are subject to a prior fill.

<title>February 1991 HOMES</title> <p><b>February 1991</b> <h1>MORTGAGE DEALS:
Shop Around For The Best Terms</h1>

<b>By Linda J. Binns</b> <p>

The last column, <a
href="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/News_Stand/Linda_Binns/LB_NDJ90_Pre-Qual.html">Pre-Qualify
for a Mortgage  - To Make House Hunting Easier</a> looked at the various types of
mortgages, affordability and what's new in mortgage financing.  In that column,
we discussed the advantages of pre-qualifying to get a firm idea of the amount of
mortgage financing you can expect from your bank. <p> Now let's say you've found
the right home, and the asking price is within the range you can consider. 
Before you make your offer to purchase, you should shop around for a mortgage the
same way you would for  any other consumer good or service.  Check with a number
of financial institutions and make sure you understand what they're offering. 
Lenders offer different types of mortgages with different terms, conditions, and
interest rates.  But what may seem like a good idea in the short-term may not be
right for you or suit your long-term needs.  Don't base your decision on interest
rates alone  - compare all options such as portability and repayment  features
that could save you  money down the road.


<h2>Compare More Than Just Rate</h2>

To help you choose the best mortgage, here are some points worth understanding
and considering. <p> 1. The type of mortgages available for the amount you need.
<p> 2. The interest rate and the length of time for which it applies. <p> 3. The
amount of the monthly payment and what it covers. <p> 4. Prepayment Options and
charges.  Depending of the lender, you can repay up to 10 to 15 percent of the
principal balance once per year. <p> Some fixed-rate mortgages do not allow
prepayments of any kind, except in the event of the sale of the home or the death
of the owner, and prepayment charges could apply.  Under certain circumstances,
others allow prepayments in full or in part without charge if the interest rate
on the mortgage is below the current rate. (this could be important if you think
you might want to sell your home and pay off your mortgage before the term is
up.) <p> Consider a lender's willingness to accept increases in payment amount
during the term.  Most variable rate (or floating rate) mortgages allow
prepayment of any amount above the minimum of any monthly payment date.  An
administration fee may or may not be charged. <p> 5. Type of life insurance
available and home insurance if applicable.  As well as mortgage life insurance a
few financial  institutions also sponsor a home insurance program offering a
comprehensive coverage at competitive rates. <p> 6. Renegotiation or renewal
privileges and conditions.  For instance, The Toronto-Dominion Bank is currently the
only financial institution that has a 30-day rate hold for renewals. <p> 7. The
lender's requirements in the event that you decide to sell your home.  For
instance, if the purchaser is going to assume your mortgage, does the lender have
the right to approve the new borrower? <p> 8. The general reputation of the
lender - factors to consider include experience in mortgage lending, stability,
and customer service.  Will quality customer service continue after you have
selected your mortgage lender? <p> 9. Any restrictions on the home or property. 
For example, is the mortgagor allowed to renovate the property?  Is the approval
of the lender required? <p> 10. What fees are required by the lender to discharge
or renew the mortgage? <p> If you repay your mortgage whole or in part before the
end of the term, you can expect to pay some sort of compensation or
loss-of-revenue charge to your lender based on the amount being repaid. <p> No
one knows for certain which way interest rates will go.  Even the experts can
only make an educated guess.  When you have to make an interest rate and term
decision, consult a number of sources.  Read published forecasts.  Decide how
important it is for you have a fixed interest rate.  then make the choice with
which you are most comfortable. <p> If interest rates appear to be rising you may
wish to lock in your mortgage for the lowest rate you can get for the longest
period of time you can get. If interest rates appear to be falling, like they
have in recent months, you may wish to get a short-term mortgage in the hope they
will continue to decline. <p> You may have already done some of this comparison
shopping and made your decision when you pre-qualified with a particular
institution but you can still change your mind if you have since found a lender
with terms and conditions that better suit your needs.


<h2>Be Sure Of The Home And The Mortgage</h2>

Buying a home may be the most important financial commitment you ever make.  Be
sure the home and the mortgage lender is right for you. <p> Some of this
information has been culled for "Mortgage Wise", a guide for homebuyers produced
by the Canadian Bankers' Association.  Single copies are available upon request
by writing Canadian Bankers' Association, P.O. Box 1500, Station A, Toronto,
Ontario M5W 2N8. <p>

<head><title>November/December/January 1994 HOMES
</title></head><p><b>November/December/January 1994/5</b><h1>Capital Gains Exemption - Use it or Lose It </h1><b>By
Linda J. Binns</b><p>More than just the purchase of bricks and mortar, buying a
home involves the purchase of land and all the technicalities that go with it.

<p>
Your real estate agent's primary function lies in the marketing of your
home and guidance in preparing an agreement of purchase and sale.  It is your
lawyer's job to give you legal advice and to protect your legal position.
<p>
A
signed agreement of purchase and sale which sets out the ground rules of the
purchase of your new home is a binding contract.  You should not sign it without
the advice of your lawyer whose special training and expertise will  protect
your interests. <p>Legal advice is a good investment.  Throughout this whole
transaction, your lawyer will be acting to protect your interests and ensure
that you receive a good and marketable title to your new home.
<p>
Speaking of
lawyers, just recently I attended a homebuyer's seminar, where real estate
lawyer and Toronto Star columnist Alan Silverstein reminded the audience of some
very important real estate investment strategies that, to work, must be claimed
on your 1994 tax return.  Anyone who owns a cottage or whose parents own
cottages or other real estate investment properties will want to pay attention
to the following.
<p>
February's federal budget killed the $100,000 Lifetime
Capital Gains Exemption (LCGE).  Real estate gains suffered the same fate two
years earlier.
<p>
But while the LCGE may be dead, it's not buried.  With little
fanfare, Ottawa gave us one last chance to use the LCGE.  And now is the time to
see whether this last call for the LCGE applies.
<p>
When the LCGE on real
estate investments was repealed two years ago, accrued gains to February, 1992
stayed eligible for the LCGE.  A formula compared the time you owned a property
up to February 1992 against the total period of ownership.  Great, since some
gains were earned while the LCGE for real estate existed.
<p>
The 1994 rules
restrict how to benefit from those exempt gains.  Now, to be eligible for the
LCGE, pre-March 1992 gains on cottages or other investment real estate must be
claimed in your 1994 tax return (i.e. in April/95) by filing a special election.
 That will bump-up your purchase price, reducing taxable gains payable in the
future.
<p>
For years many people "crystallized" capital gains by transferring
cottage titles to children, spouses and companies at a hefty expense.  The need
for that has changed, too.  
<p>
Now, Ottawa will recognize a "deemed
disposition" of that property from yourself to yourself at any figure between
its adjusted cost base and fair market value on February 22, 1994.  A hefty
savings in legal fees and Land Transfer Tax.  But only as part of your 1994 tax
return.  Or else the opportunity to use the LCGE is gone.
<p>
Not everyone will
benefit using the LCGE.  Cumulative net investment losses (based on interest
expenses) reduce the LCGE.  And claiming the LCGE means a possible loss of Child
Tax Benefits, GST Tax Credits, age credits and Old Age Security clawbacks. 
Seniors must be especially cautious.
<p>
So do your homework.  Learn the fair
market value on budget day of investment property.  An appraisal, though not
essential, is advisable since the numbers must ultimately stand up to Revenue
Canada scrutiny.
<p>
Have an accountant crunch the numbers to see how much LCGE
to use.  Since the "mock transfer" doesn't have to be at fair market value,
he/she can see if a lower number in the range means less tax payable (i.e. for
those with little LCGE left).
<p>
Finally, don't wait until spring.  Do it now. 
The numbers won't change.  And spring's always busy for appraisers and
accountants.  Don't be left out because they're short on time.  Here's a
once-in-a-lifetime chance to bump-up the cost of capital properties tax-free. 
Use it or lose it, forever.

<head><title>May 1994 HOMES</title>
</head>
<p><b>May 1994</b><h1>The Ins and Outs of High-Ratio Mortgages</h1>
<b>By Linda J. Binns</b>
<p>

Now the dream of homeownership is within grasp even if you don't have enough money to make a 25 per cent down payment.  Called "high ratio mortgages" or "NHA insured mortgages", these are available with a 10 per cent downpayment, or even 5 per cent if you are a first time borrower.
<p>
However, since you are borrowing more than the usual 75 per cent of the home's appraised value (or purchase price), the federal government's National Housing Act states that the mortgage must be insured against default and that you pay the cost of the insurance.  That cost can range from one to three per cent of the mortgage amount, and is added to the mortgage principal.  


<h2>Coming up with the Cash</h2>

You'll want to look into government assistance programs designed to help homebuyers.  Check the blue pages of your phone book for the nearest regional housing office of your provincial government.  Also, contact the nearest regional office of CMHC (Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation) which is responsible for administering the federal government's National Housing Act.
<p>
CMHC is a good source of information on government-insured loans and other matters, such as renovation loans and building inspection checklists.  Ask for an information package.


<h2>Benefits of a CMHC-Insured Mortgage</h2>

You can qualify for a CMHC insured mortgage anywhere in the country (over three million Canadians have financed their homes with CMHC since 1954).
<p>
CMHC will insure most homes including manufactured mobile homes.  There are no restrictions on the size of location of the home as long as it meets minimum building standards.  
<p>
Money lending institutions are CMHC approved.
<p>
Mortgage insurance enables you to purchase a home sooner, without having to save the conventional 25 per cent downpayment.  (This insurance isn't fire or job loss insurance.)
<p>
CMHC mortgages have very favourable prepayment privileges - the most important feature now is the three-month interest charge after three years into a term.  This allows you to pay off the mortgage or re-negotiate the terms of the mortgage to take advantage of possible lower interest rates.  This feature overrides any financial institution's policy, which is usually an Interest Rate Differential.


<h2>First Home Loan Insurance</h2>

By the end of 1993, over 138,000 units nationally had been purchased under the First Home Loan Insurance program.  The First Home Loan Insurance program has been extended until 1999 and any term, qualified on a three year rate, is now available. 
<p>
Homebuyers who have used First Home Loan Insurance (F.H.L.I.) to purchase their homes are typically young families with household income close to the national average.  Most of the families have two wage-earners working in a full range of occupations.  In short, those purchasers are fairly representative of average Canadians.


<h2>Did You Know That:
</h2>
More than three-quarters of purchasers were couples (77 per cent).
<p>
Twenty-three per cent were single person households.
<p>
Approximately 40 per cent have between one and two children.
<p>
The average age of FHLI purchasers is 33; over 80 per cent of purchasers are under 40.
<p>
Average household income is $52,246 which is close to the average for Canadians in general.
<p>
The carrying costs of FHLI-purchased homes represents 24 per cent of their total income, while total debts are at 32 per cent; these rates are similar to the levels for purchases with higher downpayments.

<h3>LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS</h3> 
<p>TD achieved year-over-year growth in earnings
of 7% in the first quarter of 1995, as loan losses continued to decline.
<p>While non-accrual loans were up slightly from the fourth quarter of 1994, we
expect the increase to be temporary and that further declines lie ahead. Our
loan loss estimate for 1995 is $240 million, of which $60 million was charged in
the first quarter. This compares to loan losses of $113 million in the first
quarter of 1994, and $345 million for the year. 

<p>TD experienced a reduction in
interest margins to 2.52% from 3.15% a year ago, as a result of sharply rising
interest rates. Partially offsetting this unfavourable development was a 7%
increase in other income from the first quarter of 1994 - mainly reflecting
growth in credit fees and our credit card business. Another positive development
in the quarter was the moderation of expense growth - expenses were up by just
1% from a year ago, despite ongoing investments in our businesses. This led to
an improvement in our productivity ratio from the fourth quarter of 1994 -
particularly important given the squeeze on margins in our industry. 

<p>During the
quarter we continued to build momentum and to sharpen TD's competitive edge with
a number of key initiatives: 
<ul><li>In the highly competitive residential mortgage
business, we improved customer service and built on our leadership in self
service banking when we became the first bank in Canada to offer mortgage
renewals by phone, on TD's Bankline; we also acquired a high quality portfolio
of residential mortgages from Confederation Trust Company, bringing 2,000 new
customers to the Bank. 
<li>To improve our customers' choices in and access to
RSPs, we introduced "TD Future Plan", a pre-approved loan program; we launched
six new mutual funds to provide greater portfolio diversity; we developed a new
GIC - TD Rate Maximizer - which escalates interest rates over three and five
years - of great appeal to customers who want to take advantage of rising
interest rates; and we announced TD Trust Fund Navigator, providing individual
investors with professional mutual fund investment management services from TD
Trust.

<li>We continued our commitment to provide superior service to small and
independent business customers by launching TD Business Service Plan - a package
of services which helps reduce bank charges. We also introduced a business code
of conduct, known as TD's Business Banking Relationship Standards - the first
such code in Canadian banking.

<li>And we made a major step forward in our
rapidly growing investment banking business with an agreement to acquire
Lancaster Financial Holdings, Inc. - a highly respected investment bank
specializing in mergers and acquisitions and financial advisory services. At the
same time, we established a Merchant Banking unit to focus on complex financings
and complement our enhanced advisory services - providing clients with a full
range of transaction financing services on an integrated basis.  </ul>

<p>As we look
ahead, we remain concerned about upward pressure on interest rates and the
impact on the Canadian economy, on our customers and on our financial results.
Ongoing growth in the Canadian economy is encouraging, and we are hopeful that
the governments in Canada will take serious steps to reduce their deficits and
thereby help stop the upward pressure on interest rates and the downward
pressure on the Canadian dollar.

<h3>REVIEW OF OPERATING PERFORMANCE</h3>

<p>Net income in the first quarter of 1995 was $179 million, an increase of $11
million over a year ago, and down $16 million from the preceding quarter. The
improvement from a year ago primarily resulted from a lower provision for credit
losses and increased other income, partly offset by reduced net interest income
and higher non-interest expenses. 

<p>Net income per share for the first quarter of
1995 was $.56 compared to $.62 for the preceding quarter and $.52 for a year
ago. 

<p>Return on assets was .69% for the quarter compared to .74% for the previous
year. Return on common equity was 13.2% for the quarter compared to 13.5% for
the previous year. 

<p><b>Net Interest Income</b><br>
Although average earning assets for the
quarter grew 13% from a year ago, net interest income on a taxable equivalent
basis decreased $63 million or 10% to $597 million. This resulted from a 63
basis point decline in net interest margin to 2.52% for the quarter. This was
mainly caused by unfavourable changes in the mix of earning assets and deposits
which largely arose from increases in interest rates. Specifically, deposit
customers shifted funds from low cost non-term deposits to high cost term
deposits, whereas for mortgage loans, customers mainly requested short term
mortgages. In addition, during 1994 the Bank increased its proportion of earning
assets in lower yielding cash resources and securities held for trading,
investment and liquidity purposes.

<p>Action taken by management in 1994 to reduce the Bank's exposure to interest
rate movements mitigated the impact of the sharp increase in market interest
rates that occurred during the quarter. The estimated decrease in the Bank's
annual net income after tax that would arise from an immediate and sustained 1%
increase in rates has been reduced to $13 million from $16 million at the year
end. 
<p>During the quarter, the Bank realized $21 million in net investment
securities gains, the same level as a year ago and $12 million higher than the
previous quarter. 

<p><b>Credit Quality and Provision for Credit Losses</b><br> 
Net non-accrual
loans increased $37 million during the quarter to $764 million at January 31,
1995 or 1.0% of total loans and bankers' acceptances, the same level as at
October 31, 1994. The increase resulted from lending in the United States to the
real estate industry. We expect net non-accrual loans to decline in future
quarters. 

<p>As a result of the general high credit quality of the Bank's loan
portfolio, the loan loss estimate for 1995 is $240 million, the lowest level
since 1989 and compares to $345 million for the previous year. One quarter of
the estimate for 1995, or $60 million, was charged against income in the first
quarter.

<p><b>Other Income</b><br>
Other income at $309 million grew 7% over the prior year and
reached the second highest level for quarterly results. The primary driving
force behind this increase was the strong growth in credit fees throughout the
Bank's operations and the corporate advisory fees generated in the United
States. In addition, card services income increased significantly because of the
strong contribution by TD/GM Visa Card. Unfavourable market conditions led to a
reduction in income from foreign exchange. Brokerage commissions from Green Line
Investor Services Inc. declined due to lower trading volumes by customers.

<p><b>Non-interest expenses</b><br> 
Non-interest expenses for the quarter increased only 1%
over the same period a year ago. This moderation in expense growth was due to a
reduction in performance related compensation, and in spite of ongoing
investments in new businesses. 

<p>The Bank's productivity ratio for the quarter
deteriorated to 60.4% from 57.1% in the first quarter 1994, but improved from
63.3% in the previous quarter. 

<p><b>Balance Sheet</b><br>
At January 31, 1995, the Bank's
total assets rose above $100 billion for the first time to reach $102.2 billion.
The 11% increase from a year ago was largely due to an increase in all its
credit lending business segments in Canada, and the increased value of the U.S.
dollar compared to the Canadian dollar.

<p>The market value of the Bank's securities portfolios held for investment and
liquidity purposes at January 31, 1995 was $428 million below cost, compared to
$356 million at October 31, 1994. This was the result of recent increases in
interest rates that reduced the values of our Canadian and U.S. government bonds
which have an average maturity of 1.9 years. The unrealized loss would be
recognized only if the portfolios were sold and it is management's intention to
hold these securities to maturity. 

<p>The Bank's personal deposits increased 2%
from a year ago as individuals increased their investments in term deposits in
response to rising interest rates. 

<p><b>Capital</b><br>
During the quarter, the Bank's common
equity grew $155 million through increased earnings after dividends of $104
million and unrealized foreign currency gains of $59 million from translation of
investments in the Bank's foreign subsidiaries, partly offset by $8 million in
share issue expenses and other items. 

<p>The Bank's total risk-weighted assets
increased 4% during the quarter, the result of increases in lending activity,
and the value of U.S. dollar denominated assets. 

<p>With these changes, the Bank's
ratio of net common equity to risk-weighted assets remained unchanged at 6.4%
from a year ago.<hr>

from a year ago. <li> Net interest margin improved 25 basis points 
from the prior quarter. <li> Productivity ratio improved from the previous

</ul><hr>


<h3>LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS</h3> 
<p> <B>TD</B> earned $.52 per common share in the second quarter, a year-over-year 
increase of 4%, while moving ahead with strategies to build our investment 
banking, retail brokerage and trust businesses. This increase in earnings 
was achieved despite the fact that, consistent with past practice, we 
expensed the purchase price of Lancaster Financial Holdings Inc.,- 
acquired during the quarter at a cost equivalent to $.07 per share. 

<p> <B>T</B>otal revenue reached its highest level since the record first quarter of
1994, due to a 25 basis point improvement in TD's interest rate margins from 
the first quarter of this year, and securities gains. Expenses grew by 6%, 
excluding the Lancaster costs.

<P><B>N</B>on-accrual loans, while below last year's level, increased from the first
quarter of 1995 - primarily reflecting the impact of the default by a major
property group on its loans; however, we remain optimistic that non-accruals will
resume their downward trend later this year and our loan loss estimate is
unchanged at $240 million for 1995. We charged $60 million of the loss estimate
to the second quarter - down by $52 million from the previous year.

<p> <B>P</B>rogress was seen on many fronts at TD during the quarter. Some of the
highlights include: 
<ul><li> Accelerated activity at TD Securities, with the acquisition and
integration of Lancaster Financial Holdings Inc. - boosting our financial
advisory services and mergers and acquisitions capabilities. Also during the
quarter, we established a merchant banking unit, and added bench strength in
other key areas in Toronto, New York and London. We were one of the most active
dealers during the quarter, and led a number of issues, including one of the
first Canadian dollar floating rate notes in the domestic market.
<li> Strong growth in our loans to small and medium sized businesses. We have
been working hard to build business in this sector, and during the quarter we
appointed a senior officer of the Bank to accelerate development of our Business
Banking Services for our independent business customers.

<li> Continued expansion of TD Evergreen Investment Services Inc., - our full
service retail brokerage - which opened branches in Owen Sound, Ontario,
Courtenay and Kelowna, British Columbia, and Saint John, New Brunswick. Evergreen
now has over 20 branches and 100 brokers across Canada, with new branches planned
for White Rock, British Columbia, London and St. Catharines, Ontario, and other
important markets.

<li> The successful transformation of key branches to TD BANK & TRUST - improving
access to personal trust services for our banking and investing customers. During
the quarter, TD became the first financial institution in Canada to combine bank
and trust operations within branches. We will have redesignated 180 branches
across Canada by the end of 1995, having trained existing branch staff and added
expertise in estate and trust services. Trust services - which include will and
estate planning, estate and trust account administration, investment counselling
and portfolio management - are increasingly important to Canada's aging
population, and are an ideal complement to our branches' banking and investment
services.

<li> Rapid growth in TD Direct Payment - our debit card business, with cardholder
transactions now approaching two million a month. During the quarter, we also won
significant new merchant accounts with major retailers, boosting our market share
in the retail segment.

<li> The development of the TD VISA GOLD TRAVEL CARD (which was publicly launched
on May 23) - the &quot;any way, any place, any time&quot; card, offering a highly
competitive points and rewards program for travel.

</ul>
<P> <B>M</B>any of these developments are providing immediate returns; others will
contribute to results in the future; all are designed to serve customers better
by meeting their changing needs - ensuring that TD lives up to our promise:
"Your Bank. Your Way."
<p> <B>A</B>s we look ahead during this time of economic uncertainty when consumer
confidence remains fragile, we expect that economic growth will continue in
Canada. We are encouraged by the decline in interest rates late in the quarter 
and the increasing commitment of governments in Canada to reduce and eliminate
deficits.

<h3>REVIEW OF OPERATING PERFORMANCE</h3>

<p> <B>N</B>et income in the second quarter of 1995 was $164 million or $.52 per common
share. These earnings reflect the $22 million after-tax acquisition costs for
Lancaster Financial Holdings Inc., equivalent to $.07 per share. Excluding this
item, net income increased $28 million or 18% over a year ago and $7 million from
the previous quarter. The improvement from a year ago primarily resulted from a
lower provision for credit losses, and higher securities gains and net interest
income.

<p> <B>O</B>n the same basis, net income per share for the second quarter of 1995 at
$.59 was higher than the $.56 earned in the previous quarter and the $.50
reported a year ago. These improved earnings from a year ago produced increases
in the return on assets from .69% to .73% and in the return on common equity from
12.7% to 13.9%.

<p> <B>A</B>s a result of the Bank's strong performance in the first half of 1995, net
income increased despite the acquisition costs of Lancaster Financial Holdings
Inc. to $343 million or $1.08 per share compared to the prior year's first half
earnings of $326 million or $1.02 per share.

<p><b>Net Interest Income</b><br>
<B>N</B>et interest income on a taxable equivalent basis increased $18 million to $637
million from a year ago. This increase was generated by the 10% growth in the
Bank's average earning assets to $94.3 million.

<p> <B>T</B>he Bank's net interest margin rose during the quarter to 2.77%, thereby
ending four successive quarter-over-quarter decreases. A 25 basis point
improvement over the prior quarter resulted from higher interest recoveries and
improved spreads on personal deposits during a period of significant increases in
interest rates.
<p> <B>D</B>uring the quarter, the Bank realized $24 million in net investment
securities gains mainly from its operations in the United States compared to no
net gains a year ago.

<p><b>Credit Quality and Provision for Credit Losses</b><br> 
<B>N</B>et non-accrual loans increased $180 million from the prior quarter end to $944
million on April 30, 1995, or 1.2% of total loans and bankers' acceptances. The
increase arose primarily from loans to one major real estate group in the United
States and Canada.

<p> <B>W</B>e continue to be optimistic that non-accrual loans will resume their
downward trend later this year. The loan loss estimate for 1995 remains unchanged
from the first quarter estimate of $240 million. One quarter of the estimate for
1995, or $60 million, was charged against income in the second quarter, a
decrease of $52 million from a year ago.

<p><b>Other Income</b><br>
<B>O</B>ther income experienced a decline of 8% from a year ago when it reached a record
level primarily due to unusually high revenues from foreign exchange and
derivative products. Lower market activity by our customers led to lower
investment and securities fees to the Bank from mutual funds management,
underwriting, and brokerage services provided by Green Line Investor Services
Inc.

<p> <B>F</B>avourable developments were the continued strong growth in credit fees
earned throughout the Bank's operations and the increase in card services income
as the usage of the TD/GM Visa Card continued to grow.

<p><b>Non-interest expenses</b><br> 
<B>E</B>xcluding the acquisition costs for Lancaster Financial Holdings Inc.,
non-interest expenses for the quarter increased 6% over the same period a year
ago. Expenses related to building our securities businesses, together with
increased non-income taxes such as capital and business taxes and deposit
insurance, were the main factors contributing to this increase. Excluding these
factors, expense growth was approximately 3%. The Bank is striving to moderate
expense growth.

<p> <B>T</B>he Bank is concerned about its increasing tax burden. Banking is among the
most heavily taxed industries in the country, accounting for a significant
portion of federal and provincial corporate tax revenue. Nevertheless, the
federal government targeted the industry for additional new taxes in its most
recent budget. High taxes are detrimental to our global competitive position and
erode returns to our shareholders.

<P> <B>T</B>he Bank's productivity ratio for the quarter deteriorated to 59.9% from
57.8% in the second quarter 1994, but improved from 60.4% in the previous quarter
as a result of strong revenue growth.

<p><b>Balance Sheet</b><br>
<B>A</B>t April 30, 1995, the Bank's total assets were $103.7 billion, an increase of
11% from a year ago largely due to higher levels of trading securities and loans
to all segments. Business and government loans and bankers' acceptances have
grown 10% as the North American economy remained strong.

<p> <B>T</B>he market value of the Bank's securities portfolios held for investment and
liquidity purposes at April 30, 1995 was $260 million below cost, compared to
$356 million at October 31, 1994. This improvement resulted from the decrease in
interest rates that increased the values of our Canadian and U.S. government
bonds which have an average maturity of 1.7 years.

<p> <B>T</B>he Bank's personal deposits increased $1.2 billion or 3% from a year ago, as
individuals continued to increase their investments in term deposits in response
to higher interest rates. This increase was partly due to an $865 million
reduction in mutual funds managed by the Bank.

<p><b>Capital</b><br>
<B>D</B>uring the quarter, the Bank's common equity grew $34 million, primarily through
increased earnings after dividends of $87 million. This was partly offset by
unrealized foreign currency losses of $56 million from translation of investments
in the Bank's foreign subsidiaries, as the value of the U.S. dollar compared to
the Canadian dollar declined during the quarter. This compares to an unrealized
foreign currency gain of $59 million in the first quarter.
<p> <B>T</B>he Bank's ratio of net common equity to risk-weighted assets remained
unchanged at 6.4% from a year ago and the previous quarter.

<H3>Abstract:</H3>
<EM><b> LaTeX</b>2<tt>HTML</tt>  is a conversion tool that allows documents
written in LaTeX to become part of the WorldWide Web.
In addition, it offers an easy migration path towards
authoring complex hypermedia documents using
familiar word-processing concepts.
<P>
<b> LaTeX</b>2<tt>HTML</tt>  replicates the basic structure of a LaTeX document 
as a set of interconnected HTML files which can be explored using
automatically generated navigation panels. 
The cross-references, citations, footnotes, the table of contents and the lists
of figures and tables, are also translated into hypertext links. Formatting
information which has equivalent ``tags'' in HTML (lists, quotes, paragraph
breaks, type styles, etc.) is also converted appropriately. 
The remaining heavily formatted items
such as mathematical equations, pictures or tables are converted to images
which are placed automatically at the correct positions in the
final HTML document.
<P>
<b> LaTeX</b>2<tt>HTML</tt>  extends LaTeX by supporting arbitrary hypertext links 
and symbolic cross-references between evolving 
remote documents. It also allows the specification
of <em> conditional text</em> and the inclusion of raw HTML commands.
These hypermedia extensions to LaTeX are available as 
new commands and environments from with a LaTeX document.
<P>
This document presents the main features of <b> LaTeX</b>2<tt>HTML</tt> , and
describes how to obtain, install, and use it.

<h2><a NAME="introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>
ACE/gr is an XY plotting tool for workstations or X-terminals using X. A few 
of its features are:
<ul>
	<li> User defined scaling, tick marks, labels, symbols, line styles, colors.
	<li> Batch mode for unattended plotting.
	<li> Read and write parameters used during a session.
	<li> Polynomial regression, splines, running averages, DFT/FFT, 
cross/auto-correlation.
	<li> Hardcopy support for PostScript, HP-GL, and FrameMaker .mif 
format.
</ul>
<p>
While ACE/gr has a convenient point-and-click interface, most parameter 
settings and operations are available through a command line interface 
(found in Files/Commands). 

<HR>

<p>
<h2><a NAME="terminology">Terminology</a></h2>
<p>
<DL>
<DT><b>Sets</b>
<dd>
Sets are collections of points, with optional associated values at these 
points. The associated values can be used to display error bars, high-low 
open-close plots and several other features. Sets are connected to a 
graph, and, by default, there are 30 sets per graph and each set is 
numbered from 0 to the maximum number of sets less one. The number of 
points in a set is limited by the size of virtual memory and are 
numbered from 1 to N where N is the total number of points in the set. 
Operations to manipulate sets are found in <a href="sets.html">Data/Set 
operations</a>, and features such as line styles, symbol types, and
others can be changed from <a href="graphs.html#symbols"> 
<b>Graph/Symbols</b></a>. 

<HR>
<DT><b>Graphs</b>
<dd>
Graphs are the collection of data sets, tick marks, titles, etc. drawn to 
display the data. By default, there are 10 graphs with each graph owning 
30 sets (both the number of graphs and the number of sets are adjustable 
via command line parameters). Operations on graphs are found in the 
<a href="graphs.html"> <b>Graphs/Graph operations</b></a> popup.
<p>
There are numerous popups accessible through Graphs pulldown menu that allow 
the manipulation of graph parameters. 
Most graph operations work on what is referred to as the `current graph', 
marked by small filled rectangles at the corners of one graph. The 10 graphs 
available by default in this version of ACE/gr are numbered from 0 to 9.
<p>
<DT><b>Regions</b>
<dd>
Regions are sections of the graph defined by the interior or exterior of 
a polygon, or a half plane defined by a line. A region defined by a 
line can be above, below, to the right, or left of the line. Defining 
regions and operations on points inside regions are found in 
<a href="regions.html"> Data/Region operations</a>.
<p>
<DT><b>Parameters</b>
<dd>
Parameters are the settings of symbols, line styles, colors, fonts, etc. 
used to define graphs and the display of the active sets.

<h1><a NAME="using">Using ACE/gr</a></h1>
<h2><a NAME="execution">Execution</a></h2>
<p>
The interactive <b>ACE/gr</b> program is called <b>xmgr</b>, if used in batch 
mode, <b>grbatch</b>. 
If <b>grbatch</b> is not found, contact your system administrator, or see the 
section on installation. For grbatch to work properly it is important that it
be called <b>grbatch</b> as it is the name that distinguishes <b>xmgr</b> from 
<b>grbatch</b>. They are the same program, but when executed as 
<b>grbatch</b>, the X interface is not initialized and <b>grbatch</b> 
terminates at the end of execution without user intervention. 
<p>
Please note
that <b>grbatch</b> does not read the any X resource files, so that it can
be run from dumb terminals and over phone lines. Don't expect resource
settings used for <b>xmgr</b> to work for <b>grbatch</b>. See the section
on setting defaults using a <a href="#defaults"> <b>.xmgrrc</b> </a> file.

<HR>

<h2><a NAME="commandline">Command line parameters</a></h2>
<p>
<DL>
<DT> <b>-autoscale</b> <i>x</i> or <i>y</i> or <i>xy</i>
<DD>
Autoscale the x axis, y axis, or both axes, overiding the settings for axes scaling and tick mark spacing 
given in any parameter file specified by the -p option.
<p>
Example:
<pre>
xmgr -autoscale x -p params.par data.dat
</pre>
Reads parameters from params.par and data from data.dat, but overrides
any settings for the X axis found in the parameter file.
<DT> -noauto  <i>y</i> or <i>y</i> or <i>xy</i>
<DD>
Suppress autoscaling on the given axis (axes). Use this when a data file 
has imbedded commands that provide axes scaling and tick mark spacing.
<DT> -arrange <i>rows columns</i>
<DD>
Arrange graphs in column major order starting from the lower left corner in a 
grid <i>rows</i> by <i>columns</i>. For example, <i>-arrange 2 2</i> will 
position the first four graphs (0, 1, 2, 3) in a 2x2 matrix of graphs 
starting with graph 0 in the lower left corner of the plotting surface. 
This function is not as complete as the similar function found in 
<a href = "graphops.html#arrange"> Graph/Graph operations/Arrange </a>
and gives a sightly different result.
<p>
Example:
<pre>
xmgr -arrange 2 2
</pre>
Creates a 2x2 matrix of graphs.
<dt> -rows <i>rows</i>
<dd>Arrange the first <i>rows graphs</i> in <i>rows</i> rows.
<dt> -cols <i>columns</i>
<dd>
Arrange the first <i>columns</i> graphs in <i>columns</i> columns.
<dt> -results <i>results_file</i>
<dd>
Write the results of regression and anything else that gets written to 
the results popup to file <i>results_file</i>.
<dt> -device <i>device_number</i>
<dd>
Set the hardcopy device to <i>device_number</i>.
The device numbering follows:
<ul>
	<li>	1 .. PostScript landscape
	<li>	2 .. PostScript portrait
	<li>	3 .. FrameMaker .mif landscape
	<li>	4 .. FrameMaker .mif portrait
	<li>	5 .. HPGL landscape
	<li>	6 .. HPGL portrait
	<li>	7 .. InterLeaf landscape
	<li>	8 .. InterLeaf portrait
</ul>
<p>
Example:
<pre>
xmgr -device 2
</pre>
Sets the hardcopy device to PostScript portrait.
<dt> -eps
<dd>
Tell the PostScript driver to produce EPS.
<dt> -printfile <i>graphics_output_file</i>
<dd>
Write the graphics output to file <i>graphics_output_file</i> rather than 
spool graphics data to a printer.
 <dt> -fixed <i>width height</i>
 <dt> -portrait
 <dt> -landscape
 <dt> -free
<dd>
Set the dimensions of the drawing area. Presently, there is no connection 
between the hardcopy drivers and these settings. This means that the printer 
needs to be set to conform to the dimensions of the drawing area.
<ul>
	<li>	-fixed <i>width height</i> - set the drawing area to have 
			dimensions <i>width and height</i>
	<li>	-portrait - set the drawing area to be 8.5x11 in portrait.
	<li>	-landscape - set the drawing area to be 8.5x11 in portrait.
	<li>	-free - allow the drawing area to be resized (no 
			scrollbars will appear).
</ul>
<dt> -batch <i>batch_file</i>
<dd>
Execute the commands in <i>batch_file</i> on startup. This command line 
switch is not the same as executing ACE/gr in batch mode as <b>grbatch</b>.
<p>
<dt> -noask
<dd>
Assume the answer is yes to all requests, This means that files will be 
overwritten without asking if they exist, and, if Exit is selected in
the GUI, <b>ACE/gr</b> will exit abruptly. This option can be used to 
overwrite existing files in batch mode. Be careful.
<p>
<dt> -graph <I>graph_number</i>
<dd>
Make <i>graph_number</i> the current graph. <i>Graph_number</i> is an 
integer between 0 and maxgraph-1 (by default maxgraph, the maximum number
of graphs, is 10).
<p>
For example, to activate four graphs and read data to each graph:
<p>
<pre>
xmgr -arrange 2 2 data0.dat -graph 1 data1.dat -graph 2 data2.dat -graph 3 data3.dat
</pre>
<p>
This command creates 4 graphs arranged in a 2x2 matrix, and reads a file
into each graph. 
<p>
<dt> -graphtype <i>graph_type</i>
<dd>
Set the current graph type to <i>graph_type</i>. Where <i>graph_type</i> is 
one of:
<p>
<ul>
	<li> xy           linear scaling along both x and y.
	<li> logx         linear scaling in y, log scaling in x., 
	<li> logy         linear scaling in x, log scaling in y.
	<li> logxy        log scaling in both x and y.
	<li> bar          vertical bar chart.
	<li> hbar         horizontal bar chart.
	<li> stackedbar   vertical stacked bar chart.
	<li> stackedhbar  horizontal stacked bar chart.
</ul>
	<dt> -type <i>data_set_type</i>
<dd>
The format of the next data source is <i>data_set_type</i>. Where 
<i>data_set_type</i> is one of <b>xydx</b> (XY data with error bars along X), 
<b>xydy</b> (XY data with error bars along Y), <b>xydxdx</b> (XY 
data with error bars along X of differing values), <b>xydydy</b> (XY data with 
error bars along Y of differing values), <b>xydxdy</b> (error bars along X 
and Y), <b>xyr</b> (a circle drawn at XY of radius R) and <b>xyhilo</b> 
(XY data with high-low open-close data). This setting remains in effect until 
a new format type is specified.
	<dt> -ihl <i>IHL_formatted_file</i>
<dd>
Assume <i>IHL_formatted_file</i> or the next source of data is in IHL 
format (a local format).
<p>
	<dt> -nxy
<dd>
The format of the next data source is X1, Y1, Y2, ..., Yn.
<p>
	<dt> -xydx
<dd>
The format of the next data source is X Y DX
<p>
	<dt> -xydy
<dd>
The format of the next data source is X Y DY
<p>
	<dt> -xydxdx
<dd>
The format of the next data source is X Y DX1 DX2
<p>
	<dt> -xydydy
<dd>
The format of the next data source is X Y DY1 DY2
<p>
	<dt> -xydxdy
<dd>
The format of the next data source is X Y DX DY
<p>
	<dt> -xyz
<dd>
The format of the next data source is X Y Z where Z is a value drawn as 
text at X, Y.
<p>
	<dt> -xyr
<dd>
The format of the next data source is X Y R, where a circle of radius R 
is drawn at X, Y.
<p>
	<dt> -xybox
<dd>
The format of the next data source is XMIN YMIN XMAX YMAX VALUE, where 
(XMIN, YMIN) is the lower lefthand corner of a rectangle and (XMAX, YMAX) 
are the upper righthand corner of a rectangle. VALUE is an integer used to 
specify the color to use to fill the rectangle. To set the fill, use 
Graph/Symbols and set the fill style to anything but None.
	<dt> -boxplot
<dd>
The format of the next data source is X AVG
<p>
	<dt> -ihl
<dd>
The format of the next data souce is in IHL format, this format leads to 
a data set of type XY.
<p>
	<dt> -hilo
<dd>
The format of the next data source is X HIGH LOW OPEN CLOSE, where a symbol 
denoting the open, close, the high and the low values for an observation is drawn at X.
<p>
	<dt> -netcdf <i>netCDF file</i>
	<dt> -netcdfxy [<i>xvar</i> or <i>"null"] yvar</i>
<dd>
Where <i>xvar</i> and <i>yvar</i> are the names of the variables to read.
if <i>xvar</i> == "null", then load the index of yvar.
These command line options may be used to read variables from
a netCDF file. For example:

<p>
<pre>
xmgr -netcdf t.nc -netcdfxy null y
</pre>
<p>

Reads y from t.nc and loads to X the index (starting from 1).

<p>
<pre>
xmgr -netcdf t.nc -netcdfxy x y -netcdfxy x1 y1
</pre>
<p>

Reads x and y from t.nc, then x1 and y1 from the same file.
2 sets are created, both of type XY, one with (x, y), the
other composed of (x1, y1).

another example reading data from 2 CDF files:

<p>
<pre>
xmgr -netcdf t.nc -netcdfxy x y -netcdf t2.nc -netcdfxy x1 y1
</pre>
<p>
	<dt> -saveall <i>filename</i>
<dd>
Write all active sets to <i>filename</i>.
<p>
	<dt> -wd
<dd>
Set the current working directory. This option can be used to read
files from several different directories. For example:

<p>
<pre>
xmgr -wd examples mlo.dat -wd ../moredat brw.d hilo.dat
</pre>
Unfortunately, this option not allow wild cards, as they are expanded in 
the current directory only.
<p>
	<dt> -image <i>X_window_dump_file</i>
<dd>
Read the window dump file <i>X_window_dump_file</i>. The format is the same as 
generated by xwd or Frame's capture utility.
<p>
	<dt> -imagexy <i>X Y</i>
<dd>
Set the upper lefthand corner position of the image at screen coordinates 
(X, Y). Note that screen coordinates have as their origin the upper lefthand 
corner of the drawing area and positive, increasing Y points down.
<p>
	<dt> -block
<dd>
Assume the format of the next data file is block data. No sets are formed 
by reading block data, and only one set of block data is allowed in an active 
session. To create sets from the block data, use Edit/Block data.
<p>
	<dt> -bxy <i>col1:col2</i>
<dd>
Create sets from a previously read block data. Using -bxy col1:col2,
will create a set using the current set type (default is XY) and using
column <i>col1</i> and column <i>col2</i> from the most recently read set 
of block data. <i>Col1</i> and <i>col2</i> are integers indicating the 
numbers of the columns - column numbers start from 1. For example:

<pre>
  xmgr -block block.d -bxy 1:4 -bxy 2:6
</pre>

  will read block.d and generate 2 sets of type XY using columns
  1 and 4 for the first set, and 2 and 6 for the second set.

<pre>
  xmgr -block block.d -type xydy -bxy 1:3:4
</pre>

  will read  block.d and generate a set of type XYDY (an XY set with
  error bars) using column 1 and 3 for X and Y, and column 4 for the
  error bars.

<p>
	<dt> -log <i>x</i> or <i>y</i> or <i>xy</i>
<dd>
Set the current graph type to logarithmic depending the the string <i>x</i> 
or <i>y</i> or both axes by <i>xy</i>.
<p>
	<dt> -parameter <i>parameter_file</i>
	<dt> -p <i>parameter_file</i>
<p>
Read the parameter file parameter_file.

<p>
	<dt> -nodc
<dd>
Disallow double click canvas operations.
<p>
	<dt> -redraw
<dd>
Redraw the entire page if ACE/gr receives an Expose event.
<p>
	<dt> -noredraw
<dd>
Do not redraw the entire page when Expose events are received.
<p>
	<dt> -maxcolors <i>number_of_colors</i>
<dd>
Set the maximum number of colors allocated.
<p>
	<dt> -world <i>xmin ymin xmax ymax</i>
<dd>

run from <i>(xmin, xmax)</i> the Y axis from <i>(ymin, ymax)</i>
<p>
	<dt> -view <i>xmin ymin xmax ymax</i>
<dd>
Set the viewport of the current graph to a rectangle described by 
<i>(xmin, ymin)</i> and <i>(xmax, ymax)</i>.
<p>
	<dt> -source <i>data_source</i>
<dd>
Set source for the next data file, the argument takes on the following values: 
<p>
<ul>
<li>  <b>disk</b>     - Data file is on disk.
<li>  <b>pipe</b>     - Read from a pipe.
<li>  <b>stdin</b>    - ACE/gr is in a pipe, read from standard input.
</ul>
<p>
The source setting stays in effect until the next -source command is given.
<p>
	<dt> -pipe
<dd>
Read from standard input and plot each set when the end of the set is seen. 
Use the -pipe option to monitor the results coming from a model or other 
data stream.
<p>
	<dt> -remove
<dd>
Erase the most recently read file. Use this option when using ACE/gr to read 
a temporarily constructed file that is not needed once read. Note that this 
option does not request confirmation.
<p>
	<dt> -legend load
<dd>
For each data set read, make the set legend label the same as the filename 
the data set originated.
<p>
	<dt> -seed <i>seed_value</i>

GXinvert and GXxor set the type of graphics operation used to draw 
rubberband lines and draw the graph focus markers. In a colormapped 
display, the xor of a source and destination pixel may not generate a 
color visible on the drawing area. The default is to use xor to draw 
rubberband lines, if the lines don't show, try -GXinvert. This draw mode 
can be set via X resource settings (see below).
<p>
	<dt> -maxplot <i>number_of_sets</i>

results of computations and other operations.
<p>

<HR>

	<h3> <a NAME="readsets">Read sets</a> </h3>
<p>
Read one or more data sets. The list item at the top of the popup displays 
the contents of the current directory. Select a file or directory by clicking 
on the item with the right mouse button. The selection is placed in the text 
item labeled `File:' and checked to see if it is a directory or a file. 
Selecting a directory causes ACE/gr to change to the new directory and 
reload the file list with the contents of the new directory. Selecting a 
file does nothing until the `Accept' button is pressed or <return> is entered.
Before `Accept'ing the file, the items describing the file type, file 
source, and the graph in which to read the data need to be properly set.
The type of data file can be one of several formats:
<p>
<ul>
	<li> A 2 column multi-data set file. Sets are separated by a line 
containing non-numeric characters, that are neither comment lines (lines 
with a `#' in column 1) nor parameter lines (lines beginning with an `@'). 
The sets generated from this file type are all of type XY.
<p>
	<li> A multi column data file. X is assumed to be in the first 
column, and Y1, Y2, ..., up to Y30 in the remaining columns. The sets 
generated with this data file format are all of type XY.
<p>
	<li> IHL format. A 3 column data file with the first line 
an integer value with the number of points to follow.
<p>
	<li> Binary format. - not defined as of this writing.
<p>
	<li> X Y DX format. A 3 column data file consisting of X, Y and a 
quantity used to form an error bar parallel to the X-axis, i.e., the point 
will be plotted with an error bar at (X+-DX, Y).
<p>
	<li> X Y DY format. A 3 column data file consisting of X, Y and a 
quantity used to form an error bar parallel to the Y-axis, i.e., the point 
will be plotted with an error bar at (X, Y+-DY).
<p>
	<li> X Y DX1 DX2 format. A 4 column data file consisting of X, Y, 
and the errors in X. The error bar riser is drawn from (X+DX1,Y) to (X-DX2,Y). 
If both DX1 and DX2 are >0 then the error bar will bracket the datum. 
If DX2 is <0 and DX1 > 0 the error bars are drawn to the right of the 
datum. Likewise, if DX1 < 0 and DX2 > 0 the error bar is drawn to the 
left of the datum.
<p>
There are 4 cases for the error bars' position with respect to the datum:
<p>
<ul>
	<li> 1.	DX1 > 0 and DX2 > 0 ... Error bars bracket the datum.
	<li> 2.	DX1 > 0 and DX2 < 0 ... Error bars are drawn to the right of the datum.
	<li> 3.	DX1 < 0 and DX2 > 0 ... Error bars are drawn to the left of the datum.
	<li> 4.	DX1 < 0 and DX2 < 0 ... Error bars bracket the datum, but reversed from case 1.
</ul>
<p>
	<li> X Y DY1 DY2 format. A 4 column data file consisting of X, Y, 
and the errors in Y. The error bar riser is drawn from (X, Y+DY1) to 
(X, Y-DY2). If both DY1 and DY2 are >0 then the error bar will bracket the 
datum. If DY2 is <0 and DY1 > 0 the error bars are drawn to the right of 
the datum. Likewise, if DY1 < 0 and DY2 > 0 the error bar is drawn to the 
left of the datum. There are 4 cases for the error bars' position with 
respect to the datum:
<ul>
	<li> 1.	DY1 > 0 and DY2 > 0 ... Error bars bracket the datum.
	<li> 2.	DY1 > 0 and DY2 < 0 ... Error bars are drawn above the datum.
	<li> 3.	DY1 < 0 and DY2 > 0 ... Error bars are drawn below the datum.
	<li> 4.	DY1 < 0 and DY2 < 0 ... Error bars bracket the datum, but reversed from case 1.
</ul>
	<li> X Y DX DY format.  A 4 column data file consisting of X, Y, 
and the errors in X and Y. The error bar risers are drawn from (X+DX, Y) to 
(X-DX, Y) and (X, Y+DY) to (X, Y-DY). 
<p>
	<li> X Y Z format. A 3 column data file consisting of X, Y, Z. 
Sets with this type are drawn with the Z value in text at (X, Y).
<p>
	<li> X Y R format. A 3 column data file consisting of X, Y, R. Sets 
with this type are drawn with a circle of radius R at (X, Y).
<p>
	<li> X HI LO OPEN CLOSE format. A 5 column data file consisting of 
the high, low, open and close values for an observation at X. A data set of 
this type uses the line style, line width and line color for a normal set 
when the symbol is drawn. 
</ul>
<p>
<b>Read from:</b> sets the source of the data, either a disk file or a pipe. 
In the case of a pipe, the information provided by the file filter item is 
not used, as the `file' in this case will be a command as typed at the 
UNIX prompt.
<p>
<b>Read to graph:</b> selects a particular graph to serve as the repository 
for the incoming data. The `Current' graph is the graph that has the focus, 
and can be any of the available graphs. If you aren't sure which graph is 
current, the locator item on the main panel displays the current graph number.
<p>
Selecting <b>Autoscale on read:</b> forces an autoscale of the target graph 
each time a set is read. 
<p>
<b>Note</b>: Data are read into the next available set. All data are assumed 
to be delimited by tabs or blanks.
<p>
For the xy, xydx, xydy, xydxdx, xydydy, xydxdy, xyz, xyr data file formats, 
sets are separated by a line containing non-numeric characters, that are 
neither comment lines (lines with a '#' in column 1) nor parameter lines 
(lines beginning with an `@'). Data files can have imbedded comments by 
placing a `#' in the first column of the comment line. Plot parameters can 
be set by placing a `@' in the first column of the line followed immediately 
by the parameter name and setting. See the command line reference for a 
description of plot parameters and other commands that may be placed in a 
data file using the `@' character. Comment lines and parameter lines can 
occur at any place in the data file, and are not used to indicate data set 
separators. I recommend a single `&' on a line to use as a data set separator.
<p>
Press <b>Accept</b> to read the data. If the read was successful, the graph 
of the data is drawn using the current plot scaling parameters. If the data 
lies outside the current plotting limits, the new set(s) will not be visible 
until the plotting limits are changed by autoscaling or manually through 
the <a href="graphs.html#world"> View/Define world popup</a>. 
<p>
Press <b>Cancel</b> to close the popup.
<p>
Open the <a href="#status">Status popup</a> to get information on the state of sets. If reading 
the file generates more than 10 errors you'll be prompted by an alert requesting whether or not 
you'd like to continue. These errors generally arise when an attempt is made to read a 
text file - ACE/gr relies on the interpretive capabilities of sscanf() to parse the data. 
ACE/gr will read data sets until there are no more sets available, after the maximum 
number of sets have been used, you'll need to free some sets using the [Kill] or [Kill all] 
items in the Edit/Set operations pullright.

	<h3> <a NAME="readnetcdf">Read netCDF</a> </h3>

<p>
   File/Read netCDF
<p>

   Select X:    Select Y:
<p>

   netCDF file:
<p>
   Load to set:
<p>
   Autoscale on read
<p>

   Accept   Files...   Update   Query   Done
<p>
---------------------------------------
<p>

Enter the name of the netCDF file in the text item labelled
<b>netCDF file:</b> then click on "Update" (note that if -netcdf
[filename] was used on the command line, this step is not
needed, as the lists will be loaded automatically). This will 
read the names of all one dimensional variables into the 
two scrolled lists.  The leftmost list is for X and the 
rightmost for Y. There is an additional item in the X 
list called INDEX (I'm hoping here that no one names a 
variable INDEX, maybe I need to change this) that indicates 
that for X, use the index of the Y variable (numbering 
starts from 1).

<p>
Select on a variable from the X list to use for X and select
a variable from the Y list (only single selections for now). 

<p>
If information about the selected variables is desired, click on 
Query.

<p>
Select a set using "Load to set:" - the default is to load
to the next available set.

<p>
If things look OK, click on Accept to read the data and load 
the set. Use "Autoscale on read" to set/unset autoscaling
after a successful read.

<p>
To read data from a new CDF file, enter the filename, or use
File... to scan the directory. Click on Update to freshenup
the X and Y selection lists.
<p>
Note: Presently, only sets of type XY are created.
<p>
Note: ACE/gr scans and replaces commas with blanks and the `D' in Fortran double 
precision exponential formats with `e'.
<p>

<HR>

	<h3> <a NAME="readparams">Read parameters</a> </h3>
<p>
Enter the parameter file name on the line labeled "File:", press "Accept" to read a saved 
state of adjustable parameters, legends, strings, etc, to the graph selected by the `Read to 
graph' cycle. As the graph number is saved in the parameter file this isn't used at the 
present time.
<p>

<HR>

	<h3> <a NAME="readblock">Read block data</a> </h3>
<p>
Select the data source, either Disk or Pipe and enter the block data file name in the text 
item labeled "File:" to read a data set in block data file format. The 
block data file format consists of columns of data. For example, 
the following is a block data file consisting of 4 columns:
<pre>
    1   2   3   4   5
    6   7   8   9  10
    11 12  13  14  15
</pre>
<p>
After reading the file of block data, the popup will close if no errors were found, and the 
Edit/Block data popup will take its place. Use the functions in the Edit/Block data 
popup to create sets from the block data.
<p>
NOTE: All items are assumed delimited by spaces or tabs. There is presently a 30 column limit. Only one set of block data per session, i.e., reading another set of block data 
will obliterate the previous set of block data.
<p>

<HR>

	<h3> <a NAME="writesets">Write sets</a> </h3>
<p>
Write one or all sets to disk. Select the set to write using the cycle displaying the set 
numbers (there is an item for selecting all active sets). The item denoted "Format" is the 
C language format string that will be used to format the data for output - the default 
should work well for most cases. Enter the file name on the line labeled "File:" and 
press the button marked [Accept], to write the data. The item, `Imbed parameters,' 
causes ACE/gr to write not only the data, but the parameters describing the graph or 
graphs as well.
<p>
A complete dump of the contents of ACE/gr may be accomplished by selecting all sets, 
imbed parameters, and all active graphs. The file generated this way can then be read as 
a normal data file, and should recreate the originating environment.
<p>

<HR>

	<h3> <a NAME="writeparams">Write parameters</a> </h3>
<p>
Select the graph from which to save the parameters. This can be the current graph, any 
particular graph, or all active graphs. Enter the parameter file name on the line labeled 
"Write parameters to", press "Accept" to write the current state of adjustable parameters, legends, strings, etc. A prompt will appear if the action would overwrite an existing 
file. allowing the operation to be cancelled.
<p>

<HR>

	<h3> <a NAME="saveall">Save all</a> </h3>
<p>
Perform a `Write sets' using all active sets, all active graphs, and imbed parameters. Use 
this to save the current session.
<p>

<HR>

	<h3> <a NAME="clearall">Clear all</a> </h3>
<p>
Kill all sets, graphs, and annotative text, lines, and boxes. After performing this action, 
it will be necessary to activate a graph using View/Graphs/Activate graphs.
<p>

<HR>

	<h3> <a NAME="print">Print</a> </h3>
<p>
Generate a hardcopy of the current plot on the device specified in the File/Printer setup 
popup.
<p>

<HR>

	<h3> <a NAME="printersetup">Printer setup</a> </h3>
<p>
Set the hardcopy device parameters. Select the device, where to print (either the printer 
or a file), and the string to use as a spooling command for the print job, or file name if 
output is directed to disk. Click on the `Accept' button to make the selections above current, or `Done' to close the popup and cancel the operation. If the selection is accepted, 
the next time File/Print is selected, hardcopy output will be to the selected device. Click 
on the `Print' button to accept the settings and print a hardcopy.
<p>

<HR>

	<h3> <a NAME="commands">Command interpreter</a> </h3>
<p>
Command driven version of the interface to ACE/gr. Here, commands are typed at the 
`Command:' text item and executed when <return> is entered. The command will be 
parsed and executed, and if no errors are found, the command line is placed in the history list. Items in the history list can be recalled by simply clicking on them with the left 
mouse button. Save a history list by clicking on the `Save...' button popping up the 
`Save commands' popup. Clicking on `Read...' will open the `Read commands' popup 
and allows previously stored commands to be loaded into the history list for future 
access. `Clear' empties the history list. `Replay' cycles through each item in the history 
list and executes each instruction in the list. See the command line reference for a 
description of the command line syntax.

<p>
Create sets from block data. Select the type of set and the columns to use for each vector 
of the new set. Press <b>Accept</b> to create the set. Note that reading block data does not 
affect the scaling of the graph so when a set is created using this popup, the set may not 
appear within the graph's scaling limits - use AS (Autoscale) to set the scale of the 
graph if needed (or use View/Define world).
<p>

<HR>

	<h2> <a NAME="hotkeys">Hot keys</a> </h2>
<p>
When the mouse is on the canvas (where the graph is drawn), there are some shortcuts 
that can be taken to bring up several popups. They are:
<p>
<ul>
	<li>  ^A - autoscale plot
	<li>  ^B - draw a box (using the current settings for boxes)
	<li>  ^D - delete an object (string, line, or box)
	<li>  ^N - move an object (string, line, or box)
	<li>  ^P - draw a line (using the current settings for lines)
	<li>  ^V - set the viewport with the mouse
	<li>  ^W - write a string (using the current settings for strings)
	<li>  ^X - exit ACE/gr
	<li>  ^Z - enable zoom
</ul>
<p>

<HR>

	<h2> <a NAME="fonts">Fonts</a> </h2>
<p>
	<h3> Changing fonts within a string </h3>
<p>
To change fonts within a string preceed the font number listed below by a backslash. To 
turn subscripting or superscripting on or off use \s for subscripts and \S for superscripting. Font selection is current for the remainder of the string or until the next font change. 
Subscripts and superscripts remain for the remainder of the string or until \N is seen. To 
print a backslash use \\. To backspace use \b. To begin underlining use \u, to stop underlining use \U. \+ increases the size of the characters and \- decreases the size of the characters.
<p>
ACE/gr uses the Hershey fonts to draw text on the screen, but PostScript fonts for hardcopy. There are discrepancies between the two sets of fonts and of this writing, there are 
problems with the mapping of Greek and special characters.
<p>
Font # 	Font
<ul>
	<li>  0 .... Complex Roman on screen, maps to Times-Roman.
	<li>  1 .... Triplex Roman on screen, maps to Times-Bold.
	<li>  2 .... Complex Italic on screen, maps to Times-Italic.
	<li>  3 .... Triplex Italic on screen, maps to Times-BoldItalic.
	<li>  4 .... Simplex on screen, maps to Helvetica.
	<li>  5 .... Duplex on screen, maps to Helvetica-Bold
	<li>  6 .... Complex Italic on screen, maps to Helvetica-Oblique.
	<li>  7 .... Triplex Italic on screen, maps to Helvetica-BoldOblique.
	<li>  8 .... Simplex Greek on screen, maps to the lower 128 characters of the Symbol font.
	<li>  9 .... Symbols on screen, maps to the upper 128 characters of the Symbol font.
	<li>  x .... Special symbols 
</ul>
<p>
Summary of other special commands
<ul>
	<li>  + .... increase size
	<li>  - .... decrease size
	<li>  b .... backspace length of previous character
	<li>  s .... begin subscripting
	<li>  S .... begin superscripting
	<li>  u .... begin underline
	<li>  U .... stop underline
	<li>  N .... return to normal
</ul>
<p>
Example:
<p>
 \0F\sX\N(\8e\0) = sin(\8e\0)*e\S(-X)\N*cos(\8e\0)
<p>
 prints roughly FX(e) = sin(e)*e -X*cos(e)
<p>
 using font 0 and e prints as epsilon from the Simplex Greek font. 
<p>
NOTE:
Special characters are mapped to the keyboard, the present mapping is not very well 
organized and may change.

                        CHARMM22.0 Release Package


The CHARMM22.0 release package for CHARMM developers and user sites includes

    (1) complete source and include files,
    (2) updated documentation files,
    (3) some supporting data files,
    (4) testcases,
    (5) the PREFX preprocessor, the FLEXFORT translator and
        tools needed to set up CHARMM development environments and
    (6) standard topology and parameter files.

    The files are organized in the followoing subdirectories.
~/ denotes the directory where you have unpacked (read from a tape
drive or issued the UNIX tar command) the CHARMM22 release package
delivered to you.  (VAX/VMS users read ~/charmm/ as [.CHARMM])

  ~/charmm/                 The main directory of CHARMM

  ~/charmm/source/          Contains all CHARMM source files

  ~/charmm/doc/             The most recent CHARMM documentation
                            If GNU emacs is available on your host
                            machine, you may 'soft' link this directory
                            to the emacs info directory to access the
                            documentation via the emacs info-program.

  ~/charmm/support/         Supplementary programs and data files

  ~/charmm/test/            CHARMM test-suite

  ~/charmm/tool/            Preprocessor, FLECS translator and
                            other CHARMM installation utilities

  ~/charmm/topar/           Standard topology/parameter files

  ~/charmm/exec/            The CHARMM22 executable charmm22 will be
                            stored here when installation is completed. 

  ~/charmm/build/           Contains Makefile, module makefiles and
                            the log file of the install make command
                            for each machine in the subdirectory named
                            after the machine type. 

  ~/charmm/lib/             Contains library files

    The total of 520+ CHARMM files are listed below.  The content of
this package defines the current release (CHARMM version 22.0).

            Major Differences between CHARMM20 and CHARMM22


As CHARMM20 is not clearly defined, it is not straightforward to sort
out major differences between the current version of CHARMM
(CHARMM22.0) and a previous version (CHARMM20 or CHARMm21).
The VAX version CHARMM on HUCHE1 turns out to be a "developmental"
version towards CHARMM21 and contains the crystal facility, BLOCK, etc.
The following is prepared by comparing the developmental VAX version
CHARMM21 source code and that of CHARMM22.0.


Obsolete Modules Deleted from CHARMM20
--------------------------------------

[1] GRAMPS
It is supported only in the VAX version CHARMM20.
TH:[MK.PROT.SOURCE.VAX]GRAMPS.FLX contains an interactive routine that
writes several files for the command language interpreter for
producing computer graphics on the Evans &amp; Sutherland
Multi-Picture-System called GRAMPS.  This obsolete feature is no
longer supported in CHARMM22.

[2] PARAmeter Optimization
PARMOP is not incorporated in the VAX version CHARMM20 either except
at the point of command parsing.  It seems that the feature has never
been included in the central version.


New Features in CHARMM22
------------------------

[1] BLOCK
The developmental CHARMM21 VAX version supports some BLOCK commands.
The BLOCK commands are used to partition the molecular system into
blocks and allows for the use of coefficients that scale the
interaction energies between the blocks.  Specific commands to carry
out free energy simulations with a component analysis scheme have been
implemented.

[2] CRYStal
The CRYStal commands are used to build a crystal with any space group
symmetry, to optimize its lattice parameters and molecular coordinates
and to carry out a vibrational analysis.  The CRYSTAL program is
incorporated into the IMAGE module.  The VAX developmental version has
a separate CRYSTL module.

[3] COOR COVAri
The new COORdinate subcommand COVAriance is added.  It computes
covariances of the spatial atom displacements of a dynamics trajectory
for selected pairs of atoms.

[4] CORR HELIx / CORR PUCKer
The New CORRelation commands HELIx and PUCKer are introduced.  The
HELIx command computes time series of the helical axis orientation and
PUCKer computes that of the sugar pucker phase and amplitude.


[5] DRAW, GRAP
The new module GRAPHICS provides CHARMM the capability of displaying
molecular structures when run on a graphics workstation.  (Currently
works only on Apollo machines.)

[6] HBTRim
The HBTRim command deletes hydrogen bonds that have an energy of
interaction that is higher than the specified cutoff.  This command is
used to reduce a list of hydrogen bonds to that of important hydrogen
bonds.

[7] MOLVIB
MOLVIB is a general purpose vibrational analysis program, suitable for
small to medium sized molecules (less than 50 atoms).  It performs
canonic force field calculations (KANO), crystal normal mode analysis
for k=0 (CRYS) and other vibrational analyses in internal coordinates
or in Cartesian coordinates.  Details are documented in molvib.doc.

[8] PERT
The PERTurbe command allows the scaling between PSFs for use in energy
analysis, comparisons, slow growth free energy simulations, and
widowing free energy simulations.  This is a rather flexible
implementation of free energy perturbation that allows connectivity to
change.  Also, three energy restraint terms (harmonic, dihedral and
NOE) are subject to change which allows a flexible way in which to
compute free energy differences between different conformations.

[9] QUANTUM
Quantum mechanical and molecular mechanical combined force field
method is implemented by employing the semi-empirical SCF method of
the MOPAC program.  This module has not been tested nor documented.
The code does not confirm CHARMM coding standards.  The future of the
code is not certain at the time of the current release.

[10] RMSD
The new RMSDyn routine is a modified CORMAN routine by William D.
Laidig, which computes the RMS difference between two trajectory files
and make a matrix of results.  

[11] RXNCOR
The RXNCor command is used for defining a reaction coordinate for any
molecule based on its structure and impose an umbrella potential along
that reaction coordinate  (i.e., to run activated dynamics along this
coordinate) in order to trace out the free energy profile during the
structural change along the coordinate.

[12] SOLANA
The solvent analysis facility computes solvent averaged properties,
e.g., the solvent velocity autocorrelation function, mean-square
displacement function, solvent-solvent radial distribution functions,
solvent-reference site radial distribution function, and the solvent -
reference site deformable boundary force.

[13] TRAJ
The new TRAJectory command is used to merges or to break up a dynamics
coordinate or velocity trajectory into different numbers of units.

[14] TSM
The Thermodynamics Simulation Method module performs the free energy
simulation.

[15] Urey-Bradley Energy Term
Urey-Bradley 1-3 terms have been added.  The developmental CHARMM21
also includes U-B terms.

[16] Update
Two new non-bonded neighbour list updating schemes are introduced; one
has something to do with an automated updating procedure and the other
with the list generation algorithm.
    When INBFRQ is set to -1 (which is the default), heuristic testing
is performed every time ENERGY is called and a list update is done if
necessary.
    A new routine NBNDGC (nbndgc.src), a modification of NBONDG, is
introduced.  NBNDGC is based on a cubical grid searching algorithm and
generates the nonbonded list in linear time, as opposed to quadratic.
On the Convex C220, which is a vector machine, it is faster than
NBONDG for any system larger than a few hundred atoms.

[17] Integrator
The leap-frog integrator has been implemented.  While the "old" Verlet
integrator is still available via the DYNA VERLet command (and is the
default), the new integrator can be accessed by DYNA LEAP.

[18] Constant Pressure &amp; Temperature Dynamics (DYNCPT)
The constant pressure/temperature dynamics algorithm is implemented
following the paper by Berendsen et al. (J. Chem. Phys. (1984) 81(8)
p.3684).


Modification of CHARMM20 to CHARMM22
------------------------------------

[1] ANALysis
The VAX version analysis facility is replaced by an energy
contribution array (ECONT).  All evaluated energy terms are
partitioned into each atomic contribution and collected in the array,
which is accessible through the SCALAR command.

[2] XRAY
The XRAY command of CHARMM20 is replaced by the READ XRAY command in
CHARMM22.  In CHARMM22, all I/O functions are parsed in mainio.src.
The subroutine XRAY is changed to RDXRAY, which generates a card file
compatible with Richard Feldmann's XRAY display program.

[3] NOE
NOE constraint has been overhauled.  It now handles general distance
restraint terms.

[4] MISCOM
The miscellaneous command parser (miscom.src in CHARMM22) is modified.
(1) The SKIPE command is parsed in MISCOM.
(2) New command parameter (@x) handling commands are added: DIVIde,
    EXPOnentiate, GET, MULTiply and SHOW.
(3) The RANDOM command is added to set random number specifications.
(4) The STOP command is parsed in MISCOM.
(5) The QUICk (or Q) command is added to carry out a quick coordinate
    analysis.

[5] HANDLE
The subroutine HANDLE is improved to accept command line arguments
given with the CHARMM command issued to an operating system.  It works
on most UNIX, UNICOS and VAX/VMS versions.

[6] Command Parameters
In CHARMM20, we have ten command parameters @n, where n is a single
digit, 0 through 9.  It is expanded to support any single
alpha-numeric character so that one can use upto 36 command
parameters (0-9, a-z).

[7] Dynamic Memory Allocation
Most of UNIX versions now support VEHEAP.  VEHEAP was originally
implemented by employing VAX/VMS system calls.  It expands the HEAP
common block when more HEAP space is needed.  In UNIX versions, we use
the UNIX system library routine malloc(), if available (the
availability depends on the machine), to perform the same function.  

[8] File Format / Compatibility
All binary files except dynamics trajectory are written in double
precision format and not compatible with old versions.  For PSF,
topology, parameter, etc. one should use CARD format to transfer
previous version files to CHARMM22.  Trajectory files are written in
single precision and compatible with all CHARMM versions and QUANTA.
Old version dynamics restart files are not compatible with CHARMM22.

[9] Random Number Generator
All random number routines are implemented in double precision (64-bit
words).  Box-Muller algorithm is used for generating a Gaussian random
deviat.  A machine specific random number routine (RANV of CONVEX
VECLIB) is used in a CMU version.

                      User Site CHARMM Installation


The installation is carried out by the shell script ~/charmm/install.com.
[Under VAX/VMS one can use the DCL procedure VMSINSTALL.COM instead.]
Change your working directory to ~/charmm and run install.com.
install.com expects one to two arguments.

  install.com &lt;host_machine_type&gt; [ &lt;CHARMM_22_size&gt; ]

For VAX/VMS installation
  @VMSINSTALL  [ &lt;CHARMM_22_size&gt; ]

The default and possible arguments are 

  &lt;host_machine_type1&gt; = { convex, sgi, sun, stardent, ibmrs, cray }
  &lt;CHARMM_22_size&gt;     = { small, medium, large           | medium }

where { | } is for { possible arguments | default }.  &lt;CHARMM_22_size&gt;
depends on your machine memory configuration.  'medium' is recommended
for Convex, SGI, Stardent and IBM RS/6000 and 'small' is for SUN and
Cray versions.

For example, 'install.com sgi'
  1. installs the preprocessor PREFX and the FLECS translator
     FLEXFORT in ~/charmm/tool (prefx_sgi and flexfort_sgi),
  2. generates the proper ~/charmm/build/sgi/pref.dat file (PREFX data file),
  3. generates makefile suitable for SGI computers running under IRIX
     (~/charmm/build/sgi/Makefile),
  4. processes 172 FLECS/FORTRAN source files, 75 FCM files and one C
     source file in ~/charmm/build/sgi, compiles/builds module
     libraries in ~/charmm/lib/sgi, and 
  5. links them to produce the executable ~/charmm/exec/sgi/charmm22.

                          CHARMM Documentation

The CHARMM documentation set is being updated and improved.  The
up-to-the-date documentation set is included in the current release.
The documentation is an integral part of CHARMM.

    The documentation files are accessible through the info program in
GNU emacs.  If emacs is available on your system, you may incorporate
the documentation into the info-tree structure.  The following is the
info-building procedure.

(1) Locate the info directory.  On tammy.harvard.edu, it is 
    /usr/lib/gemacs/info.  It may differ on your machine.
(2) Find the file, dir, in the info directory.  You should have a
    write access of the directory.  If the info directory is protected,
    contact your system manager and let him do the job.  Edit the dir file
    and insert the following one line under "* Menu".

* CHARMM: (c22doc/charmm.doc). CHARMM 22 Documentation

    It should appear exactly as shown; asterisk (*) in the first
column, etc.  The the part of dir file may look like this.

File: dir       Node: Top       This is the top of the INFO tree

        Quick Key Reference

        d                  return here
        q                  exit
        ?                  list INFO commands
        h                  help
        mCHARMM&lt;return&gt;    go into CHARMM documentation
        1                  go into CHARMM documentation (works for 1..5)

                Standard CHARMM Topology and Parameter Files


The status of the all hydrogen sets is developmental, as indicated
by the _b2 in the filenames.  As of the present release the majority of
the parameterization is complete and, thus, the number of changes can
be expected to be minimal.  However, some changes may and probably
will occur and the files must be used accordingly.  The extended atom
parameters for proteins are the same as those included with CHARMM20
which are based on Wally Reiher's thesis.  For the extended atom
nucleic acid parameters those of Nilsson and Karplus, J. Comp. Chem.
7:591-616, 1986 are used which were also included in the CHARMM20
release and are the only set to include explicit hydrogen bonding
terms.  Some alterations of the extended atom nucleic acid topology
and parameter files have been made in order to maintain compatibility
with the multiple dihedral scheme in CHARMM22.  Please send all
remarks and suggestions to paraman@tammy.harvard.edu.

    (A) Topology files
        (1) top_all22_lipid_b2.inp  all hydrogen RTF for lipids
        (2) top_all22_prot_b2.inp   all hydrogen RTF for proteins

<p>The user of CHARMM controls its execution by executing commands
sequentially from a command file or interactivly. In general the ordering
of commands is limited only by the data required by the command.
For example, the energy cannot be calculated unless the arrays holding
the coordinates, the parameters, etc., have already been filled.

<p>This section deals with overall usage, as opposed to the
detailed description of any given command. This is a good place to
start when first learning CHARMM.

<p>The syntax of commands is described using the following rules:
Capitalized words are keywords that must be specified as is. However, if
the word is partially capitalized, it may be abbreviated to the
capitalized part. Lower case words are to be replaced by a corresponding
data entry. The symbol "::=" means "has the following syntactic form:".
Anything enclosed in square brackets, "[]", is optional. If several
things are stacked in square brackets, one may choose one optionally.
Anything enclosed in curly brackets, "{}", specifies that a selection
must be made of the choices stacked vertically inside. The syntactic
entities which appear as an argument to "repeat" may be repeated any
number (including zero) times. Defaults for optional parameters may be
enclosed in apostrophes and placed under the entity they stand for.
However, defaults are not specified in this manner if the rules for the
default are complex.

<p>The <a href="#syntactic_glossary">Syntactic Glossary</a>
contains further syntactic entities which are used in the command
descriptions. Finally, the options and operands in each command can
usually be specified in any order except if otherwise noted.

<p>A CHARMM run is controlled by a command file (or files).
This section of the documentation describes the basic rules for
the command file.  Details of command level run control are described
in the next node.

<p>A command file for CHARMM should begin with a specification of
the title of the run. (See the
<a href="#syntactic_glossary">syntactic glossary</a> for the
syntax of a title.) Then, any number of commands may be specified.

<p>Each command consists of a command line possibly followed by
other data. The command line is scanned free field. This command line
may be longer than one line in the file; to do this, one must place a
hyphen at the end of line which is to be continued on the next line.
Comments may be placed on a command line by preceding the comments by
exclamation points. All lower case characters are converted to upper
case. This format is identical to that used by the VAX command language
interpreter. In addition, blank lines are permitted to separate blocks
of commands for increased readability.

<p>The first word of every command line specifies the command.
Generally, required operands of a command must follow in order.
On the other hand, options may generally be specified in any
order. Further, any number is always preceded by a key word so that any
numeric operands, can be placed in arbitrary order.

<p>The command line is scanned in units of words and delimited
strings. A word is defined by a sequence of non-blank characters, A
delimited string consists of a keyword followed by a string of
characters of variable length followed by a delimiter string.
One example of where a delimeter string is used is in atom selection
where the syntax is;  SELE ...... END. Note, that the "END" is required and
delimits the atom selection.

<p>Abbreviations are permitted in various contexts. The first word
may be abbreviated to four characters and numerous options and operands
may also be abbreviated to four characters. However, some key words which
are used to mark numbers may not be abbreviated. See the processing for
individual commands to see what can and cannot be abbreviated.

<p>Many of the various options and numeric values are maintained
from one invocation of a command to the next. Once a value is specified,
it is maintained until it is changed in any command. Therefore, if CUTNB
is specified in a NBON command, that value will be used in the DYNA
command unless it is changed therein.

<p>Usually, when a free field command line is read in, it is
echoed onto a standard output. Each such echo will be prepended by a short
marker, eg. "CHARMM&gt;", which identifies the line of input as well as the
command processor which is interpreting it.

<p>In general, as each of the command is interpreted, it is deleted
from the command line. When command processing is finished, a check is
made to see that nothing is left over. The presence of extraneous junk
indicates that something was mistyped. For some commands, such as DYNAmics,
where a mistake may be costly, extraneous characters result in a fatal
error.

<p>This node describes commands that are used to modify the usual
sequential interpretation of commands from the command file.  Three
methods are available to accomplish this: 

<ul>
<li>IF tests to conditionally execute a single command
<li>GOTO and LABEL transfers within a file
<li>STREAM and RETURN transfers to different command files.
</ul>

<p>In addition commands can be modified by the use of command parameters.
The command line reader scans input lines for parameters (specified by
@n where n is an alphanumeric character) and will subsitute the
appropriate parameter string.  Command parameters are defined using
the SET command to set one of the 36 command parameters, and their
values (if numeric) can be modified by the INCRement command, which
decodes the parameter string, does real arithmetic and encodes the
result.  The command parameters are identified by alphanumeric
characters (0-9,A(a)-Z(z)(not case-sensitive)).

<p>IF compares the string in the specified parameter string
to the comparison-string using the test-spec (GT GE EQ NE LE LT).
If the comparison is true then the rest of the command line is
executed (otherwise it is ignored).  The EQ and NE comparisons are
done as string comparisons, but the others require decoding of the
two strings and comparison by real arithmetic.  The command-spec
can be any valid command line (including another IF test or
a GOTO or STREAM specification).

<p>GOTO causes the current command file to be rewound and
searched for a line containing the correct LABEL and label-string.
The label-string is a single word.  If multiple occurrences of a
label are present, the first will be used.  Command interpretation
begins on the line following the LABEL (any information after the
LABEL keyword and label-string is ignored).

<p>STREAM iunit begins reading commands from the specified
fortran logical unit or from the stream file.  The stream file is
treated exactly as the main command file.  It begins with a title and
ends with a STOP or RETURN, the latter causing control to return to
the previously active command file at the point where the stream
switch occurred.

<p>The logical unit in OPEN, CLOSE, and REWIND commands are
useful in working with streams (see <a href="miscom.html">MISCOM</a>).

<p>In order to keep CHARMM as machine independent as possible, all
specification of files is done through Fortran unit numbers.  Two unit
numbers have special signifigance, 5 and 6.  Unit 5 is the command file
interpreted by CHARMM.  Unit 6 is the output file for all printed
messages.  As commands are read from unit 5, they are echoed on unit 6.
All other unit numbers have no predefined meaning. The CHARMM OPEN
command may be used to assign files to units.

<p>The tream file in "STREAM file-specfication" may be assigned
to a logical unit between 100 and 119 (80 and 99 on Cray machines).
Logical unit 0 through 9 may be used for CHARMM internal file
handling.  We recommend logical units 10 through 79 for user data
files.

<p>CHARMM uses a distinct system of units, the AKMA system. I.e.
Angstroms, Kilocalories/Mole, Atomic mass units. All distances are
measured in Angstroms, energies in kcal/mole, mass in atomic mass units,
and charge is in units of electron charge. Using this system, the AMKA
unit of time is 4.888821E-14 seconds (based on the constants tabulated
in Abramowitz and Stegun (1970)), however, for all input and output,
the time is listed in picoseconds (20 AKMA time units is .978 picoseconds).
In some places, the users may specify values in AKMA time units, and
in some places both picosecond and AKMA time are output.

<p>Angles are given in degrees for the analysis and constraint
sections. In parameter files, the minimum positions of angles are
specified in degrees, but the force constants for angles, dihedrals, and
dihedral constraints are specified in kcal/mole/radian/radian.

<p>Any numbers used in the documentation may be assumed to be in
AKMA units unless otherwise noted.

<hr>

<p>There are a number of data structures that CHARMM manipulates.
Many of these data structures are important for most operations; others
which are less important, are described with the commands that use them.
Much more specific information is available in the various common blocks
whose extension is .fcm in the source directory, ~/charmm/source/fcm
([...CHARMM.SOURCE.FCM] on VAX).

<p>The important data structures are given below: Each data
structure name is followed by its abbreviation which is used as its name
in commands.

<ol>
<p><li>Residue Topology File (RTF)<br>
           The residue topology file stores the definitions of all
           residues. The atoms, atomic properties, bonds, bond angles,
           torsion angles, improper torsion angles, hydrogen bond donors
           and acceptors and antecedents, and non-bonded exclusions are
           all specified on a per residue basis. The term "residue" is
           somewhat historical, but can be any basic unit.

<p><li>The Parameters (PARA or PARM)<br>
           The parameters specify the force constants, equilibrium
           geometries, van der Waals radii, and other such data needed
           for calculating the energy.

<p><li>Structure File (PSF)<br>
           The structure file is the concatenation of
           information in the RTF. It specifies the information for the
           entire structure. It has a hierarchical organization wherein
           atoms are grouped into residues which are grouped into
           segments which comprise the structure. Each atom is uniquely
           identified within a residue by its IUPAC name, residue
           identifier, and its segment identifier. Identifiers may be up
           to 4 characters in length.

<p><li>The Internal Coordinates (IC)<br>
           The internal coordinates data structure contains information
           concerning the relative positions of atoms within a structure.
           This data structure is most commonly used to build or modify
           cartesian coordinates from known or desired internal coordinate
           values. It is also used in conjunction with the analysis of
           normal modes. Since there are complete editing facilities,
           it can be used as a simple but powerful method of examining
           or analyzing structures.

<p><li>The Coordinates (COOR)<br>
           The coordinates are the Cartesian coordinates for all the
           atoms in the PSF. There are two sets of coordinates provided.
           The main set is the default used for all operations involving
           the positions of the atoms. A comparison set (also called the
           reference set) is provided for a variety of purposes, such as
           a reference for rotation or operations which involve
           differences between coordinates for a particular molecule.
           Associated with each coordinate set is a general purpose
           weighting array (one element for each atom).

<p><li>The Non-bonded List (NBON)<br>
           The non-bonded list contains the list of non-bonded
           interactions to be used in calculating the energies as well
           as optional information about the charge, dipole moment, and
           quadrapole moments of the residues. This data structure
           depends on the coordinates for its construction and must be
           periodically updated if the coordinates are being modified.

<p><li>The Hydrogen Bond List (HBON)<br>
           The hydrogen bond list contains the list of hydrogen bonds.
           Like the non-bonded list, this data structure depends on the
           coordinates and must be periodically updated.

<p><li>The Constraints (CONS)<br>
           There is a variety of available constraints. All data pertaining
           to constraints reside in this data structure.

<p><li>The Images data structure (IMAGES)<br>
           The images data structure determines and defines the relative
           positions and orientations of any symmetric image of the primary
           molecule(s). The purpose of this data structure is to allow
           the simulation of crystal symmetry or the use of periodic
           boundary conditions. Also contined in this data structure is
           information concerning all nonbonded, H-bonds, and bonded
           interactions between primary and image atoms.

<p>There are number of residue topology files, parameter files,
coordinates files and files of other data structures available. The most
important files generally available are residue topology and parameter
files. Both such classes of files are stored for general use in the
CnnPT: directories. The file names used for both these files
consists of an alphabetic part followed by a number, e.g. PARAM7.
There are two copies of each file; one with extension, .INP, which is a
character files used as an command file to generate the binary file,
with extension, .MOD. The .INP is meant for human eyes; the .MOD files
is meant for CHARMM to read efficiently. The numeric part of each name
is its version number. In general, one should use the highest version
number of a file.

<p>Although parameter files and toplogy files are separate,
they are usually associated, and they must be taken together when
generating a structure (PSF). For example, a parameter set for proteins
will not work with a DNA topology file.

they contain, see the following sections.

<p>A mechanism has been provided to allow users of the
CHARMM to write their own special purpose subroutines which can be
incorporated into the system without threatening its integrity.

<p>There are six "hooks" into the CHARMM which have been
specially provided for casual modifiers. For detailed descriptions of
each of these hooks, consult the routine in
<ul>
<li><tt>~/charmm/source/main/usersb.src</tt> on UNIX machines or
<li><tt>[...CHARMM.SOURCE.MAIN]USERSB.SRC</tt> under VAX/VMS.
</ul>

<ol>
<p><li>USERSB<br>
        The USER command invokes the subroutine, USERSB, and performs
no other action.  USERSB is a subroutine with no arguments.  However,
parameters may be passed to this subroutine via the COMMON blocks.
These COMMON blocks store nearly all of the systems data.  These common
blocks may be obtained by including them from the directory containing
the sources for the version of the program you are using.

<p><li>USERE<br>
        A user supplied energy routine may be provided that will be
invoked on every energy evaluation. The force arrays should be
modified accordingly.

<p><li>USRSEL<br>
        If one need to be able to select atoms in a manner not
possible with the existing options, a user selection routine
may be specified. One such example would be for for selecting atoms
within a given rectangular solid, or other (nonsperical) solid.

<p><li>USERNM<br>
        Within VIBRAN, a user specified vector or mode may be
generated with this routine. One command that appends this motion
onto the existing set of vectors is "EDIT INCL USER integer".

<p><li>USERF<br>
        A user specified parameter fitting routine may be specified.

<p><li>USRTIM<br>
        A user specified time series routine may be provied for use in
computing correlation functions.
</ol>

<p>To simplify the use of these hooks and to allow users to replace
subprograms in the CHARMM with their own versions of said
subprograms, the command procedure BUILD has been provided.  BUILD
will produce a private version of the CHARMM in your default USER
directory using your versions of USERSB and USERE.  The procedure
looks in your directory for USERSB.SRC and USERE.SRC.  If either file
(or both) is found, it is used in the make procedure of the CHARMM.

<p>BUILD command should always be used to generate a private
version of the CHARMM as it will always use the correct files for
linking.

<p>Before attempting to write your own USER functions, you should
familiarize yourself with the information available onthe
implementation of CHARMM.

<p>This interface procedure is designed for short, one time
programs.  If a user written subroutine is of general use, the routine
should be rewritten to conform to parameter passing standards used in the
system and then will be incorporated into the central CHARMM.

<p>There are several utility routines available to a user routine.
Some of them are listed below.

<p>CALL GETE(X,Y,Z,...)  will cause the energy and forces to be
computed and values are saved in the appropriate common blocks. For
this to work properly, NBONDS, HBONDS, and CODES must have been called.
This can be done by executing both the NBONds and HBONds command,
by the use of the UPDAte command, or by having previously found the
energy (minimization, dynamics, etc..).

<p>CALL PRINTE(...) will write the current energy
values (from common block values) to the specified unit (IUNIT).
It will also write out the cycle or iteration number and optionally
write out the standard header.

                  Deformable Boundary Potential Files


    A deformable boundary potential (DBP) file is required to run the
stoichastic boundary molecular dynamics (SBMD) simulatiuon.  Only
spherical DBP's are included in the current release.  In the future
release, cylindrical boundaries and plane shape boundaries will be
incorporated and the DBP generation routine will also be available
through CHARMM.

    ~/charmm/support/bpot (or [...CHARMM.SUPPORT.BPOT] on VMS
machines) contains DBP files for the TIP3P water in a spherical
simulation zone with 8 to 25 angstrom effective radius.  These DBP
files are generated by using Charlie Brooks' MFFGEN1 program and the
CHARMM SBOUND command.  The effective radius is set to the Langevin
and reservior region boundary (the reaction zone radius).  Then, the
boundary radius used in the DBP generating program (e.g., MFFGEN1.EXE
on HUCHE1.HARVARD.EDU) should be larger than the reaction zone radius
by the water oxygen van der Waals radius.  The reaction zone radius
plus 1.7682 angstrom (the TIP3P water oxygen vdW radius) is used to
generate the DBP for a given effective radius sphere.  The nonbonded
cutoff of 7.5 angstrom is used in the DBP generation procesure.  Those
DBP files can be used in simulations with different nonbonded cutoff
distances.

    See <a href="sbound.html">Sbound</a>, for details on the SBOUND
command.

                            CHARMM Testcases


The CHARMM test cases are designed to test every feature of CHARMM and
some of the error handling.  Though the test cases are not designed as
a tutorial and some used options and input parameters are not recommended,
the test cases are a valuable learning tool in setting up input files
for CHARMM.

                    Notes about the Testcase Suite


Testcases are reformed.  All testcases before version 22 are collected
in ~charmm/test/c20test and new tests are written while we develop
CHARMM22.  The new testcases are gathered in ~charmm/test/c22test.
Note the following.

  (1) In the new testcase suite, we use formatted I/O for
      topology/parameter files in order for all testcases to run
      independently each other.
  (2) We make testcases self-contained whenever possible.
      Required data files are found in ~charmm/test/data.
  (3) CHARMM command parameter 0 and 9 are reserved to point
      directories for data and scratch files.  These are defined in
      the stream file ~charmm/test/datadir.def.  The default
      definitions are
          set  0  data/
          set  9  scratch/
  (4) In the distribution package, we include a set of benchmarks in
      ~charmm/test/bench{22, etc.}.  The benchmark directory name
      depends on the version and machine platforms.
  (5) A developer must run all the testcases and confirm the benchmarks
      before he send in his developmental version.  If he develops a
      new function, he has to provide proper testcases.

                            How to Run Testcases


In order to run testcases, you have to locate ~charmm/test/datadir.def
and review the content.  It directs the directories for data and
scratch files needed for testcases.  Since the stream file is
stream'ed at the beginning, you may specify other job characteristics
in the file, e.g., bomb level (by the BOMLEV command), FASTer level, etc.
[If you are a beginning user and learning CHARMM, just change your
working directory to ~charmm/test and do not bother with the file.]

    A C-shell script is provided in ~charmm/test/test22.com, which expects
at least one argument.

test22.com host_machine_type [ output_dir benchmark_dir target_executable ]

(1) host_machine_type can be convex, cray, ibmrs, sgi, stardent, sun, etc.
    and must be specified.
(2) output_dir is an optional argument which indicates the directory
    where you collect output files.  The default is output.
(3) benchmark_dir is an optional and points the directory that
    contains benchmark files.  If you specify 0 for this argument,
    then no comparison is done.  The default is bench22.
(4) target_executable is the executable you are testing.  If not specified
    the default executable, ~charmm/exec/{host_machine_type}/charmm22, is
    used.

For example, if your host is a Convex and you want run under the
default setting, your command is

test22.com convex

You may run test22.com in the background or in the batch.

    When test22.com is finished, you may find the report file that
records differences between the test output and the target benchmark.
Normally the report file is named as {output_dir}.rpt.  The review
may indicate small numeric discrepancies due to different machine
precision and compiler options used.

                        CHARMM Developer Guide

This node and all its subnodes serve to provide a guide to someone
who wants to understand how CHARMM is implemented, and a variety of
rules that should be followed by anyone who wishes to modify it.
Anyone who wishes to modify CHARMM is advised to read through

                CHARMM Implementation and Management

One of major differences between CHARMM22 and previous versions is
that CHARMM22 is a well defined software system package.  The formal
definition covers source, documentation, testcases, support data files
and CHARMM processing utility tools.  The contents of the current
release are found in <a href="install.html#definition">install: Definition</a>.

    CHARMM is implemented as a single program package, which is
developed  on a variety of platforms.  As a result, it includes some
machine specific implementations and makes heavy use of the virtual
memory capabilities.  By placing everything together, the task of
modifying the program is made more reliable because errors in
modifying the program are more likely to be noticed.  The single
source package concept helps us to maintain integrity of CHARMM as the
paradigmatic macromolecular research software system.

    CHARMM22 is maintained by utilizing software engineering tools.
We use the VAXset (VAX Software Engineering Tools) utility CMS (Code
Management System) to maintain the CHARMM source code (including
include files) and the documentation.  The CMS library of CHARMM
resides on HUCHE1 (VAX 11/780 running under VMS 4.6).  We combine CMS
and VAX/VMS ACL (Access Control List) to manage the CHARMM system
environment.  This includes (1) CAP (CHARMM Authorization Program),
(2) CHECKIN (an automated CMS check-in facility), (3) BUILD (a script
to compile/link the CHARMM source code) and (4) REMOTE_COPY (a
procedure to update the central CHARMM system on other sites).

    Since VAX/VMS is not well supported as of this release, we plan to
build our own CMS (which stands for CHARMM Management System) on a
UNIX platform.  RCS would be a candidate for the basis of code
management.  The CHARMM manager will be the sole owner of all CHARMM
files and he will schedule/checkin/merge contributions from both
in-house and remote developers for CHARMM23.

    CHARMM22 is written in FLECS, FORTRAN77 and C languages.
In the past, before FORTRAN77, FLECS allowed us to use a variety of
control constructs, e.g., WHEN-ELSE, WHILE, UNLESS, etc.  A FLECS to
FORTRAN translator has been used to process FLECS source code to
produce FORTRAN source.  Recently, we begin to program directly with
FORTRAN77.  We have been able to replace all FLECS constructs with
IF-THEN-ELSE-ENDIF and other FORTRAN77 constructs.  An extension of
the original FLECS translator enables us to use both languages in the
same source file.  The preprocessor directives ##FORTRAN and ##FLECS 
can be used to direct proper translation.  The initial project in
CHARMM23 development is to convert all FLECS source code to FORTRAN.
[NOTE: new code must be written in FORTRAN.]  We use the C language
only for some machine specific coding.  There is only one C source in
CHARMM22, cstuff.c.

                     CHARMM Directory Structure


CHARMM files are organized in the following directories.  We use UNIX
pathnames throughout the document.  ~/ is the parent directory that
contains the CHARMM main directory, ~/charmm.  If your machine is
running under the VMS operating system, ~/charmm should be understood
as [...CHARMM] in the file system.

Directory            Purpose
-------------------  ---------------------------------------------------
~/charmm             The main directory of the current CHARMM version.
                     install.com procedure runs in this directory.

~/charmm/source      Sources and include files.

~/charmm/doc         Documentation

~/charmm/test        Test cases and benchmark outputs for comparison.

~/charmm/toppar      Standard topology and parameter files.

~/charmm/support     Holds various support programs and data files for
                     CHARMM.  See <a href="support.html">Support</a>.

~/charmm/tool        Contains the preprocessor, PREFLX, the FLECS
                     translator, FLEXFORT and other management tools.

~/charmm/build       Contains Makefile, module makefiles and the log
                     file of the install make command for each machine
                     in the subdirectory named after the machine type.

~/charmm/lib         Contains library files

~/charmm/exec        Will hold the executable

                Standards (rules) for writing CHARMM code

Because CHARMM is implemented by a group, there are a number of
conventions which must be observed in order for the program to remain
modifiable, usable, and transferable.  The rules which have been
established towards this end are listed below.

 1) CHARMM22 source and support files are maintained under CMS of
    VAXSET.  The CMS record is at the head of each file.  The CMS
    information should not be disturbed at any circumstances. 

 2) Gross subroutine organization:
    All INCLUDE statements are processed by the preprocessor to handle
    machine dependent INCLUDE'ing.  ##INCLUDE is the preprocessor
    keyword.  nn as in charmm_nn denotes the version number.  Each
    subroutine should have the following structure.  Note that any
    data statements come after all declarations and parameter
    statements, but before the first line of executable code. 

      SUBROUTINE DOTHIS(ARG1,ARG2,....
C
C     A comment which describes the purpose of this subroutine.
C     This may include important variables and what their use is
C     to aid in understanding and modifying the routine.
C
C     A description of all passed arrays and arguments if
C     users need to call this routine. 
C
##INCLUDE '~/charmm_nn/impnon.fcm' (required)
##INCLUDE '~/charmm_nn/dimens.fcm' (if dimensioned common blocks are included)
##INCLUDE '~/charmm_nn/exfunc.fcm' (if external functions are called)
##INCLUDE '~/charmm_nn/number.fcm' (if commonly used real*8 numbers are used)
C
      declare all passed variables here
C
##INCLUDE '~/charmm_nn/what_i_need.fcm'
##INCLUDE '~/charmm_nn/more_i_need.fcm'
C
C local
           Declarations of ALL local variables and parameters.
            .
           data statements at end of declarations.
C
C begin
            .
            .
           Code (liberally documented through comments)
            .
            .
      END

 3) All code should be written clearly.  Since the code must be
    largely self-documenting, clarity should not be sacrificed for 
    insignificant gains in efficiency.  Variable names should be
    chosen with care so as to illustrate their purpose.  Avoid using
    one or two letter variable names except for scratch variables.
    Comments should be used where the function of code is not obvious.

 4) Input/Output
    a) The RDCMND routine should be used to read lines from the
       command stream.  XTRANE should be called to be sure that the
       entire command line is parsed.
    b) Short outputs, messages, warnings, and error should be sent to
       unit OUTU (accessed by ##INCLUDE '~/charmm_nn/stream.fcm') for
       output. 
    c) All non-fatal messages should state what subroutine generated it.
    d) PSF and parameter unformatted I/O file formats must remain
       upward compatible. Use an ICNTRL array element to indicate
       which version of CHARMM wrote the file. Such upward
       compatibility must be maintained only across production
       versions of CHARMM. In other words, a file format for the
       developmental version may be freely changed until a new version
       is generated, at which point all future versions must be able
       to read it.
    e) I/O of files should be possible in both card and binary format,
       and routines should exist to interconvert between the two.

 5) All error conditions must terminate with a CALL DIE, CALL
    WRNDIE(...), or CALL DIEWRN(n). 

 6) Large or variable storage requirements must be met on the stack or
    heap. When allocating space for the stack or heap, the appropriate
    space allocation subroutine MUST be called. For example, to
    allocate J integer words off the stack, POINTER=ALLSTK(J) is not
    sufficient.  One must use POINTER=ALLSTK(INTEG4(J)) to ensure
    proper performance across different machines.  This also applies
    when freeing the space. The amount of space required for any
    purpose should NEVER be assumed.  This is essential for the
    portability of CHARMM. 

 7) Array overflows should be checked for. Error checking in general
    should be as complete as feasible.  Consider checking for
    overflows (recipricals of very small numbers, exponentials of very
    large numbers, etc.), square roots of negative numbers, arccosine 
    or arcsine of numbers of absolute value greater than one, etc.

 8) The code should use a minimum of non-standard Fortran-77 features.
    Such features MUST be restricted to the machine dependent modules,
    or encapsulated in ##IF - ##ELSE - ##ENDIF preprocessor
    constructs.  The only non-Fortran-77 features we use are the INCLUDE 
    statement and the REAL*8 (and INTEGER*2) designators.

 9) All common blocks are to be placed in files and INCLUDE'd into
    the program.  The common blocks should have comments describing
    each variable in the common block so that new users will know
    what's there.  The comments should also give clear relationships
    between the variables, so that redimensioning the common block is
    straightforward.  The device on which the file resides must be
    given as ~/charmm_nn/ where nn is the current version number.  The
    common block files should be named with lower case and have the
    extension .fcm.  Every variable in every common block must be
    declared within the FCM (INCLUDE'd) file.  No Data statements
    should appear in FCM files, and variables declared in FCM's should
    not then be initialized in any other Data statement within
    subroutines.  Moreover, a variable should not appear in more than
    one FCM if there is a possibility that both FCM's will be used in
    the same subroutine.  The multiple declaration will result in an
    error. 

10) Functions should NEVER be called with a CALL statement. Note that
    ENTRY points of functions are also functions.   Moreover, avoid the 
    use of ENTRY points.

11) The generic use of a function should be used unless there is a
    good reason not to.  For example, use SQRT(DP) rather than DSQRT(DP). 

12) Real constants should be defined in PARAMETER statements.  The
    statement above the PARAMETER statement should declare the
    parameter.  Only parameters defined in the following line should
    be declared in such a position.  Double-precision (REAL*8)
    constants should be PARAMETERized with a D.  For example: 
      REAL*8 ONED, THREE, FIVE, SEVEN
      PARAMETER (ONED=1.0D0, THREE=3.0D0, FIVE=5.0D0, SEVEN=7.0D0)
      INTEGER MAXATM
      PARAMETER (MAXATM=99999)
      REAL ONES
      PARAMETER (ONES=1.0)
    Declaration and Parameter statements should not use continuation
    cards.  See fcm/number.fcm for frequently used numbers.

13) All routines should be up to the IMPLICIT NONE standard.  This
    means that all variables and arrays, whether passed or not, must 
    be declared. This is accomplished by inserting
    "##INCLUDE '~/charmm_nn/impnon.fcm'" in each routine.  The file
    ~/charmm/source/fcm/impnon.fcm may then be modified for testing
    purposes, but should contain only comments for normal usage or for 
    machines without an IMPLICIT NONE statement. (Here ~/charmm_nn/ is
    logically bound to the directory ~/charmm/source/fcm)  All
    elements of common blocks MUST be declared in the appropriate
    common file. 

14) All programming should be done in capital letters.  Only comments
    and character strings may use lower case.  No tabs should appear
    in code or documentation. 

15) All strings must be stored in CHARACTER variables.  Although
    integer and real variables will serve on some machines, this is 
    non-standard and eventually causes problems in transportation.

16) For routine command parsing, the keyword parsing functions INDXA,
    GTRMA, GTRMF, GTRMI, and NEXTA4 should be used.

17) The DIMENSION statement should not be used.  Neither should the
    PRINT statement. 

18) Variable names longer than 6 characters should not be used.  Also,
    1 and 2 letter variables should be avoided in large routines
    (except for loop count variables). 

19) Precision variables should be REAL*8 (rather than DOUBLE PRECISION).

20) There should be no large statement labels, particularly numbers
    over 50000.   Moreover, no variable or module names should be of
    the form Innnn (where nnnn is an integer).  No FLECS control
    statement (e.g., IF, DO, WHILE, etc.) should be labelled.  Use
    CONTINUE statement in place of the label. 

21) All variables must be initialized before first use.  This may
    best be done in the routine INIALL, which is called very early in
    every CHARMM run. 

22) Other coding conventions make it easier to search through text for
    particular strings using the SEARCH, fpat, or grep commands.
    Poorly placed spaces can make it very difficult to maintain code.
    Never put a space within a variable name.  Here are some other
    examples; 

         Good                         Please Avoid
        -----------------            ------------------
         GOTO                         GO TO
         CALL DOSOME(...              CALL  DOSOME(...
         ARRAY(5) = 20                CALL DOSOME (...
         ARRAY(5)=20                  ARRAY (5) = 20

                        CHARMM Developer Tools

CHARMM is available on a variety of computational devices and we
strongly support multiplatform development efforts.  CHARMM tools are
utility programs/procedures for installation, modification, 
optimization, etc.  In ~/charmm/tool, we include the preprocessor PREFX,
the FLECS-to-FORTRAN translator FLEXFORT and utility procedures for
module makefile generation.

                          CHARMM Preprocessing

In an attempt to have a "universal" CHARMM system, we have changed the
format of the source files.  The source files have the extension .src
and the include files have .fcm.  These files are processed by the
preprocesser (PREFX) which recognizes the following directives:

    (directives start at column 1 and are in upper case)

     ##IF key_word(s)
     ##ELIF alternate_keyword(s)
     ##ELSE
     ##ERROR 'message'
     ##ENDIF
     ##IFN key_word(s)

     There are 5 types of preprocessor key_words.  Only one directive
of each type (except for feature directives) must be used.

[1] Machine Type
      ALLIANT     ! = Alliant
      APOLLO      ! = HP-Apollo, both AEGIS and UNIX
      ARDENT      ! = Stardent
      CONVEX      ! = Convex Computer
      CRAY        ! = Cray Research Inc.
      CRAY2       ! = CRAY-2 (also needs the CRAY keyword)
      HPUX        ! = Hewlett-Packard series 700.
      IBM         ! = IBM-3090 running AIX
      IBMRS       ! = IBM-RS
      INTEL       ! = Intel iPSC Hypercube
      IRIS        ! = Silicon Graphics
      STAR        ! = Star Technologies 910/VP
      SUN         ! = Sun Microsystems
      VAX         ! = Digital Equipment Corp.

[2] Operating System Type
      UNIX        ! = UNIX
      UNICOS      ! = Cray UNIX
      VMS         ! = VAX/VMS

[3] Size Directive
      LARGE       ! = 60120 atom limit
      MEDIUM      ! = 25120 atom limit
      SMALL       ! = 6100 atom limit

[4] Machine Characteristics
      SCALAR      ! = default for scalar machines
      VECTOR      ! = default for vector processors
      PARVECT     ! = for parallel/vector machines
    Precision Specification
      SINGLE      ! = specifies single precision version

[5] Feature Directives
    Recommended ones (and tested, and working) indicated with an "*"
      BLOCK     * ! = Energy partition and free energy code
      DEBUG       ! = Extra print statements.
      MOLVIB    * ! = MOLVIB vibrational analysis code
      NIH       * ! = NIH default specs code.
      OLDDYN    * ! = Old dynamics integrator
      PERT      * ! = NIH free energy code
      QUANTA      ! = Quanta interface code
      QUANTUM     ! = QM/MM code
      RXNCOR    * ! = RXNCOR and PATH code
      TRAVEL    * ! = TRAVEL code
      TSM       * ! = TSM and ICPERT code

      JUNK        ! = Code with problems or unused.
      IPRESS      ! = Pressure code in development

The following NO* directives enable us to remove major blocks.
      NOCORREL    ! removes time series analysis
      NOGRAPHICS  ! removes all graphics code
      NOIMAGES    ! removes image and crystal fascility
      NOST2       ! removes ST2 water model routines
      NOVIBRAN    ! removes vibrational analysis section
      NOMISC      ! removes miscellaneous stuff: DRAWSP,HBUILD,PATH,
                  ! QUICKA,SBOUND,SURFAC,XRAY,TESTCH,RXNCOR

    By employing appropriate preprocessor keys, one can generate a
variant of CHARMM.  CHARMM22 is defined by the feature directives;
OLDDYN, BLOCK, PERT, TSM, MOLVIB, RXNCOR and TRAVEL.  Machine specific
coding should be encapsulated in a ##IF machine_type - ##ELSE - ##ENDIF
construct.

                      FLECS to FORTRAN Translator

The output file from the preprocessor is then processed by the FLECS
translator FLEXFORT.  The flecs translator recognizes the directives,

     ##FORTRAN           to prevent FLECS processing on following lines
     ##FLECS             to resume FLECS processing

These directives enable us to write a mixed code in both FORTRAN and
FLECS.  However, the CHARMM coding standard encourages to program in
structured FORTRAN77 and discourages from using both FLECS and FORTRAN
in the same file.  There is a plan for converting the whole of CHARMM
to FORTRAN77.  The FLEXFORT directives are useful during the conversion
period.

                    Module Makefiles and Optimization

The installation script install.com works with a set of makefiles in
~/charmm/build/{machine_type}.  These makefiles play the key role in
developing, optimizing and porting CHARMM code on the machine you are
working with.


[1] Porting to Other Machines

    You may begin with the given set of makefiles for a machine close
in the architecture to the one to which you intend to port CHARMM.
First you have to decide a name for the machine platform.  For
example, we have chosen IBMRS for IBM RS/6000 series.

cp -r  ~/charmm/build/{closely_related_machine_type} \
       ~/charmm/build/{your_chosen_machine_type}

Then delete Makefile in the new build directory and remane
Makefile_{closely_related_machine_type} to Makefile_{your_machine_type}.
You may have to modify compile commands and compiler flags in the
Makefile template.
    Study carefully ~/charmm/install.com and modify it if necessary.
In most cases, you just need to correct echo messages to address your
machine properly.  Then issue the install.com command.


[2] Optimization

    Once you make the makefiles working properly, you can carry out a
compiler level optimization for the CHARMM version.  FORTRAN compile
macro's are defined in Makefile_{machine_type}, e.g., $(FC1), $(FC2),
$(FC3), etc.  Compiler options are bound to these compile macros.  You
may inspect each module makefiles and set a proper compile command for
a given FORTRAN source.  For example, we recommend the following
optimization flags for Convex C2 machines.  Most of source files are
compiled by $(FC1) execpt

    energy.mk:    $(FC2) ecnstr.f 
                  $(FCR) enefst2.f 
                  $(FCR) enefst2q.f 
                  $(FC3) enefvect.f 
    image.mk:     $(FCR) imnbf2p.f 
                  $(FC3) imnbfp.f
    manip.mk:     $(FC3) fshake.f 
                  $(FCR) fshake2.f 
    nbonds.mk:    $(FCR) enbf2.f 
                  $(FCR) enbf3.f 
                  $(FCR) enbf4.f
                  $(FCR) enbf5.f
                  $(FC2) enbfast.f
                  $(FC3) evdwf.f
                  $(FC3) ewaldf.f
                  $(FCR) ewaldf2.f
                  $(FC2) nbexcl.f
                  $(FCR) nbndf2p.f
                  $(FC3) nbndfp.f
                  $(FC2) nbndgc.f
    util.mk:      $(FC2) vector.f


[3] Generating Module Makefiles

    We have included the makemod script that finds all include file
dependencies.

        makemod [-v] [-n] module_name actual_path sourcetree_path \
                          makefile_name [definition_file_name]

where -v means verbose and -n means the include files don't have
includes (This saves time).  The module name is general the module
directory, e.g., dynamc.  The actual path is generally
~/charmm/source/{module} and the source tree path is ~/charmm/source
or the like.  We generally use module_name.mk for the makefile name.
The definition file if specified (we generally don't) will prepend a
file of definitions to the makefile.  For example, the way to generate
the makefiles is to:

        cd ~/charmm/source/{module}
        makemod -vn {module} `pwd` `cd ..;pwd` {module}.mk

where {module} is the sub-directory in source.

    When you want to create the full set of module makefiles, you may
use setmk.com in ~/charmm/tool.

        setmk.com your_machine_type


[4] Usage Note on makemod

    When you generate module.mk files from scratch, then you should
take care of the following manually.

 1) When you generate main.mk, edit the makefile main.mk produced in
    ~/charmm/build/{machine_type}.  First remove the line that
    contains $(LIB)/main.a(charmm.o) for OBJS_main= at the beginning
    of the file.  Secondly, the dependency line and the instruction
    for charmm.o should be modified in such a way that the head part
    of the file looks as follows.

# main makefile
# main library rules
OBJS_main= \
        $(LIB)/main.a(help.o) \
        $(LIB)/main.a(iniall.o) \
        $(LIB)/main.a(miscom.o) \
        $(LIB)/main.a(usersb.o)
#
$(LIB)/main.a : $(OBJS_main)
        @echo main.a COMPLETED
#
# main source file rules
$(LIB)/charmm.o  : $(SRC)/main/charmm.src
        $(FLX) $(SRC)/main/charmm.src
        $(FC1) charmm.f
        mv charmm.o $(LIB)
        rm charmm.f
#

 2) The FORTRAN compile macro $(FC1) is used for all source files.  In
    order to set the compiler option properly, you have to modify the
    module makefiles and set the macro manually.


[5] Usage Note on Makefile

    All compile and other macros are defined in Makefile_{machine_type},
where {machine_type} can be convex, sgi, ibmrs, etc. indicating the
machine platform.  This makefile must be in ~/charmm/build/{machine_type}
directory and serves the template for Makefile in actual use by the
install.com {machine_type} command.  If there already exists Makefile
in the build directory, it will be used.  When your working directory
resides on the disk yellow paged or remotely mounted, you may have to
manually delete the Makefile before you issue install.com.
install.com sets up the environment variable $c22root in Makefile and
the pre-existing Makefile may carry the wrong value for the variable.

          The procedure for modifying anything in CHARMM

This procedure describes the steps which should be taken when
modifying a source file in CHARMM.  When you are developing CHARMM
source code, always maintain close contacts with the CHARMM manager
and other developers.  Inform them your development plan and which
files you are working on.  See <a href="#checkin">Checkin</a> for checkin procedure
needed when you deposit your code in the CHARMM central library.

 1) Get a copy of the current release package.  If you are a CHARMM
    developer and plan to integrate your program into CHARMM in the
    future, make sure that you obtain the most current version.  Check
    with the CHARMM manager.

 2) Once, you obtain the package, you are branched out from the main
    CHARMM source code control system.  You should record details
    of modification so that you may REDO them when you check your
    files in the central CHARMM library.

 3) While you make modifications and debug them, follow the guidelines
    in <a href="#standards">Standards</a>, so that CHARMM code will be consistent.
    If your modification does not involve any changes in source file
    directory structure and makes no changes in INCLUDE statements,
    you may use the module makefiles supplied (with the extension .mk)
    in ~/charmm/build/{machine_type}.  If you add/remove any source
    files, reorganize them, modify any INCLUDE statements or are
    porting to other machine than those already supported, you have to
    build the relevant module make files.  See <a href="#tools">Tools</a> for more
    information on makemod. 

 4) In your local ~/charmm directory, you may issue install.com
    command to build the library and the executable.
    See <a href="install.html#install">install: Install</a>.
    Your library is built in ~/charmm/lib/{machine_type} and the
    executable will be ~/charmm/exec/{machine_type}/charmm22.  You may
    find the log file {machine_type}.log in ~/charmm/build/{machine_type}.

 5) If your modification involves a new feature, you should either
    modify an existing test or make a new test to demonstrate and
    check its operation. See <a href="testcase.html">testing</a>,
    for a description of the tests currently available.  If you add a
    new test, please update that node.  WARNING: Any additions made
    without this will stop working as the entropy of programming
    randomizes your code without detection.

 6) If your change involves adding or modifying a command or adding or
    modifying a feature, modify existing documentation or if none is
    available, make new documentation.  Check that INFO can read the
    document and the format of your documentation is consistent with
    others.  BIGGER WARNING: Not keeping documentation up to date is
    highly anti-social.  Public flagellation is the normal response.

          Checkin Procedure in CHARMM Management System

We maintain CHARMM as an integrated single source package.  The
following rules have been established to keep CHARMM as such and
to minimize time consuming problems that result from carelessness
and conflicts between developers.

 1) It is always wise to inform the CHARMM manager about your
    development plan and time table so that he may arrange CHARMM
    management schedule and prevent you duplicating works done by
    others.  The list of files you are working on and the nature of
    modification should be reported in advance.

 2) When you finish your project in code development, make an
    appointment with the CHARMM manager and get the most current
    version of the distribution package.  Then, he will lock the
    central CHARMM library and allow you to work on it.  Normally you
    are given a couple of weeks to incorporate your contributions into
    the main source.  It is very important to plan ahead for the
    appointment.

 3) Follow the steps in <a href="#modify">Modify</a> to integrate your modifications
    with the current source.  When you finish incorporating modifications,
    debugging, testing and documenting, prepare to send your final
    version in CHARMM management system.  (a) Modified/added files
    including source, testcase input, documentation and others and
    (b) the change-log file describing the modifications in detail are
    required for your checkin.

 4) You and the manager will work together to check the modified
    files in the central CHARMM system.  After the successful
    incorporation, the change-log file will be mailed to all CHARMM 
    developers (charmm-bugs@tammy.harvard.edu) and the new developmental
    version will be established.

<A NAME=31>&#160;</A>
This document describes the <b> LaTeX</b>2<tt>HTML</tt>  translator which:
<P>
<UL><LI> breaks up a document into one or more components as specified
by the user<A NAME=tex2html3 HREF="footnode.html#959"><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="http://wolf2.mpibpc.gwdg.de/icons/foot_motif.gif"></A>,
<LI> provides optional, customizable iconic navigation
panels on every page which contain links to other parts of the
document, or other documents,
<A NAME=34>&#160;</A>
<LI> hadles inlined equations ( <IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img1.gif">), handles equation alignment (<IMG  ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" SRC="img2.gif">), 
right-justified numbered equations
(see equation <A HREF="node23.html#eqdemo">2</A>), tables (see Table <A HREF="node23.html#tab">1</A>), or
figures (see Figure <A HREF="node23.html#figexample">1</A>),
and <em> any arbitrary environment</em><A NAME=tex2html5 HREF="footnode.html#45"><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="http://wolf2.mpibpc.gwdg.de/icons/foot_motif.gif"></A>,
<P>
<LI> 
figures or tables can be arbitrarily scaled and shown either as
inlined images or ``thumbnail'' sketches
<LI> can produce output suitable for browsers that support inlined
images or character based browsers (as specified by the user),
<LI> handles definitions of new commands, environments, and theorems
even when these are defined in external style files<A NAME=tex2html6 HREF="footnode.html#46"><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="http://wolf2.mpibpc.gwdg.de/icons/foot_motif.gif"></A>,
<LI> handles footnotes<A NAME=tex2html7 HREF="footnode.html#47"><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="http://wolf2.mpibpc.gwdg.de/icons/foot_motif.gif"></A>, tables of contents, lists
of figures and tables, bibliographies, and can generate an
<A NAME=48>&#160;</A> index,
<LI> translates cross-references into hyperlinks and 
extends the LaTeX cross-referencing mechanism to work
not just within a document but <em> between documents</em> which may
reside in remote locations, <A NAME=50>&#160;</A>
<LI> translates LaTeX accent and special character commands
(e.g. &#197; &#216; &#246; &#163; &#169; &#182;) to
the equivalent ISO-LATIN-1 character set where possible,
<LI> recognizes hypertext links (to multimedia resources or
arbitrary internet services such as sound/video/ftp/http/news) and
links which invoke arbitrary program scripts,
all expressed as LaTeX commands,
<LI> recognizes <em> conditional text</em>  which is intended only for
the hypertext version, or only for the paper (DVI) version,
<LI> can include raw HTML in a LaTeX document (e.g. in order to
specify interactive forms),
<LI> can deal sensibly at least with the <em> Common LaTeX  commands</em>
summarized at the back of the LaTeX  blue book [<A HREF="node42.html#lamplatex">1</A>],
<LI> will try and translate any document with embedded LaTeX commands 
irrespective of whether it is complete or syntactically legal.

To use <b> LaTeX</b>2<tt>HTML</tt>  simply type <tt> latex2html <b>&lt;</b>file<b>&gt;</b>.tex</tt>. This 
will create a new directory called <tt> file</tt> which will contain 
the generated HTML files, some log files and possibly some images.
To view the result use an HTML viewer such as <A HREF="http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/SDG/Software/Mosaic/Docs/help-about.html">NCSA 
Mosaic</A>
on the main HTML file which is <tt> file/file.html</tt>. This file will
contain navigation links to the other parts of the generated document.
<P>
It is possible to customize the output from <b> LaTeX</b>2<tt>HTML</tt>  using a number
of <A HREF="node6.html#options">command line options</A>
with which you can specify how to break up the document, where to put 
the generated files, what the title is, what the signature at the end
of each page is, what to put in the navigation panel, what kind of
extra information to include about the document, whether to retain
the original LaTeX section numbering scheme, etc.
<P>
Also, the <b> LaTeX</b>2<tt>HTML</tt>  script includes a short manual which can be 
viewed by saying 
<tt> <code>%nroff -man latex2html</code> </tt>.
