<p><a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><b>DESCRIPTION </b></p>

<p>Ketoprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug. The chemical name
for ketoprofen is 2-(3-benzoylphenyl)-propionic acid. </p>

<p>Its empirical formula is C16H14O3, with a molecular weight of 254.29.
It has a pKa of 5.94 in methanol:water (3:1) and an n-octanol:water partition
coefficient of 0.97 (buffer pH 7.4). </p>

<p>Ketoprofen is a white or off-white, odorless, nonhygroscopic, fine to
granular powder, melting at about 95 deg C. It is freely soluble in ethanol,
chloroform, acetone, ether and soluble in benzene and strong alkali, but
practically insoluble in water at 20 deg C. </p>

<p><a name="ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY"></a><b>ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
</b></p>

<p>Ketoprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug with analgesic and
antipyretic properties. </p>

<p>The anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic properties of ketoprofen
have been demonstrated in classical animal and In Vitro test systems. In
anti- inflammatory models ketoprofen has been shown to have inhibitory
effects on prostaglandin and leukotriene synthesis, to have antibradykinin
activity, as well as to have lysosomal membrane-stabilizing action. However,
its mode of action, like that of other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs,
is not fully understood. </p>

<p>PHARMACODYNAMICS </p>

<p>Ketoprofen is a racemate with only the S enantiomer possessing pharmacological
activity. The enantiomers have similar concentration time curves and do
not appear to interact with one another. </p>

<p>An analgesic effect-concentration relationship for ketoprofen was established
in an oral surgery pain study with Ketoprofen. The effect-site rate constant
(ke0) was estimated to be 0.9 hour(-1) (95% confidence limits: 0 to 2.1),
and the concentration (Ce50) of ketoprofen that produced one-half the maximum
PID (pain intensity difference) was 0.3 mcgm/mL (95% confidence limits:
0.1 to 0.5). Thirty-three (33) to 68% of patients had an onset of action
(as measured by reporting some pain relief) within 30 minutes following
a single oral dose in postoperative pain and dysmenorrhea studies. Pain
relief (as measured by remedication) persisted for up to 6 hours in 26
to 72% of patients in these studies. </p>

<p>PHARMACOKINETICS </p>

<p>GENERAL </p>

<p>Ketoprofen and Ketoprofen (time release) capsules both contain ketoprofen.
They differ only in their release characteristics. Ketoprofen capsules
release drug in the stomach whereas the pellets in Ketoprofen (time release)
capsules are designed to resist dissolution in the low pH of gastric fluid
but release drug at a controlled rate in the higher pH environment of the
small intestine (see &quot;Description&quot;). </p>

<p>Irrespective of the pattern of release, the systemic availability (Fs)
when either oral formulation is compared with IV administration is approximately
90% in humans. For 75 to 200 mg single doses, the area under the curve
has been shown to be dose proportional. The figure depicts the plasma time
curves associated with both products. </p>

<p>Ketoprofen is &gt;99% bound to plasma proteins, mainly to albumin. </p>

<p>Separate sections follow which delineate differences between Ketoprofen
and Ketoprofen (time release) capsules. </p>

<p>ABSORPTION </p>

<p>Ketoprofen capsules--Ketoprofen is rapidly and well-absorbed, with peak
plasma levels occurring within 0.5 to 2 hours. </p>

<p>Ketoprofen (time release) capsules--Ketoprofen is also well-absorbed
from this dosage form, although an observable increase in plasma levels
does not occur until approximately 2 to 3 hours after taking the formulation.
Peak plasma levels are usually reached 6 to 7 hours after dosing. (See
Figure and Table, below). </p>

<p>When ketoprofen is administered with food, its total bioavailability
(AUC) is not altered; however, the rate of absorption from either dosage
form is slowed. </p>

<p>Ketoprofen capsules--Food intake reduces Cmax by approximately one-half
and increases the mean time to peak concentration (tmax) from 1.2 hours
for fasting subjects (range, 0.5 to 3 hours) to 2.0 hours for fed subjects
(range, 0.75 to 3 hours). The fluctuation of plasma peaks may also be influenced
by circadian changes in the absorption process. </p>

<p>Concomitant administration of magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide
does not interfere with absorption of ketoprofen from Ketoprofen capsules.
</p>

<p>Ketoprofen (time release) capsules--Administration of Ketoprofen (time
release) with a high-fat meal causes a delay of about 2 hours in reaching
the Cmax; neither the total bioavailability (AUC) nor the Cmax is affected.
Circardian changes in the absorption process have not been studied. </p>

<p>The administration of antacids or other drugs which may raise stomach
pH would not be expected to change the rate or extent of absorption of
ketoprofen from Ketoprofen (time release) capsules. MULTIPLE DOSING </p>

<p>Steady-state concentrations of ketoprofen are attained within 24 hours
after commencing treatment with Ketoprofen or Ketoprofen (time release)
capsules. In studies with healthy male volunteers, trough levels at 24
hours following administration of Ketoprofen (time release) capsules were
0.4 mg/L compared with 0.07 mg/L at 24 hours following administration of
Ketoprofen 50 mg capsules QID (12 hours) or 0.13 mg/L following administration
of Ketoprofen 75 mg capsules TID for 12 hours. Thus, relative to the peak
plasma concentration, the accumulation of ketoprofen after multiple doses
of Ketoprofen (time release) or Ketoprofen capsules is minimal. </p>

<p>The figure below shows a reduction in peak height and area after the
second 50 mg dose. This is probably due to a combination of food effects,
circadian effects, and plasma sampling times. It is unclear to what extent
each factor contributes to the loss of peak height and area. </p>

<p>The shaded area represents +/- 1 standard deviation (S.D.) around the
mean for Ketoprofen or Ketoprofen (time release). </p>

1   In the case of Ketoprofen (time release), absorption is slowed, intrinsic clearance is       
     unchanged, but because the rate of elimination is dependent on             
     absorption, the half-time is prolonged.</font></pre>

<p>METABOLISM </p>

<p>The metabolic fate of ketoprofen is glucuronide conjugation to form
an unstable acyl-glucuronide. The glucuronic acid moiety can be converted
back to the parent compound. Thus, the metabolite serves as a potential
reservoir for parent drug and this may be important in persons with renal
insufficiency, whereby the conjugate may accumulate in the serum and undergo
deconjugation back to the parent drug (see SPECIAL POPULATIONS: Renally
Impaired).The conjugates are reported to appear only in trace amounts in
plasma in healthy adults, but are higher in elderly subjects--presumably
because of reduced renal clearance. It has been demonstrated that in elderly
subjects following multiple doses (50 mg every 6 h), the ratio of conjugated
to parent ketoprofen AUC was 30% and 3%, respectively for the S &amp; R
enantiomers. </p>

<p>There are no known active metabolites of ketoprofen. Ketoprofen has
been shown not to induce drug-metabolizing enzymes. </p>

<p>ELIMINATION </p>

<p>The plasma clearance of ketoprofen is approximately 0.08 L/kg/h with
a Vd of 0.1 L/kg after IV administration. The elimination half-life of
ketoprofen has been reported to be 2.05 +/- 0.58 h (Mean +/- S.D.) following
IV administration from 2 to 4 h following administration of Ketoprofen
capsules, and 5.4 +/- 2.2 h after administration of Ketoprofen (time release)
capsules. In cases of slow drug absorption, the elimination rate is dependent
on the absorption rate and thus t1/2 relative to an IV dose appears prolonged.
</p>

<p>After a single 200 mg dose of Ketoprofen (time release), the plasma
levels decline slowly, and average 0.4 mg/L after 24 hours (see Figure
above). </p>

<p>In a 24-hour period, approximately 80% of an administered dose of ketoprofen
is excreted in the urine, primarily as the glucuronide metabolite. </p>

<p>Enterohepatic recirculation of the drug has been postulated, although
biliary levels have never been measured to confirm this. </p>

<p>SPECIAL POPULATIONS </p>

<p>Elderly: Clearance And Unbound Fraction </p>

<p>The plasma and renal clearance of ketoprofen is reduced in the elderly
(mean age, 73 years) compared to a younger normal population (mean age,
27 years). Hence, ketoprofen peak concentration and AUC increase with increasing
age. In addition, there is a corresponding increase in unbound fraction
with increasing age. Data from one trial suggest that the increase is greater
in women than in men. It has not been determined whether age-related changes
in absorption among the elderly contribute to the changes in bioavailability
of ketoprofen. </p>

<p>Ketoprofen capsules--In a study conducted with young and elderly men
and women, results for subjects older than 75 years of age showed that
free drug AUC increased by 40% and Cmax increased by 60% as compared with
estimates of the same parameters in young subjects (those younger than
35 years of age; see INDIVIDUALIZATION OF DOSAGE). </p>

<p>Also in the elderly, the ratio of intrinsic clearance/availability decreased
by 35% and plasma half-life was prolonged by 26%. This reduction is thought
to be due to a decrease in hepatic extraction associated with aging. </p>

<p>Ketoprofen (time release) capsules--The effects of age and gender on
ketoprofen disposition were investigated in 2 small studies in which elderly
male and female subjects received Ketoprofen (time release) capsules. The
results were compared with those from another study conducted in healthy
young men. </p>

<p>Compared to the younger subject group, the elimination half-life in
the elderly was prolonged by 54% and total drug Cmax and AUC were 40% and
70% higher, respectively. Plasma concentrations in the elderly after single
doses and at steady state were essentially the same. Thus, no drug accumulation
occurs. </p>

<p>In comparison to younger subjects taking the immediate-release formulation
(Ketoprofen), there was a decrease of 16% and 25% in total drug Cmax and
AUC, respectively, among the elderly. Free drug data are not available
for Ketoprofen (time release). </p>

<p>Renally Impaired </p>

<p>Studies of the effects of renal-function impairment have been small.
They indicate a decrease in clearance in patients with impaired renal function.
In 23 patients with renal impairment, free ketoprofen peak concentration
was not significantly elevated, but free ketoprofen clearance was reduced
from 15 L/h/kg for normal subjects to 7 L/h/kg in patients with mildly
impaired renal function, and to 4 L/h/kg in patients with moderately to
severely impaired renal function. The elimination t1/2 was prolonged from
1.6 hours in normal subjects to approximately 3 hours in patients with
mild renal impairment, and to approximately 5 to 9 hours in patients with
moderately to severely impaired renal function. </p>

<p>No studies have been conducted in patients with renal impairment taking
Ketoprofen (time release) capsules. It is recommended that only the immediate-release
formulation of ketoprofen be used to treat patients with significant renal
impairment (see INDIVIDUALIZATION OF DOSAGE). </p>

<p>Hepatically Impaired </p>

<p>For patients with alcoholic cirrhosis, no significant changes in the
kinetic disposition of Ketoprofen capsules were observed relative to age-matched
normal subjects: the plasma clearance of drug was 0.07 L/h/kg in 26 hepatically
impaired patients. The elimination half-time was comparable to that observed
for normal subjects. However, the unbound (biologically active) fraction
was approximately doubled, probably due to hypoalbuminemia and high variability
which was observed in the pharmacokinetics for cirrhotic patients. Therefore,
these patients should be carefully monitored and daily doses of ketoprofen
kept at the minimum providing the desired therapeutic effect. </p>

<p>No studies have been conducted in patients with heptic impairment taking
Ketoprofen (time release) capsules. It is recommended that only the immediate-release
formulation of ketoprofen be used to treat patients who have hepatic impairment
and serum albumin levels below 3.5 g/dL. (see INDIVIDUALIZATION OF DOSAGE).
</p>

<p>CLINICAL TRIALS </p>

<p>RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS AND OSTEOARTHRITIS </p>

<p>The efficacy of ketoprofen has been demonstrated in patients with rheumatoid
arthritis and osteoarthritis. Using standard assessments of therapeutic
response, there were no detectable differences in effectiveness or in the
incidence of adverse events in crossover comparison of Ketoprofen and Ketoprofen
(time release). In other trials, ketoprofen demonstrated effectiveness
comparable to aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen, piroxicam, diclofenac and indomethacin.
In some of these studies there were more dropouts due to gastrointestinal
side effects among patients on ketoprofen than among patients on other
NSAIDs. </p>

<p>In studies with patients with rheumatoid arthritis, ketoprofen was administered
in combination with gold salts, antimalarials, low-dose methotrexate, d-
penicillamine, and/or corticosteroids with results comparable to those
seen with control nonsteroidal drugs. </p>

<p>MANAGEMENT OF PAIN </p>

<p>The effectiveness of Ketoprofen as a general-purpose analgesic has been
studied in standard pain models which have shown the effectiveness of doses
of 25 to 150 mg. Doses of 25 mg were superior to placebo. Doses larger
than 25 mg generally could not be shown to be significantly more effective,
but there was a tendency toward faster onset and greater duration of action
with 50 mg, and, in the case of dysmenorrhea, a significantly greater effect
overall with 75 mg. Doses greater than 50 to 75 mg did not have increased
analgesic effect. Studies in postoperative pain have shown that Ketoprofen
in doses of 25 to 100 mg was comparable to 650 mg of acetaminophen with
60 mg of codeine, or 650 mg of acetaminophen with 10 mg of oxycodone. Ketoprofen
tended to be somewhat slower in onset; peak pain relief was about the same
and the duration of the effect tended to be 1 to 2 hours longer, particularly
with the higher doses of ketoprofen. </p>

<p>The use of Ketoprofen (time release) in patients with acute pain is
not recommended, since, in comparison to Ketoprofen, Ketoprofen (time release)
would be expected to have a delayed analgesic response due to its controlled-release
characteristics. </p>

<p>INDIVIDUALIZATION OF DOSAGE </p>

<p>In patients with significant renal impairment, Ketoprofen rather than
Ketoprofen (time release) should be used. </p>

<p>The initial dosage should be reduced to 25 to 50 mg TID in patients
with mildly impaired renal function and to 25 to 50 mg twice daily (BID)
in patients with a more severe renal impairment (GFR less than 25 mL/min/1.73
M(square) or end- stage renal impairment). In elderly patients, renal function
may be reduced with apparently normal serum creatinine and/or BUN levels.
</p>

<p>Therefore, Ketoprofen is the recommended formulation of ketoprofen and
the initial dosage for patients over 75 years of age should be reduced
to 75 to 150 mg/day. </p>

<p>It is recommended that for patients with impaired liver function and
serum albumin concentration less than 3.5 g/dL, Ketoprofen rather than
Ketoprofen (time release) should be used and the initial dosage reduced
to 75 to 150 mg/day. All patients with metabolic impairment, particularly
those with both hypoalbuminemia and reduced renal function, may have increased
levels of free (biologically active) ketoprofen and should be closely monitored.
The dosage may be increased to the range recommended for the general population,
if necessary, only after good individual tolerance has been ascertained.
</p>

<p>Because hypoalbuminemia and reduced renal function both increase the
fraction of free drug (biologically active form), patients who have both
conditions may be at greater risk of adverse effects. Therefore, it is
recommended that such patients also be started on lower doses of Ketoprofen
and closely monitored. </p>

<p>As with other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, the predominant
adverse effects of ketoprofen are gastrointestinal. To attempt to minimize
these effects, physicians may wish to prescribe that either ketoprofen
formulation be taken with antacids, food, or milk. Although food delays
the absorption of both formulations (see ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY),
in most of the clinical trials ketoprofen was taken with food or milk.
</p>

<p>Physicians may want to make specific recommendations to patients about
when they should take Ketoprofen or Ketoprofen (time release) in relation
to food and/or what patients should do if they experience minor GI symptoms
associated with either formulation. </p>

<p><a name="INDICATIONS AND USAGE"></a><b>INDICATIONS AND USAGE </b></p>

<p>Ketoprofen or Ketoprofen (time release) are indicated for the management
of the signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis. Ketoprofen
(time release) is not recommended for treatment of acute pain because of
its controlled-release characteristics (see PHARMACOKINETICS). </p>

<p>Ketoprofen is indicated for the management of pain. Ketoprofen is also
indicated for treatment of primary dysmenorrhea. </p>

<p><a name="CONTRAINDICATIONS"></a><b>CONTRAINDICATIONS </b></p>

<p>Ketoprofen is contraindicated in patients who have shown hypersensitivity
to it. Ketoprofen should not be given to patients in whom aspirin or other
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs induce asthma, urticaria, or other
allergic-type reactions, because severe, rarely fatal, anaphylactic reactions
to ketoprofen have been reported in such patients. </p>

<p><a name="WARNINGS"></a><b>WARNINGS </b></p>

<p>RISK OF GI ULCERATION, BLEEDING, AND PERFORATION WITH NSAID THERAPY
</p>

<p>Serious gastrointestinal toxicity, such as bleeding, ulceration, and
perforation, can occur at any time with or without warning symptoms, in
patients treated chronically with NSAID therapy. Although minor upper gastrointestinal
problems, such as dyspepsia, are common, usually developing early in therapy,
physicians should remain alert for ulceration and bleeding in patients
treated chronically with NSAIDs even in the absence of previous GI tract
symptoms. In patients observed in clinical trials of several months to
two years' duration, symptomatic upper-GI ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation
appear to occur in approximately 1% of patients treated for 3 to 6 months,
and in about 2-4% of patients treated for one year. Physicians should inform
patients about the signs and/or symptoms of serious GI toxicity and what
steps to take if they occur. </p>

<p>Studies to date have not identified any subset of patients not at risk
of developing peptic ulceration and bleeding. Except for a prior history
of serious GI events and other risk factors known to be associated with
peptic ulcer disease, such as alcoholism, smoking, etc., no other risk
factors (e.g., age, sex) have been associated with increased risk. Elderly
or debilitated patients seem to tolerate ulceration or bleeding less well
than other individuals, and most spontaneous reports of fatal GI events
are in this population. Studies to date are inconclusive concerning the
relative risk of various NSAIDs in causing such reactions. High doses of
any NSAID probably carry a greater risk of these reactions, although controlled
clinical trials showing this do not exist in most cases. In considering
the use of relatively large doses (within the recommended dosage range),
sufficient benefit should be anticipated to offset the potential increased
risk of GI toxicity. </p>

<p><a name="PRECAUTIONS"></a><b>PRECAUTIONS </b></p>

<p>GENERAL PRECAUTIONS </p>

<p>Ketoprofen and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs cause nephritis
in mice and rats associated with chronic administration. Rare cases of
interstitial nephritis or nephrotic syndrome have been reported in humans
with ketoprofen since it has been marketed. </p>

<p>A second form of renal toxicity has been seen in patients with conditions
leading to a reduction in renal blood flow or blood volume, where renal
prostaglandins have a supportive role in the maintenance of renal blood
flow. In these patients, administration of a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
drug results in a dose-dependent decrease in prostaglandin synthesis and,
secondarily, in renal blood flow which may precipitate overt renal failure.
Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal
function, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics, and
the elderly. Discontinuation of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug therapy
is typically followed by recovery to the pretreatment state. </p>

<p>Since ketoprofen is primarily eliminated by the kidneys and its pharmacokinetics
are altered by renal failure (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY), patients with
significantly impaired renal function should be closely monitored and a
reduction of dosage should be anticipated to avoid accumulation of ketoprofen
and/or its metabolites (see INDIVIDUALIZATION OF DOSAGE). </p>

<p>As with other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, borderline elevations
of one or more liver function tests may occur in up to 15% of patients.
These abnormalities may progress, may remain essentially unchanged, or
may disappear with continued therapy. The ALT (SGPT) test is probably the
most sensitive indicator of liver dysfunction. Meaningful (3 times the
upper limit of normal) elevations of ALT or AST (SGOT) occurred in controlled
clinical trials in less than 1% of patients. A patient with symptoms and/or
signs suggesting liver dysfunction, or in whom an abnormal liver test has
occurred, should be evaluated for evidence of the development of a more
severe hepatic reaction while on therapy with ketoprofen. Serious hepatic
reactions, including jaundice have been reported from post-marketing experience
with ketoprofen as well as with other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.
</p>

<p>In patients with chronic liver disease with reduced serum albumin levels,
ketoprofen's pharmacokinetics are altered (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY).
Such patients should be closely monitored, and a reduction of dosage should
be anticipated to avoid high blood levels of ketoprofen and/or its metabolites
(see INDIVIDUALIZATION OF DOSAGE). </p>

<p>If steroid dosage is reduced or eliminated during therapy, it should
be reduced slowly and the patients observed closely for any evidence of
adverse effects, including adrenal insufficiency and exacerbation of symptoms
of arthritis. </p>

<p>Anemia is commonly observed in rheumatoid arthritis and is sometimes
aggravated by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, which may produce fluid
retention or significant gastrointestinal blood loss in some patients.
Patients on long-term treatment with NSAIDs, including Ketoprofen or Ketoprofen
(time release), should have their hemoglobin or hematocrit checked if they
develop signs or symptoms of anemia. </p>

<p>Peripheral edema has been observed in approximately 2% of patients taking
ketoprofen. Therefore, as with other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs,
ketoprofen should be used with caution in patients with fluid retention,
hypertension, or heart failure. </p>

<p>INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS </p>

<p>Ketoprofen or Ketoprofen (time release) contain ketoprofen. Like other
drugs of its class, ketoprofen is not free of side effects. The side effects
of these drugs can cause discomfort and, rarely, there are more serious
side effects, such as gastrointestinal bleeding, which may result in hospitalization
and even fatal outcomes. </p>

<p>NSAIDs are often essential agents in the management of arthritis and
have a major role in the treatment of pain, but they also may be commonly
employed for conditions which are less serious. Physicians may wish to
discuss with their patients the potential risks (see WARNINGS, GENERAL
PRECAUTIONS, and ADVERSE REACTIONS sections) and likely benefits of NSAID
treatment, particularly when the drugs are used for less serious conditions
where treatment without NSAIDs may represent an acceptable alternative
to both the patient and physician. </p>

<p>Because aspirin causes an increase in the level of unbound ketoprofen,
patients should be advised not to take aspirin while taking ketoprofen
(see DRUG INTERACTIONS). It is possible that minor adverse symptoms of
gastric intolerance may be prevented by administering Ketoprofen with antacids,
food, or milk. Ketoprofen (time release) has not been studied with antacids.
Because food and milk do affect the rate but not the extent of absorption
(see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY), physicians may want to make specific recommendations
to patients about when they should take ketoprofen in relation to food
and/or what patients should do if they experience minor GI symptoms associated
with ketoprofen therapy. </p>

<p>LABORATORY TESTS </p>

<p>Because serious GI-tract ulceration and bleeding can occur without warning
symptoms, physicians should follow chronically treated patients for the
signs and symptoms of ulceration and bleeding and should inform them of
the importance of this follow-up (see WARNINGS--RISK OF GI ULCERATION,
BLEEDING, AND PERFORATION WITH NSAID THERAPY). </p>

<p>DRUG INTERACTIONS </p>

<p>The following drug interactions were studied with ketoprofen doses of
200 mg/day. The possibility of increased interaction should be kept in
mind when Ketoprofen doses greater than 50 mg as a single dose or 200 mg
of ketoprofen per day are used concomitantly with highly bound drugs. </p>

<p>1. Antacids </p>

<p>Concomitant administration of magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide
does not interfere with the rate or extent of the absorption of ketoprofen
administered as Ketoprofen. </p>

<p>2. Aspirin </p>

<p>Ketoprofen does not alter aspirin absorption; however, in a study of
12 normal subjects, concurrent administration of aspirin decreased ketoprofen
protein binding and increased ketoprofen plasma clearance from 0.07 L/h/kg
without aspirin to 0.11 L/h/kg with aspirin. The clinical significance
of these changes has not been adequately studied. Therefore, concurrent
use of aspirin and ketoprofen is not recommended. </p>

<p>3. Diuretic </p>

<p>Hydrochlorothiazide, given concomitantly with ketoprofen, produces a
reduction in urinary potassium and chloride excretion compared to hydrochlorothiazide
alone. Patients taking diuretics are at greater risk of developing renal
failure secondary to a decrease in renal blood flow caused by prostaglandin
inhibition (see GENERAL PRECAUTIONS). </p>

<p>4. Digoxin </p>

<p>In a study in 12 patients with congestive heart failure where ketoprofen
and digoxin were concomitantly administered, ketoprofen did not alter the
serum levels of digoxin. </p>

<p>5. Warfarin </p>

<p>In a short-term controlled study in 14 normal volunteers, ketoprofen
did not significantly interfere with the effect of warfarin on prothrombin
time. Bleeding from a number of sites may be a complication of warfarin
treatment and GI bleeding a complication of ketoprofen treatment. Because
prostaglandins play an important role in hemostasis and ketoprofen has
an effect on platelet function as well (see DRUG/LABORATORY TEST INTERACTIONS:
EFFECT ON BLOOD COAGULATION), concurrent therapy with ketoprofen and warfarin
requires close monitoring of patients on both drugs. </p>

<p>6. Probenecid </p>

<p>Probenecid increases both free and bound ketoprofen by reducing the
plasma clearance of ketoprofen to about one-third, as well as decreasing
its protein- binding. Therefore, the combination of ketoprofen and probenecid
is not recommended. </p>

<p>7. Methotrexate </p>

<p>Ketoprofen, like other NSAIDs, may cause changes in the elimination
of methotrexate leading to elevated serum levels of the drug and increased
toxicity. </p>

<p>8. Lithium </p>

<p>Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents have been reported to increase
steady- state plasma lithium levels. It is recommended that plasma lithium
levels be monitored when ketoprofen is co-administered with lithium. </p>

<p>DRUG/LABORATORY TEST INTERACTIONS: </p>

<p>EFFECT ON BLOOD COAGULATION </p>

<p>Ketoprofen decreases platelet adhesion and aggregation. Therefore, it
can prolong bleeding time by approximately 3 to 4 minutes from baseline
values. There is no significant change in platelet count, prothrombin time,
partial thromboplastin time, or thrombin time. </p>

<p>CARCINOGENESIS, MUTAGENESIS, IMPAIRMENT OF FERTILITY </p>

<p>Chronic oral toxicity studies in mice (up to 32 mg/kg/day; 96 mg/M(square)/day)
did not indicate a carcinogenic potential for ketoprofen. The maximum recommended
human therapeutic dose is 300 mg/day for a 60 kg patient with a body surface
area of 1.6 M(square), which is 5 mg/kg/day or 185 mg/M(square)/day. Thus
the mice were treated at 0.5 times the maximum human daily dose based on
surface area. </p>

<p>A 2-year carcinogenicity study in rats, using doses up to 6.0 mg/kg/day
(36 mg/M(square)/day), showed no evidence of tumorigenic potential. All
groups were treated for 104 weeks except the females receiving 6.0 mg/kg/day
(36 mg/M(square)/day) where the drug treatment was terminated in week 81
because of low survival; the remaining rats were sacrificed after week
87. Their survival in the groups treated for 104 weeks was within 6% of
the control group. An earlier 2-year study with doses up to 12.5 mg/kg/day
(75 mg/M(square)/day) also showed no evidence of tumorigenicity, but the
survival rate was low and the study was therefore judged inconclusive.
Ketoprofen did not show mutagenic potential in the Ames Test. Ketoprofen
administered to male rats (up to 9 mg/kg/day; or 54 mg/M(square)/day) had
no significant effect on reproductive performance or fertility. In female
rats administered 6 or 9 mg/kg/day (36 or 54 mg/M(square)/day), a decrease
in the number of implantation sites has been noted. The dosages of 36 mg/M(square)/day
in rats represent 0.2 times the maximum recommended human dose of 185 mg/M(square)/day
(see above). </p>

<p>Abnormal spermatogenesis or inhibition of spermatogenesis developed
in rats and dogs at high doses, and a decrease in the weight of the testes
occurred in dogs and baboons at high doses. </p>

<p>TERATOGENIC EFFECTS: PREGNANCY </p>

<p>CATEGORY B </p>

<p>In teratology studies ketoprofen administered to mice at doses up to
12 mg/kg/day (36 mg/M(square)/day) and rats at doses up to 9 mg/kg/day
(54 mg/M(square)/day), the approximate equivalent of 0.2 times the maximum
recommended therapeutic dose of 185 mg/M(square)/day, showed no teratogenic
or embryotoxic effects. In separate studies in rabbits, maternally toxic
doses were associated with embryotoxicity but not teratogenicity. </p>

<p>There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women.
Because animal teratology studies are not always predictive of the human
response, ketoprofen should be used during pregnancy only if the potential
benefit justifies the risk. </p>

<p>LABOR AND DELIVERY </p>

<p>The effects of ketoprofen on labor and delivery in pregnant women are
unknown. Studies in rats have shown ketoprofen at doses of 6 mg/kg (36
mg/M(square)/day, approximately equal to 0.2 times the maximum recommended
human dose) prolongs pregnancy when given before the onset of labor. Because
of the known effects of prostaglandin-inhibiting drugs on the fetal cardiovascular
system (closure of ductus arteriosus), use of ketoprofen during late pregnancy
should be avoided. </p>

<p>NURSING MOTHERS </p>

<p>Data on secretion in human milk after ingestion of ketoprofen do not
exist. In rats, ketoprofen at doses of 9 mg/kg (54 mg/M(square)/day; approximately
0.3 times the maximum human therapeutic dose) did not affect perinatal
development. Upon administration to lactating dogs, the milk concentration
of ketoprofen was found to be 4 to 5% of the plasma drug level. As with
other drugs that are excreted in milk, ketoprofen is not recommended for
use in nursing mothers. </p>

<p>PEDIATRIC USE </p>

<p>Ketoprofen is not recommended for use in children, because its safety
and effectiveness have not been studied in children. </p>

<p><a name="DRUG INTERACTIONS"></a><b>DRUG INTERACTIONS </b></p>

<p>The following drug interactions were studied with ketoprofen doses of
200 mg/day. The possibility of increased interaction should be kept in

of ketoprofen per day are used concomitantly with highly bound drugs. </p>

<p>(See Also PRECAUTIONS.) </p>

<p><a name="ADVERSE REACTIONS"></a><b>ADVERSE REACTIONS </b></p>

<p>The incidence of common adverse reactions (above 1%) was obtained from
a population of 835 Ketoprofen-treated patients in double-blind trials
lasting from 4 to 54 weeks and in 622 Ketoprofen (time release)-treated
patients in trials lasting from 4 to 16 weeks. </p>

<p>Minor gastrointestinal side effects predominated; upper gastrointestinal
symptoms were more common than lower gastrointestinal symptoms. In crossover
trials in 321 patients with rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis, there
was no difference in either upper or lower gastrointestinal symptoms between
patients treated with 200 mg of Ketoprofen (time release) once a day or
75 mg of Ketoprofen TID (225 mg/day). Peptic ulcer or GI bleeding occurred
in controlled clinical trials in less than 1% of 1,076 patients; however,
in open label continuation studies in 1,292 patients the rate was greater
than 2%. </p>

<p>The incidence of peptic ulceration in patients on NSAIDs is dependent
on many risk factors including age, sex, smoking, alcohol use, diet, stress,
concomitant drugs such as aspirin and corticosteroids, as well as the dose
and duration of treatment with NSAIDs (see WARNINGS). </p>

<p>Gastrointestinal reactions were followed in frequency by central nervous
system side effects, such as headache, dizziness, or drowsiness. The incidence
of some adverse reactions appears to be dose-related (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).
Rare adverse reactions (incidence less than 1%) were collected from foreign
reports to manufacturers and regulatory agencies, publications, and U.S.

<p><a name="OVERDOSAGE"></a><b>OVERDOSAGE </b></p>

<p>Signs and symptoms following acute NSAID overdose are usually limited
to lethargy, drowsiness, nausea, vomiting, and epigastric pain, which are
generally reversible with supportive care. Respiratory depression, coma,
or convulsions have occurred following large ketoprofen overdoses. Gastrointestinal
bleeding, hypotension, hypertension, or acute renal failure may occur,
but are rare. </p>

<p>Patients should be managed by symptomatic and supportive care following
an NSAID overdose. There are no specific antidotes. Gut decontamination
may be indicated in patients with symptoms seen within 4 hours (longer
for sustained release products) or following a large overdose (5 to 10
times the usual dose). This should be accomplished via emesis and/or activated
charcoal (60 to 100 g in adults, 1 to 2 g/kg in children) with a saline
cathartic or sorbitol added to the first dose. Forced diuresis, alkalinization
of the urine, hemodialysis or hemoperfusion would probably not be useful
due to ketoprofen's high protein binding. </p>

<p>Case reports include twenty-six overdoses: 6 were in children, 16 in
adolescents, and 4 in adults. Five of these patients had minor symptoms
(vomiting in 4, drowsiness in 1 child). A 12-year-old girl had tonic-clonic
convulsions 1-2 hours after ingesting an unknown quantity of ketoprofen
and 1 or 2 tablets of acetaminophen with hydrocodone. Her ketoprofen level
was 1128 mg/L (56 times the upper therapeutic level of 20 mg/L) 3-4 hours
post ingestion. Full recovery ensued 18 hours after ingestion following
management with intubation, diazepam, and activated charcoal. A 45-year-old
woman ingested twelve 200 mg Ketoprofen (time release) and 375 mL vodka,
was treated with emesis and supportive measures 2 hours after ingestion,
and recovered completely with her only complaint being mild epigastric
pain. </p>

<p><a name="DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION"></a><b>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
</b></p>

<p>RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS AND OSTEOARTHRITIS </p>

<p>The recommended starting dose of ketoprofen in otherwise healthy patients
is for Ketoprofen 75 mg three times or 50 mg four times a day or for Ketoprofen
(time release) 200 mg administered once a day. A smaller dose should be
utilized initially in small individuals, in debilitated or elderly patients.
Ketoprofen is recommended for such initial dosage titration and Orvuail
is recommended for chronic treatment of those patients whose optimum dose
is 200 mg/day. The recommended maximum daily dose of ketoprofen is 300
mg/day (see INDIVIDUALIZATION OF DOSAGE). </p>

<p>During titration with Ketoprofen, if minor side effects appear, they
may disappear at a lower dose which may still have an adequate therapeutic
effect. If well tolerated but not optimally effective, the dosage may be
increased. Individual patients may show a better response to 300 mg daily
as compared to 200 mg, although in well-controlled clinical trials patients
on 300 mg did not show greater mean effectiveness. They did, however, show
an increased frequency of upper- and lower-GI distress and headaches. It
is of interest that women also had an increased frequency of these adverse
effects compared to men. When </p>

<p>treating patients with 300 mg/day, the physician should observe sufficient
increased clinical benefit to offset potential increased risk. Dosages
higher than 300 mg/day are not recommended because they have not been adequately
studied. Relatively smaller people may need smaller doses (See INDIVIDUALIZATION
OF DOSAGE.) </p>

<p>MANAGEMENT OF PAIN AND DYSMENORRHEA </p>

<p>The usual dose of Ketoprofen recommended for mild-to-moderate pain and
dysmenorrhea is 25 to 50 mg every 6 to 8 hours as necessary. A smaller
dose should be utilized initially in small individuals, in debilitated
or elderly patients, or in patients with renal or liver disease (see GENERAL
PRECAUTIONS). A larger dose may be tried if the patient's response to a
previous dose was less than satisfactory, but doses above 75 mg have not
been shown to give added analgesia. Daily doses above 300 mg are not recommended
because they have not been adequately studied. Because of its typical nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory drug- side-effect profile, including as its principal
adverse effect Gl side effects (see WARNINGS and ADVERSE REACTIONS), higher
doses of Ketoprofen should be used with caution and patients receiving
them observed carefully (see INDIVIDUALIZATION OF DOSAGE). </p>

<p>Ketoprofen (time release) is not recommended for use in treating acute
pain because of its controlled-release characteristics. </p>

<p><a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><b>DESCRIPTION </b></p>

<p>Fludrocortisone Acetate Tablets USP contain fludrocortisone acetate,
a synthetic adrenocortical steroid possessing very potent mineralocorticoid
properties and high glucocorticoid activity; it is used only for its mineralocorticoid
effects. The chemical name for fludrocortisone acetate is 9-fluoro-11,17,21-trihydroxypregn-4-ene-3,
20-dione 21-acetate. </p>

<p>C23H31FO6 </p>

<p>Molecular Weight: 422.49 </p>

<p><a name="ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY"></a><b>ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
</b></p>

<p>Corticosteroids are thought to act, at least in part, by controlling
the rate of synthesis of proteins. Although there are a number of instances
in which the synthesis of specific proteins is known to be induced by corticosteroids,
the links between the initial actions of the hormones and final metabolic
effects have not been completely elucidated. </p>

<p>The physiologic action of fludrocortisone acetate is similar to that
of hydrocortisone. However, the effects of fludrocortisone acetate, particularly
on electrolyte balance, but also on carbohydrate metabolism, are considerably
heightened and prolonged. Mineralocorticoids act on the distal tubules
of the kidney to enhance the reabsorption of sodium ions from the tubular
fluid into the plasma; they increase the urinary excretion of both potassium
and hydrogen ions. The consequence of these three primary effects together
with similar actions on cation transport in other tissues appear to account
for the entire spectrum of physiological activities that are characteristic
of mineralocorticoids. In small oral doses, fludrocortisone acetate produces
marked sodium retention and increased urinary potassium excretion. It also
causes a rise in blood pressure, apparently because of these effects on
electrolyte levels. </p>

<p>In larger doses , fludrocortisone acetate inhibits endogenous adrenal
cortical secretion, thymic activity, and pituitary corticotropin excretion;
promotes the deposition of liver glycogen; and, unless protein intake is
adequate, induces negative nitrogen balance. </p>

<p>The approximate plasma half-life of fludrocortisone (fluorohydrocortisone)
is 3.5 hours or more and the biological half-life is 18 to 36 hours. </p>

<p><a name="INDICATIONS AND USAGE"></a><b>INDICATIONS AND USAGE </b></p>

<p>Fludrocortisone Acetate is indicated as partial replacement therapy
for primary and secondary adrenocortical insufficiency in Addison's disease
and for the treatment of salt-losing adrenogenital syndrome. </p>

<p><a name="CONTRAINDICATIONS"></a><b>CONTRAINDICATIONS </b></p>

<p>Corticosteroids are contraindicated in patients with systemic fungal
infections and in those with a history of possible or known hypersensitivity
to these agents. </p>

<p><a name="WARNINGS"></a><b>WARNINGS </b></p>

<p>BECAUSE OF ITS MARKED EFFECT ON SODIUM RETENTION, THE USE OF FLUDROCORTISONE
ACETATE IN THE TREATMENT OF CONDITIONS OTHER THAN THOSE INDICATED HEREIN
IS NOT ADVISED. </p>

<p>Corticosteroids may mask some signs of infection, and new infections
may appear during their use. There may be decreased resistance and inability
to localize infection when corticosteroids are used. If an infection occurs
during fludrocortisone acetate therapy, it should be promptly controlled
by suitable antimicrobial therapy. </p>

<p>Prolonged use of corticosteroids may produce posterior subcapsular cataracts,
glaucoma with possible damage to the optic nerves, and may enhance the
establishment of secondary ocular infections due to fungi or viruses. </p>

<p>Average and large doses of hydrocortisone or cortisone can cause elevation
of blood pressure, salt and water retention, and increased excretion of
potassium. These effects are less likely to occur with the synthetic derivatives
except when used in large doses. However, since fludrocortisone acetate
is a potent mineralocorticoid, both the dosage and salt intake should be
carefully monitored in order to avoid the development of hypertension,
edema, or weight gain. Periodic checking of serum electrolyte levels is
advisable during prolonged therapy; dietary salt restriction and potassium
supplementation may be necessary. All corticosteroids increase calcium
excretion. </p>

<p>Patients should not be vaccinated against smallpox while on corticosteroid
therapy. Other immunization procedures should not be undertaken in patients
who are on corticosteroids, especially on high dose, because of possible
hazards of neurological complications and a lack of antibody response.
</p>

<p>The use of Fludrocortisone Acetate Tablets in active tuberculosis should
be restricted to those cases of fulminating or disseminated tuberculosis
in which the corticosteroid is used for the management of the disease in
conjunction with an appropriate antituberculous regimen. If corticosteroids
are indicated in patients with latent tuberculosis or tuberculin reactivity,
close observation is necessary since reactivation of the disease may occur.
During prolonged corticosteroid therapy these patients should receive chemoprophylaxis.
</p>

<p>Children who are on immunosuppressant drugs are more susceptible to
infections than healthy children. Chicken pox and measles, for example,
can have a more serious or even fatal course in children on immunosuppressant
corticosteroids. In such children, or in adults who have not had these
diseases, particular care should be taken to avoid exposure. If exposed,
therapy with varicella zoster immune globulin (VZIG) or pooled intravenous
immunoglobulin (IVIG), as appropriate, may be indicated. If chicken pox
develops, treatment with antiviral agents may be considered. </p>

<p><a name="PRECAUTIONS"></a><b>PRECAUTIONS </b></p>

<p>General </p>

<p>Adverse reactions to corticosteroids may be produced by too rapid withdrawal
or by continued use of large doses. </p>

<p>To avoid drug-induced adrenal insufficiency, supportive dosage may be
required in times of stress (such as trauma, surgery, or severe illness)
both during treatment with fludrocortisone acetate and for a year afterwards.
</p>

<p>There is an enhanced corticosteroid effect in patients with hypothyroidism
and in those with cirrhosis. </p>

<p>Corticosteroids should be used cautiously in patients with ocular herpes
simplex because of possible corneal perforation. </p>

<p>The lowest possible dose of corticosteroid should be used to control
the condition being treated. A gradual reduction in dosage should be made
when possible. </p>

<p>Psychic derangements may appear when corticosteroids are used. These
may range from euphoria, insomnia, mood swings, personality changes, and
severe depression to frank psychotic manifestations. Existing emotional
instability or psychotic tendencies may also be aggravated by corticosteroids.
</p>

<p>Aspirin should be used cautiously in conjunction with corticosteroids
in patients with hypoprothrombinemia. </p>

<p>Corticosteroids should be used with caution in patients with nonspecific
ulcerative colitis if there is a probability of impending perforation,
abscess or other pyrogenic infection. Corticosteroids should also be used
cautiously in patients with diverticulitis, fresh intestinal anastomoses,
active or latent peptic ulcer, renal insufficiency, hypertension, osteoporosis,
and myasthenia gravis. </p>

<p>Information for Patients </p>

<p>The physician should advise the patient to report any medical history
of heart disease, high blood pressure, or kidney or liver disease and to
report current use of any medicines to determine if these medicines might
interact adversely with fludrocortisone acetate (see DRUG INTERACTIONS).
</p>

<p>Patients who are on immunosuppressant doses of corticosteroids should
be warned to avoid exposure to chicken pox or measles, and, if exposed,
to obtain medical advice. </p>

<p>The patient's understanding of his steroid-dependent status and increased
dosage requirement under widely variable conditions of stress is vital.
Advise the patient to carry medical identification indicating his dependence
on steroid medication and, if necessary, instruct him to carry an adequate
supply of medication for use in emergencies. </p>

<p>Stress to the patient the importance of regular follow-up visits to
check his progress and the need to promptly notify the physician of dizziness,
severe or continuing headaches, swelling of feet or lower legs, or unusual
weight gain. </p>

<p>Advise the patient to use the medicine only as directed, to take a missed
dose as soon as possible, unless it is almost time for the next dose, and
not to double the next dose. </p>

<p>Inform the patient to keep this medication and all drugs out of the
reach of children. </p>

<p>Laboratory Tests </p>

<p>Patients should be monitored regularly for blood pressure determinations
and serum electrolyte determinations (see WARNINGS). </p>

<p>Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions </p>

<p>Corticosteroids may affect the nitrobluetetrazolium test for bacterial
infection and produce false-negative results. </p>

<p>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility </p>

<p>Adequate studies have not been performed in animals to determine whether
fludrocortisone acetate has carcinogenic or mutagenic activity or whether
it affects fertility in males or females. </p>

<p>Pregnancy Category C. </p>

<p>Adequate animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with fludrocortisone
acetate. However, many corticosteroids have been shown to be teratogenic
in laboratory animals at low doses. Teratogenicity of these agents in man
has not been demonstrated. It is not known whether fludrocortisone acetate
can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect
reproduction capacity. Fludrocortisone acetate should be given to a pregnant
woman only if clearly needed. </p>

<p>Pregnancy. Nonteratogenic Effects. </p>

<p>Infants born of mothers who have received substantial doses of fludrocortisone
acetate during pregnancy should be carefully observed for signs of hypoadrenalism.
</p>

<p>Maternal treatment with corticosteroids should be carefully documented
in the infant's medical records to assist in follow up. </p>

<p>Nursing Mothers </p>

<p>Corticosteroids are found in the breast milk of lactating women receiving
systemic therapy with these agents. Caution should be exercised when fludrocortisone
acetate is administered to a nursing woman. </p>

<p>Pediatric Use </p>

<p>Safety and effectiveness in children have not been established. </p>

<p>Growth and development of infants and children on prolonged corticosteroid
therapy should be carefully observed. </p>

<p><a name="DRUG INTERACTIONS"></a><b>DRUG INTERACTIONS &nbsp;</b></p>

<p>When administered concurrently, the following drugs may interact with
adrenal corticosteroids. </p>

<p>Amphotericin B or potassium-depleting diuretics (benzothiadiazines and
related drugs, ethacrynic acid and furosemide)--enhanced hypokalemia. Check
serum potassium levels at frequent intervals; use potassium supplements
if necessary (see WARNINGS). </p>

<p>Digitalis glycosides--enhanced possibility of arrhythmias of digitalis
toxicity associated with hypokalemia. Monitor serum potassium levels; use
potassium supplements if necessary. </p>

<p>Oral anticoagulants--decreased prothrombin time response. Monitor prothrombin
levels and adjust anticoagulant dosage accordingly. </p>

<p>Antidiabetic drugs (oral agents and insulin)--diminished antidiabetic
effect. Monitor for symptoms of hyperglycemia; adjust dosage of antidiabetic
drug upward if necessary. </p>

<p>Aspirin--increased ulcerogenic effect; decreased pharmacologic effect
of aspirin. Rarely salicylate toxicity may occur in patients who discontinue
steroids after concurrent high-dose aspirin therapy. Monitor salicylate
levels or the therapeutic effect for which aspirin is given; adjust salicylate
dosage accordingly if effect is altered (see PRECAUTIONS, General). </p>

<p>Barbiturates, phenytoin, or rifampin--increased metabolic clearance
of fludrocortisone acetate because of the induction of hepatic enzymes.
Observe the patient for possible diminished effect of steroid and increase
the steroid dosage accordingly. </p>

<p>Anabolic steroids (particularly C-17 alkylated androgens such as oxymetholone,
methandrostenolone, norethandrolone, and similar compounds)--enhanced tendency
toward edema. Use caution when giving these drugs together, especially
in patients with hepatic or cardiac disease. </p>

<p>Vaccines--neurological complications and lack of antibody response (see
WARNINGS). </p>

<p>Estrogen--increased levels of corticosteroid-binding globulin, thereby
increasing the bound (inactive) fraction; this effect is at least balanced
by decreased metabolism of corticosteroids. When estrogen therapy is initiated,
a reduction in corticosteroid dosage may be required, and increased amounts
may be required when estrogen is terminated. </p>

<p><a name="ADVERSE REACTIONS"></a><b>ADVERSE REACTIONS </b></p>

<p>Most adverse reactions are caused by the drug's mineralocorticoid activity
(retention of sodium and water) and include hypertension, edema, cardiac
enlargement, congestive heart failure, potassium loss, and hypokalemic
alkalosis. </p>

<p>When fludrocortisone is used in the small dosages recommended, the glucocorticoid
side effects often seen with cortisone and its derivatives are not usually
a problem; however the following untoward effects should be kept in mind,
particularly when fludrocortisone is used over a prolonged period of time
or in conjunction with cortisone or a similar glucocorticoid. </p>

<p>Musculoskeletal--muscle weakness, steroid myopathy, loss of muscle mass,
osteoporosis, vertebral compression fractures, aseptic necrosis of femoral
and humeral heads, pathologic fracture of long bones, and spontaneous fractures.
</p>

<p>Gastrointestinal--peptic ulcer with possible perforation and hemorrhage,
pancreatitis, abdominal distention, and ulcerative esophagitis. </p>

<p>Dermatologic--impaired wound healing, thin fragile skin, bruising, petechiae
and ecchymoses, facial erythema, increased sweating, subcutaneous fat atrophy,
purpura, striae, hyperpigmentation of the skin and nails, hirsutism, acneiform
eruptions, and hives and/or allergic skin rash; reactions to skin tests
may be suppressed. </p>

<p>Neurological--convulsions, increased intracranial pressure with papilledema
(pseudotumor cerebri) usually after treatment, vertigo, headache, and severe
mental disturbances. </p>

<p>Endocrine--menstrual irregularities; development of the cushingoid state;
suppression of growth in children; secondary adrenocortical and pituitary
unresponsiveness, particularly in times of stress (e.g., trauma, surgery,
or illness); decreased carbohydrate tolerance; manifestations of latent
diabetes mellitus; and increased requirements for insulin or oral hypoglycemic
agents in diabetics. </p>

<p>Ophthalmic--posterior subcapsular cataracts, increased intraocular pressure,
glaucoma, and exophthalmos. </p>

<p>Metabolic--hyperglycemia, glycosuria, and negative nitrogen balance
due to protein catabolism. </p>

<p>Other adverse reactions that may occur following the administration
of a corticosteroid are necrotizing angitis, thrombophlebitis, aggravation
or masking of infections, insomnia, syncopal episodes, and anaphylactoid
reactions. </p>

<p><a name="OVERDOSAGE"></a><b>OVERDOSAGE </b></p>

<p>Development of hypertension, edema, hypokalemia, excessive increase
in weight, and increase in heart size are signs of overdosage of fludrocortisone
acetate. When these are noted, administration of the drug should be discontinued,
after which the symptoms will usually subside within several days; subsequent
treatment with fludrocortisone acetate should be with a reduced dose. Muscular
weakness may develop due to excessive potassium loss and can be treated
by administering a potassium supplement. Regular monitoring of blood pressure
and serum electrolytes can help to prevent overdosage (see WARNINGS). </p>

<p><a name="DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION"></a><b>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
</b></p>

<p>Dosage depends on the severity of the disease and the response of the
patient. Patients should be continually monitored for signs that indicate
dosage adjustment is necessary, such as remissions or exacerbations of
the disease and stress (surgery, infection, trauma)(see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS,
General). </p>

<p>Addison's Disease </p>

<p>In Addison's disease, the combination of Fludrocortisone Acetate tablets
with a glucocorticoid such as hydrocortisone or cortisone provides substitution
therapy approximating normal adrenal activity with minimal risks of unwanted
effects. </p>

<p>The usual dose is 0.1 mg of Fludrocortisone Acetate daily, although
dosage ranging from 0.1 mg three times a week to 0.2 mg. daily has been
employed. In the event transient hypertension develops as a consequence
of therapy, the dose should be reduced to 0.05 mg. daily. Fludrocortisone
Acetate is preferably administered in conjunction with cortisone (10 mg.
to 37.5 mg. daily in divided doses) or hydrocortisone (10 mg. to 30 mg.
daily in divided doses). </p>

<p>Salt-Losing Adrenogenital Syndrome </p>

<p>The recommended dosage for treating the salt-losing adrenogenital syndrome
is 0.1 mg. to 0.2 mg. of Fludrocortisone Acetate daily. </p>

<p><b>This is NOT the official FDA approved material for this drug. Therefore,
please consult the appropriate FDA approved package insert for additional
information!</b></p>

<p>
<hr width="100%" ></p>

<p><a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><b>DESCRIPTION </b></p>

<p>Metaxalone chemically is 5-((3,4-dimethylphenoxy)methyl)-2 oxazolidinone
</p>

<p><a name="ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY"></a><b>ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
</b></p>

<p>The mechanism of action of metaxalone in humans has not been established,
but may be due to general central nervous system depression. It has no
direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor
end plate or the nerve fiber. </p>

<p><a name="INDICATIONS AND USAGE"></a><b>INDICATIONS AND USAGE </b></p>

<p>Metaxalone is indicated as an adjunct to rest, physical therapy, and
other measures for the relief of discomforts associated with acute, painful
musculoskeletal conditions. The mode of action of this drug has not been
clearly identified, but may be related to its sedative properties. Metaxalone
does not directly relax tense skeletal muscles in man. </p>

<p><a name="CONTRAINDICATIONS"></a><b>CONTRAINDICATIONS </b></p>

<p>Metaxalone is contraindicated in individuals who have shown hypersensitivity
to the drug. Metaxalone should not be administered to patients with a known
tendency to drug-induced, hemolytic, or other anemias. It is contraindicated
in patients with significantly impaired renal or hepatic function. </p>

<p><a name="PRECAUTIONS"></a><b>PRECAUTIONS </b></p>

<p>Elevation in cephalin flocculation tests without concurrent changes
in other liver function parameters have been noted. Hence, it is recommended
that metaxalone be administered with great care to patients with pre-existing
liver damage and that serial liver function studies be performed as required.
False-positive Benedict's tests, due to an unknown reducing substance,
have been noted. A glucose-specific test will differentiate findings. </p>

<p>Pregnancy: Reproduction studies have been performed in rats and have
revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to
metaxalone. Reactions reports from marketing experience have not revealed
evidence of fetal injury, but such experience cannot exclude the possibility
of infrequent or subtle damage to the human fetus. Safe use of metaxalone
has not been established with regard to possible adverse effects upon fetal
development. Therefore, metaxalone tablets should not be used in women
who are or may become pregnant and particularly during early pregnancy
unless in the judgment of the physician the potential benefits outweigh
the possible hazards. </p>

<p>Nursing Mothers: It is not known whether this drug is secreted in human
milk. As a general rule, nursing should not be undertaken while a patient
is on a drug since many drugs are excreted in human milk. </p>

<p>Pediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness in children 12 years of age
and below have not been established. </p>

<p><a name="ADVERSE REACTIONS"></a><b>ADVERSE REACTIONS </b></p>

<p>The most frequent reactions to metaxalone include nausea, vomiting,
gastrointestinal upset, drowsiness, dizziness, headache, and nervousness
or &quot;irritability.&quot; Other adverse reactions are: hypersensitivity
reaction, characterized by a light rash with or without pruritus; leukopenia;
hemolytic anemia; jaundice. </p>

<p><a name="OVERDOSAGE"></a><b>OVERDOSAGE </b></p>

<p>MANAGEMENT OF OVERDOSAGE: Gastric lavage and supportive therapy as indicated.
(When determining the LD50 in rats and mice, progressive sedation, hypnosis
and finally respiratory failure were noted as the dosage increased. In
dogs, no LD50 could be determined as the higher doses produced an emetic
action in 15 to 30 minutes). No documented case of major toxicity has been
reported. </p>

<p><a name="DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION"></a><b>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
</b></p>

<p>The recommended dose for adults and children over 12 years of age is
two tablets (800 mg) three to four times a day. </p>

<h1 align=center>Amoxicillin</h1>

<p>
<hr></p>

<p><b>This is NOT the official FDA approved material for this drug. Therefore,
please consult the appropriate FDA approved product information for additional
information!</b></p>

<p>
<hr width="100%" ></p>

<p>Amoxicillin is a semisynthetic antibiotic, an analog of ampicillin,
with a broad spectrum of bactericidal activity against many gram-positive
and gram-negative microorganisms. Chemically it is D-(-)-alpha-amino-p
hydroxybenzyl penicillin trihydrate. </p>

<p>INDICATIONS AND USAGE </p>

<p>Amoxicillin is indicated in the treatment of infections due to susceptible
strains of the following: </p>

<p>GRAM-NEGATIVE ORGANISMS--H. Influenzae, E. Coli, P. Mirabilis and N.
Gonorrhoeae. </p>

<p>GRAM-POSITIVE ORGANISMS--Streptococci (including Streptococcus Faecalis),
D. Pneumoniae and nonpenicillinase-producing staphylococci. </p>

<p>Therapy may be instituted prior to obtaining results from bacteriological
and susceptibility studies to determine the causative organisms and their
susceptibility to amoxicillin. Indicated surgical procedures should be
performed. </p>

<p>CONTRAINDICATIONS </p>

<p>A history of allergic reaction to any of the penicillins is a contraindication.
</p>

<p>WARNINGS </p>

<p>SERIOUS AND OCCASIONALLY FATAL HYPERSENSITIVITY (anaphylactoid) REACTIONS
HAVE BEEN REPORTED IN PATIENTS ON PENICILLIN THERAPY. THESE REACTIONS ARE
MORE LIKELY TO OCCUR IN INDIVIDUALS WITH A HISTORY OF PENICILLIN HYPERSENSITIVITY
AND/OR A HISTORY OF SENSITIVITY TO MULTIPLE ALLERGENS. BEFORE INITIATING
THERAPY WITH AMOXICILLIN, CAREFUL INQUIRY SHOULD BE MADE CONCERNING PREVIOUS
HYPERSENSITIVITY REACTIONS TO PENICILLINS, CEPHALOSPORINS OR OTHER ALLERGENS.
IF AN ALLERGIC REACTION OCCURS, AMOXICILLIN SHOULD BE DISCONTINUED AND
APPROPRIATE THERAPY INSTITUTED. SERIOUS ANAPHYLACTIC REACTIONS REQUIRE
IMMEDIATE EMERGENCY TREATMENT WITH EPINEPHRINE. OXYGEN, INTRAVENOUS STEROIDS
AND AIRWAY MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING INTUBATION, SHOULD ALSO BE ADMINISTERED
AS INDICATED. PSEUDOMEMBRANOUS COLITIS HAS BEEN REPORTED WITH NEARLY ALL
ANTI-BACTERIAL AGENTS, INCLUDING AMOXICILLIN, AND MAY RANGE IN SEVERITY
FROM MILD TO LIFE-THREATENING. THEREFORE, IT IS IMPORTANT TO CONSIDER THIS
DIAGNOSIS IN PATIENTS WHO PRESENT WITH DIARRHEA SUBSEQUENT TO THE ADMINISTRATION
OF ANTIBACTERIAL AGENTS </p>

<p>Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon
and may permit overgrowth of clostridia. Studies indicate that a toxin
produced by Clostridium Difficile is a primary cause of &quot;antibiotic-associated
colitis.&quot; After the diagnosis of pseudomembranous colitis has been
established, therapeutic measures should be initiated. Mild cases of pseudomembranous
colitis usually respond to drug discontinuation alone. In moderate to severe
cases, consideration should be given to management with fluids and electrolytes
protein supplementation and treatment with an antibacterial drug clinically
effective against C. Difficile colitis. </p>

<p>USAGE IN PREGNANCY </p>

<p>Safety for use in pregnancy has not been established. </p>

<p>PRECAUTIONS </p>

<p>As with any potent drug, periodic assessment of renal, hepatic and hematopoietic
function should be made during prolonged therapy. The possibility of superinfections
with mycotic or bacterial pathogens should be kept in mind during therapy.
If superinfections occur (usually involving Enterobacter, Pseudomonas or
Candida), the drug should be discontinued and/or appropriate therapy instituted.
</p>

<p>ADVERSE REACTIONS </p>

<p>As with other penicillins, it may be expected that untoward reactions
will be essentially limited to sensitivity phenomena. They are more likely
to occur in individuals who have previously demonstrated hypersensitivity
to penicillins and in those with a history of allergy, asthma, hay fever
or urticaria. The following adverse reactions have been reported as associated
with the use of penicillins: </p>

<p>GASTROINTESTINAL: Nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. </p>

<p>HYPERSENSITIVITY REACTIONS: Erythematous maculopapular rashes, erythema
multiforme, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis and urticaria
have been reported. </p>

<p>NOTE: These hypersensitivity reactions may be controlled with antihistamines
and, if necessary, systemic corticosteroids. Whenever such reactions occur,
amoxicillin should be discontinued unless, in the opinion of the physician,
the condition being treated is life-threatening and amenable only to amoxicillin
therapy. </p>

<p>LIVER: A moderate rise in serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT)
has been noted, but the significance of this finding is unknown. </p>

<p>HEMIC AND LYMPHATIC SYSTEMS: Anemia, thrombocytopenia, thrombocytopenic
purpura eosinophilia, leukopenia and agranulocytosis have been reported
during therapy with penicillins. These reactions are usually reversible
on discontinuation of therapy and are believed to be hypersensitivity phenomena.
</p>

<p>CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM: Reversible hyperactivity, agitation, anxiety,
insomnia, confusion, behavioral changes, and/or dizziness have been reported
rarely. </p>

<p>ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY </p>

<p>PHARMACOLOGY </p>

<p>Amoxicillin is stable in the presence of gastric acid and may be given
without regard to meals. It is rapidly absorbed after oral administration.
It diffuses readily into most body tissues and fluids, with the exception
of brain and spinal fluid, except when meninges are inflamed. The half-life
of amoxicillin is 61.3 minutes. Most of the amoxicillin is excreted unchanged
in the urine; its excretion can be delayed by concurrent administration
of probenecid.</p>

<p> Amoxicillin is not highly protein-bound. In blood serum, amoxicillin
is  approximately 20% protein-bound as compared to 60% for penicillin G.
</p>

<p>Orally administered doses of 250 mg and 500 mg amoxicillin capsules
result in average peak blood levels 1 to 2 hours after administration in
the range of 3.5 mcg/mL to 5.0 mcg/mL and 5.5 mcg/mL to 7.5 mcg/mL, respectively.
</p>

<p>Orally administered doses of amoxicillin suspension 125 mg/5 mL and
250 mg/5 mL result in average peak blood levels 1 to 2 hours after administration
in the range of 1.5 mcg/mL to 3.0 mcg/mL and 3.5 mcg/mL to 5.0 mcg/mL,
respectively. </p>

<p>Amoxicillin chewable tablets, 125 mg and 250 mg, produced blood levels
similar to those achieved with the corresponding doses of amoxicillin oral
suspensions. </p>

<p>Detectable serum levels are observed up to 8 hours after an orally administered
dose of amoxicillin. Following a 1 gram dose and utilizing a special skin
window technique to determine levels of the antibiotic, it was noted that
therapeutic levels were found in the interstitial fluid. Approximately
60% of an orally administered dose of amoxicillin is excreted in the urine
within 6 to 8 hours. </p>

<p>MICROBIOLOGY </p>

<p>Amoxicillin is similar to ampicillin in its bactericidal action against
susceptible organisms during the stage of active multiplication. It acts
through the inhibition of biosynthesis of cell wall mucopeptide. In Vitro
studies have demonstrated the susceptibility of most strains of the following
gram-positive bacteria: alpha- and beta-hemolytic streptococci, Diplococcus
Pneumoniae, nonpenicillinase-producing staphylococci, and Streptococcus
Faecalis. It is active In Vitro against many strains of Haemophilus Influenzae,
Neisseria Gonorrhoeae, Escherichia Coli and Proteus Mirabilis. </p>

<p>Because it does not resist destruction by penicillinase, it is not effective
against penicillinase-producing bacteria, particularly resistant staphylococci.
All strains of Pseudomonas and most strains of Klebsiella and Enterobacter
are resistant. </p>

<p>DISK SUSCEPTIBILITY TESTS: Quantitative methods that require measurement
of zone diameters give the most precise estimates of antibiotic susceptibility.
One such procedure* has been recommended for use with disks for testing
susceptibility to ampicillin-class antibiotics. Interpretations correlate
diameters of the disk test with MIC values for amoxicillin. With this procedure
a report from the laboratory of &quot;susceptible&quot; indicates that
the infecting organism is likely to respond to therapy. A report of &quot;resistant&quot;
indicates that the infecting organism is not likely to respond to therapy.
A report of &quot;intermediate susceptibility&quot; suggests that the organism
would be susceptible if high dosage is used, or if the infection is confined
to tissues and fluids (e.g., urine), in which high antibiotic levels are
attained. </p>

<p><a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><b>DESCRIPTION </b></p>

<p>Doxazosin is a quinazoline compound that is a selective inhibitor of
the alpha1 subtype of alpha adrenergic receptors. The chemical name of
doxazosin mesylate is 1-(4-amino-6,7-dimethoxy-2-quinazolinyl)-4-(1,4-
benzodioxan-2-ylcarbonyl) piperazine methanesulfonate. The empirical formula
for doxazosin mesylate is C23H25N5O5.CH4O3S and the molecular weight is
547.6. </p>

<p>Doxazosin is freely soluble in dimethylsulfoxide, soluble in dimethylformamide,
slightly soluble in methanol, ethanol, and water (0.8% at 25 deg C), and
very slightly soluble in acetone and methylene chloride. </p>

<p><a name="ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY"></a><b>ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
</b></p>

<p>MECHANISM OF ACTION </p>

<p>The mechanism of action of Doxazosin is selective blockade of the alpha1
(postjunctional) subtype of alpha adrenergic receptors. Studies in normal
human subjects have shown that doxazosin competitively antagonized the
pressor effects of phenylephrine (an alpha1 agonist) and the systolic pressor
effect of norepinephrine. Doxazosin and prazosin have similar abilities
to antagonize phenylephrine. The antihypertensive effect of Doxazosin results
from a decrease in systemic vascular resistance. The parent compound, doxazosin
is primarily responsible for the antihypertensive activity. The low plasma
concentrations of known active and inactive metabolites of doxazosin (2
piperazinyl, 6'- and 7'-hydroxy and 6- and 7-O-desmethyl compounds) compared
to parent drug indicate that the contribution of even the most potent compound
(6' hydroxy) to the antihypertensive effect of doxazosin in man is probably
small. </p>

<p>PHARMACOKINETICS </p>

<p>After oral administration of therapeutic doses, peak plasma levels of
Doxazosin occur at about 2-3 hours. Bioavailability is approximately 65%,
reflecting first pass metabolism of doxazosin by the liver. The effect
of food on the bioavailability of doxazosin has not been determined. </p>

<p>Doxazosin is extensively metabolized in the liver, mainly by O-demethylation
of the quinazoline nucleus or hydroxylation of the benzodioxan moiety.
In a study of two subjects administered radiolabelled doxazosin 2 mg orally
and 1 mg intravenous on two separate occasions, approximately 63% of the
dose was eliminated in the feces and 9% of the dose was found in the urine.
On average only 4.8% of the dose was excreted as unchanged drug in the
feces and only a trace of the total radioactivity in the urine was attributed
to unchanged drug. At the plasma concentrations achieved by therapeutic
doses approximately 98% of the circulating drug is bound to plasma proteins.
</p>

<p>Plasma elimination of doxazosin is biphasic, with a terminal elimination
half life of about 22 hours. Steady-state studies in hypertensive patients
given doxazosin doses of 2-16 mg once daily showed linear kinetics and
dose proportionality. In two studies, following the administration of 2
mg orally once daily, the mean accumulation ratios (steady state AUC vs
first dose AUC) were 1.2 and 1.7. Enterohepatic recycling is suggested
by secondary peaking of plasma doxazosin concentrations. </p>

<p>Although several active metabolites of doxazosin have been identified,
the pharmacokinetics of these metabolites have not been characterized.
</p>

<p>Pharmacokinetic studies in elderly patients and patients with renal
impairment have shown no significant alterations compared to younger patients
with normal renal function. There have, however, been no studies of patients
with liver impairment, and there are only limited data on the effects of
drugs known to influence hepatic metabolism [e.g. cimetidine (See Precautions)].
Use of doxazosin in patients with altered liver function should be undertaken
with particular caution, if at all, as excretion is almost wholly hepatic.
</p>

<p>PHARMACODYNAMICS </p>

<p>Administration of Doxazosin results in a reduction in systemic vascular
resistance. In patients with hypertension there is little change in cardiac
output. Maximum reductions in blood pressure usually occur 2 6 hours after
dosing and are associated with a small increase in standing heart rate.
Like other alpha1-adrenergic blocking agents, doxazosin has a greater effect
on blood pressure and heart rate in the standing position. </p>

<p>In a pooled analysis of placebo controlled studies with about 300 patients
per treatment group, doxazosin, at doses of 1-16 mg given once daily, lowered
blood pressure at 24 hours by about 10/8 mmHg compared to placebo in the
standing position and about 9/5 mmHg in the supine position. Peak blood
pressure effects (1-6 hours) were larger by about 50-75% (i.e., trough
values were about 55-70% of peak effect), with the larger peak-trough differences
seen in systolic pressures. There was no apparent difference in the blood
pressure response of Caucasians and blacks or of patients above and below
age 65. In these predominantly normocholesterolemic patients doxazosin
produced small reductions in total serum cholesterol (2-3%), LDL cholesterol
(4%), and a similarly small increase in HDL/total cholesterol ratio (4%).
The clinical significance of these findings is uncertain. In the same patient
population, patients receiving Doxazosin gained a mean of 0.6 kg compared
to a mean loss of 0.1 kg for placebo patients. </p>

<p><a name="INDICATIONS AND USAGE"></a><b>INDICATIONS AND USAGE </b></p>

<p>Doxazosin is indicated for the treatment of hypertension. </p>

<p>Doxazosin may be used alone or in combination with diuretics or beta-adrenergic
blocking agents. There is limited experience with Doxazosin in combination
with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or calcium channel blockers.
</p>

<p><a name="CONTRAINDICATIONS"></a><b>CONTRAINDICATIONS </b></p>

<p>Doxazosin is contraindicated in patients with a known sensitivity to
quinazolines (e.g. prazosin, terazosin). </p>

<p><a name="WARNINGS"></a><b>WARNINGS </b></p>

<p>SYNCOPE AND &quot;FIRST-DOSE&quot; EFFECT: </p>

<p>DOXAZOSIN, LIKE OTHER ALPHA-ADRENERGIC BLOCKING AGENTS, CAN CAUSE MARKED
HYPOTENSION, ESPECIALLY IN THE UPRIGHT POSITION, WITH SYNCOPE AND OTHER
POSTURAL SYMPTOMS SUCH AS DIZZINESS. MARKED ORTHOSTATIC EFFECTS ARE MOST
COMMON WITH THE FIRST DOSE BUT CAN ALSO OCCUR WHEN THERE IS A DOSAGE INCREASE,
OR IF THERAPY IS INTERRUPTED FOR MORE THAN A FEW DAYS. TO DECREASE THE
LIKELIHOOD OF EXCESSIVE HYPOTENSION AND SYNCOPE, IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT TREATMENT
BE INITIATED WITH THE 1 MG DOSE. THE 2, 4, AND 8 MG TABLETS ARE NOT FOR
INITIAL THERAPY. DOSAGE SHOULD THEN BE ADJUSTED SLOWLY (SEE DOSAGE AND
ADMINISTRATION SECTION) WITH INCREASES IN DOSE EVERY TWO WEEKS. ADDITIONAL
ANTIHYPERTENSIVE AGENTS SHOULD BE ADDED WITH CAUTION. </p>

<p>PATIENTS BEING TITRATED WITH DOXAZOSIN SHOULD BE CAUTIONED TO AVOID
SITUATIONS WHERE INJURY COULD RESULT SHOULD SYNCOPE OCCUR. </p>

<p>In an early investigational study of the safety and tolerance of increasing
daily doses of doxazosin in normotensives beginning at 1 mg/day, only 2
of 6 subjects could tolerate more than 2 mg/day without experiencing symptomatic
postural hypotension. In another study of 24 healthy normotensive male
subjects receiving initial doses of 2 mg/day of doxazosin, seven (29%)
of the subjects experienced symptomatic postural hypotension between 0.5
and 6 hours after the first dose necessitating termination of the study.
In this study 2 of the normotensive subjects experienced syncope. Subsequent
trials in hypertensive patients always began doxazosin dosing at 1 mg/day
resulting in a 4% incidence of postural side effects at 1 mg/day with no
cases of syncope. </p>

<p>In multiple dose clinical trials involving over 1500 patients with dose
titration every one to two weeks, syncope was reported in 0.7% of patients.
None of these events occurred at the starting dose of 1 mg and 1.2% (8/664)
occurred at 16 mg/day. </p>

<p>IF SYNCOPE OCCURS, THE PATIENT SHOULD BE PLACED IN A RECUMBENT POSITION
AND TREATED SUPPORTIVELY AS NECESSARY. </p>

<p><a name="PRECAUTIONS"></a><b>PRECAUTIONS </b></p>

<p>GENERAL </p>

<p>1. ORTHOSTATIC HYPOTENSION: </p>

<p>While syncope is the most severe orthostatic effect of Doxazosin, other
symptoms of lowered blood pressure, such as dizziness, lightheadedness,
or vertigo, can occur, especially at initiation of therapy or at the time
of dose increases. These were common in clinical trials, occurring in up
to 23% of all patients treated and causing discontinuation of therapy in
about 2%. </p>

<p>In placebo controlled titration trials orthostatic effects were minimized
by beginning therapy at 1 mg per day and titrating every two weeks to 2,4,
or 8 mg per day. There was an increased frequency of orthostatic effects
in patients given 8 mg or more, 10%, compared to 5% at 1-4 mg and 3% in
the placebo group. </p>

<p>Patients in occupations in which orthostatic hypotension could be dangerous
should be treated with particular caution. </p>

<p>If hypotension occurs, the patient should be placed in the supine position
and, if this measure is inadequate, volume expansion with intravenous fluids
or vasopressor therapy may be used. A transient hypotensive response is
not a contraindication to further doses of Doxazosin. </p>

<p>2. IMPAIRED LIVER FUNCTION: </p>

<p>Doxazosin should be administered with caution to patients with evidence
of impaired hepatic function or to patients receiving drugs known to influence
hepatic metabolism (see ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY). There is no controlled
clinical experience with Doxazosin in patients with these conditions. </p>

<p>3. LEUKOPENIA/NEUTROPENIA: </p>

<p>Analysis of hematologic data from patients receiving Doxazosin in controlled
clinical trials showed that the mean WBC (N = 474) and mean neutrophil
counts (N = 419) were decreased by 2.4% and 1.0% respectively, compared
to placebo, a phenomenon seen with other alpha blocking drugs. A search
through a data base of 2400 patients revealed 4 in which drug-related neutropenia
could not be ruled out. Two had a single low value on the last day of treatment.
Two had stable, non-progressive neutrophil counts in the 1000/mm3 range
over periods of 20 and 40 weeks. In cases where follow-up was available
the WBCs and neutrophil counts returned to normal after discontinuation
of Doxazosin. No patients became symptomatic as a result of the low WBC
or neutrophil counts. </p>

<p>INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS: </p>

<p>Patients should be made aware of the possibility of syncopal and orthostatic
symptoms, especially at the initiation of therapy, and urged to avoid driving
or hazardous tasks for 24 hours after the first dose, after a dosage increase,
and after interruption of therapy when treatment is resumed. They should
be cautioned to avoid situations where injury could result should syncope
occur during initiation of doxazosin therapy. They should also be advised
of the need to sit or lie down when symptoms of lowered blood pressure
occur, although these symptoms are not always orthostatic, and to be careful
when rising from a sitting or lying position. If dizziness, lightheadedness,
or palpitations are bothersome they should be reported to the physician,
so that dose adjustment can be considered. Patients should also be told
that drowsiness or somnolence can occur with doxazosin, requiring caution
in people who must drive or operate heavy machinery. </p>

<p>DRUG INTERACTIONS: </p>

<p>Most (98%) of plasma doxazosin is protein bound. In Vitro data in human
plasma indicate that Doxazosin has no effect on protein binding of digoxin,
warfarin, phenytoin or indomethacin. There is no information on the effect
of other highly plasma protein bound drugs on doxazosin binding. Doxazosin
has been administered without any evidence of an adverse drug interaction
to patients receiving thiazide diuretics, beta blocking agents, and nonsteroidal
anti inflammatory drugs. </p>

<p>CIMETIDINE: In a placebo-controlled trial in normal volunteers, the
ad- ministration of a single 1 mg dose of doxazosin on day 1 of a four-day
regimen of oral cimetidine (400 mg twice daily) resulted in a 10% increase
in mean AUC of doxazosin (p=0.006) and a slight but not statistically significant
increase in mean Cmax and mean half-life of doxazosin. The clinical significance
of this increase in doxazosin AUC is unknown. </p>

<p>DRUG/LABORATORY TEST INTERACTIONS: </p>

<p>None known. </p>

<p>CARDIAC TOXICITY IN ANIMALS: </p>

<p>An increased incidence of myocardial necrosis or fibrosis was displayed
by Sprague-Dawley rats after 6 months of dietary administration at concentrations
calculated to provide 80 mg doxazosin/kg/day and after 12 months of dietary
administration at concentrations calculated to provide 40 mg doxazosin/kg/day
(150 times the maximum recommended human dose assuming a patient weight
of 60 kg). Myocardial fibrosis was observed in both rats and mice treated
in the same manner with 40 mg doxazosin/kg/day for 18 months. No cardiotoxicity
was observed at lower doses (up to 10 or 20 mg/kg/day, depending on the
study) in either species. These lesions were not observed after 12 months
of oral dosing in dogs and Wistar rats at maximum doses of 20 mg/kg/day
and 100 mg/kg/day, respectively. There is no evidence that similar lesions
occur in humans. </p>

<p>CARCINOGENESIS, MUTAGENESIS AND IMPAIRMENT OF FERTILITY: </p>

<p>Chronic dietary administration (up to 24 months) of doxazosin mesylate
at maximally tolerated concentrations (highest dose 40 mg/kg: about 150
times the maximum recommended human dose of 16 mg/60 kg) revealed no evidence
of carcinogenicity in rats. There was also no evidence of carcinogenicity
in a similarly conducted study (up to 18 months of dietary administration)
in mice. The mouse study, however, was compromised by the failure to use
a maximally tolerated dose of doxazosin. </p>

<p>Mutagenicity studies revealed no drug- or metabolite-related effects
at either chromosomal or subchromosomal levels. </p>

<p>Studies in rats showed reduced fertility in males treated with doxazosin
at oral doses of 20 (but not 5 or 10) mg/kg/day, about 75 times the maximum
recommended human dose. This effect was reversible within two weeks of
drug withdrawal. </p>

<p>PREGNANCY </p>

<p>TERATOGENIC EFFECTS, PREGNANCY CATEGORY C. Studies in pregnant rabbits
and rats at daily oral doses of up to 41 and 20 mg/kg. respectively (154
and 75 times the maximum recommended daily dose of 16 mg. assuming a patient
weight of 60 kg.) have revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus. A dosage
regimen of 82 mg/kg/day in the rabbit was associated with reduced fetal
survival. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant
women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of
human response, Doxazosin should be used during pregnancy only if clearly
needed. </p>

<p>Radioactivity was found to cross the placenta following oral administration
of labelled doxazosin to pregnant rats. </p>

<p>NONTERATOGENIC EFFECTS. In peri-postnatal studies in rats, postnatal
development at maternal doses of 40 or 50 mg/kg/day of doxazosin was delayed
as evidenced by slower body weight gain and a slightly later appearance
of anatomical features and reflexes. </p>

<p>NURSING MOTHERS </p>

<p>Studies in lactating rats given a single oral dose of 1 mg/kg of (2-14C)-
doxazosin indicate that doxazosin accumulates in rat breast milk with a
maximum concentration about 20 times greater than the maternal plasma concentration.
It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many
drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Doxazosin
is administered to a nursing mother. </p>

<p>PEDIATRIC USE </p>

<p>Safety and effectiveness in children have not been established. </p>

<p><a name="DRUG INTERACTIONS"></a><b>DRUG INTERACTIONS </b></p>

<p>Most (98%) of plasma doxazosin is protein bound. In Vitro data in human
plasma indicate that Doxazosin has no effect on protein binding of digoxin,
warfarin, phenytoin or indomethacin. There is no information on the effect
of other highly plasma protein bound drugs on doxazosin binding. Doxazosin
has been administered without any evidence of an adverse drug interaction
to patients receiving thiazide diuretics, beta blocking agents, and nonsteroidal
anti inflammatory drugs. </p>

<p>(See Also PRECAUTIONS) </p>

<p><a name="ADVERSE REACTIONS"></a><b>ADVERSE REACTIONS </b></p>

<p>Doxazosin has been administered to approximately 4000 patients, of whom
1679 were included in the clinical development program. In that program,
minor adverse effects were frequent, but led to discontinuation of treatment
in only 7% of patients. In placebo-controlled studies adverse effect occurred
in 49% and 40% of patients in the doxazosin and placebo groups, respectively,
and led to discontinuation in 2% of patients in each group. The major reasons
for discontinuation were postural effects (2%), edema, malaise/fatigue,
and some heart rate disturbance, each about 0.7%. </p>

<p>In controlled clinical trials directly comparing Doxazosin to placebo
there was no significant difference in the incidence of side effects, except
for dizziness (including postural), weight gain, somnolence and fatigue/malaise.
Postural effects and edema appeared to be dose related. </p>

<p>The prevalence rates presented below are based on combined data from
placebo- controlled studies involving once daily administration of doxazosin
at doses ranging from 1-16 mg. Table 1 summarizes those adverse experiences
(possibly/ probably related) reported for patients in these studies where
the prevalence rate in the doxazosin group was at least 0.5% or where the
reaction is of particular interest. </p>

<p>Additional adverse reactions have been reported, but these are, in general,
not distinguishable from symptoms that might have occurred in the absence
of exposure to doxazosin. The following adverse reactions occurred with
a frequency of between 0.5% and 1%: syncope, hypoesthesia, increased sweating,
agitation, increased weight. The following additional adverse reactions
were reported by &lt;0.5% of 3960 patients who received doxazosin in controlled
or open short- or long-term clinical studies, including international studies.

accident; Autonomic Nervous System: pallor; Metabolic: thirst, gout, hypokalemia;
Hematopoietic: lymphadenopathy, purpura; Reproductive System: breast pain;
Skin Disorders: alopecia, dry skin, eczema; Central Nervous System: paresis,
tremor, twitching, confusion, migraine, impaired concentration; Psychiatric:
paroniria, amnesia, emotional lability, abnormal thinking, depersonalization;
Special Senses: parosmia, earache, taste perversion, photophobia, abnormal
lacrimation; Gastrointestinal System: increased appetite, anorexia, fecal
incontinence, gastroenteritis; Respiratory System: bronchospasm, sinusitis,
coughing, pharyngitis; Urinary System: renal calculus; General Body System:
hot flushes, back pain, infection, fever/rigors, decreased weight, influenza-like
symptoms. </p>

<p>Doxazosin has not been associated with any clinically significant changes
in routine biochemical tests. No clinically relevant adverse effects were
noted on serum potassium, serum glucose, uric acid, blood urea nitrogen,
creatinine or liver function tests. Doxazosin has been associated with
decreases in white blood cell counts (See Precautions). </p>

<p><a name="OVERDOSAGE"></a><b>OVERDOSAGE </b></p>

<p>No data are available in regard to overdosage in humans. </p>

<p>The oral LD50 of doxazosin is greater than 1000 mg/kg in mice and rats.
The most likely manifestation of overdosage would be hypotension, for which
the usual treatment would be intravenous infusion of fluid. As doxazosin
is highly protein bound, dialysis would not be indicated. </p>

<p><a name="DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION"></a><b>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
</b></p>

<p>DOSAGE MUST BE INDIVIDUALIZED. The initial dosage of Doxazosin in hypertensive
patients is 1 mg given once daily. This starting dose is intended to minimize
the frequency of postural hypotension and first dose syncope associated
with Doxazosin. Postural effects are most likely to occur between 2 and
6 hours after a dose. Therefore blood pressure measurements should be taken
during this time period after the first dose and with each increase in
dose. Depending on the individual patient's standing blood pressure response
(based on measurements taken at 2-6 hours postdose and 24 hours postdose),
dosage may then be increased to 2 mg and thereafter if necessary to 4 mg,
8 mg and 16 mg to achieve the desired reduction in blood pressure. INCREASES
IN DOSE BEYOND 4 MG INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD OF EXCESSIVE POSTURAL EFFECTS
INCLUDING SYNCOPE, POSTURAL DIZZINESS/VERTIGO, POSTURAL HYPOTENSION. AT
A TITRATED DOSE OF 16 MG ONCE DAILY THE FREQUENCY OF POSTURAL EFFECTS IS
ABOUT 12% COMPARED TO 3% FOR PLACEBO. </p>

<p><a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><b>DESCRIPTION </b></p>

<p>Meperidine hydrochloride is ethyl 1-methyl- 4-phenylisonipecotate hydrochloride,
a white crystalline substance with a melting point of 186 deg C to 189
deg C. It is readily soluble in water and has a neutral reaction and a
slightly bitter taste. The solution is not decomposed by a short period
of boiling. </p>

<p><a name="ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY"></a><b>ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
</b></p>

<p>Meperidine hydrochloride is a narcotic analgesic with multiple actions
qualitatively similar to those of morphine; the most prominent of these
involve the central nervous system and organs composed of smooth muscle.
The principal actions of therapeutic value are analgesia and sedation.
</p>

<p>There is some evidence which suggests that meperidine may produce less
smooth muscle spasm, constipation, and depression of the cough reflex than
equianalgesic doses of morphine. Meperidine, in 60 mg to 80 mg parenteral
doses, is approximately equivalent in analgesic effect to 10 mg of morphine.
The onset of action is slightly more rapid than with morphine, and the
duration of action is slightly shorter. Meperidine is significantly less
effective by the oral than by the parenteral route, but the exact ratio
of oral to parenteral effectiveness is unknown. </p>

<p><a name="INDICATIONS AND USAGE"></a><b>INDICATIONS AND USAGE </b></p>

<p>For the relief of moderate to severe pain (parenteral and oral forms)
</p>

<p>For preoperative medication (parenteral form only) </p>

<p>For support of anesthesia (parenteral form only) </p>

<p>For obstetrical analgesia (parenteral form only) </p>

<p><a name="CONTRAINDICATIONS"></a><b>CONTRAINDICATIONS </b></p>

<p>Hypersensitivity to meperidine. </p>

<p>Meperidine is contraindicated in patients who are receiving monoamine
oxidase (MAO) inhibitors or those who have recently received such agents.
Therapeutic doses of meperidine have occasionally precipitated unpredictable,
severe, and occasionally fatal reactions in patients who have received
such agents within 14 days. The mechanism of these reactions is unclear,
but may be related to a preexisting hyperphenylalaninemia. Some have been
characterized by coma, severe respiratory depression, cyanosis, and hypotension,
and have resembled the syndrome of acute narcotic overdose. In other reactions
the predominant manifestations have been hyperexcitability, convulsions,
tachycardia, hyperpyrexia, and hypertension. Although it is not known that
other narcotics are free of the risk of such reactions, virtually all of
the reported reactions have occurred with meperidine. If a narcotic is
needed in such patients, a sensitivity test should be performed in which
repeated, small, incremental doses of morphine are administered over the
course of several hours while the patient's condition and vital signs are
under careful observation. (Intravenous hydrocortisone or prednisolone
have been used to treat severe reactions, with the addition of intravenous
chlorpromazine in those cases exhibiting hypertension and hyperpyrexia.
The usefulness and safety of narcotic antagonists in the treatment of these
reactions is unknown.) </p>

<p>Solutions of Meperidine and barbiturates are chemically incompatible.
</p>

<p><a name="WARNINGS"></a><b>WARNINGS </b></p>

<p>Drug Dependence. Meperidine can produce drug dependence of the morphine
type and therefore has the potential for being abused. Psychic dependence,
physical dependence, and tolerance may develop upon repeated administration
of meperidine, and it should be prescribed and administered with the same
degree of caution appropriate to the use of morphine. Like other narcotics,
meperidine is subject to the provisions of the Federal narcotic laws. </p>

<p>Interaction With Other Central Nervous System Depressants. MEPERIDINE
SHOULD BE USED WITH GREAT CAUTION AND IN REDUCED DOSAGE IN PATIENTS WHO
ARE CONCURRENTLY RECEIVING OTHER NARCOTIC ANALGESICS, GENERAL ANESTHETICS,
PHENOTHIAZINES, OTHER TRANQUILIZERS (SEE DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION), SEDATIVE-HYPNOTICS
(INCLUDING BARBITURATES), TRICYCLIC ANTIDEPRESSANTS, AND OTHER CNS DEPRESSANTS
(INCLUDING ALCOHOL). RESPIRATORY DEPRESSION, HYPOTENSION, AND PROFOUND
SEDATION OR COMA MAY RESULT. </p>

<p>Head Injury And Increased Intracranial Pressure. The respiratory depressant
effects of meperidine and its capacity to elevate cerebrospinal fluid pressure
may be markedly exaggerated in the presence of head injury, other intracranial
lesions, or a preexisting increase in intracranial pressure. Furthermore,
narcotics produce adverse reactions which may obscure the clinical course
of patients with head injuries. In such patients, meperidine must be used
with extreme caution and only if its use is deemed essential. </p>

<p>Intravenous Use. If necessary, meperidine may be given intravenously,
but the injection should be given very slowly, preferably in the form of
a diluted solution. Rapid intravenous injection of narcotic analgesics,
including meperidine, increases the incidence of adverse reactions; severe
respiratory depression, apnea, hypotension, peripheral circulatory collapse,
and cardiac arrest have occurred. Meperidine should not be administered
intravenously unless a narcotic antagonist and the facilities for assisted
or controlled respiration are immediately available. When meperidine is
given parenterally, especially intravenously, the patient should be lying
down. </p>

<p>Asthma And Other Respiratory Conditions. Meperidine should be used with
extreme caution in patients having an acute asthmatic attack, patients
with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, patients having
a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, and patients with preexisting
respiratory depression, hypoxia, or hypercapnia. In such patients, even
usual therapeutic doses of narcotics may decrease respiratory drive while
simultaneously increasing airway resistance to the point of apnea. </p>

<p>Hypotensive Effect. The administration of meperidine may result in severe
hypotension in the postoperative patient or any individual whose ability
to maintain blood pressure has been compromised by a depleted blood volume
or the administration of drugs such as the phenothiazines or certain anesthetics.
Usage In Ambulatory Patients. Meperidine may impair the mental and/or physical
abilities required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks such
as driving a car or operating machinery. The patient should be cautioned
accordingly. </p>

<p>Meperidine, like other narcotics, may produce orthostatic hypotension
in ambulatory patients. </p>

<p>Usage In Pregnancy And Lactation. Meperidine should not be used in pregnant
women prior to the labor period, unless in the judgment of the physician
the potential benefits outweigh the possible hazards, because safe use
in pregnancy prior to labor has not been established relative to possible
adverse effects on fetal development. </p>

<p>When used as an obstetrical analgesic, meperidine crosses the placental
barrier and can produce depression of respiration and psychophysiologic
functions in the newborn. Resuscitation may be required (see section on
OVERDOSAGE). Meperidine appears in the milk of nursing mothers receiving
the drug. </p>

<p><a name="PRECAUTIONS"></a><b>PRECAUTIONS </b></p>

<p>As with all intramuscular preparations Meperidine intramuscular injection
should be injected well within the body of a large muscle. </p>

<p>Supraventricular Tachycardias. Meperidine should be used with caution
in patients with atrial flutter and other supraventricular tachycardias
because of a possible vagolytic action which may produce a significant
increase in the ventricular response rate. </p>

<p>Convulsions. Meperidine may aggravate preexisting convulsions in patients
with convulsive disorders. If dosage is escalated substantially above recommended
levels because of tolerance development, convulsions may occur in individuals
without a history of convulsive disorders. </p>

<p>Acute Abdominal Conditions. The administration of meperidine or other
narcotics may obscure the diagnosis or clinical course in patients with
acute abdominal conditions. </p>

<p>Special Risk Patients. Meperidine should be given with caution and the
initial dose should be reduced in certain patients such as the elderly
or debilitated, and those with severe impairment of hepatic or renal function,
hypothyroidism, Addison's disease, and prostatic hypertrophy or urethral
stricture. </p>

<p><a name="DRUG INTERACTIONS"></a><b>DRUG INTERACTIONS </b></p>

<p>Interaction With Other Central Nervous System Depressants. MEPERIDINE
SHOULD BE USED WITH GREAT CAUTION AND IN REDUCED DOSAGE IN PATIENTS WHO
ARE CONCURRENTLY RECEIVING OTHER NARCOTIC ANALGESICS, GENERAL ANESTHETICS,
PHENOTHIAZINES, OTHER TRANQUILIZERS (SEE DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION), SEDATIVE-HYPNOTICS
(INCLUDING BARBITURATES), TRICYCLIC ANTIDEPRESSANTS, AND OTHER CNS DEPRESSANTS
(INCLUDING ALCOHOL). RESPIRATORY DEPRESSION, HYPOTENSION, AND PROFOUND
SEDATION OR COMA MAY RESULT. </p>

<p>Meperidine is contraindicated in patients who are receiving monoamine
oxidase (MAO) inhibitors or those who have recently received such agents.
(See Also WARNINGS and CONTRAINDICATIONS) </p>

<p><a name="ADVERSE REACTIONS"></a><b>ADVERSE REACTIONS </b></p>

<p>The major hazards of meperidine, as with other narcotic analgesics,
are respiratory depression and, to a lesser degree, circulatory depression;
respiratory arrest, shock, and cardiac arrest have occurred. </p>

<p>The most frequently observed adverse reactions include lightheadedness,
dizziness, sedation, nausea, vomiting, and sweating. These effects seem
to be more prominent in ambulatory patients and in those who are not experiencing
severe pain. In such individuals, lower doses are advisable. Some adverse
reactions in ambulatory patients may be alleviated if the patient lies
down. Other adverse reactions include: </p>

<p>Nervous System. Euphoria, dysphoria, weakness, headache, agitation,
tremor, uncoordinated muscle movements, severe convulsions, transient hallucinations
and disorientation, visual disturbances. Inadvertent injection about a
nerve trunk may result in sensory-motor paralysis which is usually, though
not always, transitory. </p>

<p>Gastrointestinal. Dry mouth, constipation, biliary tract spasm. </p>

<p>Cardiovascular. Flushing of the face, tachycardia, bradycardia, palpitation,
hypotension (see Warnings), syncope, phlebitis following intravenous injection.
</p>

<p>Genitourinary. Urinary retention. </p>

<p>Allergic. Pruritus, urticaria, other skin rashes, wheal and flare over
the vein with intravenous injection. </p>

<p>Other. Pain at injection site; local tissue irritation and induration
following subcutaneous injection, particularly when repeated; antidiuretic
effect. </p>

<p>DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE </p>

<p>Meperidine can produce drug dependence of the morphine type and therefore
has the potential for being abused. Psychic dependence, physical dependence,
and tolerance may develop upon repeated administration of meperidine, and
it should be prescribed and administered with the same degree of caution
appropriate to the use of morphine. Like other narcotics, meperidine is
subject to the provisions of the Federal narcotic laws. (See Also WARNINGS)
</p>

<p><a name="OVERDOSAGE"></a><b>OVERDOSAGE </b></p>

<p>Symptoms. Serious overdosage with meperidine is characterized by respiratory
depression (a decrease in respiratory rate and/or tidal volume, Cheyne-Stokes
respiration, cyanosis), extreme somnolence progressing to stupor or coma,
skeletal muscle flaccidity, cold and clammy skin, and sometimes bradycardia
and hypotension. In severe overdosage, particularly by the intravenous
route, apnea, circulatory collapse, cardiac arrest, and death may occur.
</p>

<p>Treatment. Primary attention should be given to the reestablishment
of adequate respiratory exchange through provision of a patent airway and
institution of assisted or controlled ventilation. The narcotic antagonist,
naloxone hydrochloride, is a specific antidote against respiratory depression
which may result from overdosage or unusual sensitivity to narcotics, including
meperidine. Therefore, an appropriate dose of this antagonist should be
administered, preferably by the intravenous route, simultaneously with
efforts at respiratory resuscitation. </p>

<p>An antagonist should not be administered in the absence of clinically
significant respiratory or cardiovascular depression. </p>

<p>Oxygen, intravenous fluids, vasopressors, and other supportive measures
should be employed as indicated. </p>

<p>In cases of overdosage with Meperidine tablets, the stomach should be
evacuated by emesis or gastric lavage. </p>

<p>NOTE: In an individual physically dependent on narcotics, the administration
of the usual dose of a narcotic antagonist will precipitate an acute withdrawal
syndrome. The severity of this syndrome will depend on the degree of physical
dependence and the dose of antagonist administered. The use of narcotic
antagonists in such individuals should be avoided if possible. If a narcotic
antagonist must be used to treat serious respiratory depression in the
physically dependent patient, the antagonist should be administered with
extreme care and only one-fifth to one-tenth the usual initial dose administered.
</p>

<p><a name="DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION"></a><b>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
</b></p>

<p>FOR RELIEF OF PAIN </p>

<p>Dosage should be adjusted according to the severity of the pain and
the response of the patient. While subcutaneous administration is suitable
for occasional use, intramuscular administration is preferred when repeated
doses are required. If intravenous administration is required, dosage should
be decreased and the injection made very slowly, preferably utilizing a
diluted solution. Meperidine is less effective orally than on parenteral
administration. The dose of </p>

<p>Meperidine should be proportionately reduced (usually by 25 to 50 percent)
when administered concomitantly with phenothiazines and many other tranquilizers
since they potentiate the action of Meperidine. </p>

<p>Adults. The usual dosage is 50 mg to 150 mg intramuscularly, subcutaneously,
or orally, every 3 or 4 hours as necessary. </p>

<p>Children. The usual dosage is 0.5 mg/lb to 0.8 mg/lb intramuscularly,
subcutaneously, or orally up to the adult dose, every 3 or 4 hours as necessary.
Each dose of the syrup should be taken in one- half glass of water, since
if taken undiluted, it may exert a slight topical anesthetic effect on
mucous membranes. </p>

<p>FOR PREOPERATIVE MEDICATION </p>

<p>Adults. The usual dosage is 50 mg to 100 mg intramuscularly or subcutaneously,
30 to 90 minutes before the beginning of anesthesia. </p>

<p>Children. The usual dosage is 0.5 mg/lb to 1 mg/lb intramuscularly or
subcutaneously up to the adult dose, 30 to 90 minutes before the beginning
of anesthesia. </p>

<p>FOR SUPPORT OF ANESTHESIA </p>

<p>Repeated slow intravenous injections of fractional doses (eg, 10 mg/mL)
or continuous intravenous infusion of a more dilute solution (eg, 1 mg/mL)
should be used. The dose should be titrated to the needs of the patient
and will depend on the premedication and type of anesthesia being employed,
the characteristics of the particular patient, and the nature and duration
of the operative procedure. </p>

<p>FOR OBSTETRICAL ANALGESIA </p>

<p>The usual dosage is 50 mg to 100 mg intramuscularly or subcutaneously
when pain becomes regular, and may be repeated at 1- to 3-hour intervals.

<p>
<hr width="100%" ></p>

<p><a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><b>DESCRIPTION </b></p>

<p>Cetirizine hydrochloride, is an orally active and selective H1-receptor
antagonist. Cetirizine hydrochloride is a racemic compound with an empirical
formula of &nbsp;C<sub>21</sub>H<sub>25</sub>ClN<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>*2HCl.
The molecular weight is 461.82. Cetirizine hydrochloride is a white, crystalline
powder and is water soluble.</p>

<p><a name="ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY"></a><b> ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
</b></p>

<p>Mechanism of Actions: Cetirizine, a human metabolite of hydroxyzine,
is an antihistamine; its principal effects are mediated via selective inhibition
of peripheral H1 receptors. The antihistaminic activity of cetirizine has
been clearly documented in a variety of animal and human models. In vivo
and ex vivo animal models have shown negligible anticholinergic and antiserotonergic
activity. In clinical studies, however, dry mouth was more common with
cetirizine than with placebo. In vitro receptor binding studies have shown
no measurable affinity for other than H1 receptors. Autoradiographic studies
with radiolabeled cetirizine in the rat have shown negligible penetration
into the brain. Ex vivo experiments in the mouse have shown that systemically
administered cetirizine does not significantly occupy cerebral H1 receptors.</p>

<p>Pharmacokinetics: Cetirizine is rapidly absorbed after oral administration
of a tablet, which had bioavailability similar to an oral solution. Food
had no effect on the extent of cetirizine absorption, but Tmax was delayed
by 1.7 hours and Cmax was decreased by 23% in the presence of food. A mass
balance study in 6 healthy male volunteers indicated that 70% of the administered
radioactive dose was recovered in the urine and 10% in the feces, for a
combined total recovery of about 80%. Approximately 50% of the administered
radioactive dose was excreted in urine as unchanged drug. Most of the rapid
increase in peak plasma radioactivity is associated with parent drug indicating
low first pass metabolism. Cetirizine is metabolized to a very limited
extent by oxidative O-dealkylation to a metabolite with negligible antihistaminic
activity.</p>

<p>Cetirizine exhibits linear kinetics over the dosage range of 5 to 60
mg. In pharmacokinetic studies in 146 healthy volunteers, the mean  SD
terminal half-life was 8.3  1.8 hours, oral clearance was 54  13 mL/min,
and the apparent volume of distribution was 0.50 0.08 L/kg. No accumulation
was observed for cetirizine following daily doses of 10 mg for 10 days.
The steady-state maximum plasma concentration was 311  40 ng/mL and was
achieved within 1.0  0.5 hour. Individual histograms of cetirizine Cmax
and AUC showed unimodal distributions with a two- to four-fold variability
in healthy subjects. Plasma protein binding of cetirizine is 93  0.3%
and is independent of concentration in the range of 0.025 to 1.0 mcg/mL;
this concentration range covers the therapeutic plasma levels.</p>

<p>Formal pharmacokinetic interaction studies were conducted with cetirizine
and pseudoephedrine, antipyrine, ketoconazole, erythromycin, and azithromycin.
No pharmacokinetic interactions were observed. In a multiple dose study
of theophylline (400 mg once daily) and cetirizine, there was a small (16%)
decrease in clearance of cetirizine.</p>

<p>Special Populations </p>

<p>Effect of Age: Following a single 10 mg oral dose, half-life increased
by about 50% and clearance decreased by 40% in 16 elderly subjects as compared
to the 14 normal subjects. The decrease in cetirizine clearance in these
elderly volunteers appeared to be related to their decreased renal function.</p>

<p>Effect of Gender: The effect of gender on cetirizine pharmacokinetics
has not been adequately studied.</p>

<p>Effect of Race: No race-related differences were observed in the kinetics
of cetirizine between 86 white adult males and 11 black adult males.</p>

<p>Renally Impaired Patients: The kinetics of cetirizine were studied following
multiple oral daily doses of 10 mg for 7 days in 7 normal volunteers (creatinine
clearance 89-128 mL/min), 8 patients with mild renal function impairment
(creatinine clearance 42-77 mL/min) and 7 patients with moderate renal
function impairment (creatinine clearance 11-31 mL/min). The pharmacokinetics
of the drug were similar in patients with mild impairment and normal volunteers.
Moderately renally impaired patients had a 3-fold increase in half-life
and 70% decrease in clearance compared to normal volunteers.</p>

<p>Patients (N=5) on hemodialysis (creatinine clearance less than 7 mL/min)
given a single oral 10 mg dose of cetirizine had a 3-fold increase in half-life
and a 70% decrease in clearance compared to normals. Cetirizine was not
completely cleared by hemodialysis as less than 10% of the administered
dose was removed during the dialysis session.</p>

<p>Dosing adjustment is necessary in patients with moderate or severe renal
impairment and patients on dialysis. (See also DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION.)</p>

<p>Hepatically Impaired Patients: Sixteen patients with chronic liver diseases
(hepatocellular, cholestatic, and biliary cirrhosis), given 10 or 20 mg
of cetirizine as a single oral dose had a 50% increase in half-life along
with a 40% decrease in clearance compared to 16 healthy subjects.</p>

<p>Dosing adjustment may be necessary in hepatically impaired patients.
(See also DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION.)</p>

<p>Pharmacodynamics: Studies in normal volunteers show that Certrizine
at doses of 5 and 10 mg strongly inhibits the skin wheal and flare caused
by the intradermal injection of histamine. The onset of this activity after
a single 10 mg dose occurs within 20 minutes in 50% of subjects and within
one hour in 95% of subjects; this activity persists for at least 24 hours.
In a 35-day study in children ages 5 to 12, no tolerance to the antihistaminic
(suppression of wheal and flare response) effects of Certrizine was found.
The effects of intradermal injection of various other mediators or histamine
releasers are also inhibited by cetirizine, as is response to a cold challenge
in patients with cold-induced urticaria. In mildly asthmatic subjects,
Certrizine at 5 to 20 mg blocked bronchoconstriction due to nebulized histamine,
with virtually total blockade after a 20 mg dose. In studies conducted
for up to 12 hours following cutaneous antigen challenge, the late phase
recruitment of eosinophils, neutrophils and basophils, components of the
allergic inflammatory response, was inhibited by Certrizine at a dose of
20 mg.</p>

<p>In four clinical studies in healthy adult males, no clinically significant
mean increases in QTc were observed in Certrizine treated subjects. In
the first study, a placebo-controlled crossover trial, Certrizine was given
at doses up to 60 mg per day, 6 times the maximum clinical dose, for 1
week, and no significant mean QTc prolongation occurred. In the second
study, a crossover trial, Certrizine 20 mg and erythromycin (500 mg every
8 hours) were given alone and in combination. There was no significant
effect on QTc with the combination or with Certrizine alone. In the third
trial, also a crossover study, Certrizine 20 mg and ketoconazole (400 mg
per day) were given alone and in combination. Certrizine caused a mean
increase in QTc of 9.1 msec from baseline after 10 days of therapy. Ketoconazole
also increased QTc by 8.3 msec. The combination caused an increase of 17.4
msec, equal to the sum of the individual effects. Thus, there was no significant
drug interaction on QTc with the combination of Certrizine and ketoconazole.
In the fourth study, a placebo-controlled parallel trial, Certrizine 20
mg was given alone or in combination with azithromycin (500 mg as a single
dose on the first day followed by 250 mg once daily). There was no significant
increase in QTc with Certrizine 20 mg alone or in combination with azithromycin.
</p>

<p>In a six-week, placebo-controlled study of 186 patients with allergic
rhinitis and mild to moderate asthma, Certrizine 10 mg once daily improved
rhinitis symptoms and did not alter pulmonary function. This study supports
the safety of administering Certrizine to allergic rhinitis patients with
mild to moderate asthma.</p>

<p>Clinical Studies: Nine multicenter, randomized, double-blind, clinical
trials comparing cetirizine 5 to 20 mg to placebo in patients with seasonal
or perennial allergic rhinitis were conducted in the United States. Five
of these showed significant reductions in symptoms of allergic rhinitis,
3 in seasonal allergic rhinitis (1 to 4 weeks in duration) and 2 in perennial
allergic rhinitis for up to 8 weeks in duration. Two 4-week multicenter,
randomized, double-blind, clinical trials comparing cetirizine 5 to 20
mg to placebo in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria were also conducted
and showed significant improvement in symptoms of chronic idiopathic urticaria.
In general, the 10 mg dose was more effective than the 5 mg dose and the
20 mg dose gave no added effect. Some of these trials included pediatric
patients age 12 to 16 years.</p>

<p><a name="INDICATIONS AND USAGE"></a><b>INDICATIONS AND USAGE </b></p>

<p>Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis: Certrizine is indicated for the relief of
symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rhinitis due to allergens such
as ragweed, grass and tree pollens in adults and children 6 years of age
and older. Symptoms treated effectively include sneezing, rhinorrhea, nasal
pruritus, ocular pruritus, tearing and redness of the eyes.</p>

<p>Perennial Allergic Rhinitis: Certrizine is indicated for the relief
of symptoms associated with perennial allergic rhinitis due to allergens
such as dust mites, animal dander and molds in adults and children 6 years
of age and older. Symptoms treated effectively include sneezing, rhinorrhea,
post-nasal discharge, nasal pruritus, ocular pruritus and tearing.</p>

<p>Chronic Urticaria: Certrizine is indicated for the treatment of the
uncomplicated skin manifestations of chronic idiopathic urticaria in adults
and children 6 years of age and older. It significantly reduces the occurrence,
severity and duration of hives and significantly reduces pruritus.</p>

<p><a name="CONTRAINDICATIONS"></a><b>CONTRAINDICATIONS </b></p>

<p>Certrizine is contraindicated in those patients with a known hypersensitivity
to it or any of its ingredients or hydroxyzine.</p>

<p><a name="PRECAUTIONS"></a><b>PRECAUTIONS </b></p>

<p>Activities Requiring Mental Alertness: In clinical trials, the occurrence
of somnolence has been reported in some patients taking Certrizine; due
caution should therefore be exercised when driving a car or operating potentially
dangerous machinery. Concurrent use of Certrizine with alcohol or other
CNS depressants should be avoided because additional reductions in alertness
and additional impairment of CNS performance may occur.</p>

<p>Drug-drug Interactions: No clinically significant drug interactions
have been found with theophylline at a low dose, azithromycin, pseudoephedrine,
ketoconazole, or erythromycin. There was a small decrease in the clearance
of cetirizine caused by a 400 mg dose of theophylline; it is possible that
larger theophylline doses could have a greater effect.</p>

<p>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis and Impairment of Fertility: No evidence
of carcinogenicity was observed in a 2-year carcinogenicity study in rats
at dietary doses up to 20 mg/kg/day (15 times the maximum recommended human
dose on a mg/m2/day basis). An increased incidence of benign liver tumors
was found in a 2-year carcinogenicity study in male mice at a dietary dose
of 16 mg/kg/day (6 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m2/day
basis). The clinical significance of these findings during long-term use
of Certrizine is not known. Cetirizine was not mutagenic in the Ames test,
and not clastogenic in the human lymphocyte assay, the mouse lymphoma assay,
and the in vivo micronucleus test in rats. No impairment of fertility was
found in a fertility and general reproductive performance study in mice
at a dose of 64 mg/kg/day (26 times the maximum recommended human dose
on a mg/m2/day basis).</p>

<p>Pregnancy Category B: Cetirizine was not teratogenic in mice, rats and
rabbits at doses up to 96, 225, and 135 mg/kg/day (40, 180, and 216 times
the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m2/day basis), respectively.
There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because
animal studies are not always predictive of human response, Certrizine
should be used in pregnancy only if clearly needed.</p>

<p>Nursing Mothers: Retarded pup weight gain was found in mice during lactation
when dams were given cetirizine at 96 mg/kg/day (40 times the maximum recommended
human dose on a mg/m2/day basis). Studies in beagle dogs indicate that
approximately 3% of the dose is excreted in breast milk. Cetirizine has
been reported to be excreted in human breast milk; use of Certrizine in
nursing mothers is not recommended.</p>

<p>Geriatric Use: In placebo-controlled trials, 186 patients age 65 to
94 years received doses of 5 to 20 mg of Certrizine per day. Adverse events
were similar in this group to patients under age 65. Subset analysis of
efficacy in this group was not done. </p>

<p>Pediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness in children under 6 years of
age has not been established.</p>

<p><a name="ADVERSE REACTIONS"></a><b>ADVERSE REACTIONS </b></p>

<p>Controlled and uncontrolled clinical trials conducted in the United
States and Canada included more than 6000 patients, with more than 3900
receiving Certrizine at doses of 5 to 20 mg per day. The duration of treatment
ranged from 1 week to 6 months, with a mean exposure of 30 days.</p>

<p>Most adverse reactions reported during therapy with Certrizine were
mild or moderate. In placebo-controlled trials, the incidence of discontinuations
due to adverse reactions in patients receiving Certrizine 5 mg or 10 mg
was not significantly different from placebo (2.9% vs. 2.4%, respectively).</p>

<p>The most common adverse reaction that occurred more frequently on cetirizine
than placebo was somnolence. The incidence of somnolence associated with
Certrizine was dose related, 6% in placebo, 11% at 5 mg and 14% at 10 mg.
Discontinuations due to somnolence for Certrizine were uncommon (1.0% on
Certrizine vs. 0.6% on placebo). Fatigue and dry mouth also appeared to
be treatment-related adverse reactions. There were no differences by age,
race, gender or by body weight with regard to the incidence of adverse
reactions.</p>

<p>Table 1 lists adverse experiences which were reported for Certrizine
5 and 10 mg in controlled clinical trials in the United States and that
were more common with Certrizine than placebo.</p>

<p>In addition, headache and nausea occurred in more than 2% of the patients,
but were more common in placebo patients.</p>

<p>The following events were observed infrequently (less than 2%), in 3982
patients who received Certrizine in U.S. trials, including an open study
of six months duration; a causal relationship with Certrizine administration
has not been established.</p>

<p>DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE </p>

<p>There is no information to indicate that abuse or dependency occurs
with Certrizine.</p>

<p><a name="OVERDOSAGE"></a><b>OVERDOSAGE </b></p>

<p>Overdosage has been reported with Certrizine. In one patient who took
150 mg of Certrizine, the patient was somnolent but did not display any
other clinical signs or abnormal blood chemistry or hematology results.
Should overdose occur, treatment should be symptomatic or supportive, taking
into account any concomitantly ingested medications. There is no known
specific antidote to Certrizine. Certrizine is not effectively removed
by dialysis, and dialysis will be ineffective unless a dialyzable agent
has been concomitantly ingested. The minimal lethal oral dose in rodents
is approximately 100 times the maximum recommended clinical dose on a mg/m2
basis and the liver is the target organ of toxicity.</p>

<p><a name="DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION"></a><b>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
</b></p>

<p>The recommended initial dose of Certrizine is 5 or 10 mg per day in
adults and children 12 years and older, depending on symptom severity. {As of 
October 1996, indicated in children 6-11 years of age.  Syrup now available. See full prescribing information for details} 
Most patients in clinical trials started at 10 mg. Certrizine is given
as a single daily dose, with or without food. The time of administration
may be varied to suit individual patient needs. </p>

<p>In patients with decreased renal function (creatinine clearance 11-31
mL/min), patients on hemodialysis (creatinine clearance less than 7 mL/min),
and in hepatically impaired patients, a dose of 5 mg once daily is recommended.

<hr width="100%" ></p>

<p><a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><b>DESCRIPTION </b></p>

<p>Temazepam is a benzodiazepine hypnotic agent. The chemical name is 7-chloro-1,3-dihydro-3-hydroxy-1-methyl-5-phenyl-
2H-1,4-benzodiazepin-2 one. </p>

<p>C16H13ClN2O2: Mol. wt. 300.74 </p>

<p>Temazepam is a white, crystalline substance, very slightly soluble in
water and sparingly soluble in alcohol USP. </p>

<p><a name="ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY"></a><b>ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
</b></p>

<p>In a single and a multiple dose absorption, distribution, metabolism,
and excretion (ADME) study using 3H-labeled drug, Temazepam was well absorbed
and found to have minimal (8%) first pass metabolism. There were no active
metabolites formed and the only significant metabolite present in blood
was the O-conjugate. The unchanged drug was 96% bound to plasma proteins.
The blood level decline of the parent drug was biphasic with the short
half-life ranging from 0.4-0.6 hours and the terminal half-life from 3.5-18.4
hours (mean: 8.8 hours), depending on the study population and method of
determination. Metabolites were formed with a half-life of 10 hours and
excreted with a half- life of approximately 2 hours. Thus, formation of
the major metabolite is the rate limiting step in the biodisposition of
temazepam. There is no accumulation of metabolites. A dose-proportional
relationship has been established for the area under the plasma concentration/time
curve over the 15-30 mg dose range. </p>

<p>Temazepam was completely metabolized prior to excretion; 80%-90% of
the dose appeared in the urine. The major metabolite was the O-conjugate
of temazepam (90%); the O-conjugate of N-demethyl temazepam was a minor
metabolite (7%). </p>

<p><a name="INDICATIONS AND USAGE"></a><b>INDICATIONS AND USAGE </b></p>

<p>Temazepam is indicated for the short-term treatment ofinsomnia (generally
7-10 days). For patients in whom the drug is used for more than 2-3 weeks,
periodic reevaluation is recommended to determine whether there is a continuing
need. (See WARNINGS) </p>

<p>For patients with short-term insomnia, instructions in the prescription
should indicate that Temazepam should be used for short periods of time
(7-10 days). </p>

<p>Since insomnia is often transient and intermittent, the prolonged administration
of Temazepam is generally not necessary or recommended. Temazepam has been
employed for sleep maintenance for up to 35 consecutive nights of drug
administration in sleep laboratory studies. </p>

<p>Since insomnia may be a symptom of several other disorders, the possibility
that the complaint may be related to a condition for which there is more
specific treatment should be considered. </p>

<p><a name="CONTRAINDICATIONS"></a><b>CONTRAINDICATIONS </b></p>

<p>Benzodiazepines may cause fetal damage when administered during pregnancy.
An increased risk of congenital malformations associated with the use of
diazepam and chlordiazepoxide during the first trimester of pregnancy has
been suggested in several studies. Transplacental distribution has resulted
in neonatal CNS depression following the ingestion of therapeutic doses
of a benzodiazepine hypnotic during the last weeks of pregnancy. </p>

<p>Reproduction studies in animals with temazepam were performed in rats
and rabbits. In a perinatal-postnatal study in rats, oral doses of 60 mg/kg/day
resulted in increasing nursling mortality. Teratology studies in rats demonstrated
increased fetal resorptions at doses of 30 and 120 mg/kg in one study and
increased occurrence of rudimentary ribs, which are considered skeletal
variants, in a second study at doses of 240 mg/kg or higher. In rabbits,
occasional abnormalities such as exencephaly and fusion or asymmetry of
ribs were reported without dose relationship. Although these abnormalities
were not found in the concurrent control group, they have been reported
to occur randomly in historical controls. At doses of 40 mg/kg or higher,
there was an increased incidence of the 13th rib variant when compared
to the incidence in concurrent and historical controls. </p>

<p>Temazepam is contraindicated in pregnant women. If there is a likelihood
of the patient becoming pregnant while receiving temazepam, she should
be warned of the potential risk to the fetus. Patients should be instructed
to discontinue the drug prior to becoming pregnant. The possibility that
a woman of childbearing potential may be pregnant at the time of institution
of therapy should be considered. </p>

<p><a name="WARNINGS"></a><b>WARNINGS </b></p>

<p>Patients receiving Temazepam should be cautioned about possible combined
effects with alcohol and other CNS depressants. </p>

<p>Withdrawal symptoms (of the barbiturate type) have occurred after the
abrupt discontinuation of benzodiazepines. (See DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE)
</p>

<p><a name="PRECAUTIONS"></a><b>PRECAUTIONS </b></p>

<p>GENERAL </p>

<p>Since the risk of the development of oversedation, dizziness, confusion,
and/or ataxia increases substantially with larger doses of benzodiazepines
in elderly and debilitated patients, 15 mg of Temazepam is recommended
as the initial dosage for such patients. </p>

<p>Temazepam should be administered with caution in severely depressed
patients or those in whom there is any evidence of latent depression; it
should be recognized that suicidal tendencies may be present and protective
measures may be necessary. </p>

<p>The usual precautions should be observed in patients with impaired renal
or hepatic function and in patients with chronic pulmonary insufficiency.
</p>

<p>If Temazepam is to be combined with other drugs having known hypnotic
properties or CNS-depressant effects, consideration should be given to
potential additive effects. </p>

<p>The possibility of a synergistic effect exists with the co-administration
of Temazepam and diphenhydramine. One case of stillbirth at term has been
reported 8 hours after a pregnant patient received Temazepam and diphenhydramine.
A cause and effect relationship has not yet been determined. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS)
</p>

<p>INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS </p>

<p>Patients receiving Temazepam should be cautioned about possible combined
effects with alcohol and other CNS depressants. Patients should be cautioned
not to operate machinery or drive a motor vehicle after ingesting the drug.
</p>

<p>Patients should also be advised that, because benzodiazepines may produce
psychological and physical dependence, they should consult with their physician
before increasing the dose. In addition, they should be cautioned that
a temporary disturbance of nocturnal sleep and other symptoms may result
from discontinuation of the drug. Patients taking 30 mg or more for more
than a few nights should be advised not to abruptly discontinue this drug
without first consulting with their physician. </p>

<p>LABORATORY TESTS </p>

<p>The usual precautions should be observed in patients with impaired renal
or hepatic function and in patients with chronic pulmonary insufficiency.
Abnormal liver function tests as well as blood dyscrasias have been reported
with benzodiazepines. </p>

<p>CARCINOGENESIS, IMPAIRMENT OF FERTILITY </p>

<p>No carcinogenic potential was demonstrated in long-term studies in mice
and rats. Fertility in male and female rats was not adversely affected
by Temazepam. </p>

<p>PREGNANCY </p>

<p>Pregnancy Category X. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS) </p>

<p>NURSING MOTHERS </p>

<p>It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because
many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when
Temazepam is administered to a nursing woman. </p>

<p>PEDIATRIC USE </p>

<p>Safety and effectiveness in children below the age of 18 years have
not been established. </p>

<p><a name="DRUG INTERACTIONS"></a><b>DRUG INTERACTIONS </b></p>

<p>Patients receiving Temazepam should be cautioned about possible combined
effects with alcohol and other CNS depressants. </p>

<p>The usual precautions should be observed in patients with impaired renal
or hepatic function and in patients with chronic pulmonary insufficiency.
</p>

<p>If Temazepam is to be combined with other drugs having known hypnotic
properties or CNS-depressant effects, consideration should be given to
potential additive effects. </p>

<p>The possibility of a synergistic effect exists with the co-administration
of Temazepam and diphenhydramine. One case of stillbirth at term has been
reported 8 hours after a pregnant patient received Temazepam and diphenhydramine.
A cause and effect relationship has not yet been determined. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS)
</p>

<p>(See Also WARNINGS And PRECAUTIONS) </p>

<p><a name="ADVERSE REACTIONS"></a><b>ADVERSE REACTIONS </b></p>

<p>During clinical studies in which 795 patients received Temazepam , the
drug was well tolerated. Side effects were usually mild and transient.
These 795 patients included 175 subjects who received Temazepam during
daytime waking hours, sometimes in excess of recommended therapeutic dosage,
in studies to evaluate dosage levels for safety and pharmacokinetic profiles.
</p>

<p>The most common adverse reactions were drowsiness (17%), dizziness (7%),
and lethargy (5%). </p>

<p>Other side effects include confusion, euphoria, and relaxed feeling
(2%-3%). Less commonly reported were weakness, anorexia, and diarrhea (1%-2%).
Rarely reported were tremor, ataxia, lack of concentration, loss of equilibrium,
falling, and palpitations (less than 1%). </p>

<p>Hallucinations, horizontal nystagmus, and paradoxical reactions, including
excitement, stimulation, and hyperactivity were rare (less than 0.5%).
</p>

<p>DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE </p>

<p>CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE </p>

<p>Temazepam is a controlled substance in Schedule IV. </p>

<p>ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE </p>

<p>Withdrawal symptoms, similar in character to those noted with barbiturates
and alcohol (convulsions, tremor, abdominal, and muscle cramps, vomiting,
and sweating), have occurred following abrupt discontinuance of benzodiazepines.
The more severe withdrawal symptoms have usually been limited to those
patients who received excessive doses over an extended period of time.
Generally milder withdrawal symptoms (e.g., dysphoria and insomnia) have
been reported following abrupt discontinuance of benzodiazepines taken
continuously at therapeutic levels for several months. Consequently, after
extended therapy at doses higher than 15 mg, abrupt discontinuation should
generally be avoided and a gradual dosage tapering schedule followed. As
with any hypnotic, caution must be exercised in administering Temazepam
to individuals known to be addiction-prone or to those whose history suggests
they may increase the dosage on their own initiative. It is desirable to
limit repeated prescriptions without adequate medical supervision. </p>

<p><a name="OVERDOSAGE"></a><b>OVERDOSAGE </b></p>

<p>Manifestations of acute overdosage of Temazepam can be expected to reflect
the CNS effects of the drug and include somnolence, confusion, and coma,
with reduced or absent reflexes, respiratory depression, and hypotension.
If the patient is conscious, vomiting should be induced mechanically or
with emetics. Gastric lavage should be employed utilizing concurrently
a cuffed endotracheal tube if the patient is unconscious to prevent aspiration
and pulmonary complications. Maintenance of adequate pulmonary ventilation
is essential. The use of pressor agents intravenously may be necessary
to combat hypotension. Fluids should be administered intravenously to encourage
diuresis. The value of dialysis has not been determined. If excitation
occurs, barbiturates should not be used. It should be borne in mind that
multiple agents may have been ingested. </p>

<p>The oral LD50 was 1963 mg/kg in mice, 1833 mg/kg in rats, and &gt;2400
mg/kg in rabbits. </p>

<p><a name="DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION"></a><b>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
</b></p>

<p>The recommended usual adult dose is 30 mg before retiring. In some patients,
15 mg may be sufficient. As with all medications, dosage should be individualized
for maximal beneficial effects. In elderly and/or debilitated patients
it is recommended that therapy be initiated with 15 mg until individual
responses are determined. </p>

<p>
<hr width="100%" ></p>

<p><a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><b>DESCRIPTION </b></p>

<p>Famotidine is a histamine H2-receptor antagonist. Famotidine is N'-(aminosulfonyl)-3-(((2-((diaminomethylene)amino)-4
thiazolyl)methyl)thio)propanimidamide. The empirical formula of famotidine
is C8H15N7O2S3 and its molecular weight is 337.43. </p>

<p>Famotidine is a white to pale yellow crystalline compound that is freely
soluble in glacial acetic acid, slightly soluble in methanol, very slightly
soluble in water, and practically insoluble in ethanol. </p>

<p><a name="ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY"></a><b>ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
</b></p>

<p>GI Effects </p>

<p>Famotidine is a competitive inhibitor of histamine H2-receptors. The
primary clinically important pharmacologic activity of Famotidine is inhibition
of gastric secretion. Both the acid concentration and volume of gastric
secretion are suppressed by Famotidine, while changes in pepsin secretion
are proportional to volume output. </p>

<p>In normal volunteers and hypersecretors, Famotidine inhibited basal
and nocturnal gastric secretion, as well as secretion stimulated by food
and pentagastrin. After oral administration, the onset of the antisecretory
effect occurred within one hour; the maximum effect was dose-dependent,
occurring within one to three hours. Duration of inhibition of secretion
by doses of 20 and 40 mg was 10 to 12 hours. </p>

<p>After intravenous administration, the maximum effect was achieved within
30 minutes. Single intravenous doses of 10 and 20 mg inhibited nocturnal
secretion for a period of 10 to 12 hours. The 20 mg dose was associated
with the longest duration of action in most subjects. </p>

<p>Single evening oral doses of 20 and 40 mg inhibited basal and nocturnal
acid secretion in all subjects; mean nocturnal gastric acid secretion was
inhibited by 86% and 94%, respectively, for a period of at least 10 hours.
The same doses given in the morning suppressed food-stimulated acid secretion
in all subjects. The mean suppression was 76% and 84% respectively 3 to
5 hours after administration, and 25% and 30% respectively 8 to 10 hours
after administration. In some subjects who received the 20 mg dose, however,
the antisecretory effect was dissipated within 6-8 hours. There was no
cumulative effect with repeated doses. The nocturnal intragastric pH was
raised by evening doses of 20 and 40 mg of Famotidine to mean values of
5.0 and 6.4, respectively. When Famotidine was given after breakfast, the
basal daytime interdigestive pH at 3 and 8 hours after 20 or 40 mg of Famotidine
was raised to about 5. </p>

<p>Famotidine had little or no effect on fasting or postprandial serum
gastrin levels. Gastric emptying and exocrine pancreatic function were
not affected by Famotidine. </p>

<p>Other Effects </p>

<p>Systemic effects of Famotidine in the CNS, cardiovascular, respiratory
or endocrine systems were not noted in clinical pharmacology studies. Also,
no antiandrogenic effects were noted. (See ADVERSE REACTIONS.) Serum hormone
levels, including prolactin, cortisol, thyroxine (T4), and testosterone,
were not altered after treatment with Famotidine. </p>

<p>Pharmacokinetics </p>

<p>Famotidine is incompletely absorbed. The bioavailability of oral doses
is 40-45%. Famotidine Tablets and Famotidine Oral Suspension are bioequivalent.
Bioavailability may be slightly increased by food, or slightly decreased
by antacids; however, these effects are of no clinical consequence. Famotidine
undergoes minimal first pass metabolism. After oral doses, peak plasma
levels occur in 1-3 hours. Plasma levels after multiple doses are similar
to those after single doses. Fifteen to 20% of Famotidine in plasma is
protein bound. Famotidine has an elimination half-life of 2.5-3.5 hours.
Famotidine is eliminated by renal (65-70%) and metabolic (30-35%) routes.
Renal clearance is 250-450 mL/min, indicating some tubular excretion. Twenty-five
to 30% of an oral dose and 65-70% of an intravenous dose are recovered
in the urine as unchanged compound. The only metabolite identified in man
is the S-oxide. </p>

<p>There is a close relationship between creatinine clearance values and
the elimination half-life of Famotidine. In patients with severe renal
insufficiency, i.e., creatinine clearance less than 10 mL/min, Famotidine
elimination half-life may exceed 20 hours and adjustment of dose or dosing
intervals may be necessary (see PRECAUTIONS, DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).
</p>

<p>In elderly patients, there are no clinically significant age-related
changes in the pharmacokinetics of Famotidine. </p>

<p>Clinical Studies </p>

<p>Duodenal Ulcer </p>

<p>In a U.S. multicenter, double-blind study in outpatients with endoscopically
confirmed duodenal ulcer, orally administered Famotidine was compared to
placebo. As shown in Table 1, 70% of patients treated with Famotidine 40
mg h.s. were healed by week 4. </p>

<p>*Statistically significantly different than placebo (p &lt; 0.001) Patients
not healed by week 4 were continued in the study. By week 8, 83% of patients
treated with Famotidine had healed versus 45% of patients treated with
placebo. The incidence of ulcer healing with Famotidine was significantly
higher than with placebo at each time point based on proportion of endoscopically
confirmed healed ulcers. </p>

<p>In this study, time to relief of daytime and nocturnal pain was significantly
shorter for patients receiving Famotidine than for patients receiving placebo;
patients receiving Famotidine also took less antacid than the patients
receiving placebo. </p>

<p>Long-Term Maintenance </p>

<p>Treatment Of Duodenal Ulcers </p>

<p>Famotidine, 20 mg p.o. h.s. was compared to placebo h.s. as maintenance
therapy in two double-blind, multicenter studies of patients with endoscopically
confirmed healed duodenal ulcers. In the U.S. study the observed ulcer
incidence within 12 months in patients treated with placebo was 2.4 times
greater than in the patients treated with Famotidine. The 89 patients treated
with Famotidine had a cumulative observed ulcer incidence of 23.4% compared
to an observed ulcer incidence of 56.6% in the 89 patients receiving placebo
(p&lt;0.01). These results were confirmed in an international study where
the cumulative observed ulcer incidence within 12 months in the 307 patients
treated with Famotidine was 35.7%, compared to an incidence of 75.5% in
the 325 patients treated with placebo (p&lt;0.01). </p>

<p>Gastric Ulcer </p>

<p>In both a U.S. and an international multicenter, double-blind study
in patients with endoscopically confirmed active benign gastric ulcer,
orally administered Famotidine, 40 mg h.s., was compared to placebo h.s.
Antacids were permitted during the studies, but consumption was not significantly
different between the Famotidine and placebo groups. As shown in Table
2, the incidence of ulcer healing (dropouts counted as unhealed) with Famotidine
was statistically significantly better than placebo at weeks 6 and 8 in
the U.S. study, and at weeks 4, 6 and 8 in the international study, based
on the number of ulcers that healed, confirmed by endoscopy. </p>

<p>Famotidine was compared to placebo in a U.S. study that enrolled patients
with symptoms of GERD and without endoscopic evidence of erosion or ulceration
of the esophagus. Famotidine 20 mg b.i.d. was statistically significantly
superior to 40 mg h.s. and to placebo in providing a successful symptomatic

<p>* p &lt; or = 0.05 vs Ranitidine 150 mg b.i.d. Pathological Hypersecretory
Conditions (e.g., Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome, Multiple Endocrine Adenomas)
</p>

<p>In studies of patients with pathological hypersecretory conditions such
as Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome with or without multiple endocrine adenomas,
Famotidine significantly inhibited gastric acid secretion and controlled
associated symptoms. Doses from 20 to 160 mg q 6 h maintained basal acid
secretion below 10 mEq/hr; initial doses were titrated to the individual
patient need and subsequent adjustments were necessary with time in some
patients. Famotidine was well tolerated at these high dose levels for prolonged
periods (greater than 12 months) in eight patients, and there were no cases
reported of gynecomastia, increased prolactin levels, or impotence which
were considered to be due to the drug. </p>

<p><a name="INDICATIONS AND USAGE"></a><b>INDICATIONS AND USAGE </b></p>

<p>Famotidine is indicated in: </p>

<p>1. Short Term Treatment Of Active Duodenal Ulcer. Most patients heal
within 4 weeks; there is rarely reason to use Famotidine at full dosage
for longer than 6 to 8 weeks. Studies have not assessed the safety of famotidine
in uncomplicated active duodenal ulcer for periods of more than eight weeks.
</p>

<p>2. Maintenance Therapy For Duodenal Ulcer Patients At Reduced Dosage
After Healing Of An Active Ulcer. Controlled studies have not extended
beyond one year. </p>

<p>3. Short Term Treatment Of Active Benign Gastric Ulcer. Most patients
heal within 6 weeks. Studies have not assessed the safety or efficacy of
famotidine in uncomplicated active benign gastric ulcer for periods of
more than 8 weeks. </p>

<p>4. Short Term Treatment Of Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD). Famotidine
is indicated for short term treatment of patients with symptoms of GERD
(see ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Clinical Studies). </p>

<p>Famotidine is also indicated for the short term treatment of esophagitis
due to GERD including erosive or ulcerative disease diagnosed by endoscopy
(see ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Clinical Studies). </p>

<p>5. Treatment Of Pathological Hypersecretory Conditions (e.g., Zollinger-Ellison
Syndrome, Multiple Endocrine Adenomas). </p>

<p>Famotidine I.V. is indicated in some hospitalized patients with pathological
hypersecretory conditions or intractable ulcers, or as an alternative to
the oral dosage forms for short-term use in patients who are unable to
take oral medication. </p>

<p><a name="CONTRAINDICATIONS"></a><b>CONTRAINDICATIONS </b></p>

<p>Hypersensitivity to any component of these products. </p>

<p><a name="PRECAUTIONS"></a><b>PRECAUTIONS </b></p>

<p>General Symptomatic response to therapy with Famotidine does not preclude
the presence of gastric malignancy. </p>

<p>Patients With Severe Renal Insufficiency </p>

<p>Longer intervals between doses or lower doses may need to be used in
patients with severe renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance &lt;10 mL/min)
to adjust for the longer elimination half-life of famotidine. (See CLINICAL
PHARMACOLOGY and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION.) However, currently, no drug-related
toxicity has been found with high plasma concentrations of famotidine.
</p>

<p>Information For Patients </p>

<p>The patient should be instructed to shake the oral suspension vigorously
for 5 10 seconds prior to each use. Unused constituted oral suspension
should be discarded after 30 days. </p>

<p>Drug Interactions </p>

<p>No drug interactions have been identified. Studies with famotidine in
man, in animal models, and In Vitro have shown no significant interference
with the disposition of compounds metabolized by the hepatic microsomal
enzymes, e.g., cytochrome P450 system. Compounds tested in man include
warfarin, theophylline, phenytoin, diazepam, aminopyrine and antipyrine.
Indocyanine green as an index of hepatic drug extraction has been tested
and no significant effects have been found. </p>

<p>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment Of Fertility </p>

<p>In a 106 week study in rats and a 92 week study in mice given oral doses
of up to 2000 mg/kg/day (approximately 2500 times the recommended human
dose for active duodenal ulcer), there was no evidence of carcinogenic
potential for Famotidine. </p>

<p>Famotidine was negative in the microbial mutagen test (Ames test) using
Salmonella Typhimurium and Escherichia Coli with or without rat liver enzyme
activation at concentrations up to 10,000 mcg/plate. In In Vivo studies
in mice with a micronucleus test and a chromosomal aberration test, no
evidence of a mutagenic effect was observed. </p>

<p>In studies with rats given oral doses of up to 2000 mg/kg/day or intravenous
doses of up to 200 mg/kg/day fertility and reproductive performance were
not affected. </p>

<p>Pregnancy </p>

<p>Pregnancy Category B </p>

<p>Reproductive studies have been performed in rats and rabbits at oral
doses of up to 2000 and 500 mg/kg/day respectively and in both species
at I.V. doses of up to 200 mg/kg/day, and have revealed no significant
evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to Famotidine.
While no direct fetotoxic effects have been observed, sporadic abortions
occurring only in mothers displaying marked decreased food intake were
seen in some rabbits at oral doses of 200 mg/kg/day (250 times the usual
human dose) or higher. There are, however, no adequate or well-controlled
studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproductive studies are not
always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy
only if clearly needed. </p>

<p>Nursing Mothers </p>

<p>Studies performed in lactating rats have shown that famotidine is secreted
into breast milk. Transient growth depression was observed in young rats
suckling from mothers treated with maternotoxic doses of at least 600 times
the usual human dose. It is not known whether this drug is secreted into
human milk. Because many drugs are secreted into human milk and because
of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from
Famotidine, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or
discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to
the mother. </p>

<p>Pediatric Use </p>

<p>Safety and effectiveness in children have not been established. </p>

<p>Use In Elderly Patients </p>

<p>No dosage adjustment is required based on age (see ACTIONS/CLINICAL
PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacokinetics). Dosage adjustment in the case of severe
renal impairment may be necessary. </p>

<p><a name="DRUG INTERACTIONS"></a><b>DRUG INTERACTIONS </b></p>

<p>No drug interactions have been identified. Studies with famotidine in
man, in animal models, and In Vitro have shown no significant interference
with the disposition of compounds metabolized by the hepatic microsomal
enzymes, e.g., cytochrome P450 system. Compounds tested in man include
warfarin, theophylline, phenytoin, diazepam, aminopyrine and antipyrine.

<p><a name="ADVERSE REACTIONS"></a><b>ADVERSE REACTIONS </b></p>

<p>The adverse reactions listed below have been reported during domestic
and international clinical trials in approximately 2500 patients. In those
controlled clinical trials in which Famotidine Tablets were compared to
placebo, the incidence of adverse experiences in the group which received
Famotidine Tablets 40 mg at bedtime, was similar to that in the placebo
group. </p>

<p>The following adverse reactions have been reported to occur in more
than 1% of patients on therapy with Famotidine in controlled clinical trials,
and may be causally related to the drug: headache (4.7%), dizziness (1.3%),
constipation (1.2%) and diarrhea (1.7%). </p>

<p>The following other adverse reactions have been reported infrequently
in clinical trials or since the drug was marketed. The relationship to
therapy with Famotidine has been unclear in many cases. Within each category
the adverse reactions are listed in order of decreasing severity: </p>

<p>Body As A Whole: fever, asthenia, fatigue </p>

<p>Cardiovascular: arrhythmia, AV block, palpitation </p>

<p>Gastrointestinal: cholestatic jaundice, liver enzyme abnormalities,
vomiting, nausea, abdominal discomfort, anorexia, dry mouth </p>

<p>Hematologic: rare cases of agranulocytosis, pancytopenia, leukopenia,
thrombocytopenia </p>

<p>Hypersensitivity: anaphylaxis, angioedema, orbital or facial edema,
urticaria, rash, conjunctival injection </p>

<p>Musculoskeletal: musculoskeletal pain, arthralgia </p>

<p>Nervous System/Psychiatric: grand mal seizure; psychic disturbances,
which were reversible in cases for which follow-up was obtained, including
hallucinations, confusion, agitation, depression, anxiety, decreased libido;
paresthesia; insomnia; somnolence </p>

<p>Respiratory: bronchospasm </p>

<p>Skin: alopecia, acne, pruritus, dry skin, flushing </p>

<p>Special Senses: tinnitus, taste disorder </p>

<p>Other: rare cases of impotence have been reported; however, in controlled
clinical trials, the incidence was not greater than that seen with placebo.
</p>

<p>The adverse reactions reported for Famotidine Tablets may also occur
with Famotidine Oral Suspension or Famotidine I.V. In addition, transient
irritation at the injection site has been observed with Famotidine I.V.
</p>

<p><a name="OVERDOSAGE"></a><b>OVERDOSAGE </b></p>

<p>There is no experience to date with deliberate overdosage. Doses of
up to 640 mg/day have been given to patients with pathological hypersecretory
conditions with no serious adverse effects. In the event of overdosage,
treatment should be symptomatic and supportive. Unabsorbed material should
be removed from the gastrointestinal tract, the patient should be monitored,
and supportive therapy should be employed. </p>

<p>The oral LD50 of famotidine in male and female rats and mice was greater
than 3000 mg/kg and the minimum lethal acute oral dose in dogs exceeded
2000 mg/kg. Famotidine did not produce overt effects at high oral doses
in mice, rats, cats and dogs, but induced significant anorexia and growth
depression in rabbits starting with 200 mg/kg/day orally. The intravenous
LD50 of famotidine for mice and rats ranged from 254-563 mg/kg and the
minimum lethal single I.V. dose in dogs was approximately 300 mg/kg. Signs
of acute intoxication in I.V. treated dogs were emesis, restlessness, pallor
of mucous membranes or redness of mouth and ears, hypotension, tachycardia
and collapse. </p>

<p><a name="DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION"></a><b>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
</b></p>

<p>Duodenal Ulcer </p>

<p>Acute Therapy: The recommended adult oral dosage for active duodenal
ulcer is 40 mg once a day at bedtime. Most patients heal within 4 weeks;
there is rarely reason to use Famotidine at full dosage for longer than
6 to 8 weeks. A regimen of 20 mg b.i.d. is also effective. </p>

<p>Maintenance Therapy: The recommended oral dose is 20 mg once a day at
bedtime. </p>

<p>Benign Gastric Ulcer </p>

<p>Acute Therapy: The recommended adult oral dosage for active benign gastric
ulcer is 40 mg once a day at bedtime. </p>

<p>Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) </p>

<p>The recommended oral dosage for treatment of patients with symptoms
of GERD is 20 mg b.i.d. for up to 6 weeks. The recommended oral dosage
for the treatment of patients with esophagitis including erosions and ulcerations
and accompanying symptoms due to GERD is 20 or 40 mg b.i.d. for up to 12
weeks (see ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Clinical Studies). </p>

<p>Pathological Hypersecretory Conditions (e.g., Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome,
Multiple Endocrine Adenomas) </p>

<p>The dosage of Famotidine in patients with pathological hypersecretory
conditions varies with the individual patient. The recommended adult oral
starting dose for pathological hypersecretory conditions is 20 mg q 6 h.
In some patients, a higher starting dose may be required. Doses should
be adjusted to individual patient needs and should continue as long as
clinically indicated. Doses up to 160 mg q 6 h have been administered to
some patients with severe Zollinger- Ellison Syndrome. </p>

<p>Intravenous Administration </p>

<p>In some hospitalized patients with pathological hypersecretory conditions
or intractable ulcers, or in patients who are unable to take oral medication,
Famotidine I.V. may be administered. The recommended dosage is 20 mg q
12 h. </p>

<p>The doses and regimen for parenteral administration in patients with
GERD have not been established. </p>

<p>Concomitant Use Of Antacids </p>

<p>Antacids may be given concomitantly if needed. </p>

<p>Dosage Adjustment For Patients With Severe Renal Insufficiency In patients
with severe renal insufficiency, i.e., with a creatinine clearance less
than 10 mL/min, the elimination half-life of Famotidine may exceed 20 hours,
reaching approximately 24 hours in anuric patients. Although no relationship
of adverse effects to high plasma levels has been established, to avoid
excess accumulation of the drug, the dose of Famotidine may be reduced
to 20 mg h.s. or the dosing interval may be prolonged to 36-48 hours as
indicated by the patient's clinical response. </p>

<p><a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><b>DESCRIPTION </b></p>

<p>Sumatriptan Injection is a selective 5- hydroxytryptamine1 receptor
subtype agonist. The active ingredient in Sumatriptan Injection is sumatriptan
(as the succinate), which is chemically designated as 3-(2-(dimethylamino)ethyl)-N-methyl-1H-indole-5-methanesulfonamide
butane-1,4- dioate(1:1). The empirical formula is C14H21N3O2S.C4H6O4, representing
a molecular weight of 413.5. </p>

<p>Sumatriptan succinate is a white to off-white powder that is readily
soluble in water and in saline. </p>

<p><a name="ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY"></a><b>ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
</b></p>

<p> MECHANISM OF ACTION: Sumatriptan has been demonstrated to be a selective
agonist for a vascular 5-hydroxytryptamine1 receptor subtype (probably
a member of the 5-HT1D family) with no significant affinity (as measured
using standard radioligand binding assays) or pharmacological activity
at 5-HT2, 5-HT3 receptor subtypes or at alpha1-, alpha2-, or beta-adrenergic;
dopamine1; dopamine2; muscarinic; or benzodiazepine receptors. </p>

<p>The vascular 5-HT1 receptor subtype to which sumatriptan binds selectively
and through which it presumably exerts its antimigrainous effect has been
shown to be present on cranial arteries in both dog and primate, on the
human basilar artery, and in the vasculature of the isolated dura mater
of humans. In these tissues, sumatriptan activates this receptor to cause
vasoconstriction, an action in humans correlating with the relief of migraine.
In the anesthetized dog, sumatriptan selectively reduces the carotid arterial
blood flow with little or no effect on arterial blood pressure or total
peripheral resistance. In the cat, sumatriptan selectively constricts the
carotid arteriovenous anastomoses while having little effect on blood flow
or resistance in cerebral or extracerebral tissues. </p>

<p>PHARMACOKINETICS: Pharmacokinetic parameters following a 6-mg subcutaneous
injection into the deltoid area of the arm in nine males (Mean Age, 33
Years; Mean Weight, 77 Kg) were systemic clearance; 1,194+/-149 mL per
minute (Mean+/ S.D.), distribution half-life: 15+/-2 minutes, terminal
half-life: 115+/-19 minutes, and volume of distribution central compartment:
50+/-8 liters. Of this dose, 22+/-4% was excreted in the urine as unchanged
sumatriptan and 38+/ 7% as the indole acetic acid metabolite. </p>

<p>After a single 6-mg subcutaneous manual injection into the deltoid area
of the arm in 18 healthy males (Age, 24+/-6 Years; Weight, 70 Kg), the
maximum serum concentration (Cmax) was (Mean+/-Standard Deviation) 74+/-15
ng/mL and the time to peak concentration (Tmax) was 12 minutes after injection
(Range, 5-20 Minutes). In this study, the same dose injected subcutaneously
in the thigh gave a Cmax of 61+/-15 ng/mL by manual injection versus 52+/-15
ng/mL by autoinjector techniques. The Tmax or amount absorbed were not
significantly altered by either the site or technique of injection. </p>

<p>The bioavailability of sumatriptan via subcutaneous site injection to
18 healthy male subjects was 97+/-16% of that obtained following intravenous
injection. Protein binding, determined by equilibrium dialysis over the
concentration range of 10-1,000 ng/mL, is low, approximately 14%-21%. The
effect of sumatriptan on the protein binding of other drugs has not been
evaluated. </p>

<p>The pharmacokinetics of sumatriptan in the elderly (Mean Age, 72 Years;
Two Males And Four Females) and in patients with migraine (mean Age, 38
Years; 25 Males And 155 Females) were similar to that in healthy male subjects
(mean Age, 30 Years). The systemic clearance and Cmax of sumatriptan were
similar in black (n=34) and Caucasian (n=38) healthy male subjects. </p>

<p>The effect of hepatic and renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of
sumatriptan has not been evaluated. </p>

<p>PHARMACODYNAMICS: </p>

<p>TYPICAL PHYSIOLOGIC RESPONSES: </p>

<p>A. CARDIOVASCULAR </p>

<p>BLOOD PRESSURE: Transient increases in systolic and diastolic blood
pressure may be observed after 6 mg of Sumatriptan Injection. In a placebo-controlled
study of 12 hypertensive migraineurs with documented diastolic blood pressure
of &gt;/=95 mmHg on two occasions during a migraine-free period, administration
of 6 mg of sumatriptan subcutaneously caused transient (usually less than
1 hour) elevations of blood pressure. Mean peak systolic and diastolic
blood pressures were both 6 mmHg above baseline; peak increases were usually
within 30 minutes of injection. The greatest observation of increased blood
pressure was in one individual with increases of 33 mmHg systolic and 17
mmHg diastolic postdose; this greatest response was maintained less than
20 minutes, occurred during the first half-hour after injection, and was
without any other clinically significant effect. </p>

<p>In two placebo-controlled trials of 6 mg of Sumatriptan Injection during
migraine attacks (n=547 treated with Sumatriptan Injection; n=370, placebo),
there were no differences between treatment groups for the number of patients
who experienced clinically significant increases in blood pressure (defined
prospectively as 20 mmHg above baseline and &gt;/=180 mmHg for systolic
blood pressure, or 15 mmHg above baseline and &gt;/=105 mmHg diastolic
blood pressure). These studies did not exclude patients with a history
of hypertension (n=25 for placebo and n=66 for Sumatriptan Injection hypertension
subgroups). Withdrawal of antihypertensive medications (if any) was not
a requirement in these studies; some patients were taking beta-adrenergic
receptor blocking drugs (n=12), calcium channel blocking drugs (n=3), diuretics
(n=4), or enalapril (n=1). Mean blood pressures for these hypertension
subgroups were 138/89 for placebo and 132/86 for Sumatriptan Injection
pretreatment. Neither placebo nor Sumatriptan Injection was associated
with changes in mean blood pressures in these hypertension subgroups. One
patient in the placebo subgroup experienced a clinically significant (see
definition above) elevation of diastolic blood pressure, and one patient
treated with Sumatriptan Injection experienced a clinically significant
elevation in systolic blood pressure (see definition above); both these
observations were transient and not accompanied by rises in systolic and
diastolic blood pressure respectively. </p>

<p>In controlled studies of 2,306 migraine patients receiving 4-8 mg of
Sumatriptan Injection, clinically significant increases or decreases (increases
as defined above, decreases prospectively defined as 20 mmHg below baseline
and &lt; or =90 mmHg systolic or 15 mmHg below baseline and &lt; or =50
mmHg diastolic) were present in &lt; or =1% of patients. Identical results
were observed in placebo-treated patients. </p>

<p>PERIPHERAL (SMALL) ARTERIES: In healthy volunteers (n=18), weighted
mean toe- arm systolic blood pressure gradients were used to study the
possible effects of sumatriptan on peripheral (small vessel) arterial reactivity.
After 8 mg of sumatriptan, the mean toe-arm pressure gradient fell by 6.6
mmHg systolic during the first 2 hours postdose. The maximum decrease in
systolic toe-arm gradient occurred at 1 hour postdose, and returned to
baseline values (a mean decrease of 8.3 mmHg) by 4 hours. Clinically insignificant
changes in ordinary systolic blood pressure, similar to those described
in the preceding paragraphs were also observed in this study. These changes
in toe-arm systolic gradient are interpreted as being slight and not indicating
a clinically significant risk of peripheral vasospasm in healthy volunteers.
</p>

<p>HEART RATE: The transient increases in blood pressure observed in the
clinical trials described above were not accompanied by any clinically
significant changes in heart rate. This was also true for the hypertensive
subgroups in the two pivotal trials. Overall, there was observed a mean
decrease of 4 bpm associated with Sumatriptan Injection in the two large
pivotal studies; while not of clinical significance, it is possible that
this was associated with relief of migraine. </p>

<p>B. OTHER PHYSIOLOGIC EFFECTS: </p>

<p>RESPIRATORY RATE: Respiratory rate was monitored in many of the studies
described in this section. There is no evidence for an effect of sumatriptan
on respiratory rate, and neither is there any theoretical reason to expect
such an effect. </p>

<p>CLINICAL STUDIES: In US controlled clinical trials enrolling more than
1,000 patients during migraine attacks who were experiencing moderate or
severe pain and one or more of the symptoms enumerated in Table 2 below,
onset of relief began as early as 10 minutes following a 6-mg Sumatriptan
Injection. Smaller doses of sumatriptan may also prove effective, although
the proportion of patients obtaining adequate relief is decreased and the
latency to that relief is In one well-controlled study where placebo (n=62)
was compared to six different doses of Sumatriptan Injection (n=30 each
group) in a single-attack, parallel-group design, the dose response relationship
was found to be as shown in the following Table 1. </p>

*  Relief is defined as the reduction of moderate or severe pain to no or mild  
    pain after dosing without use of rescue medication.  </font></pre>

<p>In two US well-controlled clinical trials in 1,104 migraine patients
with moderate and severe migraine pain, the onset of relief was rapid (less
than 10 minutes). Headache relief, as evidenced by a reduction in pain
from severe or moderately severe to mild or no headache, was achieved in
70% of the patients within 1 hour of a single 6-mg subcutaneous dose of
Sumatriptan Injection. Headache relief was achieved in approximately 82%
of patients within 2 hours, and 65% of all patients were pain free within
2 hours. </p>

<p>Sumatriptan Injection also relieved photophobia, phonophobia (sound
sensitivity), nausea, and vomiting associated with migraine attacks. Similar
efficacy was seen when patients self-administered Sumatriptan Injection
using an autoinjector. </p>

<p>The efficacy of Sumatriptan Injection is unaffected by whether or not
migraine is associated with aura, duration of attack, gender of the patient,
or concomitant use of common migraine prophylactic drugs (e.g., beta-blockers).
</p>

<p><a name="INDICATIONS AND USAGE"></a><b>INDICATIONS AND USAGE </b></p>

<p>Sumatriptan Injection is indicated for the acute treatment of migraine
attacks with or without aura. </p>

<p>Sumatriptan Injection is not for use in the management of hemiplegic
or basilar migraine (see WARNINGS). </p>

<p>Safety and effectiveness have also not been established for cluster
headache, which is present in an older, predominantly male population.
</p>

<p><a name="CONTRAINDICATIONS"></a><b>CONTRAINDICATIONS </b></p>

<p>Sumatriptan INJECTION SHOULD NOT BE GIVEN INTRAVENOUSLY BECAUSE OF ITS
POTENTIAL TO CAUSE CORONARY VASOSPASM. FOR SIMILAR REASONS, Sumatriptan
INJECTION SHOULD NOT BE GIVEN SUBCUTANEOUSLY TO PATIENTS WITH ISCHEMIC
HEART DISEASE (ANGINA PECTORIS, HISTORY OF MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION, OR DOCUMENTED
SILENT ISCHEMIA) OR TO PATIENTS WITH PRINZMETAL'S ANGINA. ALSO, PATIENTS
WITH SYMPTOMS OR SIGNS CONSISTENT WITH ISCHEMIC HEART DISEASE SHOULD NOT
RECEIVE Sumatriptan INJECTION. BECAUSE Sumatriptan INJECTION CAN GIVE RISE
TO INCREASES IN BLOOD PRESSURE (USUALLY SMALL), IT SHOULD NOT BE GIVEN
TO PATIENTS WITH UNCONTROLLED HYPERTENSION. </p>

<p>Sumatriptan INJECTION SHOULD NOT BE USED CONCOMITANTLY WITH ERGOTAMINE-CONTAINING
PREPARATIONS. </p>

<p>Sumatriptan INJECTION IS CONTRAINDICATED IN PATIENTS WITH HYPERSENSITIVITY
TO SUMATRIPTAN. </p>

<p><a name="WARNINGS"></a><b>WARNINGS </b></p>

<p>Sumatriptan Injection should not be administered to patients with basilar
or hemiplegic migraine. </p>

<p>CARDIAC EVENTS/CORONARY CONSTRICTION: </p>

<p>Serious coronary events following Sumatriptan Injection can occur but
are extremely rare; nonetheless, CONSIDERATION SHOULD BE GIVEN TO ADMINISTERING
THE FIRST DOSE OF Sumatriptan INJECTION IN THE PHYSICIAN'S OFFICE TO PATIENTS
IN WHOM UNRECOGNIZED CORONARY DISEASE IS COMPARATIVELY LIKELY (postmenopausal
women; males over 40; patients with risk factors for CAD, such as hypertension,
hypercholesterolemia, obesity, diabetes, smokers, and strong family history).
IF SYMPTOMS CONSISTENT WITH ANGINA OCCUR, ELECTROCARDIOGRAPHIC-ECG-EVALUATION
SHOULD BE CARRIED OUT TO LOOK FOR ISCHEMIC CHANGES. Sumatriptan may cause
coronary vasospasm in patients with a history of coronary artery disease
who are known to be more susceptible than others to coronary artery vasospasm,
and, rarely in patients without prior history suggestive of coronary artery
disease. There were eight patients among the more than 1,900 who participated
in controlled trials who sustained clinical events during or shortly after
receiving subcutaneous sumatriptan that may have reflected coronary vasospasm.
Six of these eight patients had ECG changes consistent with transient ischemia,
but without symptoms or signs. Of the eight patients, four had some findings
suggestive of coronary artery disease prior to treatment. None of these
adverse events was associated with a serious clinical outcome. </p>

<p>There have been rare reports from countries in which Sumatriptan Injection
has been marketed of serious and/or life-threatening arrhythmias, including
atrial fibrillation, ventricular fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia;
myocardial infarction; and marked ischemic ST elevations associated with
Sumatriptan Injection. In addition, there have been rare, but more frequent,
reports of chest and arm discomfort thought to represent angina pectoris.
</p>

<p>USE IN WOMEN OF CHILDBEARING POTENTIAL: (see PRECAUTIONS) </p>

<p><a name="PRECAUTIONS"></a><b>PRECAUTIONS </b></p>

<p>GENERAL: Chest, jaw, or neck tightness is relatively common after Sumatriptan
Injection, but has only rarely been associated with ischemic ECG changes.
</p>

<p>Sumatriptan Injection may cause mild, transient elevation of blood pressure
and peripheral vascular resistance (see ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY).
</p>

<p>Sumatriptan Injection should also be administered with caution to patients
with diseases that may alter the absorption, metabolism, or excretion of
drugs, such as impaired hepatic or renal function. </p>

<p>As with other acute migraine therapies, before treating headaches in
patients not previously diagnosed as migraineurs and in migraineurs who
present with atypical symptoms, care should be taken to exclude other potentially
serious neurological conditions. There have been rare reports where patients
received sumatriptan for severe headaches that were subsequently shown
to have been secondary to an evolving neurological lesion (cerebrovascular
accident, subarachnoid hemorrhage). In this regard, it should be noted
that migraineurs may be at increased risk of certain cerebrovascular events
(e.g., cerebrovascular accident, transient ischemic attack). </p>

<p>ALTHOUGH WRITTEN INSTRUCTIONS ARE SUPPLIED WITH THE AUTOINJECTOR, PATIENTS
WHO ARE ADVISED TO SELF-ADMINISTER Sumatriptan INJECTION IN MEDICALLY UNSUPERVISED
SITUATIONS SHOULD RECEIVE INSTRUCTION ON THE PROPER USE OF THE PRODUCT
FROM THE PHYSICIAN OR OTHER SUITABLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONAL
PRIOR TO DOING SO FOR THE FIRST TIME. </p>

<p>INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS: See PATIENT INFORMATION at the end of this
labeling for the text of the separate leaflet provided for patients. </p>

<p>LABORATORY TESTS: No specific laboratory tests are recommended for monitoring
patients prior to and/or after treatment with Sumatriptan Injection. </p>

<p>DRUG INTERACTIONS: There is no evidence that concomitant use of migraine
prophylactic medications has any effect on the efficacy or unwanted effects
of sumatriptan. In two Phase III trials in the US, a retrospective analysis
of 282 patients who had been using prophylactic drugs (verapamil n=63,
amitriptyline n=57, propranolol n=94, for 45 other drugs n=123) were compared
to those who had not used prophylaxis (n=452). There were no differences
in relief rates at 60 minutes postdose for Sumatriptan Injection, whether
or not prophylactic medications were used. There were also no differences
in overall adverse event rates between the two groups. </p>

<p>Ergot-containing drugs have been reported to cause prolonged vasospasm
reactions. Because there is a theoretical basis that these effects MAY
be additive, use of ergotamine and sumatriptan within 24 hours of each
other should be avoided (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). </p>

<p>DRUG/LABORATORY TEST INTERACTIONS: Sumatriptan Injection is not known
to interfere with commonly employed clinical laboratory tests. </p>

<p>CARCINOGENESIS, MUTAGENESIS, IMPAIRMENT OF FERTILITY: In a 104-week
lifetime study in rats given sumatriptan by oral gavage, serum concentrations
achieved were dose related, ranging at the low dose from approximately
twice the peak concentration of the drug after the recommended human subcutaneous
dose of 6 mg to more than 100 times this concentration at the high dose.
There was no evidence of an increase in tumors considered to be related
to sumatriptan administration. </p>

<p>In a 78-week study in which mice received sumatriptan continuously in
drinking water, there was no evidence for an increase in tumors considered
to be related to sumatriptan administration. That study, however, did not
use the maximum tolerated dose and therefore did not fully explore the
carcinogenic potential of Sumatriptan Injection in the mouse. </p>

<p>A segment I rat fertility study by the subcutaneous route has shown
no evidence of impaired fertility. </p>

<p>PREGNANCY: Pregnancy Category C: </p>

<p>Sumatriptan has been shown to be embryolethal in rabbits when given
in daily doses producing plasma levels 3-fold higher than those attained
following a 6 mg subcutaneous injection (i.e., recommended dose) to humans.
There is no evidence that establishes that sumatriptan is a human teratogen;
however, there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant
women. Sumatriptan Injection should be used during pregnancy only if the
potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. </p>

<p>In assessing this information, the following additional findings should
be considered. </p>

<p>EMBRYOLETHALITY: When given intravenously to pregnant rabbits daily
throughout the period of organogenesis, sumatriptan caused embryolethality
at doses at or close to those producing maternal toxicity. The mechanism
of the embryolethality is not known. At these doses, peak concentrations
of drug in plasma were more than 3-fold higher than the range observed
in humans after the recommended subcutaneous dose of 6 mg. </p>

<p>The intravenous administration of sumatriptan to pregnant rats throughout
organogenesis at doses producing plasma concentrations more than 50 times
those seen after the recommended subcutaneous human dose did not cause
embryolethality. In a study of pregnant rats given subcutaneous sumatriptan
daily prior to and throughout pregnancy, there was no evidence of increased
embryo/fetal lethality. </p>

<p>TERATOGENICITY: Term fetuses from Dutch Stride rabbits treated during
organogenesis with oral sumatriptan exhibited an increased incidence of
cervicothoracic vascular defects and minor skeletal abnormalities. The
functional significance of these abnormalities is not known. </p>

<p>In a study in rats dosed daily with subcutaneous sumatriptan prior to
and throughout pregnancy, there was no evidence of teratogenicity. </p>

<p>Studies in rats and rabbits evaluating the teratogenic potential of
sumatriptan administered subcutaneously only during organogenesis (standard
Segment II studies) have not been performed. </p>

<p>NURSING MOTHERS: Sumatriptan is excreted in breast milk in animals.
No data exist in humans. Therefore, caution should be exercised when considering
the administration of Sumatriptan Injection to a nursing woman. </p>

<p>PEDIATRIC USE: Safety and effectiveness of Sumatriptan Injection in
children have not been established. </p>

<p>USE IN THE ELDERLY: The safety and effectiveness of Sumatriptan Injection
in individuals over age 65 have not been systematically evaluated. However,
the pharmacokinetic disposition of Sumatriptan Injection in the elderly
is similar to that seen in younger adults. No unusual adverse, age-related
phenomena have been identified in patients over the age of 60 who participated
in clinical trials with Sumatriptan Injection. </p>

<p><a name="DRUG INTERACTIONS"></a><b>DRUG INTERACTIONS </b></p>

<p>There is no evidence that concomitant use of migraine prophylactic medications
has any effect on the efficacy or unwanted effects of sumatriptan. In two
phase III trials in the US, a retrospective analysis of 282 patients who
had been using prophylactic drugs (verapamil n=63, amitriptyline n=57,
propranolol n=94, for 45 other drugs n=123) were compared to those who
had not used prophylaxis (n=452). There were no differences in relief rates
at 60 minutes postdose for Sumatriptan Injection, whether or not prophylactic
medications were used. There were also no differences in overall adverse
event rates between the two groups. </p>

<p>Ergot-containing drugs have been reported to cause prolonged vasospasm
reactions. Because there is a theoretical basis that these effects MAY
be additive, use of ergotamine and sumatriptan within 24 hours of each
other should be avoided (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). </p>

<p>(See Also PRECAUTIONS) </p>

<p><a name="ADVERSE REACTIONS"></a><b>ADVERSE REACTIONS </b></p>

<p>ADVERSE REACTIONS (see also PRECAUTIONS) </p>

<p>Sumatriptan may cause coronary vasospasm in patients with a history
of coronary artery disease, known to be susceptible to coronary artery
vasospasm, and, very rarely, without prior history suggestive of coronary
artery disease. </p>

<p>There have been rare reports from countries in which Sumatriptan (sumatriptan
succinate) Injection has been marketed of serious and/or life-threatening
arrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation, ventricular fibrillation, ventricular
tachycardia, myocardial infarction, and marked ischemic ST elevations associated
with Sumatriptan Injection (see WARNINGS). More often, there has been chest
discomfort that appeared to represent angina pectoris. </p>

<p>Other untoward clinical events associated with the use of subcutaneous
Sumatriptan Injection are: pain or redness at the injection site, atypical
sensations (such as sensations of warmth, cold, tingling or paresthesia,
pressure, burning, numbness, tightness, all of which may be localized or
generalized), flushing, chest symptoms (pressure, pain, or tightness),
fatigue, dizziness, and drowsiness. All these untoward effects are usually
transient, although they may be severe in some patients. Transient rises
in blood pressure soon after treatment have been recorded. </p>

<p>Among patients in clinical trials of subcutaneous Sumatriptan Injection
(n=6,218), up to 3.5% of patients withdrew for reasons related to adverse
events. </p>

<p>INCIDENCE IN CONTROLLED CLINICAL TRIALS: The following Table 3 lists
adverse events that occurred in two large US, Phase III, placebo-controlled
clinical trials following either a single dose of Sumatriptan Injection
or placebo. Only events that occurred at a frequency of 1% or more in Sumatriptan
Injection treatment groups and were at least as frequent as in the placebo
group are included in Table 3. </p>

      groups and were at least as frequent as in the placebo groups are         
      included.                                                                 </font></pre>

<p>OTHER EVENTS OBSERVED IN ASSOCIATION WITH THE ADMINISTRATION OF Sumatriptan
INJECTION: In the paragraphs that follow, the frequency of less commonly
reported adverse clinical events are presented. Because the reports cite
events observed in open and uncontrolled studies, the role of Sumatriptan
Injection in their causation cannot be reliably determined. Furthermore,
variability associated with reporting requirements, the terminology used
to describe adverse events, etc., limit the value of the quantitative frequency
estimates provided. </p>

<p>Event frequencies are calculated as the number of patients reporting
an event divided by the total number of patients (n=6,218) exposed to subcutaneous
Sumatriptan Injection. Given their imprecision, frequencies for specific
adverse event occurrences are defined as follows: &quot;infrequent&quot;
indicates a frequency estimated as falling between 1/1,000 and 1/100; &quot;rare,&quot;
a frequency less than 1/1,000. </p>

<p>CARDIOVASCULAR: Infrequent were hypertension, hypotension, bradycardia,
tachycardia, palpitations, pulsating sensations, various transient ECG
changes (non-specific ST or T wave changes, prolongation of PR or QTc intervals,
sinus arrhythmia, nonsustained ventricular premature beats, isolated junctional
ectopic beats, atrial ectopic beats, delayed activation of the right ventricle)
and syncope. Rare were pallor, arrhythmia, abnormal pulse, vasodilatation,
and Raynaud's syndrome. </p>

<p>ENDOCRINE AND METABOLIC: Infrequent was thirst. Rare were polydipsia
and dehydration. </p>

<p>EYE: Infrequent was irritation of the eye. </p>

<p>GASTROINTESTINAL: Infrequent were gastroesophageal reflux, diarrhea,
and disturbances of liver function tests. Rare were peptic ulcer, retching,
flatulence/eructation, and gallstones. </p>

<p>MUSCULOSKELETAL: Infrequent were various joint disturbances (pain, stiffness,
swelling, ache). Rare were muscle stiffness, need to flex calf muscles,
backache, muscle tiredness, and swelling of the extremities. </p>

<p>NEUROLOGICAL: Infrequent were mental confusion, euphoria, agitation,
relaxation chills, sensation of lightness, tremor, shivering, disturbances
of taste, prickling sensations, paresthesia, stinging sensations, headaches,
facial pain, photophobia, and lachrymation. Rare were transient hemiplegia,
hysteria, globus hystericus, intoxication, depression, myoclonia, monoplegia/diplegia,
sleep disturbance, difficulties in concentration, disturbances of smell,
hyperesthesia, dysesthesia, simultaneous hot and cold sensations, tickling
sensations, dysarthria, yawning, reduced appetite, hunger, and dystonia.
</p>

<p>RESPIRATORY: Infrequent was dyspnea. Rare were influenza, diseases of
the lower respiratory tract, and hiccoughs. </p>

<p>DERMATOLOGICAL: Infrequent were erythema, pruritus, and skin rashes
and eruptions. Rare was skin tenderness. </p>

<p>UROGENITAL: Rare were dysuria, frequency, dysmenorrhea, and renal calculus.
</p>

<p>MISCELLANEOUS: Infrequent were miscellaneous laboratory abnormalities,
including minor disturbances in liver function tests, &quot;serotonin agonist
effect&quot;, and hypersensitivity to various agents. Rare was fever. </p>

<p>POSTMARKETING EXPERIENCE: Frequency and causality for sumatriptan are
not established for many of the following reports which come from worldwide
postmarketing experience: Episodes of Prinzmetal's angina, myocardial infarction,
acute renal failure, seizure, cerebrovascular accident (CVA), dysphasia,
subarachnoid hemorrhage, and arrhythmias (atrial fibrillation, ventricular
fibrillation, and ventricular tachycardia). Hypersensitivity to Sumatriptan
Injection has been reported, including anaphylactoid reactions, rash, urticaria,
pruritus, erythema, and shortness of breath. </p>

<p>DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE </p>

<p>The abuse potential of Sumatriptan Injection cannot be fully delineated
in advance of extensive marketing experience. One clinical study enrolling
12 patients with a history of substance abuse failed to induce subjective
behavior and/or physiologic response ordinarily associated with drugs that
have an established potential for abuse. </p>

<p><a name="OVERDOSAGE"></a><b>OVERDOSAGE </b></p>

<p>Patients (n=269) have received single injections of 8-12 mg without
significant adverse effects. Volunteers (n=47) have received single subcutaneous
doses of up to 16 mg without serious adverse events. </p>

<p>No gross overdoses in clinical practice have been reported. Coronary
vasospasm was observed after intravenous administration of Sumatriptan
(sumatriptan succinate) Injection (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). Overdoses would
be expected from animal data (dogs at 0.1 g/kg, rats at 2 g/kg) to possibly
cause convulsions, tremor, inactivity, erythema of the extremities, reduced
respiratory rate, cyanosis, ataxia, mydriasis, injection site reactions
(desquamation, hair loss, and scab formation), and paralysis. The half-life
of elimination of sumatriptan is about 2 hours (see ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY),
and therefore monitoring of patients after overdose with Sumatriptan Injection
should continue while symptoms or signs persist, and for at least 10 hours.
</p>

<p>It is unknown what effect hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis has on
the serum concentrations of sumatriptan. </p>

<p><a name="DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION"></a><b>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
</b></p>

<p>The maximum single recommended adult dose of Sumatriptan (sumatriptan
succinate) Injection is 6 mg injected subcutaneously. Controlled clinical
trials have failed to show that clear benefit is associated with the administration
of a second 6-mg dose in patients who have failed to respond to a first
injection. </p>

<p>The maximum recommended dose that may be given in 24 hours is two 6-mg
injections separated by at least one hour. Although the recommended dose
is 6 mg, if side effects are dose limiting, then lower doses may be used
(see ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY). In patients receiving doses lower
than 6 mg, only the single-dose vial dosage form should be used. An autoinjection
device is available for use with 6-mg prefilled syringes to facilitate
self administration in patients in whom this dose is deemed necessary.</p>

<p> Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate
matter and discoloration before administration whenever solution and container
permit. </p>

<p><a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><b>DESCRIPTION </b></p>

<p>Methylprednisolone Tablets contain methylprednisolone which is a glucocorticoid.
Glucocorticoids are adrenocortical steroids, both naturally occurring and
synthetic, which are readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract.
Methylprednisolone occurs as a white to practically white, odorless, crystalline
powder. It is sparingly soluble in alcohol, in dioxane, and in methanol,
slightly soluble in acetone, and in chloroform, and very slightly soluble
in ether. It is practically insoluble in water. </p>

<p>The chemical name for methylprednisolone is pregna-1,4-diene-3,20-dione,11,17,
21-trihydroxy-6-methyl-,(6alpha, 11beta)- and the molecular weight is 374.48.

</b></p>

<p>Naturally occurring glucocorticoids (hydrocortisone and cortisone),
which also have salt-retaining properties, are used as replacement therapy
in adrenocortical deficiency states. Their synthetic analogs are primarily
used for their potent anti-inflammatory effects in disorders of many organ
systems. </p>

<p>Glucocorticoids cause profound and varied metabolic effects. In addition,
they modify the body's immune responses to diverse stimuli. </p>

<p>
<br><a name="CONTRAINDICATIONS"></a><b>CONTRAINDICATIONS </b></p>

<p>Systemic fungal infections and known hypersensitivity to components.</p>

<p><a name="WARNINGS"></a><b> WARNINGS </b></p>

<p>In patients on corticosteroid therapy subjected to unusual stress, increased
dosage of rapidly acting corticosteroids before, during, and after the
stressful situation is indicated. </p>

<p>Corticosteroids may mask some signs of infection and new infections
may appear during their use. There may be decreased resistance and inability
to localize infection when corticosteroids are used. </p>

<p>Prolonged use of corticosteroids may produce posterior subcapsular cataracts,
glaucoma with possible damage to the optic nerves, and may enhance the
establishment of secondary ocular infections due to fungi or viruses. </p>

<p>Usage in pregnancy: Since adequate human reproduction studies have not
been done with corticosteroids, the use of these drugs in pregnancy, nursing
mothers or women of childbearing potential requires that the possible benefits
of the drug be weighed against the potential hazards to the mother and
embryo or fetus. Infants born of mothers who have received substantial
doses of corticosteroids during pregnancy should be carefully observed
for signs of hypoadrenalism. </p>

<p>Average and large doses of hydrocortisone or cortisone can cause elevation
of blood pressure, salt and water retention, and increased excretion of
potassium. These effects are less likely to occur with the synthetic derivatives
except when used in large doses. Dietary salt restriction and potassium
supplementation may be necessary. All corticosteroids increase calcium
excretion. </p>

<p>WHILE ON CORTICOSTEROID THERAPY PATIENTS SHOULD NOT BE VACCINATED AGAINST
SMALLPOX. OTHER IMMUNIZATION PROCEDURES SHOULD NOT BE UNDERTAKEN IN PATIENTS
WHO ARE ON CORTICOSTEROIDS, ESPECIALLY ON HIGH DOSE, BECAUSE OF POSSIBLE
HAZARDS OF NEUROLOGICAL COMPLICATIONS AND A LACK OF ANTIBODY RESPONSE.
</p>

<p>The use of Methylprednisolone Tablets (methylprednisolone) in active
tuberculosis should be restricted to those cases of fulminating or disseminated
tuberculosis in which the corticosteroid is used for the management of
the disease in conjunction with an appropriate antituberculous regimen.
</p>

<p>If corticosteroids are indicated in patients with latent tuberculosis
or tuberculin reactivity, close observation is necessary as reactivation
of the disease may occur. During prolonged corticosteroid therapy, these
patients should receive chemoprophylaxis. </p>

<p>Persons who are on drugs which suppress the immune system are more susceptible
to infections than healthy individuals. Chicken pox and measles, for example,
can have a more serious or even fatal course in non-immune children or
adults on corticosteroids. In such children or adults who have not had
these diseases particular care should be taken to avoid exposure. How the
dose, route and duration of corticosteroid administration affects the risk
of developing a disseminated infection is not known. The contribution of
the underlying disease and/or prior corticosteroid treatment to the risk
is also not known. If exposed to chicken pox, prophylaxis with varicella
zoster immune globulin (VZIG) may be indicated. If exposed to measles,
prophylaxis with pooled intramuscular immunoglobulin (IG) may be indicated.
(See the respective package inserts for complete VZIG and IG prescribing
information.) If chicken pox develops, treatment with antiviral agents
may be considered. </p>

<p><a name="PRECAUTIONS"></a><b>PRECAUTIONS </b></p>

<p>Drug-induced secondary adrenocortical insufficiency may be minimized
by gradual reduction of dosage. This type of relative insufficiency may
persist for months after discontinuation of therapy; therefore, in any
situation of stress occurring during that period, hormone therapy should
be reinstituted. Since mineralocorticoid secretion may be impaired, salt
and/or a mineralocorticoid should be administered concurrently. </p>

<p>There is an enhanced effect of corticosteroids on patients with hypothyroidism
and in those with cirrhosis. </p>

<p>Corticosteroids should be used cautiously in patients with ocular herpes
simplex because of possible corneal perforation. </p>

<p>The lowest possible dose of corticosteroid should be used to control
the condition under treatment, and when reduction in dosage is possible,
the reduction should be gradual. </p>

<p>Psychic derangements may appear when corticosteroids are used, ranging
from euphoria, insomnia, mood swings, personality changes and severe depression,
to frank psychotic manifestations. Also, existing emotional instability
or psychotic tendencies may be aggravated by corticosteroids. </p>

<p>Steroids should be used with caution in nonspecific ulcerative colitis,
if there is a probability of impending perforation, abscess or other pyogenic
infection; diverticulitis; fresh intestinal anastomoses; active or latent
peptic ulcer; renal insufficiency; hypertension; osteoporosis; and myasthenia
gravis. </p>

<p>Growth and development of infants and children on prolonged corticosteroid
therapy should be carefully observed. </p>

<p>Although controlled clinical trials have shown corticosteroids to be
effective in speeding the resolution of acute exacerbations of multiple
sclerosis, they do not show that corticosteroids affect the ultimate outcome
or natural history of the disease. The studies do show that relatively
high doses of corticosteroids are necessary to demonstrate a significant
effect. (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION) </p>

<p>Since complications of treatment with glucocorticoids are dependent
on the size of the dose and the duration of treatment, a risk/benefit decision
must be made in each individual case as to dose and duration of treatment
and as to whether daily or intermittent therapy should be used. </p>

<p>The 24 mg tablet contains FD&amp;C Yellow No. 5 (tartrazine) which may
cause allergic-type reactions (including bronchial asthma) in certain susceptible
individuals. Although the overall incidence of FD&amp;C Yellow No. 5 (tartrazine)
sensitivity in the general population is low, it is frequently seen in
patients who also have aspirin hypersensitivity. </p>

<p>INFORMATION FOR THE PATIENT </p>

<p>Persons who are on immunosuppressant doses of corticosteroids should
be warned to avoid exposure to chicken pox or measles. Patients should
also be advised that if they are exposed, medical advice should be sought
without delay. </p>

<p>DRUG INTERACTIONS </p>

<p>The pharmacokinetic interactions listed below are potentially clinically
important. Mutual inhibition of metabolism occurs with concurrent use of
cyclosporin and methylprednisolone; therefore, it is possible that adverse
events associated with the individual use of either drug may be more apt
to occur. Convulsions have been reported with concurrent use of methylprednisolone
and cyclosporin. Drugs that induce hepatic enzymes such as phenobarbital,
phenytoin and rifampin may increase the clearance of methylprednisolone
and may require increases in methylprednisolone dose to achieve the desired
response. Drugs such as troleandomycin and ketoconazole may inhibit the
metabolism of methylprednisolone and thus decrease its clearance. Therefore,
the dose of methylprednisolone should be titrated to avoid steroid toxicity.
</p>

<p>Methylprednisolone may increase the clearance of chronic high dose aspirin.
This could lead to decreased salicylate serum levels or increase the risk
of salicylate toxicity when methylprednisolone is withdrawn. Aspirin should
be used cautiously in conjunction with corticosteroids in patients suffering
from hypoprothrombinemia. </p>

<p>The effect of methylprednisolone on oral anticoagulants is variable.
There are reports of enhanced as well as diminished effects of anticoagulant
when given concurrently with corticosteroids. Therefore, coagulation indices
should be monitored to maintain the desired anticoagulant effect. </p>

<p><a name="DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION"></a><b>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
</b></p>

<p>The initial dosage of Methylprednisolone Tablets may vary from 4 mg
to 48 mg per day depending on the specific disease entity being treated.
In situations of less severity lower doses will generally suffice while
in selected patients higher initial doses may be required. The initial
dosage should be maintained or adjusted until a satisfactory response is
noted. If after a reasonable period of time there is a lack of satisfactory
clinical response, Methylprednisolone should be discontinued and the patient
transferred to other appropriate therapy. IT SHOULD BE EMPHASIZED THAT
DOSAGE REQUIREMENTS ARE VARIABLE AND MUST BE INDIVIDUALIZED ON THE BASIS
OF THE DISEASE UNDER TREATMENT AND THE RESPONSE OF THE PATIENT. After a
favorable response is noted, the proper maintenance dosage should be determined
by decreasing the initial drug dosage in small decrements at appropriate
time intervals until the lowest dosage which will maintain an adequate
clinical response is reached. It should be kept in mind that constant monitoring
is needed in regard to drug dosage. Included in the situations which may
make dosage adjustments necessary are changes in clinical status secondary
to remissions or exacerbations in the disease process, the patient's individual
drug responsiveness, and the effect of patient exposure to stressful situations
not directly related to the disease entity under treatment; in this latter
situation it may be necessary to increase the dosage of Methylprednisolone
for a period of time consistent with the patient's condition. If after
long-term therapy the drug is to be stopped, it is recommended that it
be withdrawn gradually rather than abruptly.</p>

<p> MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS </p>

<p>In treatment of acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis daily doses
of 200 mg of prednisolone for a week followed by 80 mg every other day
for 1 month have been shown to be effective (4 mg of methylprednisolone
is equivalent to 5 mg of prednisolone). </p>

<p>ADT(R) (ALTERNATE DAY THERAPY) Alternate day therapy is a corticosteroid
dosing regimen in which twice the usual daily dose of corticoid is administered
every other morning. The purpose of this mode of therapy is to provide
the patient requiring long-term pharmacologic dose treatment with the beneficial
effects of corticoids while minimizing certain undesirable effects, including
pituitary-adrenal suppression the Cushingoid state, corticoid withdrawal
symptoms, and growth suppression in children. </p>

<p>The rationale for this treatment schedule is based on two major premises:
(a) the anti-inflammatory or therapeutic effect of corticoids persists
longer than their physical presence and metabolic effects and (b) administration
of the corticosteroid every other morning allows for re-establishment of
more nearly normal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) activity on the
off-steroid day. </p>

<p>A brief review of the HPA physiology may be helpful in understanding
this rationale. Acting primarily through the hypothalamus a fall in free
cortisol stimulates the pituitary gland to produce increasing amounts of
corticotropin (ACTH) while a rise in free cortisol inhibits ACTH secretion.
Normally the HPA system is characterized by diurnal (circadian) rhythm.
Serum levels of ACTH rise from a low point about 10 pm to a peak level
about 6 am. Increasing levels of ACTH stimulate adrenal cortical activity
resulting in a rise in plasma cortisol with maximal levels occurring between
2 am and 8 am. This rise in cortisol dampens ACTH production and in turn
adrenal cortical activity. There is a gradual fall in plasma corticoids
during the day with lowest levels occurring about midnight. </p>

<p>The diurnal rhythm of the HPA axis is lost in Cushing's disease, a syndrome
of adrenal cortical hyperfunction characterized by obesity with centripetal
fat distribution, thinning of the skin with easy bruisability, muscle wasting
with weakness, hypertension, latent diabetes, osteoporosis, electrolyte
imbalance, etc. The same clinical findings of hyperadrenocorticism may
be noted during long-term pharmacologic dose corticoid therapy administered
in conventional daily divided doses. It would appear, then, that a disturbance
in the diurnal cycle with maintenance of elevated corticoid values during
the night may play a significant role in the development of undesirable
corticoid effects. Escape from these constantly elevated plasma levels
for even short periods of time may be instrumental in protecting against
undesirable pharmacologic effects. </p>

<p>During conventional pharmacologic dose corticosteroid therapy, ACTH
production is inhibited with subsequent suppression of cortisol production
by the adrenal cortex. Recovery time for normal HPA activity is variable
depending upon the dose and duration of treatment. During this time the
patient is vulnerable to any stressful situation. Although it has been
shown that there is considerably less adrenal suppression following a single
morning dose of prednisolone (10 mg) as opposed to a quarter of that dose
administered every 6 hours, there is evidence that some suppressive effect
on adrenal activity may be carried over into the following day when pharmacologic
doses are used. Further, it has been shown that a single dose of certain
corticosteroids will produce adrenal cortical suppression for two or more
days. Other corticoids, including methylprednisolone, hydrocortisone, prednisone,
and prednisolone, are considered to be short acting (producing adrenal
cortical suppression for 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 days following a single dose) and
thus are recommended for alternate day therapy. </p>

<p>The following should be kept in mind when considering alternate day
therapy: </p>

<p>1) Basic principles and indications for corticosteroid therapy should
apply. The benefits of ADT should not encourage the indiscriminate use
of steroids. </p>

<p>2) ADT is a therapeutic technique primarily designed for patients in
whom long- term pharmacologic corticoid therapy is anticipated. </p>

<p>3) In less severe disease processes in which corticoid therapy is indicated,
it may be possible to initiate treatment with ADT. More severe disease
states usually will require daily divided high dose therapy for initial
control of the disease process. The initial suppressive dose level should
be continued until satisfactory clinical response is obtained, usually
four to ten days in the case of many allergic and collagen diseases. It
is important to keep the period of initial suppressive dose as brief as
possible particularly when subsequent use of alternate day therapy is intended.
</p>

<p>Once control has been established, two courses are available: (a) change
to ADT and then gradually reduce the amount of corticoid given every other
day Or (b) following control of the disease process reduce the daily dose
of corticoid to the lowest effective level as rapidly as possible and then
change over to an alternate day schedule. Theoretically, course (a) may
be preferable. </p>

<p>4) Because of the advantages of ADT, it may be desirable to try patients
on this form of therapy who have been on daily corticoids for long periods
of time (eg, patients with rheumatoid arthritis). Since these patients
may already have a suppressed HPA axis, establishing them on ADT may be
difficult and not always successful. However, it is recommended that regular
attempts be made to change them over. It may be helpful to triple or even
quadruple the daily maintenance dose and administer this every other day
rather than just doubling the daily dose if difficulty is encountered.
Once the patient is again controlled, an attempt should be made to reduce
this dose to a minimum. </p>

<p>5) As indicated above, certain corticosteroids, because of their prolonged
suppressive effect on adrenal activity, are not recommended for alternate
day therapy (eg, dexamethasone and betamethasone). </p>

<p>6) The maximal activity of the adrenal cortex is between 2 am and 8
am, and it is minimal between 4 pm and midnight. Exogenous corticosteroids
suppress adrenocortical activity the least, when given at the time of maximal
activity (am). </p>

<p>7) In using ADT it is important, as in all therapeutic situations, to
individualize and tailor the therapy to each patient. Complete control
of symptoms will not be possible in all patients. An explanation of the
benefits of ADT will help the patient to understand and tolerate the possible
flare-up in symptoms which may occur in the latter part of the off-steroid
day. Other symptomatic therapy may be added or increased at this time if
needed. </p>

<p>8) In the event of an acute flare-up of the disease process, it may
be necessary to return to a full suppressive daily divided corticoid dose
for control. Once control is again established alternate day therapy may
be reinstituted. </p>

<p>9) Although many of the undesirable features of corticosteroid therapy
can be minimized by ADT, as in any therapeutic situation, the physician
must carefully weigh the benefit-risk ratio for each patient in whom corticoid
therapy is being considered. </p>

WARNING
<p>
USE IN PREGNANCY 
 <p>
WHEN USED IN PREGNANCY DURING THE SECOND AND THIRD TRIMESTERS, ACE INHIBITORS
CAN CAUSE INJURY AND EVEN DEATH TO THE DEVELOPING FETUS. When pregnancy is
detected, Benazepril should be discontinued as soon as possible. See WARNINGS,
Fetal/Neonatal Morbidity and Mortality.  
 
 <p>
Benazepril hydrochloride is a white to off-white crystalline powder, soluble
(&gt;100 mg/mL) in water, in ethanol, and in methanol. Benazepril's chemical name
is 3-((1-(ethoxy-carbonyl)-3-phenyl-(1S)-propyl)amino)-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-2-oxo 
1H-1-(3S)-benzazepine-1-acetic acid monohydrochloride. Its empirical formula
is C24H28N2O5.HCl, and its molecular weight is 460.96.  
 <p>
Benazeprilat, the active metabolite of benazepril, is a non-sulfhydryl
angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. Benazepril is converted to
benazeprilat by hepatic cleavage of the ester group.  <p>
 
<a name="ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY"></a><b>ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 
</b> <p>
MECHANISM OF ACTION 
 <p>
Benazepril and benazeprilat inhibit angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in
human subjects and animals. ACE is a peptidyl dipeptidase that catalyzes the
conversion of angiotensin I to the vasoconstrictor substance, angiotensin II. 
Angiotensin II also stimulates aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex.  
 <p>
Inhibition of ACE results in a decreased plasma angiotensin II, which leads to
decreased vasopressor activity and to decreased aldosterone secretion. The
latter decrease may result in a small increase in serum potassium. Hypertensive 
patients treated with Benazepril alone for up to 52 weeks had elevations of serum 
potassium of up to 0.2 mEq/L. Similar patients treated with Benazepril and
hydrochlorothiazide for up to 24 weeks had no consistent changes in their serum 
potassium (see PRECAUTIONS).  
 <p>
Removal of angiotensin II negative feedback on renin secretion leads to
increased plasma renin activity. In animal studies, benazepril had no
inhibitory effect on the vasopressor response to angiotensin II and did not
interfere with the hemodynamic effects of the autonomic neurotransmitters
acetylcholine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine.  
                            <p>
ACE is identical to kininase, an enzyme that degrades bradykinin. Whether
increased levels of bradykinin, a potent vasodepressor peptide, play a role in
the therapeutic effects of Benazepril remains to be elucidated.  
 <p>
While the mechanism through which benazepril lowers blood pressure is believed
to be primarily suppression of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system,
benazepril has an antihypertensive effect even in patients with low-renin
hypertension. In particular, Benazepril was antihypertensive in all races studied 
although it was somewhat less effective in blacks than in nonblacks.  
 <p>
PHARMACOKINETICS AND METABOLISM 
 <p>
Following oral administration of Benazepril, peak plasma concentrations of
benazepril are reached within 0.5-1.0 hours. The extent of absorption is at
least 37% as determined by urinary recovery and is not significantly influenced 
by the presence of food in the GI tract.  
 <p>
Cleavage of the ester group (primarily in the liver) converts benazepril to its 
active metabolite, benazeprilat. Peak plasma concentrations of benazeprilat are 
reached 1-2 hours after drug intake in the fasting state and 2-4 hours after
drug intake in the nonfasting state. The serum protein binding of benazepril is 
about 96.7% and that of benazeprilat about 95.3%, as measured by equilibrium
dialysis; on the basis of in vitro studies, the degree of protein binding
should be unaffected by age, hepatic dysfunction, or concentration (over the
concentration range of 0.24-23.6 micromol/L).  
 <p>
Benazepril is almost completely metabolized to benazeprilat, which has much
greater ACE inhibitory activity than benazepril, and to the glucuronide
conjugates of benazepril and benazeprilat. Only trace amounts of an
administered dose of Benazepril can be recovered in the urine as unchanged
benazepril, while about 20% of the dose is excreted as benazeprilat, 4% as
benazepril glucuronide, and 8% as benazeprilat glucuronide.  
 <p>
The kinetics of benazepril are approximately dose-proportional within the
dosage range of 10-80 mg.  <p>
 
The effective half-life of accumulation of benazeprilat following multiple
dosing of benazepril hydrochloride is 10-11 hours. Thus, steady-state
concentrations of benazeprilat should be reached after 2 or 3 doses of
benazepril hydrochloride given once daily.  
 <p>
The kinetics did not change, and there was no significant accumulation during
chronic administration (28 days) of once-daily doses between 5 mg and 20 mg. 
Accumulation ratios based on AUC and urinary recovery of benazeprilat were 1.19 
and 1.27, respectively.  <p>
 
When dialysis was started two hours after ingestion of 10 mg of benazepril,
approximately 6% of benazeprilat was removed in 4 hours of dialysis. The parent 
compound benazepril, was not detected in the dialysate.  <p>
 
The disposition of benazepril and benazeprilat in patients with mild-to
moderate renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance &gt;30 mL/min) is similar to
that in patients with normal renal function. In patients with creatinine
clearance &lt; or =30 mL/min, peak benazeprilat levels and the initial (alpha phase)
half-life increase, and time to steady-state may be delayed (see DOSAGE AND
ADMINISTRATION).  
 <p>
Benazepril and benazeprilat are cleared predominantly by renal excretion in
healthy subjects with normal renal function. Nonrenal (i.e., biliary) excretion 
accounts for approximately 11-12% of benazeprilat excretion in healthy
subjects.  In patients with renal failure, biliary clearance may compensate to
an extent for deficient renal clearance.  
 <p>
In patients with hepatic dysfunction due to cirrhosis, levels of benazeprilat
are essentially unaltered. The pharamcokinetics of benazepril and benazeprilat
do not appear to be influenced by age.  
 <p>
In studies in rats given 14C-benazepril, benazepril and its metabolites crossed 
the blood-brain barrier only to an extremely low extent. Multiple doses of
benazepril did not result in accumulation in any tissue except the lung, where, 
as with other ACE inhibitors in similar studies, there was a slight increase in 
concentration due to slow elimination in that organ.  
 <p>
Some placental passage occurred when the drug was administered to pregnant
rats.  <p>
 
PHARMACODYNAMICS <p>
 
Single and multiple doses of 10 mg or more of Benazepril cause inhibition of
plasma ACE activity by at least 80-90% for at least 24 hours after dosing. 
Pressor responses to exogenous angiotensin I were inhibited by 60-90% (up to 4
hours post-dose) at the 10 mg dose.  
 <p>
Administration of Benazepril to patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension
results in reduction of both supine and standing blood pressure to about the
same extent with no compensatory tachycardia. Symptomatic postural hypotension
is infrequent, although it can occur in patients who are salt- and/or volume-
depleted (see WARNINGS).  
 <p>
In single-dose studies, Benazepril lowered blood pressure within 1 hour, with
peak reductions achieved 2-4 hours after dosing. The antihypertensive effect of 
a single dose persisted for 24 hours. In multiple dose studies, once-daily
doses of 20-80 mg decreased seated pressure (systolic/diastolic) 24 hours after 
dosing by about 6-12/4-7 mmHg. The trough values represent reductions of about
50% of that seen at peak.  <p>
 
Four dose-response studies using once-daily dosing were conducted in 470 mild-
to-moderate hypertensive patients not using diuretics. The minimal effective
once-daily dose of Benazepril was 10 mg; but further falls in blood pressure,
especially at morning trough, were seen with higher doses in the studied dosing 
range (10-80 mg). In studies comparing the same daily dose of Benazepril given as 
a single morning dose or as a twice-daily dose, blood pressure reductions at
the time of morning trough blood levels were greater with the divided regimen.  <p>
 
During chronic therapy, the maximum reduction in blood pressure with any dose
is generally achieved after 1-2 weeks. The antihypertensive effects of Benazepril 
have continued during therapy for at least two years. Abrupt withdrawal of
Benazepril has not been associated with a rapid increase in blood pressure.  
 <p>
In patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension, Benazepril 10-20 mg was similar
in effectiveness to captopril, hydrochlorothiazide, nifedipine SR, and
propranolol.  
 <p>
In antihypertensive effects of Benazepril were not appreciably different in
patients receiving high- or low-sodium diets.  
 <p>
In hemodynamic studies in dogs, blood pressure reduction was accompanied by a
reduction in peripheral arterial resistance, with an increase in cardiac output 
and renal blood flow and little or no change in heart rate. In normal human
volunteers, single doses of benazepril caused an increase in renal blood flow
but had no effect on glomerular filtration rate.  
 <p>
Use of Benazepril in combination with thiazide diuretics gives a blood-pressure-
lowering effect greater than that seen with either agent alone. By blocking the 
renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis, administration of Benazepril tends to reduce
the potassium loss associated with the diuretic.  
 <p>
<a name="INDICATIONS AND USAGE"></a><b>INDICATIONS AND USAGE 
</b> <p>
Benazepril is indicated for the treatment of hypertension. It may be used alone
or in combination with thiazide diuretics.  <p>
 
In using Benazepril, consideration should be given to the fact that another
angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, has caused agranulocytosis, 
particularly in patients with renal impairment or collagen-vascular disease. 
Available data are insufficient to show that Benazepril does not have a similar
risk (see WARNINGS).  <p>
 
<a name="CONTRAINDICATIONS"></a><b>CONTRAINDICATIONS 
</b> <p>
Benazepril is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to this product
or to any other ACE inhibitor.

Presumably because angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors affect the
metabolism of eicosanoids and polypeptides, including endogenous bradykinin,
patients receiving ACE inhibitors (including Benazepril) may be subject to a
variety of adverse reactions, some of them serious.  
 <p>
ANGIOEDEMA: Angioedema of the face, extremities, lips, tongue, glottis, and
larynx has been reported in patients treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme 
inhibitors. In U.S. clinical trials, symptoms consistent with angioedema were
seen in none of the subjects who received placebo and in about 0.5% of the
subjects who received Benazepril. Angioedema associated with laryngeal edema can
be fatal. If laryngeal stridor or angioedema of the face, tongue, or glottis
occurs, treatment with Benazepril should be discontinued and appropriate therapy
instituted immediately. WHERE THERE IS INVOLVEMENT OF THE TONGUE, GLOTTIS, OR
LARYNX, LIKELY TO CAUSE AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION, APPROPRIATE THERAPY, E.G.,
SUBCUTANEOUS EPINEPHRINE INJECTION 1:1000 (0.3 ML TO 0.5 ML) SHOULD BE PROMPTLY 
ADMINISTERED (SEE ADVERSE REACTIONS).  
 <p>
ANAPHYLACTOID REACTIONS DURING DESENSITIZATION: Two patients undergoing
desensitizing treatment with hymenoptera venom while receiving ACE inhibitors
sustained life-threatening anaphylactoid reactions. In the same patients, these 
reactions were avoided when ACE inhibitors were temporarily withheld, but they
reappeared upon inadvertent rechallenge.  
 <p>
ANAPHYLACTOID REACTIONS DURING MEMBRANE EXPOSURE: Anaphylactoid reactions have
been reported in patients dialyzed with high-flux membranes and treated
concomitantly with an ACE inhibitor. Anaphylactoid reactions have also been
reported in patients undergoing low-density lipoprotein apheresis with dextran
sulfate absorption (a procedure dependent upon devices not approved in the
United States).  
 <p>
HYPOTENSION 
 <p>
Benazepril can cause symptomatic hypotension. Like other ACE inhibitors,
benazepril has been only rarely associated with hypotension in uncomplicated
hypertensive patients. Symptomatic hypotension is most likely to occur in
patients who have been volume- and/or salt-depleted as a result of prolonged
diuretic therapy, dietary salt restriction, dialysis, diarrhea, or vomiting. 
Volume- and/or salt-depletion should be corrected before initiating therapy
with Benazepril.  
 <p>
In patients with congestive heart failure, with or without associated renal
insufficiency, ACE inhibitor therapy may cause excessive hypotension, which may 
be associated with oliguria or azotemia and, rarely, with acute renal failure
and death. In such patients, Benazepril therapy should be started under close
medical supervision; they should be followed closely for the first 2 weeks of
treatment and whenever the dose of benazepril or diuretic is increased.  
 <p>
If hypotension occurs, the patient should be placed in a supine position, and,
if necessary, treated with intravenous infusion of physiological saline. 
Benazepril treatment usually can be continued following restoration of blood
pressure and volume.  
 <p>
NEUTROPENIA/AGRANULOCYTOSIS 
 <p>
Another angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, has been shown to
cause agranulocytosis and bone marrow depression, rarely in uncomplicated
patients, but more frequently in patients with renal impairment, especially if
they also have a collagen-vascular disease such as systemic lupus erythematosus 
or scleroderma. Available data from clinical trials of benazepril are
insufficient to show that benazepril does not cause agranulocytosis at similar
rates. Monitoring of white blood cell counts should be considered in patients
with collagen-vascular disease, especially if the disease is associated with
impaired renal function.  <p>
 
FETAL/NEONATAL MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY 
 <p>
ACE inhibitors can cause fetal and neonatal morbidity and death when
administered to pregnant women.  
 <p>
Several dozen cases have been reported in the world literature. When pregnancy
is detected, ACE inhibitors should be discontinued as soon as possible.  
 <p>
The use of ACE inhibitors during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy
has been associated with fetal and neonatal injury, including hypotension,
neonatal skull hypoplasia, anuria, reversible or irreversible renal failure,
and death. Oligohydramnios has also been reported, presumably resulting from
decreased fetal renal function; oligohydramnios in this setting has been
associated with fetal limb contractures, craniofacial deformation, and
hypoplastic lung development. Prematurity, intrauterine growth retardation, and 
patent ductus arteriosus have also been reported, although it is not clear
whether these occurrences were due to the ACE inhibitor exposure.  
 <p>
These adverse effects do not appear to have resulted from intrauterine ACE
inhibitor exposure that has been limited to the first trimester. Mothers whose
embryos and fetuses are exposed to ACE inhibitors only during the first
trimester should be so informed. Nonetheless, when patients become pregnant,
physicians should make every effort to discontinue the use of benazepril as
soon as possible.  <p>
 
Rarely (probably less often than once in every thousand pregnancies), no
alternative to ACE inhibitors will be found. In these rare cases, the mothers
should be apprised of the potential hazards to their fetuses, and serial
ultrasound examinations should be performed to assess the intraamniotic
environment.  <p>
 
If oligohydramnios is observed, benazepril should be discontinued unless it is
considered life-saving for the mother. Contraction stress testing (CST), a
nonstress test (NST), or biophysical profiling (BPP) may be appropriate,
depending upon the week of pregnancy. Patients and physicians should be aware,
however, that oligohydramnios may not appear until after the fetus has
sustained irreversible injury.  
 <p>
Infants with histories of In Utero exposure to ACE inhibitors should be closely 
observed for hypotension, oliguria, and hyperkalemia. If oliguria occurs,
attention should be directed toward support of blood pressure and renal
perfusion. Exchange transfusion or dialysis may be required as means of
reversing hypotension and/or substituting for disordered renal function. 
Benazepril, which crosses the placenta, can theoretically be removed from the
neonatal circulation by these means; there are occasional reports of benefit
from these maneuvers with another ACE inhibitor, but experience is limited.  
 <p>
No teratogenic effects of Benazepril were seen in studies of pregnant rats, mice, 
and rabbits. On a mg/m(square) basis, the doses used in these studies were 60
times (in rats), 9 times (in mice), and more than 0.8 times (in rabbits) the
maximum recommended human dose (assuming a 50 kg woman). On a mg/kg basis these 
multiples are 300 times (in rats), 90 times (in mice) and more than 3 times (in 
rabbits) the maximum recommended human dose.  
 <p>
HEPATIC FAILURE 
 <p>
Rarely, ACE inhibitors have been associated with a syndrome that starts with
cholestatic jaundice and progresses to fulminant hepatic necrosis and
(sometimes) death. The mechanism of this syndrome is not understood. Patients
receiving ACE inhibitors who develop jaundice or marked elevations of hepatic
enzymes should discontinue the ACE inhibitor and receive appropriate medical
follow-up.  
 <p>
<a name="PRECAUTIONS"></a><b>PRECAUTIONS 
</b> <p>
GENERAL 
 <p>
IMPAIRED RENAL FUNCTION: As a consequence of inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-
aldosterone system, changes in renal function may be anticipated in susceptible 
individuals. In patients with severe congestive heart failure whose renal
function may depend on the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system 
treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, including Benazepril,
may be associated with oliguria and/or progressive azotemia and (rarely) with
acute renal failure and/or death. In a small study of hypertensive patients
with renal artery stenosis in a solitary kidney or bilateral renal artery
stenosis, treatment with Benazepril was associated with increases in blood urea
nitrogen and serum creatinine; these increases were reversible upon
discontinuation of Benazepril or diuretic therapy, or both. When such patients
are treated with ACE inhibitors, renal function should be monitored during the
first few weeks of therapy. Some hypertensive patients with no apparent
preexisting renal vascular disease have developed increases in blood urea
nitrogen and serum creatinine, usually minor and transient, especially when
Benazepril has been given concomitantly with a diuretic. This is more likely to
occur in patients with preexisting renal impairment. Dosage reduction of
Benazepril and/or discontinuation of the diuretic may be required. EVALUATION OF
THE HYPERTENSIVE PATIENT SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE ASSESSMENT OF RENAL FUNCTION
(SEE DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).  
                            <p>
HYPERKALEMIA: In clinical trials, hyperkalemia (serum potassium at least 0.5
mEq/L greater than the upper limit of normal) occurred in approximately 1% of
hypertensive patients receiving Benazepril. In most cases, these were isolated
values which resolved despite continued therapy. Risk factors for the
development of hyperkalemia include renal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus, and 
the concomitant use of potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements,
and/or potassium-containing salt substitutes, which should be used cautiously,
if at all, with Benazepril (see Drug Interactions).  
 <p>
COUGH: Presumably due to the inhibition of the degradation of endogenous
bradykinin, persistent nonproductive cough has been reported with all ACE
inhibitors, always resolving after discontinuation of therapy. ACE inhibitor-
induced cough should be considered in the differential diagnosis of cough.  
 <p>
IMPAIRED LIVER FUNCTION: In patients with hepatic dysfunction due to cirrhosis, 
levels of benazeprilat are essentially unaltered. (See WARNINGS, Hepatic
Failure).  <p>
 
SURGERY/ANESTHESIA: In patients undergoing surgery or during anesthesia with
agents that produce hypotension, benazepril will block the angiotensin II
formation that could otherwise occur secondary to compensatory renin release. 
Hypotension that occurs as a result of this mechanism can be corrected by
volume expansion.  
 <p>
INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS 
 <p>
PREGNANCY: Female patients of childbearing age should be told about the
consequences of second- and third-trimester exposure to ACE inhibitors, and
they should also be told that these consequences do not appear to have resulted 
from intrauterine ACE inhibitor exposure that has been limited to the first
trimester. These patients should be asked to report pregnancies to their
physicians as soon as possible.  
 <p>
ANGIOEDEMA: Angioedema, including laryngeal edema, can occur with treatment
with ACE inhibitors, especially following the first dose. Patients should be so 
advised and told to report immediately any signs or symptoms suggesting
angioedema (swelling of face, eyes, lips, or tongue, or difficulty in
breathing) and to take no more drug until they have consulted with the
prescribing physician.  
 <p>
SYMPTOMATIC HYPOTENSION: Patients should be cautioned that lightheadedness can
occur, especially during the first days of therapy, and it should be reported
to the prescribing physician. Patients should be told that if syncope occurs,
Benazepril should be discontinued until the prescribing physician has been
consulted.  <p>
 
All patients should be cautioned that inadequate fluid intake or excessive
perspiration, diarrhea, or vomiting can lead to an excessive fall in blood
pressure, with the same consequences of lightheadedness and possible syncope. 
 <p>
HYPERKALEMIA: Patients should be told not to use potassium supplements or salt
substitutes containing potassium without consulting the prescribing physician.  
 <p>
NEUTROPENIA:  Patients should be told to promptly report any indication of
infection (e.g., sore throat, fever), which could be a sign of neutropenia.  
 <p>
DRUG INTERACTIONS 
 <p>
DIURETICS: Patients on diuretics, especially those in whom diuretic therapy was 
recently instituted, may occasionally experience an excessive reduction of
blood pressure after initiation of therapy with Benazepril. The possibility of
hypotensive effects with Benazepril can be minimized by either discontinuing the
diuretic or increasing the salt intake prior to initiation of treatment with
Benazepril. If this is not possible, the starting dose should be reduced (see
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).  
 <p>
POTASSIUM SUPPLEMENTS AND POTASSIUM-SPARING DIURETICS: Benazepril can attenuate
potassium loss caused by thiazide diuretics. Potassium-sparing diuretics
(spironolactone, amiloride, triamterene, and others) or potassium supplements
can increase the risk of hyperkalemia. Therefore, if concomitant use of such
agents is indicated, they should be given with caution, and the patient's serum 
potassium should be monitored frequently.  
 <p>
ORAL ANTICOAGULANTS: Interaction studies with warfarin and acenocoumarol failed 
to identify any clinically important effects on the serum concentrations or
clinical effects of these anticoagulants.  
 <p>
LITHIUM: Increased serum lithium levels and symptoms of lithium toxicity have
been reported in patients receiving ACE inhibitors during therapy with lithium. 
These drugs should be coadministered with caution, and frequent monitoring of
serum lithium levels is recommended. If a diuretic is also used, the risk of
lithium toxicity may be increased.  
 <p>
OTHER: No clinically important pharmacokinetic interactions occurred when
Benazepril was administered concomitantly with hydrochlorothiazide,
chlorthalidone, furosemide, digoxin, propranolol, atenolol, naproxen, or
cimetidine.  
 <p>
Benazepril has been used concomitantly with beta-adrenergic-blocking agents,
calcium-channel-blocking agents, diuretics, digoxin, and hydralazine, without
evidence of clinically important adverse interactions. Benazepril, like other
ACE inhibitors, has had less than additive effects with beta-adrenergic
blockers, presumably because both drugs lower blood pressure by inhibiting
parts of the renin-angiotensin system.  
 <p>
CARCINOGENSIS, MUTAGENESIS, IMPAIRMENT OF FERTILITY 
 <p>
No evidence of carcinogenicity was found when benazepril was administered to
rats and mice for up to two years at doses of up to 150 mg/kg/day. When
compared on the basis of body weights, this dose is 110 times the maximum
recommended human dose. When compared on the basis of body surface areas, this
dose is 18 and 9 times (rats and mice, respectively) the maximum recommended
human dose (calculations assume a patient weight of 60 kg). No mutagenic
activity was detected in the Ames test in bacteria (with or without metabolic
activation), in an in vitro test for forward mutations in cultured mammalian
cells, or in a nucleus anomaly test. In doses of 50-500 mg/kg/day (6-60 times
the maximum recommended human dose based on mg/m(square) comparison and 37-375
times the maximum recommended human dose based on a mg/kg comparison), Benazepril 
had no adverse effect on the reproductive performance of male and female rats.  
 <p>
PREGNANCY CATEGORIES C (FIRST TRIMESTER) AND D (SECOND AND THIRD TRIMESTERS) 
 <p>
See WARNINGS, Fetal/Neonatal Morbidity and Mortality.  
 <p>
NURSING MOTHERS 
 <p>
Minimal amounts of unchanged benazepril and of benazeprilat are excreted into
the breast milk of lactating women treated with benazepril. A newborn child
ingesting entirely breast milk would receive less than 0.1% of the mg/kg
maternal dose of benazepril and benazeprilat.  
 <p>
GERIATRIC USE 
 <p>
Of the total number of patients who received benazepril in U.S. clinical
studies of Benazepril, 18% were 65 or older while 2% were 75 or older. No overall 
differences in effectiveness or safety were observed between these patients and 
younger patients, and other reported clinical experience has not identified
differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater
sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.  
 <p>
PEDIATRIC USE

Safety and effectiveness in children have not been established.

<a name="ADVERSE REACTIONS"></a><b>ADVERSE REACTIONS 
</b> <p>
Benazepril has been evaluated for safety in over 6000 patients with hypertension; 
over 700 of these patients were treated for at least one year. The overall
incidence of reported adverse events was comparable in Benazepril and placebo
patients.  <p>
 
The reported side effects were generally mild and transient, and there was no
relation between side effects and age, duration of therapy, or total dosage
within the range of 2 to 80 mg. Discontinuation of therapy because of a side
effect was required in approximately 5% of U.S. patients treated with Benazepril
and in 3% of patients treated with placebo.  
 <p>
The most common reasons for discontinuation were headache (0.6%) and cough
(0.5%). (See PRECAUTIONS, Cough).

Other adverse experiences reported in controlled clinical trials (in less than
1% of benazepril patients), and rarer events seen in postmarketing experience,
include the following (in some, a causal relationship to drug use is
uncertain):  
 </pre><p>
CARDIOVASCULAR: Symptomatic hypotension was seen in 0.3% of patients, postural
hypotension in 0.4%, and syncope in 0.1%; these reactions led to
discontinuation of therapy in 4 patients who had received benazepril
monotherapy and in 9 patients who had received benazepril with
hydrochlorothiazide (see PRECAUTIONS and WARNINGS). Other reports include
angina pectoris, palpitations, and peripheral edema.  
 <p>
RENAL: Of hypertensive patients with no apparent preexisting renal disease,
about 2% have sustained increases in serum creatinine to at least 150% of their 
baseline values while receiving Benazepril, but most of these increases have
disappeared despite continuing treatment. A much smaller fraction of these
patients (less than 0.1%) developed simultaneous (usually transient) increases
in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine.  
 <p>
FETAL/NEONATAL MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY:  See WARNINGS, Fetal/Neonatal Morbidity 
and Mortality.  
 <p>
ANGIOEDEMA: Angioedema has been reported in patients receiving ACE inhibitors.  
During clinical trials in hypertensive patients with benazepril, 0.5% of
patients experienced edema of the lips or face without other manifestations of
angioedema. Angioedema associated with laryngeal edema and/or shock may be
fatal. If angioedema of the face, extremities, lips, tongue, or glottis and/or
larynx occurs, treatment with Benazepril should be discontinued and appropriate
therapy instituted immediately (see WARNINGS).  
 <p>
GASTROINTESTINAL: Constipation, gastritis, vomiting, and melena.  
 <p>
DERMATOLOGIC: Apparent hypersensitivity reactions (manifested by dermatitis,
pruritus, or rash), photosensitivity and flushing.  
 <p>
NEUROLOGIC AND PSYCHIATRIC: Anxiety, decreased libido, hypertonia, insomnia,
nervousness, and paresthesia.  
 <p>
OTHER: Arthralgia, arthritis, asthenia, asthma, bronchitis, dyspnea, impotence, 
infection, myalgia, sinusitis, sweating, and urinary tract infection.  
 <p>
CLINICAL LABORATORY TEST FINDINGS 
 <p>
CREATININE AND BLOOD UREA NITROGEN: Of hypertensive patients with no apparent
preexisting renal disease, about 2% have sustained increases in serum
creatinine to at least 150% of their baseline values while receiving Benazepril,
but most of these increases have disappeared despite continuing treatment. A
much smaller fraction of these patients (less than 0.1%) developed simultaneous 
(usually transient) increases in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine. None 
of these increases required discontinuation of treatment. Increases in these
laboratory values are more likely to occur in patients with renal insufficiency 
or those pretreated with a diuretic and, based on experience with other ACE
inhibitors, would be expected to be especially likely in patients with renal
artery stenosis (see PRECAUTIONS, General).  
 <p>
POTASSIUM: Since benazepril decreases aldosterone secretion, elevation of serum 
potassium can occur. Potassium supplements and potassium-sparing diuretics
should be given with caution, and the patient's serum potassium should be
monitored frequently (see PRECAUTIONS).  
 <p>
HEMOGLOBIN: Decreases in hemoglobin (a low value and a decrease of 5 g/dL) were 
rare, occurring in only 1 of 2014 patients receiving Benazepril alone and in 1 of 
1357 patients receiving Benazepril plus a diuretic. No U.S. patients discontinued 
treatment because of decreases in hemoglobin.  
 <p>
OTHER (CAUSAL RELATIONSHIPS UNKNOWN): Clinically important changes in standard
laboratory tests were rarely associated with Benazepril administration.
Elevations of uric acid, blood glucose, serum bilirubin, and liver enzymes (see 
WARNINGS) have been reported, as have scattered incidents of hyponatremia,
electrocardiographic changes, leukopenia, eosinophilia, and proteinuria. In
U.S.  trials, less than 0.5% of patients discontinued treatment because of
laboratory abnormalities.  
 <p>
<a name="OVERDOSAGE"></a><b>OVERDOSAGE 
</b><p> 
Single oral doses of 3 g/kg benazepril were associated with significant
lethality in mice. Rats however, tolerated single oral doses of up to 6 g/kg. 
Reduced activity was seen at 1 g/kg in mice and at 5 g/kg in rats. Human
overdoses of benazepril have not been reported, but the most common
manifestation of human benazepril overdosage is likely to be hypotension.  
 <p>
Laboratory determinations of serum levels of benazepril and its metabolities
are not widely available, and such determinations have, in any event, no
established role in the management of benazepril overdose.  
 <p>
No data are available to suggest physiological maneuvers (e.g., maneuvers to
change the pH of the urine) that might accelerate elimination of benazepril and 
its metabolities. Benazepril is only slightly dialyzable, but dialysis might be 
considered in overdosed patients with severly impaired renal function (see
WARNINGS).  
 <p>
Angiotensin II could presumbably serve as a specific antagonist-antidote in the 
setting of benazepril overdose, but angiotensin II is essentially unavailable
outside of scattered research facilities. Because the hypotensive effect of
benazepril is achieved through vasodilation and effective hypovolemia, it is
reasonable to treat benazepril overdose by infusion of normal saline solution.  
 <p>
<a name="DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION"></a><b>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION 
</b><p> 
The recommended initial dose for patients not receiving a diuretic is 10 mg
once-a-day. The usual maintenance dosage range is 20-40 mg per day administered 
as a single dose or in two equally divided doses. A dose of 80 mg gives an
increased response, but experience with this dose is limited. The divided
regimen was more effective in controlling trough (pre-dosing) blood pressure
than the same dose given as a once-daily regimen. Dosage adjustment should be
based on measurement of peak (2-6 hours after dosing) and trough responses. If
a once-daily regimen does not give adequate trough response an increase in
dosage or divided administration should be considered. If blood pressure is not 
controlled with Benazepril alone, a diuretic can be added.  
 <p>
Total daily doses above 80 mg have not been evaluated.  
 <p>
Concomitant administration of Benazepril with potassium supplements, potassium
salt substitutes, or potassium-sparing diuretics can lead to increases of serum 
potassium (see PRECAUTIONS).  
 <p>
In patients who are currently being treated with a diuretic, symptomatic
hypotension occasionally can occur following the initial dose of Benazepril. To
reduce the likelihood of hypotension, the diuretic should, if possible, be
discontinued two to three days prior to beginning therapy with Benazepril (see
WARNINGS). Then, if blood pressure is not controlled with Benazepril alone,
diuretic therapy should be resumed.  
 <p>
If the diuretic cannot be discontinued, an initial dose of 5 mg Benazepril should 
be used to avoid excessive hypotension.  
 <p>
DOSAGE ADJUSTMENT IN RENAL IMPAIRMENT 
 <p>
For patients with a creatinine clearance &lt;30 mL/min/1.73 m(square) (serum
creatinine &gt;3 mg/dL), the recommended initial dose is 5 mg Benazepril once daily. 
Dosage may be titrated upward until blood pressure is controlled or to a
maximum total daily dose of 40 mg (see WARNINGS).

Alcohol 8%
Each tablet for oral administration contains:
Methadone Hydrochloride : 5 mg or 10 mg
(WARNING: May be habit forming)</pre>

<p>Chemically, Methadone Hydrochloride is 3-Heptanone,6-(dimethylamino)-4,4-
diphenyl- ,hydrochloride. Methadone Hydrochloride acts as a narcotic analgesic.
</p>

<p><a name="ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY"></a>ACTIONS/CLINICAL
PHARMACOLOGY
</p>

<p>Methadone Hydrochloride is a synthetic narcotic analgesic with multiple
actions quantitatively similar to those of morphine, the most prominent
of which involve the central nervous system and organs composed of smooth
muscle. The principal actions of therapeutic value are analgesia and sedation
and detoxification or temporary maintenance in narcotic addiction. The
methadone abstinence syndrome, although qualitatively similar to that of
morphine, differs in that the onset is slower, the course is more prolonged,
and the symptoms are less severe. </p>

<p>When administered orally, methadone is approximately one-half as potent
as when given parenterally. Oral administration results in a delay of the
onset, a lowering of the peak, and an increase in the duration of analgesic
effect. </p>

<p><a name="INDICATIONS AND USAGE"></a><b>INDICATIONS AND USAGE
</b></p>

<p>Methadone Hydrochloride is indicated for relief of severe pain, for
detoxification treatment of narcotic addiction, and for temporary maintenance
treatment of narcotic addiction.</p>

<pre>
                   
                                                                  
                     NOTE                                         
                     If methadone is administered for treatment   
                     of heroin dependence for more than three     
                     weeks, the procedure passes from treatment   
                     of the acute withdrawal syndrome             
                     (detoxification) to maintenance therapy.     
                     Maintenance treatment is permitted to be     
                     undertaken only by approved methadone        
                     programs. This does not preclude the         
                     maintenance treatment of an addict who is    
                     hospitalized for medical conditions other    
                     than addiction and who requires temporary    
                     maintenance during the critical period of    
                     his stay or whose enrollment has been        
                     verified in a program which has approval

                     dispensed, be packaged in child-resistant    
                     containers and kept out of the reach of      
                     children to prevent accidental ingestion.    
                                                                  
                   </pre>

<p>Methadone Hydrochloride, a narcotic, is a Schedule II controlled substance
under the Federal Controlled Substances Act. Appropriate security measures
should be taken to safeguard stocks of methadone against diversion. </p>

<p>DRUG DEPENDENCE -- METHADONE CAN PRODUCE DRUG DEPENDENCE OF
THE MORPHINE
TYPE AND, THEREFORE, HAS THE POTENTIAL FOR BEING ABUSED. PSYCHIC
DEPENDENCE,
PHYSICAL DEPENDENCE, AND TOLERANCE MAY DEVELOP UPON REPEATED
ADMINISTRATION
OF METHADONE, AND IT SHOULD BE PRESCRIBED AND ADMINISTERED WITH
THE SAME
DEGREE OF CAUTION APPROPRIATE TO THE USE OF MORPHINE. </p>

<p>Interaction With Other Central-Nervous-System Depressants--Methadone
should be used with caution and in reduced dosage in patients who are concurrently
receiving other narcotic analgesics, general anesthetics, phenothiazines,
other tranquilizers, sedative-hypnotics, tricyclic antidepressants, and
other C.N.S. depressants (including alcohol). Respiratory depression, hypotension,
and profound sedation or coma may result. </p>

<p>Anxiety--Since methadone, as used by tolerant subjects at a constant
maintenance dosage, is not a tranquilizer, patients who are maintained
on this drug will react to life problems and stresses with the same symptoms
of anxiety as do other individuals. The physician should not confuse such
symptoms with those of narcotic abstinence and should not attempt to treat
anxiety by increasing the dosage of methadone. The action of methadone
in maintenance treatment is limited to the control of narcotic symptoms
and is ineffective for relief of general anxiety. </p>

<p>Head Injury And Increased Intracranial Pressure- -The respiratory depressant
effects of methadone and its capacity to elevate cerebrospinal-fluid pressure
may be markedly exaggerated in the presence of increased intracranial pressure.
Furthermore, narcotics produce side effects that may obscure the clinical
course of patients with head injuries. In such patients, methadone must
be used with caution and only if it is deemed essential. </p>

<p>Asthma And Other Respiratory Conditions- -Methadone should be used with
caution in patients having an acute asthmatic attack, in those with chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and in individuals with
a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, preexisting respiratory
depression, hypoxia, or hypercapnia. In such patients, even usual therapeutic
doses of narcotics may decrease respiratory drive while simultaneously
increasing airway resistance to the point of apnea. </p>

<p>Hypotensive Effect--The administration of methadone may result in severe
hypotension in an individual whose ability to maintain his blood pressure
has already been compromised by a depleted blood volume or concurrent administration
of such drugs as the phenothiazines or certain anesthetics. </p>

<p>Use In Ambulatory Patients--Methadone may impair the mental and/or physical
abilities required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks,
such as driving a car or operating machinery. The patient should be cautioned
accordingly. </p>

<p>Methadone, like other narcotics, may produce orthostatic hypotension
in ambulatory patients. </p>

<p>Use In Pregnancy--Safe use in pregnancy has not been established in
relation to possible adverse effects on fetal development. Therefore, methadone
should not be used in pregnant women unless, in the judgment of the physician,
the potential benefits outweigh the possible hazards. </p>

<p>Methadone is not recommended for obstetric analgesia because its long
duration of action increases the probability of respiratory depression
in the newborn. Use In Children--Methadone is not recommended for use as
an analgesic in children, since documented clinical experience has been
insufficient to establish a suitable dosage regimen for the pediatric age
group. </p>

<p><a name="PRECAUTIONS"></a><b>PRECAUTIONS </b></p>

<p>INTERACTION WITH PENTAZOCINE--PATIENTS WHO ARE ADDICTED TO
HEROIN OR
WHO ARE ON THE METHADONE MAINTENANCE PROGRAM MAY EXPERIENCE
WITHDRAWAL
SYMPTOMS WHEN GIVEN PENTAZOCINE. </p>

<p>Interaction With Rifampin--The concurrent administration of rifampin
may possibly reduce the blood concentration of methadone. The mechanism
by which rifampin may decrease blood concentrations of methadone is not
fully understood, although enhanced microsomal drug- metabolized enzymes
may influence drug disposition. </p>

<p>Acute Abdominal Conditions--The administration of methadone or other
narcotics may obscure the diagnosis or clinical course in patients with
acute abdominal conditions. </p>

<p>Interaction With Monoamine Oxidase (MAO) Inhibitors--Therapeutic Doses
Of Meperidine Have Precipitated Severe reactions in patients concurrently
receiving monoamine oxidase inhibitors or those who have received such
agents within 14 days. Similar reactions thus far have not been reported
with methadone; but if the use of methadone is necessary in such patients,
a sensitivity test should be performed in which repeated small incremental
doses are administered over the course of several hours while the patient's
condition and vital signs are under careful observation. </p>

<p>Special-Risk Patients--Methadone should be given with caution and the
initial dose should be reduced in certain patients, such as the elderly
or debilitated and those with severe impairment of hepatic or renal function,
hypothyroidism, Addison's disease, prostatic hypertrophy, or urethral stricture.

</p>

<p><a name="ADVERSE REACTIONS"></a><b>ADVERSE REACTIONS </b></p>

<p>THE MAJOR HAZARDS OF METHADONE, AS OF OTHER NARCOTIC
ANALGESICS, ARE
RESPIRATORY DEPRESSION AND, TO A LESSER DEGREE, CIRCULATORY
DEPRESSION.
RESPIRATORY ARREST, SHOCK, AND CARDIAC ARREST HAVE OCCURRED. </p>

<p>The most frequently observed adverse reactions include lightheadedness,
dizziness, sedation, nausea, vomiting, and sweating. These effects seem
to be more prominent in ambulatory patients and in those who are not suffering
severe chronic pain. In such individuals, lower doses are advisable. Some
adverse reactions may be alleviated in the ambulatory patient if he lies
down. </p>

<p>Other adverse reactions include the following: </p>

<p>Central Nervous System--Euphoria, dysphoria, weakness, headache, insomnia,
agitation, disorientation, and visual disturbances. </p>

<p>Gastrointestinal--Dry mouth, anorexia, constipation, and biliary tract
spasm. </p>

<p>Cardiovascular--Flushing of the face, bradycardia, palpitation, faintness,
and syncope. </p>

<p>Genitourinary--Urinary retention or hesitancy, antidiuretic effect,
and reduced libido and/or potency. </p>

<p>Allergic--Pruritus, urticaria, other skin rashes, edema, and, rarely,
hemorrhagic urticaria. </p>

<p><a name="OVERDOSAGE"></a><b>OVERDOSAGE </b></p>

<p>Symptoms--Serious overdosage of methadone is characterized by respiratory
depression (a decrease in respiratory rate and/or tidal volume, Cheyne-Stokes
respiration, cyanosis), extreme somnolence progressing to stupor or coma,
maximally constricted pupils, skeletal-muscle flaccidity, cold and clammy
skin, and sometimes, bradycardia and hypotension. In severe overdosage,
particularly by the intravenous route, apnea, circulatory collapse, cardiac
arrest, and death may occur. </p>

<p>Treatment--Primary attention should be given to the reestablishment
of adequate respiratory exchange through provision of a patent airway and
institution of assisted or controlled ventilation. If a nontolerant person,
especially a child, takes a large dose of methadone, effective narcotic
antagonists are available to counteract the potentially lethal respiratory
depression. </p>

<p>THE PHYSICIAN MUST REMEMBER, HOWEVER, THAT METHADONE IS A
LONG-ACTING
DEPRESSANT (36 TO 48 HOURS), WHEREAS THE ANTAGONISTS ACT FOR MUCH
SHORTER
PERIODS (ONE TO THREE HOURS). </p>

<p>The patient must, therefore, be monitored continuously for recurrence
of respiratory depression and treated repeatedly with the narcotic antagonist
as needed. If the diagnosis is correct and respiratory depression is due
only to overdosage of methadone, the use of other respiratory stimulants
is not indicated. </p>

<p>An antagonist should not be administered in the absence of clinically
significant respiratory or cardiovascular depression. Intravenously administered
narcotic antagonists (naloxone and nalorphine) are the drugs of choice
to reverse signs of intoxication. These agents should be given repeatedly
until the patient's status remains satisfactory. The hazard that the narcotic
agent will further depress respiration is less likely with the use of naloxone.
</p>

<p>Oxygen, intravenous fluids, vasopressors, and other supportive measures
should be employed as indicated.</p>

<p><a name="DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION"></a><b>DOSAGE AND
ADMINISTRATION
</b></p>

<p>For Relief Of Severe Pain--Dosage should be adjusted according to the
severity of the pain and the response of the patient. Occasionally it may
be necessary to exceed the usual dosage recommended in cases of exceptionally
severe chronic pain or in those patients who have become tolerant to the
analgesic effect of narcotics. </p>

<p>For severe acute pain, the usual adult dose is 2.5 mg to 10 mg every
three to four hours as necessary. </p>

<p>For Detoxification Treatment--THE DRUG SHALL BE ADMINISTERED DAILY UNDER
CLOSE SUPERVISION AS FOLLOWS: </p>

<p>A detoxification treatment course shall not exceed 21 days and may not
be repeated earlier than four weeks after completion of the preceding course.
The oral form of administration is preferred. However, if the patient is
unable to ingest oral medication, he may be started on the parenteral form
initially. In detoxification, the patient may receive methadone when there
are significant symptoms of withdrawal. The dosage schedules indicated
below are recommended but could be varied in accordance with clinical judgment.
Initially, a single dose of 15 to 20 mg of methadone will often be sufficient
to suppress withdrawal symptoms. Additional methadone may be provided if
withdrawal symptoms are not suppressed or if symptoms reappear. When patients
are physically dependent on high doses, it may be necessary to exceed these
levels. Forty mg per day in single or divided doses will usually constitute
an adequate stabilizing dosage level. Stabilization can be continued for
two to three days, and then the amount of methadone normally will be gradually
decreased. The rate at which methadone is decreased will be determined
separately for each patient. The dose of methadone can be decreased on
a daily basis or at two-day intervals, but the amount of intake shall always
be sufficient to keep withdrawal symptoms at a tolerable level. In hospitalized
patients, a daily reduction of 20 percent of the total dose may be tolerated
and may cause little discomfort. In ambulatory patients, a somewhat slower
schedule may be needed. If methadone is administered for more than three
weeks, the procedure is considered to have progressed from detoxification
or treatment of the acute withdrawal syndrome to maintenance treatment,
even though the goal and intent may be eventual total withdrawal. </p>

<p>Aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) an analgesic, antipyretic, and anti-inflammatory
agent is chemically, 2-(Acetyloxy)benzoic acid. </p>

<p><a name="ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY"></a><b>ACTIONS/CLINICAL
PHARMACOLOGY
</b></p>

<p>Aspirin is a salicylate that has demonstrated antiinflammatory, analgesic,
antipyretic, and antirheumatic activity. Aspirin's mode of action as an
antiinflammatory and antirheumatic agent may be due to inhibition of synthesis
and release of prostaglandins. Aspirin appears to produce analgesia by
virtue of both a peripheral and CNS effect. Peripherally, aspirin acts
by inhibiting the synthesis and release of prostaglandins. Acting centrally,
it would appear to produce analgesia at a hypothalamic site in the brain,
although the mode of action is not known. Aspirin also acts on the hypothalamus
to produce antipyresis; heat dissipation is increased as a result of vasodilation
and increased peripheral blood flow. Aspirin's antipyretic activity may
also be related to inhibition of synthesis and release of prostaglandins.
In a crossover study, Enteric Coated Aspirin at a dose of one tablet (15
grains) three times a day produced an average fecal blood loss of 1.54
ml per day. Uncoated aspirin at a dosage of three 5-grain tablets given
three times a day caused an average fecal blood loss of 4.33 ml per day.
Aspirin is rapidly hydrolyzed primarily in the liver to salicylic acid,
which is conjugated with glycine (forming salicyluric acid) and glucuronic
acid and excreted largely in the urine. As a result of the rapid hydrolysis,
plasma concentrations of aspirin are always low and rarely exceed 20 mcg/ml
at ordinary therapeutic doses. The peak salicylate level for uncoated aspirin
occurs in about 2 hours; however with enteric coated aspirin tablets this
is delayed. A direct correlation between salicylate plasma levels and clinical
analgesic effectiveness has not been definitely established, but effective
analgesia is usually achieved at plasma levels of 15 to 30 mg per 100 ml.
Effective antiinflammatory activity is usually achieved at salicylate plasma
levels of 20 to 30 mg per 100 ml. There is also poor correlation between
toxic symptoms and plasma salicylate concentrations, but most patients
exhibit symptoms of salicylism at plasma salicylate levels of 35 mg per
100 ml. The plasma half-life for aspirin is approximately 15 minutes; that
for salicylate lengthens as the dose increases: Doses of 300 to 650 mg
have a half-life of 3.1 to 3.2 hours; with doses of 1 gram, the half-life
is increased to 5 hours and with 2 grams it is increased to about 9 hours.
Salicylates are excreted mainly by the kidney. Studies in man indicate
that salicylate is excreted in the urine as free salicylic acid (10%),
salicyluric acid (75%), salicylic phenolic (10%) and acyl (5%) glucuronides
and gentisic acid (&lt;1%). </p>

<p><a name="INDICATIONS AND USAGE"></a><b>INDICATIONS AND USAGE
</b></p>

<p>Analgesic, antipyretic, anti-inflammatory. For the temporary relief
of headache; painful discomfort and fever of colds; muscular aches and
pains; temporary relief of minor pains of arthritis; toothache, and pain
following dental procedures; menstrual pain. </p>

<p>ANTIARTHRITIC EFFECT </p>

<p>Conditions requiring chronic or long-term aspirin therapy for pain and/or
inflammation, e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis,
systemic lupus erythematosus, osteoarthritis (degenerative joint disease),
ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, Reiter's syndrome, and fibrositis.
</p>

<p>ANTIPLATELET EFFECT </p>

<p>IN MI PROPHYLAXIS: </p>

<p>Aspirin is indicated to reduce the risk of death and/or nonfatal myocardial
infarction in patients with a previous infarction or unstable angina pectoris.
</p>

<p>IN TRANSIENT ISCHEMIC ATTACKS: </p>

<p>Aspirin is indicated for reducing the risk of recurrent transient ischemic
attacks (TIAs) or stroke in men who have transient ischemia of the brain
due to fibrin emboli. There is no evidence that aspirin is effective in
reducing TIAs in women, or is of benefit in the treatment of completed
strokes in men or women. </p>

<p><a name="CONTRAINDICATIONS"></a><b>CONTRAINDICATIONS </b></p>

<p>Aspirin should not be used in patients who have previously exhibited
hypersensitivity to aspirin and/or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents.
Aspirin should not be given to patients with a recent history of gastrointestinal
bleeding or in patients with bleeding disorders (e.g., hemophilia). </p>

<p><a name="PRECAUTIONS"></a><b>PRECAUTIONS </b></p>

<p>IN TRANSIENT ISCHEMIC ATTACKS: </p>

<p>Patients presenting with signs and/or symptoms of TIAs should have a
complete medical and neurologic evaluation. Consideration should be given
to other disorders which may resemble TIAs. It is important to evaluate
and treat, if appropriate, diseases associated with TIAs and stroke, such
as hypertension and diabetes. </p>

<p>Concurrent administration of absorbable antacids at therapeutic doses
may increase the clearance of salicylates in some individuals. The concurrent
administration of nonabsorbable antacids may alter the rate of absorption
of aspirin, thereby resulting in a decreased acetylsalicylic acid/salicylate
ratio in plasma. The clinical significance of these decreases in available
aspirin is unknown. </p>

<p>Aspirin at dosages of 1,000 milligrams per day has been associated with
small increases in blood pressure, blood urea nitrogen, and serum uric
acid levels. It is recommended that patients placed on long-term aspirin
treatment be seen at regular intervals to assess changes in these measurements.
</p>

<p>Sodium excretion produced by spironolactone may be decreased in the
presence of salicylates. </p>

<p><a name="WARNINGS"></a><b>WARNINGS </b></p>

<p>CHILDREN AND TEENAGERS SHOULD NOT USE THIS MEDICINE FOR CHICKEN
POX
OR FLU SYMPTOMS BEFORE A DOCTOR IS CONSULTED ABOUT REYE SYNDROME,
A RARE
BUT SERIOUS ILLNESS REPORTED TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH ASPIRIN. Do not take
this product for pain for more than 10 days or for fever for more than
3 days unless directed by a doctor. If pain or fever persists or gets worse,
if new symptoms occur, or if redness or swelling is present consult a doctor
because these could be signs of a serious condition. Do not take this product
if you are allergic to aspirin, have asthma, stomach problems that persist
or recur, gastric ulcers or bleeding problems unless directed by a doctor.
If ringing in the ears or loss of hearing occurs, consult a doctor before
taking any more of this product. Keep this and all drugs out of the reach
of children. In case of accidental overdose, seek professional assistance
or contact a poison control center immediately. As with any drug, if you
are pregnant or nursing a baby, seek the advice of a health professional
before using this product. IT IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT NOT TO USE ASPIRIN
DURING THE LAST 3 MONTHS OF PREGNANCY UNLESS SPECIFICALLY DIRECTED
TO DO
SO BY A DOCTOR BECAUSE IT MAY CAUSE PROBLEMS IN THE UNBORN CHILD OR
COMPLICATIONS
DURING DELIVERY. </p>

<p>Aspirin should be used with caution when anticoagulants are prescribed
concurrently, for aspirin may depress the concentration of prothrombin
in plasma and thereby increase bleeding time. Large doses of salicylates
have a hypoglycemic action and may enhance the effect of the oral hypoglycemics.
Consequently, they should not be given concomitantly; if however, this
is necessary, the dosage of the hypoglycemic agent must be reduced while
the salicylate is given. This hypoglycemic action may also affect the insulin
requirements of diabetics. Although salicylates in large doses are uricosuric
agents, smaller amounts may decrease the uricosuric effects of probenecid,
sulfinpyrazone, and phenylbutazone. </p>

<p><a name="DRUG INTERACTIONS"></a><b>DRUG INTERACTIONS </b></p>

<p>Anticoagulants: See WARNINGS section. 
<br>Hypoglycemic Agents: See WARNINGS section. 
<br>Uricosuric Agents: Aspirin may decrease the effects of probenecid,
sulfinpyrazone, and phenylbutazone. 
<br>Spironolactone: See PRECAUTIONS section. 
<br>Alcohol: Has a synergistic effect with aspirin in causing gastrointestinal
bleeding. 
<br>Corticosteroids: Concomitant administration with aspirin may increase
the risk of gastrointestinal ulceration and may reduce serum salicylate
levels. 
<br>Pyrazolone Derivatives (phenylbutazone, oxyphenbutazone, and possibly
dipyrone): Concomitant administration with aspirin may increase the risk
of gastrointestinal ulceration. 
<br>Nonsteroidal Antiinflammatory Agents: Aspirin is contraindicated in
patients who are hypersensitive to nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents.

<br>Urinary Alkalinizers: Decrease aspirin effectiveness by increasing
the rate of salicylate renal excretion. 
<br>Phenobarbital: Decreases aspirin effectiveness by enzyme induction.

<br>Phenytoin: Serum phenytoin levels may be increased by aspirin. 
<br>Propranolol: May decrease aspirin's antiinflammatory action by competing
for the same receptors. Antacids: Enteric Coated Aspirin should not be
given concurrently with antacids, since an increase in the pH of the stomach
may effect the enteric coating of the tablets. </p>

<p>CLINICAL STUDIES </p>

<p>IN MI PROPHYLAXIS </p>

<p>CLINICAL TRIALS: The indication is supported by the results of six large
randomized, multicenter, placebo-controlled studies (REF. 1-7) involving
10,816 predominantly male post-myocardial infarction (MI) patients and
one randomized placebo-controlled study of 1,266 men with unstable angina.
Therapy with aspirin was begun at intervals after the onset of acute MI
varying from less than three days to more than five years and continuing
for periods of from less than one year to four years. In the unstable angina
study, treatment was started within one month after the onset of unstable
angina and continued for 12 weeks, and complicating conditions, such as
congestive heart failure, were not included in the study. </p>

<p>Aspirin therapy in MI patients was associated with about a 20% reduction
in the risk of subsequent death and/or nonfatal reinfarction, a median
absolute decrease of 3% from the 12% to 22% event rates in the placebo
groups. In the aspirin-treated unstable angina patients, the reduction
in risk was about 50%, a reduction in the event rate of 5% from the 10%
rate in the placebo group over the 12 weeks of study. </p>

<p>Daily dosage of aspirin in the post-myocardial infarction studies was
300 mg in one study and 900-1,500 mg in five studies. A dose of 325 mg
was used in the study of unstable angina. </p>

<p>IN TRANSIENT ISCHEMIC ATTACKS: </p>

<p>CLINICAL TRIALS: The indication is supported by the results of a Canadian
study (REF. 8) in which 585 patients with threatened stroke were followed
in a randomized clinical trial for an average of 28 months to determine
whether aspirin or sulfinpyrazone, singly or in combination, was superior
to placebo in preventing transient ischemic attacks, stroke, or death.
The study showed that, although sulfinpyrazone had no statistically significant
effect, aspirin reduced the risk of continuing transient ischemic attacks,
stroke, or death by 19 percent and reduced the risk of stroke or death
by 31 percent. Another aspirin study carried out in the United States with
178 patients showed a statistically significant number of &quot;favorable
outcomes,&quot; including reduced transient ischemic attacks, stroke, and
death.(REF. 9) </p>

<p><a name="ADVERSE REACTIONS"></a><b>ADVERSE REACTIONS </b></p>

<p>ANTIPLATELET EFFECT </p>

<p>IN MI PROPHYLAXIS: </p>

<p>Gastrointestinal reactions: Doses of 1,000 mg per day of aspirin caused
gastrointestinal symptoms and bleeding that, in some cases, were clinically
significant. In the largest postinfarction study (the Aspirin Myocardial
Infarction Study (AMIS) with 4,500 people), the percentage of incidences
of gastrointestinal symptoms for the aspirin (1,000 mg of a standard, solid-tablet
formulation) and placebo-treated subjects, respectively, were stomach pain
(14.5%, 4.4%), heartburn (11.9%, 4.8%), nausea and/or vomiting (7.6%, 2.1%),
hospitalization for GI disorder (4.9%, 3.5%). In the AMIS and other trials,
aspirin-treated patients had increased rates of gross gastrointestinal
bleeding. Symptoms and signs of gastrointestinal irritation were not significantly
increased in subjects treated for unstable angina with buffered aspirin
in solution. </p>

<p>CARDIOVASCULAR AND BIOCHEMICAL: In the AMIS trial, the dosage of 1,000
mg per day of aspirin was associated with small increases in systolic blood
pressure (BP) (average 1.5 to 2.1 mm) and diastolic BP (0.5 to 0.6 mm),
depending upon whether maximal or last available readings were used. Blood
urea nitrogen and uric acid levels were also increased but by less than
1.0 mg percent. Subjects with marked hypertension or renal insufficiency
had been excluded from the trial so that the clinical importance of these
observations for such subjects or for any subjects treated over more prolonged
periods is not known. It is recommended that patients placed on long-term
aspirin treatment, even at doses of 300 mg per day, be seen at regular
intervals to assess changes in these measurements. </p>

<p>IN TRANSIENT ISCHEMIC ATTACKS: </p>

<p>At dosages of 1,000 milligrams or higher of aspirin per day, gastrointestinal
side effects include stomach pain, heartburn, nausea and/or vomiting, as
well as increased rates of gross gastrointestinal bleeding. </p>

<p><a name="OVERDOSAGE"></a><b>OVERDOSAGE </b></p>

<p>Overdosage of 200 to 500 mg/kg is in the fatal range. Early symptoms
are CNS stimulation with vomiting, hyperpnea, hyperactivity, and possibly
convulsions. This progresses quickly to depression, coma, respiratory failure,
and collapse. These symptoms are accompanied by severe electrolyte disturbances.
In the treatment of salicylate overdosage, intensive supportive therapy
should be instituted immediately. Plasma salicylate levels should be measured
in order to determine the severity of the poisoning and to provide a guide
for therapy. Emptying of the stomach should be accomplished as soon as
possible with ipecac syrup unless the patient is depressed. In depressed
patients use airway protected gastric lavage. Delay absorption with activated
charcoal and give a saline cathartic. Proceed according to Standard Reference
Procedures for Salicylate Intoxication. </p>

<p><a name="DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION"></a><b>DOSAGE AND
ADMINISTRATION
</b></p>

<p>DIRECTIONS: The following dosages are those provided in the packaging,
as appropriate for self-medication. Larger or more frequent dosage may
be necessary as appropriate to the condition or needs of the patient. The
hydroxypropyl methylcellulose coating makes Genuine Bayer Aspirin particularly
appropriate for those who have difficulty in swallowing uncoated tablets
and caplets. </p>

<p>Usual Adult Dose: Adults and Children 12 years and over: One or two
tablets/caplets with water. May be repeated every four hours as necessary
up to 12 tablets/caplets a day or as directed by a doctor. Do not give
to children under 12 unless directed by a doctor. </p>

<p>ANTIPLATELET EFFECT </p>

<p>IN MI PROPHYLAXIS: </p>

<p>Although most of the studies used dosages exceeding 300 mg, two trials
used only 300 mg daily and pharmacologic data indicate that this dose inhibits
platelet function fully. Therefore, 300 mg or a conventional 325 mg aspirin
dose daily is a reasonable routine dose that would minimize gastrointestinal
adverse reactions. This use of aspirin applies to both solid oral dosage
forms (buffered and plain aspirin) and buffered aspirin in solution. </p>

<p>IN TRANSIENT ISCHEMIC ATTACKS: </p>

<p>Adult oral dosage for men is 1,300 milligrams a day, in divided doses
of 650 milligrams twice a day or 325 milligrams four times a day. </p>

<p><a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><b>DESCRIPTION </b></p>

<p>Promethazine hydrochloride is a racemic compound; the empirical formula
is C17H20N2S.HCl and its molecular weight is 320.88. </p>

<p>Promethazine hydrochloride, a phenothiazine derivative, is designated
chemically as N,N, alpha-trimethyl-10H-phenothiazine-10-ethanamine monohydrochloride.
</p>

<p>Promethazine hydrochloride occurs as a white to faint yellow, practically
odorless, crystalline powder which slowly oxidizes and turns blue on prolonged
exposure to air. It is soluble in water and freely soluble in alcohol.
</p>

<p><a name="ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY"></a><b>ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
</b></p>

<p>Promethazine is a phenothiazine derivative which differs structurally
from the antipsychotic phenothiazines by the presence of a branched side
chain and no ring substitution. It is thought that this configuration is
responsible for its relative lack (1/10 that of chlorpromazine) of dopaminergic
(CNS) action. </p>

<p>Promethazine is an H1 receptor blocking agent. In addition to its antihistaminic
action, it provides clinically useful sedative and antiemetic effects.
In therapeutic dosage, promethazine produces no significant effects on
the cardiovascular system. </p>

<p>Promethazine is well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Clinical
effects are apparent within 20 minutes after oral administration and generally
last four to six hours, although they may persist as long as 12 hours.
Promethazine is metabolized by the liver to a variety of compounds; the
sulfoxides of promethazine and N-demethylpromethazine are the predominant
metabolites appearing in the urine. </p>

<p><a name="INDICATIONS AND USAGE"></a><b>INDICATIONS AND USAGE </b></p>

<p>Promethazine is useful for: </p>

<p>Perennial and seasonal allergic rhinitis. </p>

<p>Vasomotor rhinitis. </p>

<p>Allergic conjunctivitis due to inhalant allergens and foods. </p>

<p>Mild, uncomplicated allergic skin manifestations of urticaria and angioedema.
</p>

<p>Amelioration of allergic reactions to blood or plasma. </p>

<p>Dermographism. </p>

<p>Anaphylactic reactions, as adjunctive therapy to epinephrine and other
standard measures, after the acute manifestations have been controlled.
</p>

<p>Preoperative, postoperative, or obstetric sedation. </p>

<p>Prevention and control of nausea and vomiting associated with certain
types of anesthesia and surgery. </p>

<p>Therapy adjunctive to meperidine or other analgesics for control of
postoperative pain. </p>

<p>Sedation in both children and adults, as well as relief of apprehension
and production of light sleep from which the patient can be easily aroused.
</p>

<p>Active and prophylactic treatment of motion sickness. </p>

<p>Antiemetic therapy in postoperative patients. </p>

<p><a name="CONTRAINDICATIONS"></a><b>CONTRAINDICATIONS </b></p>

<p>Promethazine is contraindicated in individuals known to be hypersensitive
or to have had an idiosyncratic reaction to promethazine or to other phenothiazines.
</p>

<p>Antihistamines are contraindicated for use in the treatment of lower
respiratory tract symptoms including asthma. </p>

<p><a name="WARNINGS"></a><b>WARNINGS </b></p>

<p>Promethazine may cause marked drowsiness. Ambulatory patients should
be cautioned against such activities as driving or operating dangerous
machinery until it is known that they do not become drowsy or dizzy from
promethazine therapy. </p>

<p>The sedative action of promethazine hydrochloride is additive to the
sedative effects of central nervous system depressants; therefore, agents
such as alcohol, narcotic analgesics, sedatives, hypnotics, and tranquilizers
should either be eliminated or given in reduced dosage in the presence
of promethazine hydrochloride. When given concomitantly with promethazine
hydrochloride, the dose of barbiturates should be reduced by at least one-half,
and the dose of analgesic depressants, such as morphine or meperidine,
should be reduced by one quarter to one-half. </p>

<p>Promethazine may lower seizure threshold. This should be taken into
consideration when administering to persons with known seizure disorders
or when giving in combination with narcotics or local anesthetics which
may also affect seizure threshold. </p>

<p>Sedative drugs or CNS depressants should be avoided in patients with
a history of sleep apnea. </p>

<p>Antihistamines should be used with caution in patients with narrow-angle
glaucoma, stenosing peptic ulcer, pyloroduodenal obstruction, and urinary
bladder obstruction due to symptomatic prostatic hypertrophy and narrowing
of the bladder neck. </p>

<p>Administration of promethazine has been associated with reported cholestatic
jaundice. </p>

<p><a name="PRECAUTIONS"></a><b>PRECAUTIONS </b></p>

<p>GENERAL </p>

<p>Promethazine should be used cautiously in persons with cardiovascular
disease or with impairment of liver function. </p>

<p>INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS </p>

<p>Promethazine may cause marked drowsiness or impair the mental and/or
physical abilities required for the performance of potentially hazardous
tasks, such as driving a vehicle or operating machinery. Ambulatory patients
should be told to avoid engaging in such activities until it is known that
they do not become drowsy or dizzy from Promethazine therapy. Children
should be supervised to avoid potential harm in bike riding or in other
hazardous activities. </p>

<p>The concomitant use of alcohol or other central nervous system depressants,
including narcotic analgesics, sedatives, hypnotics, and tranquilizers,
may have an additive effect and should be avoided or their dosage reduced.
</p>

<p>Patients should be advised to report any involuntary muscle movements
or unusual sensitivity to sunlight. </p>

<p>DRUG INTERACTIONS </p>

<p>The sedative action of promethazine is additive to the sedative effects
of other central nervous system depressants, including alcohol, narcotic
analgesics, sedatives, hypnotics, tricyclic antidepressants, and tranquilizers;
therefore, these agents should be avoided or administered in reduced dosage
to patients receiving promethazine. </p>

<p>DRUG/LABORATORY TEST INTERACTIONS </p>

<p>The following laboratory tests may be affected in patients who are receiving
therapy with promethazine hydrochloride: </p>

<p>Pregnancy Tests </p>

<p>Diagnostic pregnancy tests based on immunological reactions between
HCG and anti-HCG may result in false-negative or false-positive interpretations.
</p>

<p>Glucose Tolerance Test </p>

<p>An increase in blood glucose has been reported in patients receiving
promethazine. </p>

<p>CARCINOGENESIS, MUTAGENESIS, IMPAIRMENT OF FERTILITY </p>

<p>Long-term animal studies have not been performed to assess the carcinogenic
potential of promethazine, nor are there other animal or human data concerning
carcinogenicity, mutagenicity, or impairment of fertility with this drug.
Promethazine was nonmutagenic in the Salmonella test system of Ames. </p>

<p>PREGNANCY </p>

<p>Teratogenic Effects--Pregnancy Category C </p>

<p>Teratogenic effects have not been demonstrated in rat-feeding studies
at doses of 6.25 and 12.5 mg/kg of promethazine. These doses are from approximately
2.1 to 4.2 times the maximum recommended total daily dose of promethazine
for a 50 kg subject, depending upon the indication for which the drug is
prescribed. Specific studies to test the action of the drug on parturition,
lactation, and development of the animal neonate were not done, but a general
preliminary study in rats indicated no effect on these parameters. Although
antihistamines, including promethazine, have been found to produce fetal
mortality in rodents, the pharmacological effects of histamine in the rodent
do not parallel those in man. There are no adequate and well-controlled
studies of promethazine in pregnant women. Promethazine should be used
during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential
risk to the fetus. </p>

<p>Nonteratogenic Effects </p>

<p>Promethazine taken within two weeks of delivery may inhibit platelet
aggregation in the newborn. </p>

<p>LABOR AND DELIVERY </p>

<p>Promethazine, in appropriate dosage form, may be used alone or as an
adjunct to narcotic analgesics during labor and delivery. (See &quot;Indications
and Usage&quot; and &quot;Dosage and Administration.&quot;) </p>

<p>See also &quot;Nonteratogenic Effects.&quot; </p>

<p>NURSING MOTHERS </p>

<p>It is not known whether promethazine is excreted in human milk. Caution
should be exercised when promethazine is administered to a nursing woman.
</p>

<p>PEDIATRIC USE </p>

<p>This product should not be used in children under 2 years of age because
safety for such use has not been established. </p>

<p><a name="DRUG INTERACTIONS"></a><b>DRUG INTERACTIONS </b></p>

<p>The sedative action of promethazine is additive to the sedative effects
of other central nervous system depressants, including alcohol, narcotic
analgesics, sedatives, hypnotics, tricyclic antidepressants, and tranquilizers;
therefore, these agents should be avoided or administered in reduced dosage
to patients receiving promethazine. </p>

<p>(See Also PRECAUTIONS) </p>

<p><a name="ADVERSE REACTIONS"></a><b>ADVERSE REACTIONS </b></p>

<p>Nervous System--Sedation, sleepiness, occasional blurred vision, dryness
of mouth, dizziness; rarely confusion, disorientation, and extrapyramidal
symptoms such as oculogyric crisis, torticollis, and tongue protrusion
(usually in association with parenteral injection or excessive dosage).
</p>

<p>Cardiovascular--Increased or decreased blood pressure. </p>

<p>Dermatologic--Rash, rarely photosensitivity. </p>

<p>Hematologic--Rarely leukopenia, thrombocytopenia; agranulocytosis (1
case). </p>

<p>Gastrointestinal--Nausea and vomiting. </p>

<p><a name="OVERDOSAGE"></a><b>OVERDOSAGE </b></p>

<p>Signs and symptoms of overdosage with promethazine range from mild depression
of the central nervous system and cardiovascular system to profound hypotension
respiratory depression, and unconsciousness. </p>

<p>Stimulation may be evident, especially in children and geriatric patients.
Convulsions may rarely occur. A paradoxical reaction has been reported
in children receiving single doses of 75 mg to 125 mg orally, characterized
by hyperexcitability and nightmares. </p>

<p>Atropine like signs and symptoms--dry mouth, fixed, dilated pupils,
flushing, as well as gastrointestinal symptoms, may occur. </p>

<p>TREATMENT </p>

<p>Treatment of overdosage is essentially symptomatic and supportive. Only
in cases of extreme overdosage or individual sensitivity do vital signs
including respiration, pulse, blood pressure, temperature, and EKG need
to be monitored. Activated charcoal orally or by lavage may be given, or
sodium or magnesium sulfate orally as a cathartic. Attention should be
given to the reestablishment of adequate respiratory exchange through provision
of a patent airway and institution of assisted or controlled ventilation.
Diazepam may be used to control convulsions. Acidosis and electrolyte losses
should be corrected. Note that any depressant effects of promethazine are
not reversed by naloxone. Avoid analeptics which may cause convulsions.
</p>

<p>Severe hypotension usually responds to the administration of norepinephrine
or phenylephrine. EPINEPHRINE SHOULD NOT BE USED, since its use in patients
with partial adrenergic blockade may further lower the blood pressure.
</p>

<p>Limited experience with dialysis indicates that it is not helpful. </p>

<p><a name="DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION"></a><b>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
</b></p>

<p>ALLERGY </p>

<p>The average oral dose is 25 mg taken before retiring; however, 12.5
mg may be taken before meals and on retiring, if necessary. Children tolerate
this product well. Single 25-mg doses at bedtime or 6.25 to 12.5 mg taken
three times daily will usually suffice. After initiation of treatment in
children or adults, dosage should be adjusted to the smallest amount adequate
to relieve symptoms. </p>

<p>Promethazine Rectal Suppositories may be used if the oral route is not
feasible but oral therapy should be resumed as soon as possible if continued
therapy is indicated. </p>

<p>The administration of promethazine hydrochloride in 25-mg doses will
control minor transfusion reactions of an allergic nature. </p>

<p>MOTION SICKNESS </p>

<p>The average adult dose is 25 mg taken twice daily. The initial dose
should be taken one-half to one hour before anticipated travel and be repeated
8 to 12 hours later, if necessary. On succeeding days of travel, it is
recommended that 25 mg be given on arising and again before the evening
meal. For children, Promethazine Tablets, Syrup, or Rectal Suppositories,
12.5 to 25 mg, twice daily, may be administered. </p>

<p>NAUSEA AND VOMITING </p>

<p>The average effective dose of Promethazine for the active therapy of
nausea and vomiting in children or adults is 25 mg. When oral medication
cannot be tolerated, the dose should be given parenterally (cf. Promethazine
Injection) or by rectal suppository. 12.5 to 25-mg doses may be repeated,
as necessary, at 4- to 6-hour intervals. </p>

<p>For nausea and vomiting in children, the usual dose is 0.5 mg per pound
of body weight, and the dose should be adjusted to the age and weight of
the patient and the severity of the condition being treated. </p>

<p>For prophylaxis of nausea and vomiting, as during surgery and the postoperative
period, the average dose is 25 mg repeated at 4- to 6-hour intervals, as
necessary. </p>

<p>SEDATION </p>

<p>This product relieves apprehension and induces a quiet sleep from which
the patient can be easily aroused. Administration of 12.5 to 25 mg Promethazine
by the oral route or by rectal suppository at bedtime will provide sedation
in children. Adults usually require 25 to 50 mg for nighttime, presurgical,
or obstetrical sedation. </p>

<p>PRE- AND POSTOPERATIVE USE </p>

<p>Promethazine in 12.5- to 25-mg doses for children and 50-mg doses for
adults the night before surgery relieves apprehension and produces a quiet
sleep. </p>

<p>For preoperative medication children require doses of 0.5 mg per pound
of body weight in combination with an equal dose of meperidine and the
appropriate dose of an atropinelike drug. </p>

<p>Usual adult dosage is 50 mg Promethazine with an equal amount of meperidine
and the required amount of a belladonna alkaloid. </p>

<p>Postoperative sedation and adjunctive use with analgesics may be obtained
by the administration of 12.5 to 25 mg in children and 25- to 50-mg doses
in adults. </p>

<p>Promethazine Syrup Plain and Promethazine Syrup Fortis are not recommended
for children under 2 years of age. </p>

<p>Losartan , the first of a new class of antihypertensives, is an angiotensin
II receptor (type AT1) antagonist. Losartan potassium, a non-peptide molecule,
is chemically described as 2-butyl- 4-chloro-1-(P-(O- 1H-tetrazol-5-ylphenyl)benzyl)imidazole-
5-methanol monopotassium salt. Its empirical formula is C22H22ClKN6O. </p>

<p>Losartan potassium is a white to off-white free-flowing crystalline
powder with a molecular weight of 461.01. It is freely soluble in water,
soluble in alcohols, and slightly soluble in common organic solvents, such
as acetonitrile and methyl ethyl ketone. Oxidation of the 5-hydroxymethyl
group on the imidazole ring results in the active metabolite of losartan.
Losartan is available for oral administration containing either 25 mg or
50 mg of losartan potassium. </p>

<p><a name="ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY"></a><b>ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
</b></p>

<p>Mechanism Of Action </p>

<p>Angiotensin II (formed from angiotensin I in a reaction catalyzed by
angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE, kininase II)), is a potent vasoconstrictor,
the primary vasoactive hormone of the renin-angiotensin system and an important
component in the pathophysiology of hypertension. It also stimulates aldosterone
secretion by the adrenal cortex. Losartan and its principal active metabolite
block the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin
II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT1 receptor
found in many tissues, (e.g., vascular smooth muscle, adrenal gland). There
is also an AT2 receptor found in many tissues but it is not known to be
associated with cardiovascular homeostasis. Both losartan and its principal
active metabolite do not exhibit any partial agonist activity at the AT1
receptor and have much greater affinity (about 1000-fold) for the AT1 receptor
than for the AT2 receptor. In Vitro binding studies indicate that losartan
is a reversible, competitive inhibitor of the AT1 receptor. The active
metabolite is 10 to 40 times more potent by weight than losartan and appears
to be a reversible, non- competitive inhibitor of the AT1 receptor. </p>

<p>Neither losartan nor its active metabolite inhibits ACE (kininase II,
the enzyme that converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II and degrades bradykinin);
nor do they bind to or block other hormone receptors or ion channels known
to be important in cardiovascular regulation. </p>

<p>Pharmacokinetics </p>

<p>General </p>

<p>Losartan is an orally active agent that undergoes substantial first-pass
metabolism by cytochrome P450 enzymes. It is converted, in part, to an
active carboxylic acid metabolite that is responsible for most of the angiotensin
II receptor antagonism that follows losartan treatment. The terminal half-life
of losartan is about 2 hours and of the metabolite is about 6-9 hours.
The pharmacokinetics of losartan and its active metabolite are linear with
oral losartan doses up to 200 mg and do not change over time. Neither losartan
nor its metabolite accumulate in plasma upon repeated once-daily dosing.
</p>

<p>Following oral administration, losartan is well absorbed (based on absorption
of radiolabeled losartan) and undergoes substantial first-pass metabolism;
the systemic bioavailability of losartan is approximately 33%. About 14%
of an orally-administered dose of losartan is converted to the active metabolite.
Mean peak concentrations of losartan and its active metabolite are reached
in 1 hour and in 3-4 hours, respectively. While maximum plasma concentrations
of losartan and its active metabolite are approximately equal, the AUC
of the metabolite is about 4 times as great as that of losartan. A meal
slows absorption of losartan and decreases its Cmax but has only minor
effects on losartan AUC or on the AUC of the metabolite (about 10% decreased).
</p>

<p>Both losartan and its active metabolite are highly bound to plasma proteins,
primarily albumin, with plasma free fractions of 1.3% and 0.2% respectively.
Plasma protein binding is constant over the concentration range achieved
with recommended doses. Studies in rats indicate that losartan crosses
the blood- brain barrier poorly, if at all. </p>

<p>Losartan metabolites have been identified in human plasma and urine.
In addition to the active carboxylic acid metabolite, several inactive
metabolites are formed. Following oral and intravenous administration of
14C-labeled losartan potassium, circulating plasma radioactivity is primarily
attributed to losartan and its active metabolite. In Vitro studies indicate
that cytochrome P450 2C9 and 3A4 are involved in the biotransformation
of losartan to its metabolites. Minimal conversion of losartan to the active
metabolite (less than 1% of the dose compared to 14% of the dose in normal
subjects) was seen in about one percent of individuals studied. </p>

<p>The volume of distribution of losartan is about 34 liters and of the
active metabolite is about 12 liters. Total plasma clearance of losartan
and the active metabolite is about 600 mL/min and 50 mL/min, respectively,
with renal clearance of about 75 mL/min and 25 mL/min, respectively. When
losartan is administered orally, about 4% of the dose is excreted unchanged
in the urine and about 6% is excreted in urine as active metabolite. Biliary
excretion contributes to the elimination of losartan and its metabolites.
Following oral 14C-labeled losartan, about 35% of radioactivity is recovered
in the urine and about 60% in the feces. Following an intravenous dose
of 14C- labeled losartan, about 45% of radioactivity is recovered in the
urine and 50% in the feces. </p>

<p>Special Populations </p>

<p>Pediatric: Losartan pharmacokinetics have not been investigated in patients
&lt;18 years of age. </p>

<p>Geriatric And Gender: Losartan pharmacokinetics have been investigated
in the elderly (65-75 years) and in both genders. Plasma concentrations
of losartan and its active metabolite are similar in elderly and young
hypertensives. Plasma concentrations of losartan were about twice as high
in female hypertensives as male hypertensives, but concentrations of the
active metabolite were similar in males and females. No dosage adjustment
is necessary (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). </p>

<p>Race: Pharmacokinetic differences due to race have not been studied.
</p>

<p>Renal Insufficiency: Plasma concentrations of losartan are not altered
in patients with creatinine clearance above 30 mL/min. In patients with
lower creatinine clearance, AUCs are about 50% greater and they are doubled
in hemodialysis patients. Plasma concentrations of the active metabolite
are not significantly altered in patients with renal impairment or in hemodialysis
patients. Neither losartan nor its active metabolite can be removed by
hemodialysis. No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with renal
impairment unless they are volume-depleted (see WARNINGS, Hypotension--Volume-
Depleted Patients and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). </p>

<p>Hepatic Insufficiency: Following oral administration in patients with
mild to moderate alcoholic cirrhosis of the liver, plasma concentrations
of losartan and its active metabolite were, respectively, 5-times and about
1.7-times those in young male volunteers. Compared to normal subjects the
total plasma clearance of losartan in patients with hepatic insufficiency
was about 50% lower and the oral bioavailability was about 2-times higher.
A lower starting dose is recommended for patients with a history of hepatic
impairment (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). </p>

<p>Drug Interactions </p>

<p>Losartan, administered for 12 days, did not affect the pharmacokinetics
or pharmacodynamics of a single dose of warfarin. Losartan did not affect
the pharmacokinetics of oral or intravenous digoxin. Coadministration of
losartan and cimetidine led to an increase of about 18% in AUC of losartan
but did not affect the pharmacokinetics of its active metabolite. Coadministration
of losartan and phenobarbital led to a reduction of about 20% in the AUC
of losartan and that of its active metabolite. There is no pharmacokinetic
interaction between losartan and hydrochlorothiazide. </p>

<p>Pharmacodynamics And Clinical Effects </p>

<p>Losartan inhibits the pressor effect of angiotensin II (as well as angiotensin
I) infusions. A dose of 100 mg inhibits the pressor effect by about 85%
at peak with 25-40% inhibition persisting for 24 hours. Removal of the
negative feedback of angiotensin II causes a 2-3 fold rise in plasma renin
activity and consequent rise in angiotensin II plasma concentration in
hypertensive patients. Losartan does not affect the response to bradykinin,
whereas ACE inhibitors increase the response to bradykinin. Aldosterone
plasma concentrations fall following losartan administration. In spite
of the effect of losartan on aldosterone secretion, very little effect
on serum potassium was observed. </p>

<p>In a single-dose study in normal volunteers, losartan had no effects
on glomerular filtration rate, renal plasma flow or filtration fraction.
In multiple dose studies in hypertensive patients, there were no notable
effects on systemic or renal prostaglandin concentrations, fasting triglycerides,
total cholesterol or HDL- cholesterol or fasting glucose concentrations.
There was a small uricosuric effect leading to a minimal decrease in serum
uric acid (mean decrease &lt;0.4 mg/dL) during chronic oral administration.
</p>

<p>The antihypertensive effects of Losartan were demonstrated principally
in 4 placebo-controlled 6-12 week trials of dosages from 10 to 150 mg per
day in patients with baseline diastolic blood pressures of 95-115. The
studies allowed comparisons of two doses (50-100 mg/day) as once- daily
or twice-daily regimens, comparisons of peak and trough effects, and comparisons
of response by gender, age, and race. Three additional studies examined
the antihypertensive effects of losartan and hydrochlorothiazide in combination.
</p>

<p>The 4 studies of losartan monotherapy included a total of 1075 patients
randomized to several doses of losartan and 334 to placebo. The 10 and
25 mg doses produced some effect at peak (6 hours after dosing) but small
and inconsistent trough (24 hour) responses. Doses of 50, 100 and 150 mg
once daily gave statistically significant systolic/diastolic mean decreases
in blood pressure, compared to placebo in the range of 5.5-10.5/3.5-7.5
mmHg, with the 150 mg dose giving no greater effect than 50-100 mg. Twice-
daily dosing at 50- 100 mg/day gave consistently larger trough responses
than once-daily dosing at the same total dose. Peak (6 hour) effects were
uniformly, but moderately, larger than trough effects, with the trough-to-peak
ratio for systolic and diastolic responses 50-95% and 60-90%, respectively.
</p>

<p>Addition of a low dose of hydrochlorothiazide (12.5 mg) to losartan
50 mg once daily resulted in placebo-adjusted blood pressure reduction
of 15.5/9.2 mmHg. Analysis of age, gender, and race subgroups of patients
showed that men and women, and patients over and under 65, had generally
similar responses. Black patients, however, had notably smaller responses
to losartan monotherapy. The effect of losartan is substantially present
within one week but in some studies the maximal effect occurred in 3-6
weeks. In long-term follow-up studies (without placebo control) the effect
of losartan appeared to be maintained for up to a year. There is no apparent
rebound effect after abrupt withdrawal of losartan. There was essentially
no change in average heart rate in losartan- treated patients in controlled
trials. </p>

<p><a name="INDICATIONS AND USAGE"></a><b>INDICATIONS AND USAGE </b></p>

<p>Losartan is indicated for the treatment of hypertension. It may be used
alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents. </p>

<p>In considering the use of monotherapy with Losartan, it should be noted
that in controlled trials Losartan had an effect on blood pressure that
was notably less in black patients than in non-blacks, a finding similar
to the small effect of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in blacks.
</p>

<p><a name="CONTRAINDICATIONS"></a><b>CONTRAINDICATIONS </b></p>

<p>Losartan is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to any

<p>Drugs that act directly on the renin-angiotensin system can cause fetal
and neonatal morbidity and death when administered to pregnant women. Several
dozen cases have been reported in the world literature in patients who
were taking angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. When pregnancy is
detected, Losartan should be discontinued as soon as possible. </p>

<p>The use of drugs that act directly on the renin- angiotensin system
during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy has been associated
with fetal and neonatal injury, including hypotension, neonatal skull hypoplasia,
anuria, reversible or irreversible renal failure, and death. Oligohydramnios
has also been reported, presumably resulting from decreased fetal renal
function; oligohydramnios in this setting has been associated with fetal
limb contractures, craniofacial deformation, and hypoplastic lung development.
Prematurity, intrauterine growth retardation, and patent ductus arteriosus
have also been reported, although it is not clear whether these occurrences
were due to exposure to the drug. </p>

<p>These adverse effects do not appear to have resulted from intrauterine
drug exposure that has been limited to the first trimester. </p>

<p>Mothers whose embryos and fetuses are exposed to an angiotensin II receptor
antagonist only during the first trimester should be so informed. Nonetheless,
when patients become pregnant, physicians should have the patient discontinue
the use of Losartan as soon as possible. </p>

<p>Rarely (probably less often than once in every thousand pregnancies),
no alternative to an angiotensin II receptor antagonist will be found.
In these rare cases, the mothers should be apprised of the potential hazards
to their fetuses, and serial ultrasound examinations should be performed
to assess the intraamniotic environment. </p>

<p>If oligohydramnios is observed, Losartan should be discontinued unless
it is considered life-saving for the mother. Contraction stress testing
(CST), a non- stress test (NST), or biophysical profiling (BPP) may be
appropriate, depending upon the week of pregnancy. Patients and physicians
should be aware, however, that oligohydramnios may not appear until after
the fetus has sustained irreversible injury. </p>

<p>Infants with histories of In Utero exposure to an angiotensin II receptor
antagonist should be closely observed for hypotension, oliguria, and hyperkalemia.
If oliguria occurs, attention should be directed toward support of blood
pressure and renal perfusion. Exchange transfusion or dialysis may be required
as means of reversing hypotension and/or substituting for disordered renal
function. </p>

<p>Losartan potassium has been shown to produce adverse effects in rat
fetuses and neonates, including decreased body weight, delayed physical
and behavioral development, mortality and renal toxicity. With the exception
of neonatal weight gain (which was affected at doses as low as 10 mg/kg/day),
doses associated with these effects exceeded 25 mg/kg/day (approximately
three times the maximum recommended human dose of 100 mg on a mg/M(squared)
basis). These findings are attributed to drug exposure in late gestation
and during lactation. Significant levels of losartan and its active metabolite
were shown to be present in rat fetal plasma during late gestation and
in rat milk. </p>

<p>Hypotension--Volume-Depleted Patients </p>

<p>In patients who are intravascularly volume- depleted (e.g., those treated
with diuretics), symptomatic hypotension may occur after initiation of
therapy with Losartan. These conditions should be corrected prior to administration
of Losartan, or a lower starting dose should be used (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).
</p>

<p><a name="PRECAUTIONS"></a><b>PRECAUTIONS </b></p>

<p>General </p>

<p>Based on pharmacokinetic data which demonstrate significantly increased
plasma concentrations of losartan in cirrhotic patients, a lower dose should
be considered for patients with impaired liver function (see DOSAGE AND
ADMINISTRATION and ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacokinetics). </p>

<p>Hypersensitivity. See ADVERSE REACTIONS, Post- Marketing Experience.
</p>

<p>Impaired Renal Function </p>

<p>As a consequence of inhibiting the renin- angiotensin-aldosterone system,
changes in renal function may be anticipated in susceptible individuals.
In patients whose renal function may depend on the activity of the renin-
angiotensin- aldosterone system (e.g., patients with severe congestive
heart failure), treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors
has been associated with oliguria and/or progressive azotemia and (rarely)
with acute renal failure and/or death. Losartan would be expected to behave
similarly. In studies of ACE inhibitors in patients with unilateral or
bilateral renal artery stenosis, increases in serum creatinine or BUN have
been reported. There has been no known use of Losartan in patients with
unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis, but a similar effect should
be anticipated. </p>

<p>Information For Patients </p>

<p>Pregnancy: Female patients of childbearing age should be told about
the consequences of second- and third trimester exposure to drugs that
act on the renin-angiotensin system, and they should also be told that
these consequences do not appear to have resulted from intrauterine drug
exposure that has been limited to the first trimester. These patients should
be asked to report pregnancies to their physicians as soon as possible.
</p>

<p>Drug Interactions </p>

<p>No significant drug-drug pharmacokinetic interactions have been found
in interaction studies with hydrochlorothiazide, digoxin, warfarin, cimetidine
and phenobarbital. (See ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Drug Interactions.)
Potent inhibitors of cytochrome P450 3A4 and 2C9 have not been studied
clinically but In Vitro studies show significant inhibition of the formation
of the active metabolite by inhibitors of P450 3A4 (ketoconazole, troleandomycin,
gestodene), or P450 2C9 (sulfaphenazole) and nearly complete inhibition
by the combination of sulfaphenazole and ketoconazole. The pharmacodynamic
consequences of concomitant use of losartan and these inhibitors have not
been examined. </p>

<p>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment Of Fertility </p>

<p>Losartan potassium was not carcinogenic when administered at maximally
tolerated dosages to rats and mice for 105 and 92 weeks, respectively.
Female rats given the highest dose (270 mg/kg/day) had a slightly higher
incidence of pancreatic acinar adenoma. The maximally tolerated dosages
(270 mg/kg/day in rats, 200 mg/kg/day in mice) provided systemic exposures
for losartan and its pharmacologically active metabolite that were approximately
160- and 90-times (rats) and 30- and 15-times (mice) the exposure of a
50 kg human given 100 mg per day. </p>

<p>Losartan potassium was negative in the microbial mutagenesis and V-79
mammalian cell mutagenesis assays and in the In Vitro alkaline elution
and In Vitro and In Vivo chromosomal aberration assays. In addition, the
active metabolite showed no evidence of genotoxicity in the microbial mutagenesis,
In Vitro alkaline elution, and In Vitro chromosomal aberration assays.
</p>

<p>Fertility and reproductive performance were not affected in studies
with male rats given oral doses of losartan potassium up to approximately
150 mg/kg/day. The administration of toxic dosage levels in females (300/200
mg/kg/day) was associated with a significant (p&lt;0.05) decrease in the
number of corpora lutea/female, implants/female, and live fetuses/female
at C- section. At 100 mg/kg/day only a decrease in the number of corpora
lutea/female was observed. The relationship of these findings to drug-treatment
is uncertain since there was no effect at these dosage levels on implants/pregnant
female, percent post- implantation loss, or live animals/litter at parturition.
In nonpregnant rats dosed at 135 mg/kg/day for 7 days, systemic exposure
(AUCs) for losartan and its active metabolite were approximately 66 and
26 times the exposure achieved in man at the maximum recommended human
daily dosage (100 mg). </p>

<p>Pregnancy </p>

<p>Pregnancy Categories C (first trimester) and D (second and third trimesters).
See WARNINGS, Fetal/Neonatal Morbidity And Mortality. </p>

<p>Nursing Mothers </p>

<p>It is not known whether losartan is excreted in human milk, but significant
levels of losartan and its active metabolite were shown to be present in
rat milk. Because of the potential for adverse effects on the nursing infant,
a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue
the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.
</p>

<p>Pediatric Use </p>

<p>Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.
</p>

<p>Use In The Elderly </p>

<p>Of the total number of patients receiving Losartan in controlled clinical
studies, 391 patients (19%) were 65 years and over, while 37 patients (2%)
were 75 years and over. No overall differences in effectiveness or safety
were observed between these patients and younger patients, but greater
sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. </p>

<p><a name="ADVERSE REACTIONS"></a><b>ADVERSE REACTIONS </b></p>

<p>Losartan has been evaluated for safety in more than 3300 patients treated
for essential hypertension and 4058 patients/subjects overall. Over 1200
patients were treated for over 6 months and more than 800 for over one
year. In general, treatment with Losartan was well-tolerated. The overall
incidence of adverse experiences reported with Losartan was similar to
placebo. </p>

<p>In controlled clinical trials, discontinuation of therapy due to clinical
adverse experiences was required in 2.3 percent of patients treated with
Losartan and 3.7 percent of patients given placebo. </p>

<p>The following table of adverse events is based on four 6-12 week placebo
controlled trials involving over 1000 patients on various doses (10-150
mg) of losartan and over 300 patients given placebo. All doses of losartan
are grouped because none of the adverse events appeared to have a dose-related
frequency. The table includes all adverse events, whether or not attributed
to the treatment, occurring in at least 1% of patients treated with losartan
and that were more frequent on losartan than placebo. </p>

</p>

<p>Post-Marketing Experience </p>

<p>The following adverse reactions have been reported in post-marketing
experience: </p>

<p>Hypersensitivity: Angioedema (involving swelling of the face, lips,
and/or tongue) has been reported rarely in patients treated with losartan.
</p>

<p>Laboratory Test Findings </p>

<p>In controlled clinical trials, clinically important changes in standard
laboratory parameters were rarely associated with administration of Losartan.
Creatinine, Blood Urea Nitrogen: Minor increases in blood urea nitrogen
(BUN) or serum creatinine were observed in less than 0.1 percent of patients
with essential hypertension treated with Losartan alone. No patient discontinued
taking Losartan alone due to increased BUN or serum creatinine. (See PRECAUTIONS,
Impaired Renal Function.) </p>

<p>Hemoglobin And Hematocrit: Small decreases in hemoglobin and hematocrit
(mean decreases of approximately 0.11 grams percent and 0.09 volume percent,
respectively) occurred frequently in patients treated with Losartan alone,
but were rarely of clinical importance. No patients were discontinued due
to anemia. </p>

<p>Liver Function Tests: Occasional elevations of liver enzymes and/or
serum bilirubin have occurred. In patients with essential hypertension
treated with Losartan alone, one patient (&lt;0.1%) was discontinued due
to these laboratory adverse experiences. </p>

<p><a name="OVERDOSAGE"></a><b>OVERDOSAGE </b></p>

<p>Significant lethality was observed in mice and rats after oral administration
of 1000 mg/kg and 2000 mg/kg, respectively, about 44 and 170 times the
maximum recommended human dose on a mg/M(squared) basis. </p>

<p>Limited data are available in regard to overdosage in humans. The most
likely manifestation of overdosage would be hypotension and tachycardia;
bradycardia could occur from parasympathetic (vagal) stimulation. If symptomatic
hypotension should occur, supportive treatment should be instituted. </p>

<p>Neither losartan nor its active metabolite can be removed by hemodialysis.
</p>

<p><a name="DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION"></a><b>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
</b></p>

<p>The usual starting dose of Losartan is 50 mg once daily, with 25 mg
used in patients with possible depletion of intravascular volume (e.g.,
patients treated with diuretics) (see WARNINGS, Hypotension--Volume-Depleted
Patients) and patients with a history of hepatic impairment (see PRECAUTIONS,
General). Losartan can be administered once or twice daily with total daily
doses ranging from 25 mg to 100 mg. </p>

<p>If the antihypertensive effect measured at trough using once-a-day dosing
is inadequate, a twice-a- day regimen at the same total daily dose or an
increase in dose may give a more satisfactory response. </p>

<p>If blood pressure is not controlled by Losartan alone, a low dose of
a diuretic may be added. Hydrochlorothiazide has been shown to have an
additive effect (see ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacodynamics And
Clinical Effects). No initial dosage adjustment is necessary for elderly
patients or for patients </p>

<p>with renal impairment, including patients on dialysis. </p>

<p>Losartan may be administered with other antihypertensive agents. </p>

<p>Losartan may be administered with or without food. </p>

<p><a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><b>DESCRIPTION </b></p>

<p>Ketoconazole 2% Cream is a broad-spectrum synthetic antifungal agent.
Ketoconazole is Cis-1-acetyl-4-(4-((2-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-2-(1H-imidazol-1-
ylmethyl)-1,3-dioxolan-4-yl)methoxy)phenyl)piperazine. </p>

<p><a name="ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY"></a><b>ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
</b></p>

<p>When Ketoconazole 2% Cream was applied dermally to intact or abraded
skin of Beagle dogs for 28 consecutive days at a dose of 80 mg, there were
no detectable plasma levels using an assay method having a lower detection
limit of 2 ng/ml. </p>

<p>After a single topical application to the chest, back and arms of normal
volunteers, systemic absorption of ketoconazole was not detected at the
5 ng/ml level in blood over a 72-hour period. </p>

<p>Two dermal irritancy studies, a human sensitization test, a phototoxicity
study and a photoallergy study conducted in 38 male and 62 female volunteers
showed no contact sensitization of the delayed hypersensitivity type, no
irritation, no phototoxicity and no photoallergenic potential due to Ketoconazole
2% Cream. </p>

<p>MICROBIOLOGY: Ketoconazole is a broad spectrum synthetic antifungal
agent which inhibits the In Vitro growth of the following common dermatophytes
and yeasts by altering the permeability of the cell membrane: dermatophytes:
Trichophyton Rubrum, T. Mentagrophytes, T. Tonsurans, Microsporum Canis,
M. Audouini, M. Gypseum and Epidermophyton Floccosum; yeasts: Candida Albicans,
Malassezia Ovale Pityrosporum Ovale) and C. Tropicalis; and the organism
responsible for tinea versicolor, Malassezia Furfur (Pityrosporum Orbiculare).
Only those organisms listed in the INDICATIONS AND USAGE Section have been
proven to be clinically affected. Development of resistance to ketoconazole
has not been reported. </p>

<p>MODE OF ACTION: In Vitro studies suggest that ketoconazole impairs the
synthesis of ergosterol, which is a vital component of fungal cell membranes.
It is postulated that the therapeutic effect of ketoconazole in seborrheic
dermatitis is due to the reduction of M. ovale, but this has not been proven.
</p>

<p><a name="INDICATIONS AND USAGE"></a><b>INDICATIONS AND USAGE </b></p>

<p>Ketoconazole 2% Cream is indicated for the topical treatment of tinea
corporis and tinea cruris and tinea pedis caused by Trichophyton Rubrum,
T. Mentagrophytes and Epidermophyton Floccosum; in the treatment of tinea
(pityriasis) versicolor caused by Malassezia Furfur (Pityrosporum Orbiculare);
in the treatment of cutaneous candidiasis caused by Candida Spp. and in
the treatment of seborrheic dermatitis. </p>

<p><a name="CONTRAINDICATIONS"></a><b>CONTRAINDICATIONS </b></p>

<p>Ketoconazole 2% Cream is contraindicated in persons who have shown hypersensitivity
to the active or excipient ingredients of this formulation. </p>

<p><a name="WARNINGS"></a><b>WARNINGS </b></p>

<p>Ketoconazole 2% Cream is not for ophthalmic use. </p>

<p>Ketoconazole 2% Cream contains sodium sulfite anhydrous, a sulfite that
may cause allergic-type reactions including anaphylactic symptoms and life
threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes in certain susceptible people.
The overall prevalence of sulfite sensitivity in the general population
is unknown and probably low. Sulfite sensitivity is seen more frequently
in asthmatic than in nonasthmatic people.</p>

<p><a name="PRECAUTIONS"></a><b> PRECAUTIONS </b></p>

<p>GENERAL: If a reaction suggesting sensitivity or chemical irritation
should occur, use of the medication should be discontinued. Hepatitis (1:10,000
reported incidence) and, at high doses, lowered testosterone and ACTH induced
corticosteroid serum levels have been seen with orally administered ketoconazole;
these effects have not been seen with topical ketoconazole. </p>

<p>CARCINOGENESIS, MUTAGENESIS, IMPAIRMENT OF FERTILITY: A long-term feeding
study in Swiss Albino mice and in Wistar rats showed no evidence of oncogenic
activity. The dominant lethal mutation test in male and female mice revealed
that single oral doses of ketoconazole as high as 80 mg/kg produced no
mutation in any stage of germ cell development. The Ames' Salmonella microsomal
activator assay was also negative. </p>

<p>PREGNANCY: TERATOGENIC EFFECTS: PREGNANCY CATEGORY C: Ketoconazole has
been shown to be teratogenic (syndactylia and oligodactylia) in the rat
when given orally in the diet at 80 mg/kg/day, (10 times the maximum recommended
human oral dose). However, these effects may be related to maternal toxicity,
which was seen at this and higher dose levels. </p>

<p>There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women.
Ketoconazole should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit
justifies the potential risk to the fetus.</p>

<p> NURSING MOTHERS: It is not known whether Ketoconazole 2% Cream administered
topically could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable
quantities in breast milk. Nevertheless, a decision should be made whether
to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the
importance of the drug to the mother. </p>

<p>PEDIATRIC USE: Safety and effectiveness in children have not been established.
</p>

<p><a name="ADVERSE REACTIONS"></a><b>ADVERSE REACTIONS </b></p>

<p>During clinical trials 45 (5.0%) of 905 patients treated with Ketoconazole
2% Cream and 5 (2.4%) of 208 patients treated with placebo reported side
effects consisting mainly of severe irritation, pruritus and stinging.
One of the patients treated with Ketoconazole Cream developed a painful
allergic reaction. </p>

<p><a name="DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION"></a><b>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
</b></p>

<p>Cutaneous Candidiasis, Tinea Corporis, Tinea Cruris, and Tinea (Pityriasis)
Versicolor: It is recommended that Ketoconazole 2% Cream be applied once
daily to cover the affected and immediate surrounding area. Clinical improvement
may be seen fairly soon after treatment is begun; however, candidal infections
and tinea cruris and corporis should be treated for two weeks in order
to reduce the possibility of recurrence. Patients with tinea versicolor
usually require two weeks of treatment. Patients with tinea pedis require
six weeks of treatment.</p>

<p> Seborrheic Dermatitis: Ketoconazole 2% Cream should be applied to the
affected area twice daily for four weeks or until clinical clearing. </p>

<p>If a patient shows no clinical improvement after the treatment period,
the diagnosis should be redetermined. </p>

<P><A NAME="DESCRIPTION"></A><B>DESCRIPTION </B></P>

<P>WHEN Carbidopa-levodopa IS TO BE GIVEN TO PATIENTS WHO ARE BEING TREATED
WITH LEVODOPA, LEVODOPA MUST BE DISCONTINUED AT LEAST EIGHT HOURS BEFORE
THERAPY WITH Carbidopa-levodopa IS STARTED. IN ORDER TO REDUCE ADVERSE
REACTIONS, IT IS NECESSARY TO INDIVIDUALIZE THERAPY. SEE THE WARNINGS AND
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION SECTIONS BEFORE INITIATING THERAPY. </P>

<P>Carbidopa, an inhibitor of aromatic amino acid decarboxylation, is a
white, crystalline compound, slightly soluble in water, with a molecular
weight of 244.3. It is designated chemically as (-)-L-alpha-hydrazino-alpha-methyl-beta-
(3,4-dihydroxybenzene) propanoic acid monohydrate. Tablet content is expressed
in terms of anhydrous carbidopa which has a molecular weight of 226.3.
</P>

<P>Levodopa, an aromatic amino acid, is a white, crystalline compound,
slightly soluble in water, with a molecular weight of 197.2. It is designated
chemically as (-)-L-alpha-amino-beta-(3,4-dihydroxybenzene) propanoic acid.
</P>

<P><A NAME="ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY"></A><B>ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
</B></P>

<P>Current evidence indicates that symptoms of Parkinson's disease are
related to depletion of dopamine in the corpus striatum. Administration
of dopamine is ineffective in the treatment of Parkinson's disease apparently
because it does not cross the blood-brain barrier. However, levodopa, the
metabolic precursor of dopamine, does cross the blood-brain barrier, and
presumably is converted to dopamine in the basal ganglia. This is thought
to be the mechanism whereby levodopa relieves symptoms of Parkinson's disease.
</P>

<P>When levodopa is administered orally it is rapidly converted to dopamine
in extracerebral tissues so that only a small portion of a given dose is
transported unchanged to the central nervous system. For this reason, large
doses of levodopa are required for adequate therapeutic effect and these
may often be attended by nausea and other adverse reactions, some of which
are attributable to dopamine formed in extracerebral tissues. </P>

<P>Since levodopa competes with certain amino acids, the absorption of
levodopa may be impaired in some patients on a high protein diet. </P>

<P>Carbidopa inhibits decarboxylation of peripheral levodopa. It does not
cross the blood-brain barrier and does not affect the metabolism of levodopa
within the central nervous system. </P>

<P>Since its decarboxylase inhibiting activity is limited to extracerebral
tissues, administration of carbidopa with levodopa makes more levodopa
available for transport to the brain. In dogs, reduced formation of dopamine
in extracerebral tissues, such as the heart, provides protection against
the development of dopamine-induced cardiac arrhythmias. Clinical studies
tend to support the hypothesis of a similar protective effect in humans
although controlled data are too limited at the present time to draw firm
conclusions. </P>

<P>Carbidopa reduces the amount of levodopa required by about 75 percent
and, when administered with levodopa, increases both plasma levels and
the plasma half-life of levodopa, and decreases plasma and urinary dopamine
and homovanillic acid. </P>

<P>In clinical pharmacologic studies, simultaneous administration of carbidopa
and levodopa produced greater urinary excretion of levodopa in proportion
to the excretion of dopamine than administration of the two drugs at separate
times </P>

<P>Pyridoxine hydrochloride (vitamin B6), in oral doses of 10 mg to 25
mg, may reverse the effects of levodopa by increasing the rate of aromatic
amino acid decarboxylation. Carbidopa inhibits this action of pyridoxine.
</P>

<P><A NAME="INDICATIONS AND USAGE"></A><B>INDICATIONS AND USAGE </B></P>

<P>Carbidopa-levodopa is indicated in the treatment of the symptoms of
idiopathic Parkinson's disease (paralysis agitans), postencephalitic parkinsonism,
and symptomatic parkinsonism which may follow injury to the nervous system
by carbon monoxide intoxication and manganese intoxication. Carbidopa-levodopa
is indicated in these conditions to permit the administration of lower
doses of levodopa with reduced nausea and vomiting, with more rapid dosage
titration, with a somewhat smoother response, and with supplemental pyridoxine
(vitamin B6). </P>

<P>The incidence of levodopa-induced nausea and vomiting is less with Carbidopa-levodopa
than with levodopa. In many patients this reduction in nausea and vomiting
will permit more rapid dosage titration. </P>

<P>In some patients a somewhat smoother antiparkinsonian effect results
from therapy with Carbidopa-levodopa than with levodopa. However, patients
with markedly irregular (&quot;on-off&quot;) responses to levodopa have
not been shown to benefit from Carbidopa-levodopa. </P>

<P>Since carbidopa prevents the reversal of levodopa effects caused by
pyridoxine, Carbidopa-levodopa can be given to patients receiving supplemental
pyridoxine (vitamin B6). </P>

<P>Although the administration of carbidopa permits control of parkinsonism
and Parkinson's disease with much lower doses of levodopa, there is no
conclusive evidence at present that this is beneficial other than in reducing
nausea and vomiting, permitting more rapid titration, and providing a somewhat
smoother response to levodopa. Carbidopa Does Not Decrease Adverse Reactions
Due To Central Effects Of Levodopa. By Permitting More Levodopa To Reach
The Brain, Particularly When Nausea And Vomiting Is Not A Dose-limiting
Factor, Certain Adverse CNS Effects, E.g., Dyskinesias, May Occur At Lower
Dosages And Sooner During Therapy With Carbidopa-levodopa Than With Levodopa.
</P>

<P>Certain patients who responded poorly to levodopa have improved when
Carbidopa-levodopa was substituted. This is most likely due to decreased
peripheral decarboxylation of levodopa which results from administration
of carbidopa rather than to a primary effect of carbidopa on the nervous
system. Carbidopa has not been shown to enhance the intrinsic efficacy
of levodopa in parkinsonian syndromes. </P>

<P>In considering whether to give Carbidopa-levodopa to patients already
on levodopa who have nausea and/or vomiting, the practitioner should be
aware that, while many patients may be expected to improve, some do not.
Since one cannot predict which patients are likely to improve, this can
only be determined by a trial of therapy. It should be further noted that
in controlled trials comparing Carbidopa-levodopa with levodopa, about
half of the patients with nausea and/or vomiting on levodopa improved spontaneously
despite being retained on the same dose of levodopa during the controlled
portion of the trial. </P>

<P><A NAME="CONTRAINDICATIONS"></A><B>CONTRAINDICATIONS </B></P>

<P>Monoamine oxidase inhibitors and Carbidopa-levodopa should not be given
concomitantly. These inhibitors must be discontinued at least two weeks
prior to initiating therapy with Carbidopa-levodopa. </P>

<P>Carbidopa-levodopa is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity
to this drug, and in narrow angle glaucoma. </P>

<P>Because levodopa may activate a malignant melanoma, it should not be
used in patients with suspicious, undiagnosed skin lesions or a history
of melanoma. </P>

<P><A NAME="WARNINGS"></A><B>WARNINGS </B></P>

<P>When patients are receiving levodopa, it must be discontinued at least
eight hours before Carbidopa-levodopa is started. Carbidopa-levodopa should
be substituted at a dosage that will provide approximately 25 percent of
the previous levodopa dosage (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Patients
who are taking Carbidopa-levodopa should be instructed not to take additional
levodopa unless it is prescribed by the physician. </P>

<P>As with levodopa, Carbidopa-levodopa may cause involuntary movements
and mental disturbances. These reactions are thought to be due to increased
brain dopamine following administration of levodopa. All patients should
be observed carefully for the development of depression with concomitant
suicidal tendencies. Patients with past or current psychoses should be
treated with caution. Because Carbidopa Permits More Levodopa To Reach
The Brain And, Thus, More Dopamine To Be Formed, Dyskinesias May Occur
At Lower Dosages And Sooner With Carbidopa-levodopa Than With Levodopa.
The occurrence of dyskinesias may require dosage reduction. </P>

<P>Carbidopa-levodopa should be administered cautiously to patients with
severe cardiovascular or pulmonary disease, bronchial asthma, renal, hepatic
or endocrine disease. </P>

<P>Care should be exercised in administering Carbidopa-levodopa, as with
levodopa, to patients with a history of myocardial infarction who have
residual atrial, nodal, or ventricular arrhythmias. In such patients, cardiac
function should be monitored with particular care during the period of
initial dosage adjustment, in a facility with provisions for intensive
cardiac care. </P>

<P>As with levodopa there is a possibility of upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage
in patients with a history of peptic ulcer. </P>

<P>A symptom complex resembling the neuroleptic malignant syndrome including
muscular rigidity, elevated body temperature, mental changes, and increased
serum creatine phosphokinase has been reported when antiparkinsonian agents
were withdrawn abruptly. Therefore, patients should be observed carefully
when the dosage of Carbidopa-levodopa is reduced abruptly or discontinued,
especially if the patient is receiving neuroleptics. </P>

<P>Usage In Pregnancy And Lactation: Although the effects of Carbidopa-levodopa
on human pregnancy and lactation are unknown, both levodopa and combinations
of carbidopa and levodopa have caused visceral and skeletal malformations
in rabbits. Use of Carbidopa-levodopa in women of childbearing potential
requires that the anticipated benefits of the drug be weighed against possible
hazards to mother and child. Carbidopa-levodopa should not be given to
nursing mothers. </P>

<P>Usage In Children: The safety of Carbidopa-levodopa in patients under
18 years of age has not been established. </P>

<P><A NAME="PRECAUTIONS"></A><B>PRECAUTIONS </B></P>

<P>As with levodopa, periodic evaluations of hepatic, hematopoietic, cardiovascular,
and renal function are recommended during extended therapy. </P>

<P>Patients with chronic wide angle glaucoma may be treated cautiously
with Carbidopa-levodopa provided the intraocular pressure is well controlled
and the patient is monitored carefully for changes in intraocular pressure
during therapy. </P>

<P>Laboratory Tests </P>

<P>Abnormalities in laboratory tests may include elevations of liver function
tests such as alkaline phosphatase, SGOT (AST), SGPT (ALT), lactic dehydrogenase,
and bilirubin. Abnormalities in protein-bound iodine, blood urea nitrogen
and positive Coombs test have also been reported. Commonly, levels of blood
urea nitrogen, creatinine, and uric acid are lower during administration
of Carbidopa-levodopa than with levodopa. </P>

<P>Carbidopa-levodopa may cause a false-positive reaction for urinary ketone
bodies when a test tape is used for determination of ketonuria. This reaction
will not be altered by boiling the urine specimen. False-negative tests
may result with the use of glucose-oxidase methods of testing for glucosuria.
</P>

<P>Drug Interactions </P>

<P>Caution Should Be Exercised When The Following Drugs Are Administered
Concomitantly With Carbidopa-levodopa. </P>

<P>Symptomatic postural hypotension can occur when Carbidopa-levodopa is
added to the treatment of a patient receiving antihypertensive drugs. Therefore,
when therapy with Carbidopa-levodopa is started, dosage adjustment of the
antihypertensive drug may be required. For patients receiving monoamine
oxidase inhibitors, see CONTRAINDICATIONS. </P>

<P>There have been rare reports of adverse reactions, including hypertension
and dyskinesia, resulting from the concomitant use of tricyclic antidepressants
and Carbidopa-levodopa. </P>

<P>Phenothiazines and butyrophenones may reduce the therapeutic effects
of levodopa. In addition, the beneficial effects of levodopa in Parkinson's
disease have been reported to be reversed by phenytoin and papaverine.
Patients taking these drugs with Carbidopa-levodopa should be carefully
observed for loss of therapeutic response. </P>

<P><A NAME="ADVERSE REACTIONS"></A><B>ADVERSE REACTIONS </B></P>

<P>The most common serious adverse reactions occurring with Carbidopa-levodopa
are choreiform, dystonic, and other involuntary movements. Other serious
adverse reactions are mental changes including paranoid ideation and psychotic
episodes, depression with or without development of suicidal tendencies,
and dementia. Convulsions also have occurred; however, a causal relationship
with Carbidopa-levodopa has not been established. </P>

<P>A common but less serious effect is nausea. </P>

<P>Less frequent adverse reactions are cardiac irregularities and/or palpitation,
orthostatic hypotensive episodes, bradykinetic episodes (the &quot;on-off&quot;
phenomenon), anorexia, vomiting, and dizziness. </P>

<P>Rarely, gastrointestinal bleeding, development of duodenal ulcer, hypertension,
phlebitis, hemolytic and nonhemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia,
and agranulocytosis have occurred. </P>

<P>Laboratory tests which have been reported to be abnormal are alkaline
phosphatase, SGOT (AST), SGPT (ALT), lactic dehydrogenase, bilirubin, blood
urea nitrogen, protein-bound iodine, and Coombs test. </P>

<P>Other adverse reactions that have been reported with levodopa are: </P>

<P>Nervous System: ataxia, numbness, increased hand tremor, muscle twitching,
muscle cramps, blepharospasm (which may be taken as an early sign of excess
dosage, consideration of dosage reduction may be made at this time), trismus,
activation of latent Horner's syndrome. </P>

<P>Psychiatric: confusion, sleepiness, insomnia, nightmares, hallucinations,
delusions, agitation, anxiety, euphoria. </P>

<P>Gastrointestinal: dry mouth, bitter taste, sialorrhea, dysphagia, bruxism,
hiccups, abdominal pain and distress, constipation, diarrhea, flatulence,
burning sensation of tongue. </P>

<P>Metabolic: weight gain or loss, edema. </P>

<P>Integumentary: malignant melanoma (see also CONTRAINDICATIONS), flushing,
increased sweating, dark sweat, skin rash, loss of hair. </P>

<P>Genitourinary: urinary retention, urinary incontinence, dark urine,
priapism. </P>

<P>Special Senses: diplopia, blurred vision, dilated pupils, oculogyric
crises. </P>

<P>Miscellaneous: weakness, faintness, fatigue, headache, hoarseness, malaise,
hot flashes, sense of stimulation, bizarre breathing patterns, neuroleptic
malignant syndrome. </P>

<P><A NAME="OVERDOSAGE"></A><B>OVERDOSAGE </B></P>

<P>Management of acute overdosage with Carbidopa-levodopa is basically
the same as management of acute overdosage with levodopa; however, pyridoxine
is not effective in reversing the actions of Carbidopa-levodopa. </P>

<P>General supportive measures should be employed, along with immediate
gastric lavage. Intravenous fluids should be administered judiciously and
an adequate airway maintained. Electrocardiographic monitoring should be
instituted and the patient carefully observed for the development of arrhythmias;
if required, appropriate antiarrhythmic therapy should be given. The possibility
that the patient may have taken other drugs as well as Carbidopa-levodopa
should be taken into consideration. To date, no experience has been reported
with dialysis; hence, its value in overdosage is not known. </P>

<P><A NAME="DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION"></A><B>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
</B></P>

<P>The optimum daily dosage of Carbidopa-levodopa must be determined by
careful titration in each patient. Carbidopa-levodopa tablets are available
in a 1:4 ratio of carbidopa to levodopa (Carbidopa-levodopa 25-100) as
well as 1:10 ratio (Carbidopa-levodopa 25-250 and Carbidopa-levodopa 10-100).
Tablets of the two ratios may be given separately or combined as needed
to provide the optimum dosage. </P>

<P>Studies show that peripheral dopa decarboxylase is saturated by carbidopa
at approximately 70 to 100 mg a day. Patients receiving less than this
amount of carbidopa are more likely to experience nausea and vomiting.
</P>

<P>Usual Initial Dosage </P>

<P>Dosage is best initiated with one tablet of Carbidopa-levodopa 25-100
three times a day. This dosage schedule provides 75 mg of carbidopa per
day. Dosage may be increased by one tablet every day or every other day,
as necessary, until a dosage of eight tablets of Carbidopa-levodopa 25-100
a day is reached. </P>

<P>If Carbidopa-levodopa 10-100 is used, dosage may be initiated with one
tablet three or four times a day. However, this will not provide an adequate
amount of carbidopa for many patients. Dosage may be increased by one tablet
every day or every other day until a total of eight tablets (2 tablets
q.i.d.) is reached. </P>

<P>How To Transfer Patients From Levodopa </P>

<P>LEVODOPA MUST BE DISCONTINUED AT LEAST EIGHT HOURS BEFORE STARTING Carbidopa-levodopa
. A daily dosage of Carbidopa-levodopa should be chosen that will provide
approximately 25 percent of the previous levodopa dosage. Patients who
are taking less than 1500 mg of levodopa a day should be started on one
tablet of Carbidopa-levodopa 25-100 three or four times a day. The suggested
starting dosage for most patients taking more than 1500 mg of levodopa
is one tablet of Carbidopa-levodopa 25-250 three or four times a day. </P>

<P>Maintenance </P>

<P>Therapy should be individualized and adjusted according to the desired
therapeutic response. At least 70 to 100 mg of carbidopa per day should
be provided. When a greater proportion of carbidopa is required, one tablet
of Carbidopa-levodopa 25-100 may be substituted for each tablet of Carbidopa-levodopa
10-100. When more levodopa is required, Carbidopa-levodopa 25-250 should
be substituted for Carbidopa-levodopa 25-100 or Carbidopa-levodopa 10-100.
If necessary, the dosage of Carbidopa-levodopa 25-250 may be increased
by one-half or one tablet every day or every other day to a maximum of
eight tablets a day. Experience with total daily dosages of carbidopa greater
than 200 mg is limited. </P>

<P>Because both therapeutic and adverse responses occur more rapidly with
Carbidopa-levodopa than with levodopa alone, patients should be monitored
closely during the dose adjustment period. Specifically, involuntary movements
will occur more rapidly with Carbidopa-levodopa than with levodopa. The
occurrence of involuntary movements may require dosage reduction. Blepharospasm
may be a useful early sign of excess dosage in some patients. </P>

<P>Current evidence indicates that other standard drugs for Parkinson's
disease (except levodopa) may be continued while Carbidopa-levodopa is
being administered, although their dosage may have to be adjusted. </P>

<P>If general anesthesia is required, Carbidopa-levodopa may be continued
as long as the patient is permitted to take fluids and medication by mouth.
If therapy is interrupted temporarily, the usual daily dosage may be administered
as soon as the patient is able to take oral medication. </P>

<P>CONTROLLED RELEASE (CR): </P>

<P>Carbidopa-levodopa CR contains carbidopa and levodopa in a 1:4 ratio
as either the 50-200 tablet or the 25-100 tablet. The daily dosage of Carbidopa-levodopa
CR must be determined by careful titration. Patients should be monitored
closely during the dose adjustment period, particularly with regard to
appearance or worsening of involuntary movements, dyskinesias or nausea.
Carbidopa-levodopa CR 50-200 may be administered as whole or as half-tablets
which should not be chewed or crushed. Carbidopa-levodopa CR 25-100 may
be used in combination with Carbidopa-levodopa CR 50-200 to titrate to
the optimum dosage, or as an alternative to the 50-200 half tablet. </P>

<P>Standard drugs for Parkinson's disease, other than levodopa without
a decarboxylase inhibitor, may be used concomitantly while Carbidopa-levodopa
CR is being administered, although their dosage may have to be adjusted.
</P>

<P>Since carbidopa prevents the reversal of levodopa effects caused by
pyridoxine, Carbidopa-levodopa CR can be given to patients receiving supplemental
pyridoxine (vitamin B6). </P>

<P>Initial Dosage </P>

<P>Patients Currently Treated With Conventional Carbidopa-Levodopa Preparations:
Dosage with Carbidopa-levodopa CR should be substituted at an amount that
provides approximately 10% more levodopa per day, although this may need
to be increased to a dosage that provides up to 30% more levodopa per day
depending on clinical response (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION, Titration).
The interval between doses of Carbidopa-levodopa CR should be 4-8 hours
during the waking day. (See ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacodynamics.)

<P>Patients Currently Treated With Levodopa Without A Decarboxylase Inhibitor:
Levodopa must be discontinued at least eight hours before therapy with
Carbidopa-levodopa CR is started. Carbidopa-levodopa CR should be substituted
at a dosage that will provide approximately 25% of the previous levodopa
dosage. In patients with mild to moderate disease, the initial dose is
usually 1 tablet of Carbidopa-levodopa CR b.i.d. </P>

<P>Patients Not Receiving Levodopa: In patients with mild to moderate disease,
the initial recommended dose is 1 tablet of Carbidopa-levodopa CR 50-200
b.i.d. Initial dosage should not be given at intervals of less than 6 hours.
</P>

<P>Titration With Carbidopa-levodopa CR </P>

<P>Following initiation of therapy, doses and dosing intervals may be increased
or decreased depending upon therapeutic response. Most patients have been
adequately treated with doses of Carbidopa-levodopa CR that provide 400
to 1600 mg of levodopa per day, administered as divided doses at intervals
ranging from 4 to 8 hours during the waking day. Higher doses of Carbidopa-levodopa
CR (2400 mg or more of levodopa per day) and shorter intervals (less than
4 hours) have been used, but are not usually recommended. </P>

<P>When doses of Carbidopa-levodopa CR are given at intervals of less than
4 hours, and/or if the divided doses are not equal, it is recommended that
the smaller doses be given at the end of the day. </P>

<P>An interval of at least 3 days between dosage adjustments is recommended
</P>

<P>Maintenance </P>

<P>Because Parkinson's disease is progressive, periodic clinical evaluations
are recommended; adjustment of the dosage regimen of Carbidopa-levodopa
CR may be required. </P>

<P>Addition Of Other Antiparkinson Medications </P>

<P>Anticholinergic agents, dopamine agonists, and amantadine can be given
with Carbidopa-levodopa CR. Dosage adjustment of Carbidopa-levodopa CR
may be necessary when these agents are added. </P>

<P>A dose of Carbidopa-levodopa (Carbidopa-Levodopa) 25-100 or 10-100 (one
half or a whole tablet) can be added to the dosage regimen of Carbidopa-levodopa
CR in selected patients with advanced disease who need additional immediate
release levodopa for a brief time during daytime hours. </P>

<P>Interruption Of Therapy </P>

<P>Patients should be observed carefully if abrupt reduction or discontinuation
of Carbidopa-levodopa CR is required, especially if the patient is receiving
neuroleptics. (See WARNINGS). </P>

<P>If general anesthesia is required, Carbidopa-levodopa CR may be continued
as long as the patient is permitted to take oral medication. If therapy
is interrupted temporarily, the usual dosage should be administered as
soon as the patient is able to take oral medication. </P>

<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><b>DESCRIPTION</b> 
 <P></P>
Loratadine is a white to off-white powder not soluble in water, but very
soluble in acetone, alcohol, and chloroform. It has a molecular weight of
382.89, and empirical formula of C22H23ClN2O2; its chemical name is ethyl 4-(8
chloro-5,6- dihydro-11H-benzo(5,6)cyclohepta(1,2-b)pyridin-11-ylidene)-1-
piperidinecarboxylate.  <P></P>
 
<a name="ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY"></a><b>ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 
</b> <P></P>
Loratadine is a long-acting tricyclic antihistamine with selective peripheral
histamine H1-receptor antagonistic activity.  <P></P>
 
Human histamine skin wheal studies following single and repeated 10 mg oral
doses of Loratadine Tablets have shown that the drug exhibits an antihistaminic
effect beginning within 1 to 3 hours, reaching a maximum at 8 to 12 hours and
lasting in excess of 24 hours. There was no evidence of tolerance to this
effect after 28 days of dosing with Loratadine Tablets.  <P></P>
 
Pharmacokinetic studies following single and multiple oral doses of loratadine
in 115 volunteers showed that Loratadine Tablets are rapidly absorbed and
extensively metabolized to an active metabolite (descarboethoxyloratadine). The 
specific enzyme systems responsible for metabolism have not been identified. 
Approximately 80% of the total dose administered can be found equally
distributed between urine and feces in the form of metabolic products after 10
days. The mean elimination half-lives found in studies in normal adult subjects 
(n = 54) were 8.4 hours (range = 3 to 20 hours) for Loratadine Tablets and 28
hours (range = 8.8 to 92 hours) for the major active metabolite
(descarboethoxyloratadine). In nearly all patients, exposure (AUC) to the
metabolite is greater than exposure to parent loratadine.  <P></P>
 
In a study involving twelve healthy geriatric subjects (66 to 78 years old),
the AUC and peak plasma levels (Cmax) of both Loratadine Tablets and
descarboethoxyloratadine were significantly higher (approximately 50%
increased) than in studies of younger subjects. The mean elimination half-lives 
for the elderly subjects were 18.2 hours (range = 6.7 to 37 hours) for Loratadine 
Tablets and 17.5 hours (range = 11 to 38 hours) for the active metabolite.  
 <P></P>
Loratadine Tablets, dosed once daily, had reached steady-state by the fifth daily 
dose. The pharmacokinetics of Loratadine Tablets and descarboethoxyloratadine are 
dose independent over the dose range of 10 to 40 mg and are not significantly
altered by the duration of treatment.  <P></P>
 
In the clinical efficacy studies, Loratadine Tablets were administered before
meals. In a single-dose study, food increased the AUC of Loratadine Tablets by
approximately 40% and of descarboethoxyloratadine by approximately 15%. The
time to peak plasma concentration (Tmax) of Loratadine Tablets and
descarboethoxyloratadine was delayed by 1 hour with a meal. Although these
differences would not be expected to be clinically important, Loratadine Tablets
should be administered on an empty stomach.  <P></P>
 
In patients with chronic renal impairment (Creatinine Clearance&lt;/=30 mL/min)
both the AUC and peak plasma levels (Cmax) increased on average by
approximately 73% for Loratadine Tablets; and approximately by 120% for
descarboethoxyloratadine, compared to individuals with normal renal function. 
The mean elimination half-lives of Loratadine Tablets (7.6 hours) and
descarboethoxyloratadine (23.9 hours) were not significantly different from
that observed in normal subjects. Hemodialysis does not have an effect on the
pharmacokinetics of Loratadine Tablets or its active metabolite
(descarboethoxyloratadine) in subjects with chronic renal impairment.  
 <P></P>
In patients with chronic alcoholic liver disease the AUC and peak plasma levels 
(Cmax) of Loratadine Tablets were double while the pharmacokinetic profile of the 
active metabolite (descarboethoxyloratadine) was not significantly changed from 
that in normals. The elimination half-lives for Loratadine Tablets and
descarboethoxyloratadine were 24 hours and 37 hours, respectively, and
increased with increasing severity of liver disease.  <P></P>
 
There was considerable variability in the pharmacokinetic data in all studies
of Loratadine Tablets, probably due to the extensive first-pass metabolism. 
Individual histograms of area under the curve, clearance, and volume of
distribution showed a log normal distribution with a 25-fold range in
distribution in healthy subjects.  
 <P></P>
Loratadine Tablets are about 97% bound to plasma proteins at the expected
concentrations (2.5 to 100 ng/mL) after a therapeutic dose. Loratadine Tablets do 
not affect the plasma protein binding of warfarin and digoxin. The metabolite
descarboethoxyloratadine is 73% to 77% bound to plasma proteins (at 0.5 to 100
ng/mL).  
 <P></P>
Whole body autoradiographic studies in rats and monkeys, radiolabeled tissue
distribution studies in mice and rats, and In Vivo radioligand studies in mice
have shown that neither loratadine nor its metabolites readily cross the blood- 
brain barrier. Radioligand binding studies with guinea pig pulmonary and brain
H1-receptors indicate that there was preferential binding to peripheral versus
central nervous system H1-receptors.  <P></P>
 
Clinical trials of Loratadine Tablets involved over 10,700 patients who received
either Loratadine Tablets or another anithistamine and/or placebo in double-blind 
randomized controlled studies. In placebo-controlled trials, 10 mg once daily
<P></P>
of Loratadine Tablets was superior to placebo and similar to clemastine (1 mg
BID) or terfenadine (60 mg BID) in effects on nasal and non-nasal symptoms of
allergic rhinitis. In these studies, somnolence occurred less frequently with
Loratadine Tablets than with clemastine and at about the same frequency as
terfenadine or placebo. In studies with Loratadine Tablets at doses 2 to 4 times
higher than the recommended dose of 10 mg, a dose-related increase in the
incidence of somnolence was observed. Therefore, some patients, particularly
those with hepatic or renal impairment and the elderly, may experience
somnolence.  <P></P>
 
In a study in which Loratadine Tablets were administered at 4 times the clinical
dose for 90 days, no clinically significant increase in the QTc was seen on
ECGs.  <P></P>
 
<a name="INDICATIONS AND USAGE"></a><b>INDICATIONS AND USAGE 
</b> <P></P>
Loratadine Tablets are indicated for the relief of nasal and non-nasal symptoms
of seasonal allergic rhinitis.  <P></P>
 
<a name="CONTRAINDICATIONS"></a><b>CONTRAINDICATIONS 
<P></P>

</b>Loratadine Tablets are contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to this 
medication or to any of its ingredients.  <P></P>
 
<a name="PRECAUTIONS"></a><b>PRECAUTIONS 
</b> <P></P>
GENERAL: Patients with liver impairment should be given a lower initial dose
(10 mg every other day) because they have reduced clearance of Loratadine
Tablets.  <P></P>
 
DRUG INTERACTIONS:<b> </b>The coadministration of a single 20 mg dose of Loratadine
Tablets (double the recommended daily dose) and a 200 mg dose of ketoconazole
twice daily to 12 subjects resulted in increased plasma concentrations of
loratadine (180% increase in AUC) and its active metabolite,
descarboethoxyloratadine (56% increase in AUC). However, no related changes
were noted in the QTc on ECGs taken at 2, 6, and 24 hours after the
coadministration of loratadine and ketoconazole. Also, there were no
significant differences in clinical adverse events between Loratadine Tablet
groups with or without ketoconazole.  <P></P>
 
Other drugs known to inhibit hepatic metabolism should be coadministered with
caution until definitive interaction studies can be completed. The number of
subjects who concomitantly received macrolide antibiotics, cimetidine,
ranitidine, or theophylline along with Loratadine Tablets in controlled clinical
trials is too small to rule out possible drug-drug interactions. There does not 
appear to be an increase in adverse events in subjects who received oral
contraceptives and Loratadine Tablets compared to placebo.  <P></P>
 
CARCINOGENESIS, MUTAGENESIS, AND IMPAIRMENT OF FERTILITY: In an 18-month
oncogenicity study in mice and a 2-year study in rats, loratadine was
administered in the diet at doses up to 40 mg/kg (mice) and 25 mg/kg (rats). In 
the carcinogenicity studies, pharmacokinetic assessments were carried out to
determine animal exposure to the drug. AUC data demonstrated that the exposure
of mice given 40 mg/kg of loratadine was 3.6 (loratadine) and 18 (active
metabolite) times higher than a human given 10 mg/day. Exposure of rats given
25 mg/kg of loratadine was 28 (loratadine) and 67 (active metabolite) times
higher than a human given 10 mg/day. Male mice given 40 mg/kg had a
significantly higher incidence of hepatocellular tumors (combined adenomas and
carcinomas) than concurrent controls. In rats, a significantly higher incidence 
of hepatocellular tumors (combined adenomas and carcinomas) was observed in
males given 10 mg/kg and males and females given 25 mg/kg. The clinical
significance of these findings during long-term use of Loratadine Tablets is not
known.  <P></P>
 
In mutagenicity studies, there was no evidence of mutagenic potential in
reverse (AMES) or forward point mutation (CHO-HGPRT) assays, or in the assay
for DNA damage (Rat Primary Hepatocyte Unscheduled DNA Assay) or in two assays
for chromosomal aberrations (Human Peripheral Blood Lymphocyte Clastogenesis
Assay and the Mouse Bone Marrow Erythrocyte Micronucleus Assay). In the Mouse
Lymphoma Assay, a positive finding occurred in the nonactivated but not the
activated phase of the study.  <P></P>
 
Loratadine administration produced hepatic microsomal enzyme induction in the
mouse at 40 mg/kg and rat at 25 mg/kg, but not at lower doses.  <P></P>
 
Decreased fertility in male rats, shown by lower female conception rates,
occurred at approximately 64 mg/kg and was reversible with cessation of dosing. 
<P></P>
Loratadine had no effect on male or female fertility or reproduction in the
rat at doses of approximately 24 mg/kg.  <P></P>
 
PREGNANCY CATEGORY B: There was no evidence of animal teratogenicity in studies 
performed in rats and rabbits. There are, however, no adequate and well-
controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are
not always predictive of human response, Loratadine Tablets should be used during 
pregnancy only if clearly needed.  <P></P>
 
NURSING MOTHERS: Loratadine and its metabolite, descarboethoxyloratadine, pass
easily into breast milk and achieve concentrations that are equivalent to
plasma levels with an AUCmilk/AUCplasma ratio of 1.17 and 0.85 for the parent
and active metabolite, respectively. Following a single oral dose of 40 mg, a
small amount of loratadine and metabolite was excreted into the breast milk
(approximately 0.03% of 40 mg over 48 hours). A decision should be made whether 
to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the
importance of the drug to the mother. Caution should be exercised when Loratadine 
Tablets are administered to a nursing woman.  <P></P>
 
PEDIATRIC USE:  Safety and effectiveness in children below the age of 12 years
have not been established.  <P></P>
 
<a name="DRUG INTERACTIONS"></a><b>DRUG INTERACTIONS 
</b> <P></P>
The coadministration of a single 20 mg dose of Loratadine Tablets (double the
recommended daily dose) and a 200 mg dose of ketoconazole twice daily to 12
subjects resulted in increased plasma concentrations of loratadine (180%
increase in AUC) and its active metabolite, descarboethoxyloratadine (56%
increase in AUC). However, no related changes were noted in the QTc on ECGs
taken at 2, 6, and 24 hours after the coadministration of loratadine and
ketoconazole. Also, there were no significant differences in clinical adverse
events between Loratadine Tablet groups with or without ketoconazole.  
 <P></P>
Other drugs known to inhibit hepatic metabolism should be coadministered with
caution until definitive interaction studies can be completed. The number of
subjects who concomitantly received macrolide antibiotics, cimetidine,
ranitidine, or theophylline along with Loratadine Tablets in controlled clinical
trials is too small to rule out possible drug-drug interactions. There does not 
appear to be an increase in adverse events in subjects who received oral

(See Also PRECAUTIONS) 
 <P></P>
<a name="ADVERSE REACTIONS"></a><b>ADVERSE REACTIONS 
</b> <P></P>
Approximately 90,000 patients received Loratadine Tablets 10 mg once daily in
controlled and uncontrolled studies. Placebo-controlled clincial trials at the
recommended dose of 10 mg once a day varied from 2 weeks' to 6 months'
duration.  The rate of premature withdrawal from these trials was approximately 
2% in both the treated and placebo groups.  <P></P>

DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE 
 <P></P>
There is no information to indicate that abuse or dependency occurs with
Loratadine Tablets.  <P></P>
 
<a name="OVERDOSAGE"></a><b>OVERDOSAGE 
</b> <P></P>
Somnolence, tachycardia, and headache have been reported with overdoses greater 
than 10 mg (40 to 180 mg). In the event of overdosage, general symptomatic and
supportive measures should be instituted promptly and maintained for as long as 
necessary.  <P></P>
 
Treatment of overdosage would reasonably consist of emesis (ipecac syrup),
except in patients with impaired consciousness, followed by the administration
of activated charcoal to absorb any remaining drug. If vomiting is unsuccessful 
or contraindicated, gastric lavage should be performed with normal saline. 
Saline cathartics may also be of value for rapid dilution of bowel contents. 
Loratadine is not eliminated by hemodialysis. It is not known if loratadine is
eliminated by peritoneal dialysis.  <P></P>
 
Oral LD50 values for loratadine were greater than 5000 mg/kg in rats and mice.  
Doses as high as 10 times the recommended clinical doses showed no effects in
rats, mice, and monkeys.  <P></P>
 
<a name="DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION"></a><b>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION 
</b> <P></P>
Adults and children 12 years of age and over: One 10 mg tablet daily on an
empty stomach.  <P></P>
 
In patients with liver failure, 10 mg every other day should be the starting
dose.  <P></P>

<p><a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><b>DESCRIPTION </b></p>

<p>Clomipramine is an antiobsessional drug that belongs to the class (dibenzazepine)
of pharmacologic agents known as tricyclic antidepressants. </p>

<p>Clomipramine hydrochloride is 3-chloro- 5-(3-(dimethylamino)propyl)-10,11-
dihydro-5H- dibenz(b,f)azepine monohydrochloride. </p>

<p>Clomipramine hydrochloride is a white to off- white crystalline powder.
It is freely soluble in water, in methanol, and in methylene chloride,
and insoluble in ethyl ether and in hexane. Its molecular weight is 351.3.
</p>

<p><a name="ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY"></a><b>ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
</b></p>

<p>PHARMACODYNAMICS </p>

<p>Clomipramine (CMI) is presumed to influence obsessive and compulsive
behaviors through its effects on serotonergic neuronal transmission. The
actual neurochemical mechanism is unknown, but CMI's capacity to inhibit
the reuptake of serotonin (5-HT) is thought to be important. </p>

<p>PHARMACOKINETICS </p>

<p>ABSORPTION/BIOAVAILABILITY: CMI from Clomipramine capsules is as bioavailable
as CMI from a solution. The bioavailability of CMI from capsules is not
significantly affected by food. </p>

<p>In a dose proportionality study involving multiple CMI doses, steady-state
plasma concentrations (CSS) and area-under-plasma- concentration-time curves
(AUC) of CMI and CMI's major active metabolite, desmethylclomipramine (DMI),
were not proportional to dose over the ranges evaluated, i.e., between
25-100 mg/day and between 25-150 mg/day, although CSS and AUC are approximately
linearly related to dose between 100-150 mg/day. The relationship between
dose and CMI/DMI concentrations at higher daily doses has not been systematically
assessed, but if there is significant dose dependency at doses above 150
mg/day, there is the potential for dramatically higher CSS and AUC even
for patients dosed within the recommended range. This may pose a potential
risk to some patients (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions).
</p>

<p>After a single 50-mg oral dose, maximum plasma concentrations of CMI
occur within 2-6 hours (mean, 4.7 hr) and range from 56 ng/ml to 154 ng/ml
(mean, 92 ng/ml). After multiple daily doses of 150 mg of Clomipramine,
steady-state maximum plasma concentrations range from 94 ng/ml to 339 ng/ml
(mean, 218 ng/ml) for CMI and from 134 ng/ml to 532 ng/ml (mean, 274 ng/ml)
for DMI. No pharmacokinetic information is available for doses ranging
from 150 mg/day to 250 mg/day, the maximum recommended daily dose. </p>

<p>DISTRIBUTION: CMI distributes into cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and brain
and into breast milk. DMI also distributes into CSF, with a mean CSF/plasma
ratio of 2.6. The protein binding of CMI is approximately 97%, principally
to albumin, and is independent of CMI concentration. The interaction between
CMI and other highly protein-bound drugs has not been fully evaluated,
but may be important (see PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions). </p>

<p>METABOLISM: CMI is extensively biotransformed to DMI and other metabolites
and their glucuronide conjugates. DMI is pharmacologically active, but
its effects on OCD behaviors are unknown. These metabolites are excreted
in urine and feces, following biliary elimination. After a 25-mg radiolabeled
dose of CMI in two subjects, 60% and 51%, respectively, of the dose were
recovered in the urine and 32% and 24%, respectively, in feces. In the
same study, the combined urinary recoveries of CMI and DMI were only about
0.8-1.3% of the dose administered. CMI does not induce drug-metabolizing
enzymes, as measured by antipyrine half-life. </p>

<p>ELIMINATION: Evidence that the CSS and AUC for CMI and DMI may increase
disproportionately with increasing oral doses suggests that the metabolism
of CMI and DMI may be capacity limited. This fact must be considered in
assessing the estimates of the pharmacokinetic parameters presented below,
as these were obtained in individuals exposed to doses of 150 mg. If the
pharmacokinetics of CMI and DMI are nonlinear at doses above 150 mg, their
elimination half-lives may be considerably lengthened at doses near the
upper end of the recommended dosing range (i.e., 200 mg/day to 250mg/day).
Consequently, CMI and DMI may accumulate, and this accumulation may increase
the incidence of any dose- or plasma- concentration-dependent adverse reactions,
in particular seizures (see WARNINGS). </p>

<p>After a 150-mg dose, the half-life of CMI ranges from 19 hours to 37
hours (mean, 32 hr) and that of DMI ranges from 54 hours to 77 hours (mean,
69 hr). Steady-state levels after multiple dosing are typically reached
within 7-14 days for CMI. Plasma concentrations of the metabolite exceed
the parent drug on multiple dosing. After multiple dosing with 150 mg/day,
the accumulation factor for CMI is approximately 2.5 and for DMI is 4.6.
Importantly, it may take two weeks or longer to achieve this extent of
accumulation at constant dosing because of the relatively long elimination
half-lives of CMI and DMI (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). The effects
of hepatic and renal impairment on the disposition of Clomipramine have
not been determined. </p>

<p>INTERACTIONS: Coadministration of haloperidol with CMI increases plasma
concentrations of CMI. Coadministration of CMI with phenobarbital increases
plasma concentrations of phenobarbital (see PRECAUTIONS. Drug Interactions).
Younger subjects (18-40 years of age) tolerated CMI better and had significantly
lower steady-state plasma concentrations, compared with subjects over 65
years of age. Children under 15 years of age had significantly lower plasma
concentration/dose ratios, compared with adults. Plasma concentrations
of CMI were significantly lower in smokers than in nonsmokers. </p>

<p>ANIMAL PHARMACOLOGY </p>

<p>Testicular and lung changes commonly associated with tricyclic compounds
have been observed with Clomipramine. In 1- and 2-year studies in rats,
changes in the testes (atrophy, aspermatogenesis, and calcification) and
drug-induced phospholipidosis in the lungs were observed at doses 4 times
the maximum daily human dose. Testicular atrophy was also observed in a
1-year oral toxicity study in dogs at 10 times the maximum daily human
dose. </p>

<p><a name="INDICATIONS AND USAGE"></a><b>INDICATIONS AND USAGE </b></p>

<p>Clomipramine is indicated for the treatment of obsessions and compulsions
in patients with Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD). The obsessions or
compulsions must cause marked distress, be time-consuming, or significantly
interfere with social or occupational functioning, in order to meet the
DSM-III-R (circa 1989) diagnosis of OCD. </p>

<p>Obsessions are recurrent, persistent ideas, thoughts, images, or impulses
that are ego- dystonic. Compulsions are repetitive, purposeful, and intentional
behaviors performed in response to an obsession or in a stereotyped fashion,
and are recognized by the person as excessive or unreasonable. </p>

<p>The effectiveness of Clomipramine for the treatment of OCD was demonstrated
in multicenter, placebo- controlled, parallel-group studies, including
two 10-week studies in adults and one 8-week study in children and adolescents
10-17 years of age. Patients in all studies had moderate-to-severe OCD
(DSM-III), with mean baseline ratings on the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive
Scale (YBOCS) ranging from 26 to 28 and a mean baseline rating of 10 on
the NIMH Clinical Global Obsessive Compulsive Scale (NIMH-OC). Patients
taking CMI experienced a mean reduction of approximately 10 on the YBOCS,
representing an average improvement on this scale of 35% to 42% among adults
and 37% among children and adolescents. CMI treated patients experienced
a 3.5 unit decrement on the NIMH-OC. Patients on placebo showed no important
clinical response on either scale. The maximum dose was 250 mg/day for
most adults and 3 mg/kg/day (up to 200 mg) for all children and adolescents.
</p>

<p>The effectiveness of Clomipramine for long-term use (i.e., for more
than 10 weeks) has not been systematically evaluated in placebo-controlled
trials. The physician who elects to use Clomipramine for extended periods
should periodically reevaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for
the individual patient (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). </p>

<p><a name="CONTRAINDICATIONS"></a><b>CONTRAINDICATIONS </b></p>

<p>Clomipramine is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity
to Clomipramine or other tricyclic antidepressants. </p>

<p>Clomipramine should not be given in combination, or within 14 days before
or after treatment, with a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor. Hyperpyretic
crisis, seizures, coma, and death have been reported in patients receiving
such combinations. </p>

<p>Clomipramine is contraindicated during the acute recovery period after
a myocardial infarction. </p>

<p><a name="WARNINGS"></a><b>WARNINGS </b></p>

<p>SEIZURES </p>

<p>During premarket evaluation, seizure was identified as the most significant
risk of Clomipramine use. </p>

<p>The observed cumulative incidence of seizures among patients exposed
to Clomipramine at doses up to 300 mg/day was 0.64% at 90 days, 1.12% at
180 days, and 1.45% at 365 days. The cumulative rates correct the crude
rate of 0.7% (25 of the 3519 patients) for the variable duration of exposure
in clinical trials. Although dose appears to be a predictor of seizure,
there is a confounding of dose and duration of exposure, making it difficult
to assess independently the effect of either factor alone. The ability
to predict the occurrence of seizures in subjects exposed to doses of CMI
greater than 250 mg is limited, given that the plasma concentration of
CMI may be dose-dependent and may vary among subjects given the same dose.
Nevertheless, prescribers are advised to limit the daily dose to a maximum
of 250 mg in adults and 3 mg/kg (or 200 mg) in children and adolescents
(see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). </p>

<p>Caution should be used in administering Clomipramine to patients with
a history of seizures or other predisposing factors, e.g., brain damage
of varying etiology, alcoholism, and concomitant use with other drugs that
lower the seizure threshold. </p>

<p>Rare reports of fatalities in association with seizures have been recorded
by foreign post- marketing surveillance, but not in U.S. clinical trials.
In some of these cases, Clomipramine had been administered with other epileptogenic
agents; in others, the patients involved had possibly predisposing medical
conditions. Thus a causal association between Clomipramine treatment and
these fatalities has not been established. </p>

<p>Physicians should discuss with patients the risk of taking Clomipramine
while engaging in activities in which sudden loss of consciousness could
result in serious injury to the patient or others, e.g., the operation
of complex machinery, driving, swimming, climbing. </p>

<p><a name="PRECAUTIONS"></a><b>PRECAUTIONS </b></p>

<p>GENERAL </p>

<p>SUICIDE: Since depression is a commonly associated feature of OCD, the
risk of suicide must be considered. Prescriptions for Clomipramine should
be written for the smallest quantity of capsules consistent with good patient
management, in order to reduce the risk of overdose. </p>

<p>CARDIOVASCULAR EFFECTS: Modest orthostatic decreases in blood pressure
and modest tachycardia were each seen in approximately 20% of patients
taking Clomipramine in clinical trials; but patients were frequently asymptomatic.
Among approximately 1400 patients treated with CMI in the premarketing
experience who had ECGs, 1.5% developed abnormalities during treatment,
compared with 3.1% of patients receiving active control drugs and 0.7%
of patients receiving placebo. The most common ECG changes were PVCs, ST-T
wave changes, and intraventricular conduction abnormalities. These changes
were rarely associated with significant clinical symptoms. Nevertheless,
caution is necessary in treating patients with known cardiovascular disease,
and gradual dose titration is recommended. </p>

<p>PSYCHOSIS, CONFUSION, AND OTHER NEUROPSYCHIATRIC PHENOMENA: Patients
treated with Clomipramine have been reported to show a variety of neuropsychiatric
signs and symptoms including delusions, hallucinations, psychotic episodes,
confusion, and paranoia. Because of the uncontrolled nature of many of
the studies, it is impossible to provide a precise estimate of the extent
of risk imposed by treatment with Clomipramine. As with tricyclic antidepressants
to which it is closely related, Clomipramine may precipitate an acute psychotic
episode in patients with unrecognized schizophrenia. </p>

<p>MANIA/HYPOMANIA: During premarketing testing of Clomipramine in patients
with affective disorder, hypomania or mania was precipitated in several
patients. Activation of mania or hypomania has also been reported in a
small proportion of patients with affective disorder treated with marketed
tricyclic antidepressants, which are closely related to Clomipramine. </p>

<p>HEPATIC CHANGES: During premarketing testing, Clomipramine was occasionally
associated with elevations in SGOT and SGPT (pooled incidence of approximately
1% and 3%, respectively) of potential clinical importance (i.e., values
greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal). In the vast majority of
instances these enzyme increases were not associated with other clinical
findings suggestive of hepatic injury; moreover, none were jaundiced. Rare
reports of more severe liver injury, some fatal, have been recorded in
foreign post-marketing experience. Caution is indicated in treating patients
with known liver disease, and periodic monitoring of hepatic enzyme levels
is recommended in such patients. </p>

<p>HEMATOLOGIC CHANGES: Although no instances of severe hematologic toxicity
were seen in the premarketing experience with Clomipramine, there have
been post- marketing reports of leukopenia, agranulocytosis, thrombocytopenia,
anemia, and pancytopenia in association with Clomipramine use. As is the
case with tricyclic antidepressants to which Clomipramine is closely related,
leukocyte and differential blood counts should be obtained in patients
who develop fever and sore throat during treatment with Clomipramine. </p>

<p>CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM: More than 30 cases of hyperthermia have been
recorded by nondomestic post-marketing surveillance systems. Most cases
occurred when Clomipramine was used in combination with other drugs when
Clomipramine and a neuroleptic were used concomitantly, the cases were
sometimes considered to be examples of a neuroleptic malignant syndrome.
</p>

<p>SEXUAL DYSFUNCTION: The rate of sexual dysfunction in male patients
with OCD who were treated with Clomipramine in the premarketing experience
was markedly increased compared with placebo controls (i.e., 42% experienced
ejaculatory failure and 20% experienced impotence, compared with 2.0% and
2.6%, respectively, in the placebo group). Approximately 85% of males with
sexual dysfunction chose to continue treatment. </p>

<p>WEIGHT CHANGES: In controlled studies of OCD, weight gain was reported
in 18% of patients receiving Clomipramine, compared with 1% of patients
receiving placebo. In these studies, 28% of patients receiving Clomipramine
had a weight gain of at least 7% of their initial body weight, compared
with 4% of patients receiving placebo. Several patients had weight gains
in excess of 25% of their initial body weight. Conversely, 5% of patients
receiving Clomipramine and 1% receiving placebo had weight losses of at
least 7% of their initial body weight. </p>

<p>ELECTROCONVULSIVE THERAPY: As with closely related tricyclic antidepressants,
concurrent administration of Clomipramine with electroconvulsive therapy
may increase the risks; such treatment should be limited to those patients
for whom it is essential, since there is limited clinical experience. </p>

<p>SURGERY: Prior to elective surgery with general anesthetics, therapy
with Clomipramine should be discontinued for as long as is clinically feasible,
and the anesthetist should be advised. </p>

<p>USE IN CONCOMITANT ILLNESS: As with closely related tricyclic antidepressants,
Clomipramine should be used with caution in the following: </p>

<p>1. Hyperthyroid patients or patients receiving thyroid medication, because
of the possibility of cardiac toxicity. </p>

<p>2. Patients with increased intraocular pressure, a history of narrow-angle
glaucoma, or urinary retention, because of the anticholinergic properties
of the drug. </p>

<p>3. Patients with tumors of the adrenal medulla (e.g., pheochromocytoma,
neuroblastoma) in whom the drug may provoke hypertensive crises. </p>

<p>4. Patients with significantly impaired renal function. </p>

<p>WITHDRAWAL SYMPTOMS: A variety of withdrawal symptoms have been reported
in association with abrupt discontinuation of Clomipramine, including dizziness,
nausea, vomiting, headache, malaise, sleep disturbance, hyperthermia, and
irritability. In addition, such patients may experience a worsening of
psychiatric status. While the withdrawal effects of Clomipramine have not
been systematically evaluated in controlled trials, they are well known
with closely related tricyclic antidepressants, and it is recommended that
the dosage be tapered gradually and the patient monitored carefully during
discontinuation (see DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE). </p>

<p>INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS </p>

<p>Physicians are advised to discuss the following issues with patients
for whom they prescribe Clomipramine: </p>

<p>1. The risk of seizure (see WARNINGS); </p>

<p>2. The relatively high incidence of sexual dysfunction among males (see
PRECAUTIONS; Sexual Dysfunction); </p>

<p>3. Since Clomipramine may impair the mental and/or physical abilities
required for the performance of complex tasks, and since Clomipramine is
associated with a risk of seizures, patients should be cautioned about
the performance of complex and hazardous tasks (see WARNINGS); </p>

<p>4. Patients should be cautioned about using alcohol, barbiturates, or
other CNS depressants concurrently, since Clomipramine may exaggerate their
response to these drugs; </p>

<p>5. Patients should notify their physician if they become pregnant or
intend to become pregnant during therapy; </p>

<p>6. Patients should notify their physician if they are breast-feeding.
</p>

<p>DRUG INTERACTIONS </p>

<p>The risks of using Clomipramine in combination with other drugs have
not been systematically evaluated. Given the primary CNS effects of Clomipramine,
caution is advised in using it concomitantly with other CNS-active drugs
(see Information for Patients). Clomipramine should Not be used with MAO
inhibitors (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). </p>

<p>Close supervision and careful adjustment of dosage are required when
Clomipramine is administered with anticholinergic or sympathomimetic drugs.
</p>

<p>Several tricyclic antidepressants have been reported to block the pharmacologic
effects of guanethidine, clonidine, or similar agents, and such an effect
may be anticipated with CMI because of its structural similarity to other
tricyclic antidepressants. </p>

<p>The plasma concentration of CMI has been reported to be increased by
the concomitant administration of haloperidol; plasma levels of several
closely related tricyclic antidepressants have been reported to be increased
by the concomitant administration of methylphenidate or hepatic enzyme
inhibitors (e.g., cimetidine, fluoxetine) and decreased by the concomitant
administration of hepatic enzyme inducers (e.g., barbiturates, phenytoin),
and such an effect may be anticipated with CMI as well. Administration
of CMI has been reported to increase the plasma levels of phenobarbital,
if given concomitantly (see ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Interactions).
</p>

<p>Because Clomipramine is highly bound to serum protein, the administration
of Clomipramine to patients taking other drugs that are highly bound to
protein (e.g., warfarin, digoxin) may cause an increase in plasma concentrations
of these drugs, potentially resulting in adverse effects. Conversely, adverse
effects may result from displacement of protein-bound Clomipramine by other
highly bound drugs (see ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Distribution). </p>

<p>CARCINOGENESIS, MUTAGENESIS, IMPAIRMENT OF FERTILITY In a 2-year bioassay,
no clear evidence of carcinogenicity was found in rats given doses 20 times
the maximum daily human dose. Three out of 235 treated rats had a rare
tumor (hemangioendothelioma); it is unknown if these neoplasms are compound
related. </p>

<p>In reproduction studies, no effects on fertility were found in rats
given doses approximately 5 times the maximum daily human dose. </p>

<p>PREGNANCY CATEGORY C </p>

<p>No teratogenic effects were observed in studies performed in rats and
mice at doses up to 20 times the maximum daily human dose. Slight nonspecific
fetotoxic effects were seen in the offspring of pregnant mice given doses
10 times the maximum daily human dose. Slight nonspecific embryotoxicity
was observed in rats given doses 5-10 times the maximum daily human dose.
</p>

<p>There are no adequate or well-controlled studies in pregnant women.
Withdrawal symptoms, including jitteriness, tremor, and seizures, have
been reported in neonates whose mothers had taken Clomipramine until delivery.
Clomipramine should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit
justifies the potential risk to the fetus. </p>

<p>NURSING MOTHERS </p>

<p>Clomipramine has been found in human milk. Because of the potential
for adverse reactions, a decision should be made whether to discontinue
nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance
of the drug to the mother. </p>

<p>PEDIATRIC USE </p>

<p>In a controlled clinical trial in children and adolescents (10-17 years
of age), 46 outpatients received Clomipramine for up to 8 weeks. In addition,
150 adolescent patients have received Clomipramine in open-label protocols
for periods of several months to several years. Of the 196 adolescents
studied, 50 were 13 years of age or less and 146 were 14-17 years of age.
While the adverse reaction profile in this age group (see ADVERSE REACTIONS)
is similar to that in adults, it is unknown what, if any, effects long-term
treatment with Clomipramine may have on the growth and development of children.
</p>

<p>The safety and effectiveness in children below the age of 10 have not
been established. Therefore, specific recommendations cannot be made for
the use of Clomipramine in children under the age of 10. </p>

<p>USE IN ELDERLY </p>

<p>Clomipramine has not been systematically studied in older patients;
but 152 patients at least 60 years of age participating in U.S. clinical
trials received Clomipramine for periods of several months to several years.
No unusual age-related adverse events have been identified in this elderly
population, but these data are insufficient to rule out possible age-related
differences, particularly in elderly patients who have concomitant systemic
illnesses or who are receiving other drugs concomitantly. </p>

<p>Because Clomipramine is highly bound to serum protein, the administration
of Clomipramine to patients taking other drugs that are highly bound to
protein (e.g., warfarin, digoxin) may cause an increase in plasma concentrations
of these drugs, potentially resulting in adverse effects. Conversely, adverse
effects may result from displacement of protein-bound Clomipramine by other
highly bound drugs (see ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Distribution). (See
Also PRECAUTIONS) </p>

<p><a name="ADVERSE REACTIONS"></a><b>ADVERSE REACTIONS </b></p>

<p>COMMONLY OBSERVED </p>

<p>The most commonly observed adverse events associated with the use of
Clomipramine and not seen at an equivalent incidence among placebo-treated
patients were gastrointestinal complaints, including dry mouth, constipation,
nausea, dyspepsia, and anorexia; nervous system complaints, including somnolence,
tremor, dizziness, nervousness, and myoclonus; genitourinary complaints,
including changed libido, ejaculatory failure, impotence, and micturition
disorder; and other miscellaneous complaints, including fatigue, sweating,
increased appetite, weight gain, and visual changes. </p>

<p>LEADING TO DISCONTINUATION OF TREATMENT </p>

<p>Approximately 20% of 3616 patients who received Clomipramine in U.S.
premarketing clinical trials discontinued treatment because of an adverse
event. Approximately one-half of the patients who discontinued (9% of the
total) had multiple complaints, none of which could be classified as primary.
Where a primary reason for discontinuation could be identified, most patients
discontinued because of nervous system complaints (5.4%), primarily somnolence.
The second-most-frequent reason for discontinuation was digestive system
complaints (1.3%), primarily vomiting and nausea. </p>

<p>INCIDENCE IN CONTROLLED CLINICAL TRIALS </p>

<p>The following table enumerates adverse events that occurred at an incidence
of 1% or greater among patients with OCD who received Clomipramine in adult
or pediatric placebo-controlled clinical trials. The frequencies were obtained
from pooled data of clinical trials involving either adults receiving Clomipramine
(N=322) or placebo (N=319) or children treated with Clomipramine (N=46)
or placebo (N=44). The prescriber should be aware that these figures cannot
be used to predict the incidence of side effects in the course of usual
medical practice, in which patient characteristics and other factors differ
from those which prevailed in the clinical trials. Similarly, the cited
frequencies cannot be compared with figures obtained from other clinical
investigations involving different treatments, uses, and investigators.
The cited figures, however, provide the physician with a basis for estimating
the relative contribution of drug and nondrug factors to the incidence
of side effects in the populations studied. </p>

<p>OTHER EVENTS OBSERVED DURING THE PREMARKETING EVALUATION OF Clomipramine
</p>

<p>During clinical testing in the U.S., multiple doses of Clomipramine
were administered to approximately 3600 subjects. Untoward events associated
with this exposure were recorded by clinical investigators using terminology
of their own choosing. Consequently, it is not possible to provide a meaningful
estimate of the proportion of individuals experiencing adverse events without
first grouping similar types of untoward events into a smaller number of
standardized event categories. </p>

dictionary of terminology has been used to classify reported adverse events.
The frequencies presented, therefore, represent the proportion of the 3525
individuals exposed to Clomipramine who experienced an event of the type
cited on at least one occasion while receiving Clomipramine. All events
are included except those already listed in the previous table, those reported
in terms so general as to be uninformative, and those in which an association
with the drug was remote. It is important to emphasize that although the
events reported occurred during treatment with Clomipramine, they were
not necessarily caused by it. Events are further categorized by body system
and listed in order of decreasing frequency according to the following
definitions: frequent adverse events are those occurring on one or more
occasions in at least 1/100 patients; infrequent adverse events are those
occurring in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients; rare events are those occurring
in less than 1/1000 patients. </p>

<p>DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE </p>

<p>Clomipramine has not been systematically studied in animals or humans
for its potential for abuse, tolerance, or physical dependence. While a
variety of withdrawal symptoms have been described in association with
Clomipramine discontinuation (see PRECAUTIONS, Withdrawal Symptoms), there
is no evidence for drug-seeking behavior, except for a single report of
potential Clomipramine abuse by a patient with a history of dependence
on codeine, benzodiazepines, and multiple psychoactive drugs. The patient
received Clomipramine for depression and panic attacks and appeared to
become dependent after hospital discharge. </p>

<p>Despite the lack of evidence suggesting an abuse liability for Clomipramine
in foreign marketing, it is not possible to predict the extent to which
Clomipramine might be misused or abused once marketed in the U.S. Consequently,
physicians should carefully evaluate patients for a history of drug abuse
and follow such patients closely. </p>

<p><a name="OVERDOSAGE"></a><b>OVERDOSAGE </b></p>

<p>HUMAN EXPERIENCE </p>

<p>In U.S. clinical trials, 2 deaths occurred in 12 reported cases of acute
overdosage with Clomipramine either alone or in combination with other
drugs. One death involved a patient suspected of ingesting a dose of 7000
mg. The second death involved a patient suspected of ingesting a dose of
5750 mg. The 10 nonfatal cases involved doses of up to 5000 mg, accompanied
by plasma levels of up to 1010 ng/ml. All 10 patients completely recovered.
Among reports from other countries of Clomipramine overdose, the lowest
dose associated with a fatality was 750 mg. Based upon post- marketing
reports in the United Kingdom, CMI's lethality in overdose is considered
to be similar to that reported for closely related tricyclic compounds
marketed as antidepressants. </p>

<p>SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS </p>

<p>Signs and symptoms vary in severity depending upon factors such as the
amount of drug absorbed, the age of the patient, and the time elapsed since
drug ingestion. Blood and urine levels of Clomipramine may not reflect
the severity of poisoning: they have chiefly a qualitative rather than
quantitative value, and they are unreliable indicators in the clinical
management of the patient. The first signs and symptoms of poisoning with
tricyclic antidepressants are generally severe anticholinergic reactions.
CNS abnormalities may include drowsiness, stupor, coma, ataxia, restlessness,
agitation, delirium, severe perspiration, hyperactive reflexes, muscle
rigidity, athetoid and choreiform movements, and convulsions. Cardiac abnormalities
may include arrhythmia, tachycardia, ECG evidence of impaired conduction,
and signs of congestive heart failure, and in very rare cases, cardiac
arrest. Respiratory depression, cyanosis, hypotension, shock, vomiting,
hyperpyrexia, mydriasis, oliguria or anuria, and diaphoresis may also be
present. </p>

<p>TREATMENT </p>

<p>The recommended treatment for tricyclic overdose may change periodically.
Therefore, it is recommended that the physician contact a poison control
center for current information on treatment. </p>

<p>Because CNS involvement, respiratory depression, and cardiac arrhythmia
can occur suddenly, hospitalization and close observation may be necessary,
even when the amount ingested is thought to be small or the initial degree
of intoxication appears slight or moderate. All patients with ECG abnormalities
should have continuous cardiac monitoring and be closely observed until
well after the cardiac status has returned to normal; relapses may occur
after apparent recovery. </p>

<p>In the alert patient, the stomach should be emptied promptly by lavage.
In the obtunded patient, the airway should be secured with a cuffed endotracheal
tube before beginning lavage (do not induce emesis). Instillation of activated
charcoal slurry may help reduce absorption of CMI. </p>

<p>External stimulation should be minimized to reduce the tendency for
convulsions. If anticonvulsants are necessary, diazepam and phenytoin may
be useful. Adequate respiratory exchange should be maintained, including
intubation and artificial respiration, if necessary. Respiratory stimulants
should not be used. </p>

<p>In severe hypotension or shock, the patient should be placed in an appropriate
position and given a plasma expander, and, if necessary, a vasopressor
agent by intravenous drip. The use of corticosteroids in shock is controversial
and may be contraindicated in cases of overdosage with tricyclic antidepressants.
</p>

<p>Digitalis may increase conduction abnormalities and further irritate
an already sensitized myocardium. If congestive heart failure necessitates
rapid digitalization, particular care must be exercised. Hyperpyrexia should
be controlled by whatever external means are available, including ice packs
and cooling sponge baths, if necessary. Hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis,
exchange transfusions, and forced diuresis have generally been reported
as ineffective because of the rapid fixation of Clomipramine in tissues.
</p>

<p>The slow intravenous administration of physostigmine salicylate has
been used as a last resort to reverse severe CNS anticholinergic manifestations
of overdosage with tricylic antidepressants; however, it should not be
used routinely, since it may induce seizures and cholinergic crises. </p>

<p><a name="DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION"></a><b>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
</b></p>

<p>The treatment regimens described below are based on those used in controlled
clinical trials of Clomipramine in 520 adults, and 91 children and adolescents
with OCD. During initial titration, Clomipramine should be given in divided
doses with meals to reduce gastrointestinal side effects. The goal of this
initial titration phase is to minimize side effects by permitting tolerance
to side effects to develop or allowing the patient time to adapt if tolerance
does not develop. </p>

<p>Because both CMI and its active metabolite, DMI, have long elimination
half- lives, the prescriber should take into consideration the fact that
steady-state plasma levels may not be achieved until 2-3 weeks after dosage
change (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY). Therefore, after initial titration,
it may be appropriate to wait 2-3 weeks between further dosage adjustments.
</p>

<p>INITIAL TREATMENT/DOSE ADJUSTMENT (ADULTS) </p>

<p>Treatment with Clomipramine should be initiated at a dosage of 25 mg
daily and gradually increased, as tolerated, to approximately 100 mg during
the first 2 weeks. During initial titration, Clomipramine should be given
in divided doses with meals to reduce gastrointestinal side effects. Thereafter,
the dosage may be increased gradually over the next several weeks, up to
a maximum of 250 mg daily. After titration, the total daily dose may be
given once daily at bedtime to minimize daytime sedation. </p>

<p>INITIAL TREATMENT/DOSE ADJUSTMENT (CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS) </p>

<p>As with adults, the starting dose is 25 mg daily and should be gradually
increased (also given in divided doses with meals to reduce gastrointestinal
side effects) during the first 2 weeks, as tolerated, up to a daily maximum
of 3 mg/kg or 100 mg, whichever is smaller. Thereafter, the dosage may
be increased gradually over the next several weeks up to a daily maximum
of 3 mg/kg or 200 mg, whichever is smaller (see PRECAUTIONS, Pediatric
Use). As with adults, after titration, the total daily dose may be given
once daily at bedtime to minimize daytime sedation. </p>

<p>MAINTENANCE/CONTINUATION TREATMENT (ADULTS, CHILDREN, AND ADOLESCENTS)
</p>

<p>While there are no systematic studies that answer the question of how
long to continue Clomipramine, OCD is a chronic condition and it is reasonable
to consider continuation for a responding patient. Although the efficacy
of Clomipramine after 10 weeks has not been documented in controlled trials,
patients have been continued in therapy under double-blind conditions for
up to 1 year without loss of benefit. However, dosage adjustments should
be made to maintain the patient on the lowest effective dosage, and patients
should be periodically reassessed to determine the need for treatment.
During maintenance, the total daily dose may be given once daily at bedtime.

 <a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><b>DESCRIPTION 
</b> <p>
Cisapride tablets contain cisapride as the monohydrate, which is 
an oral gastrointestinal prokinetic agent chemically designated as (+/-)-cis-4- 
amino-5-chloro-N-(1-(3-(4-fluorophenoxy)propyl)-3-methoxy-4-piperidinyl)-2-
methoxybenzamide monohydrate. Its empirical formula is C23H29CIFN3O4.H2O. The
molecular weight is 483.97.  
 <p>
Cisapride as the monohydrate is a white to slightly beige odorless powder. It
is practically insoluble in water, sparingly soluble in methanol, and soluble
in acetone. Each 1.04 mg of cisapride as the monohydrate is equivalent to one
mg of cisapride.  <p>
 
<a name="ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY"></a><b>ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 
</b> <p>
PHARMACOKINETICS 
 <p>
Cisapride is rapidly absorbed after oral administration; peak plasma
concentrations are reached 1 to 1.5 hr after dosing. The absolute
bioavailability of Cisapride is 35-40%. When gastric acidity was reduced by
high dose histamine H2 receptor blocker and sodium bicarbonate in fasting
subjects, there was a decrease in the rate, and to a lesser degree the extent,
of Cisapride absorption. Cisapride binds to an extent of 97.5-98% to
plasma proteins, mainly to albumin. The volume of distribution of Cisapride
is about 180 L, indicating extensive tissue distribution.  
 <p>
The plasma clearance of Cisapride is about 100 mL/min. The mean terminal
half-life reported for Cisapride ranges from 6 to 12 hr; longer half-lives,
up to 20 hr, have been reported following intravenous (IV) administration. 
Cisapride is extensively metabolized; unchanged drug accounts for less than
10% of urinary and fecal recovery following oral administration. Norcisapride,
formed by N-dealkylation, is the principal metabolite in plasma, feces and
urine.  <p>
 
There was no unusual drug accumulation due to time-dependent or non-linear
changes in PK. After cessation of the repeated dosing, the elimination half-
lives (8 to 10 hr) were in the same order as after single dosing. There is some 
evidence that the degree of accumulation of Cisapride and/or its metabolites 
may be somewhat higher in patients with hepatic or renal impairment and in
elderly patients compared to young healthy volunteers, but the differences are
not consistent and do not require dosage adjustment.  
 <p>
PHARMACODYNAMICS 
                           <p>
The onset of pharmacological action of cisapride is approximately 30 to 60
minutes after oral administration.  <p>
 
The mechanism of action of cisapride is thought to be primarily enhancement of
release of acetylcholine at the myenteric plexus. Cisapride does not induce
muscarinic or nicotinic receptor stimulation, nor does it inhibit
acetylcholinesterase activity. It is less potent than metoclopramide in
dopamine receptor-blocking effects in rats. It does not increase or decrease
basal or pentagastrin-induced gastric acid secretion.  
 <p>
In Vitro studies have shown that cisapride is a serotonin-4 (5-HT4) receptor
agonist. This agonistic action may result in increased gastrointestinal
motility and cardiac rate.  <p>
 
ESOPHAGUS: Single doses of cisapride (4 to 10 mg IV) increased the lower
esophageal sphincter pressure (LESP) and lower esophageal peristalsis compared
to placebo and/or metoclopramide. In patients with gastroesophageal reflux
disease (GERD) and a LESP of &lt;10 mm Hg, cisapride dose-dependently increased
the strength of esophageal peristalsis and more than doubled LESP, raising it
to normal values. The increase in LESP was partially reversed by atropine,
suggesting that the effect is partly, but not exclusively, cholinergically-
mediated. Twenty mg oral cisapride given once to healthy volunteers similarly
increased LESP, starting 45 minutes after dosing, with a peak response at 75
minutes. The full duration of the effect was not monitored, and doses smaller
than 20 mg were ineffective. Ten mg oral cisapride, administered 3 times daily
for several days to patients with GERD, resulted in a significant increase in
LESP, and an increased esophageal acid clearance.  
 <p>
STOMACH: Cisapride (single 10 mg doses IV or oral or 10 mg given orally 3 times 
daily up to six weeks) significantly accelerated gastric emptying of both
liquids and solids. Acceleration of gastric emptying, measured over a four hour 
period following a radio-labeled test meal given at lunch time, was greatest
when 10 mg cisapride was given both in the morning and again before the test
meal, intermediate when 20 mg was given as a single administration in the
morning and least when only 10 mg was given on the morning of the test meal.
The increases in gastric emptying were proportional to the plasma levels of
cisapride measured in these subjects over the same 4 hours that the gastric
emptying test was conducted.  
 <p>
CLINICAL TRIALS 
 <p>
Clinical trials have shown that cisapride can reduce the symptoms of nocturnal
heartburn associated with gastroesophageal reflux disease. Two placebo-
controlled studies, one using a dose of 10 mg QID, the other both 10 and 20 mg
QID, showed effects on nighttime heartburn, although the 10 mg dose in the
second study was only marginally effective. There were no consistent effects on 
daytime heartburn, symptoms of regurgitation, or histopathology of the
esophagus. Use of antacids was only infrequently affected and slightly
decreased. In a third controlled trial of similar design to the others, neither 
10 nor 20 mg taken 4 times was superior to placebo.  
                           <p>
These clinical trials did not show a significant effect on LESP, perhaps
because the majority of these patients had normal LESP's at the beginning and
end of the study period. In a clinical trial comparing 10 mg cisapride to
placebo, pH probe evaluation, in a relatively small number of patients, did not 
reveal a significant difference in pH.  
 <p>
<a name="INDICATIONS AND USAGE"></a><b>INDICATIONS AND USAGE 
</b> <p>
Cisapride  is indicated for the symptomatic treatment of patients 
with nocturnal heartburn due to gastroesophageal reflux disease.  
 <p>
<a name="CONTRAINDICATIONS"></a><b>CONTRAINDICATIONS 
</b> <p>
Cisapride  should not be used in patients in whom an increase in
gastrointestinal motility could be harmful, e.g., in the presence of
gastrointestinal hemorrhage, mechanical obstruction, or perforation. 
Cisapride is contraindicated in patients with known sensitivity or
intolerance to the drug.  <p>
 
<a name="PRECAUTIONS"></a><b>PRECAUTIONS 
</b> <p>
INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS: Although Cisapride  does not affect
psychomotor function nor does it induce sedation or drowsiness when used alone, 
patients should be advised that the sedative effects of benzodiazepines and of
alcohol may be accelerated by Cisapride.  <p>
 
DRUG INTERACTIONS: Concurrent administration of anticholinergic compounds would 
be expected to compromise the beneficial effects of Cisapride.  <p>
 
The acceleration of gastric emptying by Cisapride could affect the rate of
absorption of other drugs. Patients receiving narrow therapeutic ratio drugs or 
other drugs that require careful titration should be followed closely; if
plasma levels are being monitored, they should be reassessed.  
 <p>
In patients receiving oral anticoagulants, the coagulation times were increased 
in some cases. It is advisable to check coagulation time within the first few
days after the start and discontinuation of Cisapride therapy, with an
appropriate adjustment of the anticoagulant dose, if necessary.  
 <p>
Cimetidine coadministration leads to an increased peak plasma concentration and 
AUC of Cisapride; there is no effect on Cisapride absorption when it is
coadministered with ranitidine. The gastrointestinal absorption of cimetidine
and ranitidine is accelerated when they are coadministered with Cisapride. 
 <p>
CARCINOGENESIS, MUTAGENESIS, IMPAIRMENT OF FERTILITY:  In a twenty-five month
oral carcinogenicity study in rats, cisapride at daily doses up to 80 mg/kg was 
not tumorigenic. For a 50 kg person of average height (1.46 M(square) body
surface area), this dose represents 50 times the maximum recommended human dose 
(1.6 mg/kg/day) on a mg/kg basis and 7 times the maximum recommended human dose 
(54.4 mg/M(square)) on a body surface area basis. In a nineteen month oral
carcinogenicity study in mice, cisapride at daily doses up to 80 mg/kg was not
tumorigenic. This dose represents 50 times the maximum recommended human dose
on a mg/kg basis and about 4 times the maximum recommended human dose on a body 
surface area basis.  
 <p>
Cisapride was not mutagenic in the In Vitro Ames test, human lymphocyte
chromosomal aberration test, mouse lymphoma cell forward mutation test, and rat 
hepatocyte UDS test and In Vivo rat micronucleus test, male and female mouse
dominant lethal mutations tests, and sex linked recessive lethal test in male
Drosophila Melanogaster.  
 <p>
Fertility and reproductive performance studies were conducted in male and
female rats. Cisapride was found to have no effect on fertility and
reproductive performance of male rats at oral doses up to 160 mg/kg/day (100
times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/kg basis and 14 times the
maximum recommended human dose on a mg/M(square) basis). In the female rats,
cisapride at oral doses of 40 mg/kg/day and higher prolonged the breeding
interval required for impregnation. Similar effects were also observed at
maturity in the female offspring (F1) of the female rats (F0) treated with oral 
doses of cisapride at 10 mg/kg/day or higher. Cisapride at an oral dose of 160
mg/kg/day also exerted contragestational/pregnancy disrupting effects in female 
rats (F0).  <p>
 
PREGNANCY: TERATOGENIC EFFECTS: PREGNANCY CATEGORY C: Oral teratology studies
have been conducted in rats (doses up to 160 mg/kg/day) and rabbits (doses up
to 40 mg/kg/day). There was no evidence of a teratogenic potential of cisapride 
in rats or rabbits. Cisapride was embryotoxic and fetotoxic in rats at a dose
of 160 mg/kg/day (100 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/kg basis 
and 14 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/M(square) basis) and in 
rabbits at a dose of 20 mg/kg/day (approximately 12 times the maximum
recommended human dose on a mg/kg basis) or higher. It also produced reduced
birth weights of pups in rats at 40 and 160 mg/kg/day and adversely affected
the pup survival. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant 
women. Cisapride should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit
justifies the potential risk to the fetus.  <p>
 
NURSING MOTHERS:  Cisapride is excreted in human milk at concentrations
approximately one twentieth of those observed in plasma. Caution should be
exercised when Cisaprideis administered to a nursing woman.  
 <p>
PEDIATRIC USE:  Safety and effectiveness in children have not been established. 
 <p>
GERIATRIC USE:  Steady-state plasma levels are generally higher in older than
in younger patients, due to a moderate prolongation of the elimination half
life.  Therapeutic doses, however, are similar to those used in younger adults. 
 <p>
The rate of adverse experiences in patients greater than 65 years of age was
similar to that in younger adults.  
 <p>
<a name="DRUG INTERACTIONS"></a><b>DRUG INTERACTIONS 
</b> <p>
Concurrent administration of anticholinergic compounds would be expected to
compromise the beneficial effects of Cisapride.  
 <p>
The acceleration of gastric emptying by Cisapride could affect the rate of
absorption of other drugs. Patients receiving narrow therapeutic ratio drugs or 
other drugs that require careful titration should be followed closely; if
plasma levels are being monitored, they should be reassessed.  
 <p>
In patients receiving oral anticoagulants, the coagulation times were increased 
in some cases. It is advisable to check coagulation time within the first few
days after the start and discontinuation of Cisapride therapy, with an
appropriate adjustment of the anticoagulant dose, if necessary.  <p>
 
Cimetidine coadministration leads to an increased peak plasma concentration and 
AUC of Cisapride; there is no effect on Cisapride absorption when it is
coadministered with ranitidine. The gastrointestinal absorption of cimetidine
and ranitidine is accelerated when they are coadministered with Cisapride.

</pre><p>
The following adverse events also reported in more than 1% of Cisapride
patients were more frequently reported on placebo: dizziness, vomiting,
pharyngitis, chest pain, fatigue, back pain, depression, dehydration, and
myalgia.  
 <p>
Diarrhea, abdominal pain, constipation, flatulence, and rhinitis all occurred
more frequently in patients using 20 mg of Cisapride than in patients using
10 mg.  
 <p>
Additional adverse experiences reported to occur in 1% or less of patients in
the U.S. clinical studies are: dry mouth, somnolence, palpitation, migraine,
tremor, and edema.  
 <p>
In other U.S. and international trials and in foreign marketing experience,
there have been rare reports of seizures and extrapyramidal effects,
tachycardia, elevated liver enzymes, hepatitis, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia,
aplastic anemia, pancytopenia, and granulocytopenia. The relationship of
Cisapride to the event was not clear in these cases.  
 <p>
There have been rare cases of sinus tachycardia reported. Rechallenge
precipitated relapse in some of those patients.  
 <p>
<a name="OVERDOSAGE"></a><b>OVERDOSAGE 
</b> <p>
Reports of overdosage with Cisapride include an adult who took
540 mg and for 2 hours experienced retching, borborygmi, flatulence, stool
frequency and urinary frequency. Treatment should include gastric lavage and/or 
activated charcoal, close observation and general supportive measures.  
 <p>
Single oral doses of cisapride at 4000 mg/kg, 160 mg/kg, 1280 mg/kg and 640
mg/kg were lethal in adult rats, neonatal rats, mice and dogs, respectively. 
Symptoms of acute toxicity were ptosis, tremors, convulsions, dyspnea, loss of
righting reflex, catalepsy, catatonia, hypotonia and diarrhea.  
 <p>
<a name="DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION"></a><b>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION 
</b> <p>
ADULTS:  Initiate therapy with 10 mg of Cisapride  4 times daily
at least 15 minutes before meals and at bedtime. In some patients the dosage
will need to be increased to 20 mg, given as above, to obtain a satisfactory
result.  
 <p>
In elderly patients, steady-state plasma levels are generally higher due to a
moderate prolongation of the elimination half-life. Therapeutic doses, however, 
are similar to those used in younger adults.

<p><a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><b>DESCRIPTION </b></p>

<p>Cimetidine is a histamine H2-receptor antagonist. Chemically it is N''-cyano-N-methyl-N'-(2-(((5-methyl-1
H-imidazol-4-yl)methyl)thio)- ethyl) guanidine. The empirical formula for
cimetidine is C10H16N6S and for cimetidine hydrochloride, C10H16N6SHCl;
these represent molecular weights of 252.34 and 288.80, respectively. Cimetidine
contains an imidazole ring, and is chemically related to histamine. Cimetidine
has a bitter taste and characteristic odor. </p>

<p>SOLUBILITY CHARACTERISTICS: Cimetidine is soluble in alcohol, slightly
soluble in water, very slightly soluble in chloroform and insoluble in
ether. Cimetidine hydrochloride is freely soluble in water, soluble in
alcohol, very slightly soluble in chloroform and practically insoluble
in ether. </p>

<p><a name="ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY"></a><b>ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
</b></p>

<p>Cimetidine competitively inhibits the action of histamine at the histamine
H2 receptors of the parietal cells and thus is a histamine H2 receptor
antagonist. </p>

<p>Cimetidine is not an anticholinergic agent. Studies have shown that
Cimetidine inhibits both daytime and nocturnal basal gastric acid secretion.
Cimetidine also inhibits gastric acid secretion stimulated by food, histamine,
pentagastrin, caffeine and insulin. </p>

<p>ANTISECRETORY ACTIVITY </p>

<p>1) ACID SECRETION: Nocturnal: Cimetidine 800 mg orally at bedtime reduces
mean hourly H+ activity by greater than 85% over an 8-hour period in duodenal
ulcer patients, with no effect on daytime acid secretion. Cimetidine 1600
mg orally h.s. produces 100% inhibition of mean hourly H+ activity over
an 8-hour period in duodenal ulcer patients, but also reduces H+ activity
by 35% for an additional 5 hours into the following morning. Cimetidine
400 mg b.i.d. and 300 mg q.i.d. decrease nocturnal acid secretion in a
dose-related manner, i.e., 47% to 83% over a 6- to 8-hour period and 54%
over a 9-hour period, respectively. </p>

<p>Food Stimulated: During the first hour after a standard experimental
meal, oral Cimetidine 300 mg inhibited gastric acid secretion in duodenal
ulcer patients by at least 50%. During the subsequent 2 hours Cimetidine
inhibited gastric acid secretion by at least 75%. </p>

<p>The effect of a 300 mg breakfast dose of Cimetidine continued for at
least 4 hours and there was partial suppression of the rise in gastric
acid secretion following the luncheon meal in duodenal ulcer patients.
This suppression of gastric acid output was enhanced and could be maintained
by another 300 mg dose of Cimetidine given with lunch. </p>

<p>In another study, Cimetidine 300 mg given with the meal increased gastric
pH as compared with placebo. </p>

                                        Cimetidine             PLACEBO

<p>24-Hour Mean H+ Activity: Cimetidine 800 mg h.s., 400 mg b.i.d. and
300 mg q.i.d. all provide a similar, moderate (less than 60%) level of
24-hour acid suppression. However, the 800 mg h.s. regimen exerts its entire
effect on nocturnal acid, and does not affect daytime gastric physiology.
</p>

<p>Chemically Stimulated: Oral Cimetidine significantly inhibited gastric
acid secretion stimulated by betazole (an isomer of histamine), pentagastrin,
caffeine and insulin as follows: </p>

<pre>------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
                       STIMULANT

                        hr (iv)               (po)              hour            
Insulin               0.03 units/           100mg/hr          82% at 1          
                       kg/hr (iv)             (iv)              hour            
------------------------------------------------------------------------------  </pre>

<p>When food and betazole were used to stimulate secretion, inhibition
of hydrogen ion concentration usually ranged from 45% to 75% and the inhibition
of volume ranged from 30% to 65%. </p>

<p>Parenteral administration also significantly inhibits gastric acid secretion.
In a crossover study involving patients with active or healed duodenal
or gastric ulcers, either continuous I.V. infusion of Cimetidine 37.5 mg/hour
(900 mg/day) or intermittent injection of Cimetidine 300 mg q6h (1200 mg/day)
maintained gastric pH above 4.0 for more than 50% of the time under steady
state conditions. </p>

<p>2) PEPSIN: Oral Cimetidine 300 mg reduced total pepsin output as a result
of the decrease in volume of gastric juice. </p>

<p>3) INTRINSIC FACTOR: Intrinsic factor secretion was studied with betazole
as a stimulant. Oral Cimetidine 300 mg inhibited the rise in intrinsic
factor concentration produced by betazole, but some intrinsic factor was
secreted at all times. </p>

<p>OTHER </p>

<p>LOWER ESOPHAGEAL SPHINCTER PRESSURE AND GASTRIC EMPTYING </p>

<p>Cimetidine has no effect on lower esophageal sphincter (LES) pressure
or the rate of gastric emptying. </p>

<p>PHARMACOKINETICS </p>

<p>Cimetidine is rapidly absorbed after oral administration and peak levels
occur in 45 to 90 minutes. The half-life of Cimetidine is approximately
2 hours. Both oral and parenteral (I.V. or I.M.) administration provide
comparable periods of therapeutically effective blood levels; blood concentrations
remain above that required to provide 80% inhibition of basal gastric acid
secretion for 4 to 5 hours following a dose of 300 mg. </p>

<p>Steady-state blood concentrations of cimetidine with continuous infusion
of Cimetidine are determined by the infusion rate and clearance of the
drug in the individual patient. In a study of peptic ulcer patients with
normal renal function, an infusion rate of 37.5 mg/hour produced average
steady-state plasma cimetidine concentrations of about 0.9 mcg/mL. Blood
levels with other infusion rates will vary in direct proportion to the
infusion rate. </p>

<p>The principal route of excretion of Cimetidine is the urine. Following
parenteral administration, most of the drug is excreted as the parent compound;
following oral administration, the drug is more extensively metabolized,
the sulfoxide being the major metabolite. Following a single oral dose,
48% of the drug is recovered from the urine after 24 hours as the parent
compound. Following I.V. or I.M. administration, approximately 75% of the
drug is recovered from the urine after 24 hours as the parent compound.
</p>

<p><a name="INDICATIONS AND USAGE"></a><b>INDICATIONS AND USAGE </b></p>

<p>Cimetidine is indicated in: </p>

<p>(1) SHORT-TERM TREATMENT OF ACTIVE DUODENAL ULCER. Most patients heal
within 4 weeks and there is rarely reason to use Cimetidine at full dosage
for longer than 6 to 8 weeks (see Dosage and Administration--Duodenal Ulcer).
Concomitant antacids should be given as needed for relief of pain. However,
simultaneous administration of Cimetidine and antacids is not recommended,
since antacids have been reported to interfere with the absorption of Cimetidine.
</p>

<p>(2) MAINTENANCE THERAPY FOR DUODENAL ULCER PATIENTS AT REDUCED DOSAGE
AFTER HEALING OF ACTIVE ULCER. Patients have been maintained on continued
treatment with Cimetidine 400 mg h.s. for periods of up to 5 years. </p>

<p>(3) SHORT-TERM TREATMENT OF ACTIVE BENIGN GASTRIC ULCER. There is no
information concerning usefulness of treatment periods of longer than 8
weeks. </p>

<p>(4) EROSIVE GASTROESOPHAGEAL REFLUX DISEASE (GERD). Erosive esophagitis
diagnosed by endoscopy. Treatment is indicated for 12 weeks for healing
of lesions and control of symptoms. The use of Cimetidine beyond 12 weeks
has not been established (see Dosage and Administration--GERD). </p>

<p>(5) PREVENTION OF UPPER GASTROINTESTINAL BLEEDING IN CRITICALLY ILL
PATIENTS. </p>

<p>(6) THE TREATMENT OF PATHOLOGICAL HYPERSECRETORY CONDITIONS (i.e., Zollinger-
Ellison Syndrome, systemic mastocytosis, multiple endocrine adenomas).
</p>

<p><a name="CONTRAINDICATIONS"></a><b>CONTRAINDICATIONS </b></p>

<p>Cimetidine is contraindicated for patients known to have hypersensitivity
to the product. </p>

<p><a name="PRECAUTIONS"></a><b>PRECAUTIONS </b></p>

<p>GENERAL: Rare instances of cardiac arrhythmias and hypotension have
been reported following the rapid administration of Cimetidine (cimetidine
hydrochloride) Injection by intravenous bolus. </p>

<p>Symptomatic response to Cimetidine therapy does not preclude the presence
of a gastric malignancy. There have been rare reports of transient healing
of gastric ulcers despite subsequently documented malignancy. </p>

<p>Reversible confusional states (see Adverse Reactions) have been observed
on occasion, predominantly, but not exclusively, in severely ill patients.
Advancing age (50 or more years) and preexisting liver and/or renal disease
appear to be contributing factors. In some patients these confusional states
have been mild and have not required discontinuation of Cimetidine therapy.
In cases where discontinuation was judged necessary, the condition usually
cleared within 3 to 4 days of drug withdrawal. </p>

<p>DRUG INTERACTIONS: Cimetidine, apparently through an effect on certain
microsomal enzyme systems, has been reported to reduce the hepatic metabolism
of warfarin type anticoagulants, phenytoin, propranolol, nifedipine, chlordiazepoxide,
diazepam, certain tricyclic antidepressants, lidocaine, theophylline and
metronidazole, thereby delaying elimination and increasing blood levels
of these drugs. </p>

<p>Clinically significant effects have been reported with the warfarin
anticoagulants; therefore, close monitoring of prothrombin time is recommended,
and adjustment of the anticoagulant dose may be necessary when Cimetidine
is administered concomitantly. Interaction with phenytoin, lidocaine and
theophylline has also been reported to produce adverse clinical effects.
</p>

<p>However, a crossover study in healthy subjects receiving either Cimetidine
300 mg q.i.d. or 800 mg h.s. concomitantly with a 300 mg b.i.d. dosage
of theophylline (Theo-Dur, Key Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) demonstrated less
alteration in steady state theophylline peak serum levels with the 800
mg h.s. regimen, particularly in subjects aged 54 years and older. Data
beyond 10 days are not available. (Note: All patients receiving theophylline
should be monitored appropriately, regardless of concomitant drug therapy.)
</p>

<p>Dosage of the drugs mentioned above and other similarly metabolized
drugs, particularly those of low therapeutic ratio or in patients with
renal and/or hepatic impairment, may require adjustment when starting or
stopping concomitantly administered Cimetidine to maintain optimum therapeutic
blood levels. </p>

<p>Additional clinical experience may reveal other drugs affected by the
concomitant administration of Cimetidine. </p>

<p>CARCINOGENESIS, MUTAGENESIS, IMPAIRMENT OF FERTILITY: In a 24-month
toxicity study conducted in rats, at dose levels of 150, 378 and 950 mg/kg/day
(approximately 8 to 48 times the recommended human dose), there was a small
increase in the incidence of benign Leydig cell tumors in each dose group;
when the combined drug-treated groups and control groups were compared,
this increase reached statistical significance. In a subsequent 24-month
study, there were no differences between the rats receiving 150 mg/kg/day
and the untreated controls. However, a statistically significant increase
in benign Leydig cell tumor incidence was seen in the rats that received
378 and 950 mg/kg/day. These tumors were common in control groups as well
as treated groups and the difference became apparent only in aged rats.
</p>

<p>Cimetidine has demonstrated a weak antiandrogenic effect. In animal
studies this was manifested as reduced prostate and seminal vesicle weights.
However, there was no impairment of mating performance or fertility, nor
any harm to the fetus in these animals at doses 8 to 48 times the full
therapeutic dose of Cimetidine, as compared with controls. The cases of
gynecomastia seen in patients treated for 1 month or longer may be related
to this effect. </p>

<p>In human studies, Cimetidine has been shown to have no effect on spermatogenesis,
sperm count, motility, morphology or In Vitro fertilizing capacity. </p>

<p>PREGNANCY: TERATOGENIC EFFECTS. PREGNANCY CATEGORY B: Reproduction studies
have been performed in rats, rabbits and mice at doses up to 40 times the
normal human dose and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or
harm to the fetus due to Cimetidine. There are, however, no adequate and
well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproductive
studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be
used during pregnancy only if NURSING MOTHERS: Cimetidine is secreted in
human milk and, as a general rule, nursing should not be undertaken while
a patient is on a drug. </p>

<p>PEDIATRIC USE: Clinical experience in children is limited. Therefore,
Cimetidine therapy cannot be recommended for children under 16, unless,
in the judgment of the physician, anticipated benefits outweigh the potential
risks. In very limited experience, doses of 20 to 40 mg/kg per day have
been used. </p>

<p><a name="DRUG INTERACTIONS"></a><b>DRUG INTERACTIONS </b></p>

<p>Cimetidine, apparently through an effect on certain microsomal enzyme
systems, has been reported to reduce the hepatic metabolism of warfarin-type
anticoagulants, phenytoin, propranolol, nifedipine, chlordiazepoxide, diazepam,
certain tricyclic antidepressants, lidocaine, theophylline and metronidazole,
thereby delaying elimination and increasing blood levels of these drugs.
</p>

<p>Clinically significant effects have been reported with the warfarin
anticoagulants; therefore, close monitoring of prothrombin time is recommended,
and adjustment of the anticoagulant dose may be necessary when Cimetidine
is administered concomitantly. Interaction with phenytoin, lidocaine and
theophylline has also been reported to produce adverse clinical effects.
</p>

<p>However, a crossover study in healthy subjects receiving either Cimetidine
300 mg q.i.d. or 800 mg h.s. concomitantly with a 300 mg b.i.d. dosage
of theophylline (Theo-Dur, Key Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) demonstrated less
alteration in steady state theophylline peak serum levels with the 800
mg h.s. regimen, particularly in subjects aged 54 years and older. Data
beyond 10 days are not available. (Note: All patients receiving theophylline
should be monitored appropriately, regardless of concomitant drug therapy.)
</p>

<p>Dosage of the drugs mentioned above and other similarly metabolized
drugs, particularly those of low therapeutic ratio or in patients with
renal and/or hepatic impairment, may require adjustment when starting or

<p>(See Also PRECAUTIONS) </p>

<p><a name="ADVERSE REACTIONS"></a><b>ADVERSE REACTIONS </b></p>

<p>Adverse effects reported in patients taking Cimetidine are described
below by body system. Incidence figures of 1 in 100 and greater are generally
derived from controlled clinical studies. </p>

<p>GASTROINTESTINAL: Diarrhea (usually mild) has been reported in approximately
1 in 100 patients. </p>

<p>CNS: Headaches, ranging from mild to severe, have been reported in 3.5%
of 924 patients taking 1600 mg/day, 2.1% of 2,225 patients taking 800 mg/day
and 2.3% of 1,897 patients taking placebo. Dizziness and somnolence (usually
mild) have been reported in approximately 1 in 100 patients on either 1600
mg/day or 800 mg/day. </p>

<p>Reversible confusional states, e.g., mental confusion, agitation, psychosis,
depression, anxiety, hallucinations, disorientation, have been reported
predominantly, but not exclusively, in severely ill patients. They have
usually developed within 2 to 3 days of initiation of Cimetidine therapy
and have cleared within 3 to 4 days of discontinuation of the drug. </p>

<p>ENDOCRINE: Gynecomastia has been reported in patients treated for 1
month or longer. In patients being treated for pathological hypersecretory
states, this occurred in about 4% of cases while in all others the incidence
was 0.3% to 1% in various studies. No evidence of induced endocrine dysfunction
was found, and the condition remained unchanged or returned toward normal
with continuing Cimetidine treatment. </p>

<p>Reversible impotence has been reported in patients with pathological
hypersecretory disorders, e.g., Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome, receiving Cimetidine,
particularly in high doses, for at least 12 months (range 12 to 79 months,
mean 38 months). However, in large-scale surveillance studies at regular
dosage, the incidence has not exceeded that commonly reported in the general
population. </p>

<p>HEMATOLOGIC: Decreased white blood cell counts in Cimetidine-treated
patients (approximately 1 per 100,000 patients), including agranulocytosis
(approximately 3 per million patients), have been reported, including a
few reports of recurrence on rechallenge. Most of these reports were in
patients who had serious concomitant illnesses and received drugs and/or
treatment known to produce neutropenia. Thrombocytopenia (approximately
3 per million patients) and, very rarely, cases of pancytopenia or aplastic
anemia have also been reported. As with some other H2-receptor antagonists,
there have been extremely rare reports of immune hemolytic anemia. </p>

<p>HEPATOBILIARY: Dose-related increases in serum transaminase have been
reported. In most cases they did not progress with continued therapy and
returned to normal at the end of therapy. There have been rare reports
of cholestatic or mixed cholestatic-hepatocellular effects. These were
usually reversible. Because of the predominance of cholestatic features,
severe parenchymal injury is considered highly unlikely. However, as in
the occasional liver injury with other H2-receptor antagonists, in exceedingly
rare circumstances fatal outcomes have been reported. </p>

<p>There has been reported a single case of biopsy-proven periportal hepatic
fibrosis in a patient receiving Cimetidine. </p>

<p>Rare cases of pancreatitis, which cleared on withdrawal of the drug,
have been reported. </p>

<p>HYPERSENSITIVITY: Rare cases of fever and allergic reactions including
anaphylaxis and hypersensitivity vasculitis, which cleared on withdrawal
of the drug, have been reported. </p>

<p>RENAL: Small, possibly dose-related increases in plasma creatinine,
presumably due to competition for renal tubular secretion, are not uncommon
and do not signify deteriorating renal function. Rare cases of interstitial
nephritis and urinary retention, which cleared on withdrawal of the drug,
have been reported. </p>

<p>CARDIOVASCULAR: Rare cases of bradycardia, tachycardia and A-V heart
block have been reported with H2-receptor antagonists. </p>

<p>MUSCULOSKELETAL: There have been rare reports of reversible arthralgia
and myalgia; exacerbation of joint symptoms in patients with preexisting
arthritis has also been reported. Such symptoms have usually been alleviated
by a reduction in Cimetidine dosage. Rare cases of polymyositis have been
reported, but no causal relationship has been established. </p>

<p>INTEGUMENTAL: Mild rash and, very rarely, cases of severe generalized
skin reactions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, epidermal necrolysis,
erythema multiforme, exfoliative dermatitis and generalized exfoliative
erythroderma have been reported with H2-receptor antagonists. Reversible
alopecia has been reported very rarely. </p>

<p><a name="OVERDOSAGE"></a><b>OVERDOSAGE </b></p>

<p>Studies in animals indicate that toxic doses are associated with respiratory
failure and tachycardia that may be controlled by assisted respiration
and the administration of a beta-blocker. </p>

<p>Reported acute ingestions orally of up to 20 grams have been associated
with transient adverse effects similar to those encountered in normal clinical
experience. The usual measures to remove unabsorbed material from the gastrointestinal
tract, clinical monitoring, and supportive therapy should be employed.
</p>

<p>There have been reports of severe CNS symptoms, including unresponsiveness,
following ingestion of between 20 and 40 grams of cimetidine, and extremely
rare reports following concomitant use of multiple CNS-active medications
and ingestion of cimetidine at doses less than 20 grams. An elderly, terminally
ill dehydrated patient with organic brain syndrome receiving concomitant
antipsychotic agents and Cimetidine 4800 mg intravenously over a 24-hour
period experienced mental deterioration with reversal on Cimetidine discontinuation.
</p>

<p>There have been two deaths in adults who were reported to have ingested
over 40 grams orally on a single occasion. </p>

<p><a name="DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION"></a><b>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
</b></p>

<p>DUODENAL ULCER </p>

<p>ACTIVE DUODENAL ULCER: Clinical studies have indicated that suppression
of nocturnal acid is the most important factor in duodenal ulcer healing
(see Clinical Pharmacology--Acid Secretion). This is supported by recent
clinical trials (see Clinical Trials--Active Duodenal Ulcer). Therefore,
there is no apparent rationale, except for familiarity with use, for treating
with anything other than a once-daily at bedtime dosage regimen (h.s.).
</p>

<p>In a U.S. dose-ranging study of 400 mg h.s., 800 mg h.s. and 1600 mg
h.s., a continuous dose response relationship for ulcer healing was demonstrated.
</p>

<p>However, 800 mg h.s. is the dose of choice for most patients, as it
provides a high healing rate (the difference between 800 mg h.s. and 1600
mg h.s. being small), maximal pain relief, a decreased potential for drug
interactions (see Precautions--Drug Interactions) and maximal patient convenience.
Patients unhealed at 4 weeks, or those with persistent symptoms, have been
shown to benefit from 2 to 4 weeks of continued therapy. </p>

<p>It has been shown that patients who both have an endoscopically demonstrated
ulcer larger than 1.0 cm and are also heavy smokers (i.e., smoke one pack
of cigarettes or more per day) are more difficult to heal. There is some
evidence which suggests that more rapid healing can be achieved in this
subpopulation with Cimetidine 1600 mg at bedtime. While early pain relief
with either 800 mg h.s. or 1600 mg h.s. is equivalent in all patients,
1600 mg h.s. provides an appropriate alternative when it is important to
ensure healing within 4 weeks for this subpopulation. Alternatively, approximately
94% of all patients will also heal in 8 weeks with Cimetidine 800 mg h.s.
</p>

<p>Other Cimetidine regimens in the U.S. which have been shown to be effective
are: 300 mg four times daily, with meals and at bedtime, the original regimen
with which U.S. physicians have the most experience, and 400 mg twice daily,
in the morning and at bedtime (see Clinical Trials--Active Duodenal Ulcer).
</p>

<p>Concomitant antacids should be given as needed for relief of pain. However,
simultaneous administration of Cimetidine and antacids is not recommended,
since antacids have been reported to interfere with the absorption of Cimetidine
. </p>

<p>While healing with Cimetidine often occurs during the first week or
two, treatment should be continued for 4 to 6 weeks unless healing has
been demonstrated by endoscopic examination. </p>

<p>MAINTENANCE THERAPY FOR DUODENAL ULCER: In those patients requiring
maintenance therapy, the recommended adult oral dose is 400 mg at bedtime.
</p>

<p>ACTIVE BENIGN GASTRIC ULCER </p>

<p>The recommended adult oral dosage for short-term treatment of active
benign gastric ulcer is 800 mg h.s., or 300 mg four times a day with meals
and at bedtime. Controlled clinical studies were limited to 6 weeks of
treatment (see Clinical Trials). 800 mg h.s. is the preferred regimen for
most patients based upon convenience and reduced potential for drug interactions.
Symptomatic response to Cimetidine does not preclude the presence of a
gastric malignancy. It is important to follow gastric ulcer patients to
assure rapid progress to complete healing. </p>

<p>EROSIVE GASTROESOPHAGEAL REFLUX DISEASE (GERD) </p>

<p>The recommended adult oral dosage for the treatment of erosive esophagitis
that has been diagnosed by endoscopy is 1600 mg daily in divided doses
(800 mg b.i.d. or 400 mg q.i.d.) for 12 weeks. The use of Cimetidine beyond
12 weeks has not been established. </p>

<p>PREVENTION OF UPPER GASTROINTESTINAL BLEEDING </p>

<p>The recommended adult dosing regimen is continuous I.V. infusion of
50 mg/hour. Patients with creatinine clearance less than 30 cc/min. should
receive half the recommended dose. Treatment beyond 7 days has not been
studied. </p>

<p>PATHOLOGICAL HYPERSECRETORY CONDITIONS (such as Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome)
</p>

<p>Recommended adult oral dosage: 300 mg four times a day with meals and
at bedtime. In some patients it may be necessary to administer higher doses
more frequently. Doses should be adjusted to individual patient needs,
but should not usually exceed 2400 mg per day and should continue as long
as clinically indicated. </p>

<p>PARENTERAL ADMINISTRATION </p>

<p>In hospitalized patients with pathological hypersecretory conditions
or intractable ulcers, or in patients who are unable to take oral medication,
Cimetidine may be administered parenterally. </p>

<p>The doses and regimen for parenteral administration in patients with
GERD have not been established. </p>

<p>All parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate
matter and discoloration prior to administration. </p>

<p>RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PARENTERAL ADMINISTRATION: </p>

<p>INTRAMUSCULAR INJECTION: 300 mg q 6 to 8 hours (no dilution necessary).
Transient pain at the site of injection has been reported. </p>

<p>INTRAVENOUS INJECTION: 300 mg q 6 to 8 hours. In some patients it may
be necessary to increase dosage. When this is necessary, the increases
should be made by more frequent administration of a 300 mg dose, but should
not exceed 2400 mg per day. Dilute Cimetidine (cimetidine hydrochloride)
Injection, 300 mg, in Sodium Chloride Injection (0.9%) or another compatible
I.V. solution (see Stability of Cimetidine Injection) to a total volume
of 20 mL and inject over a period of not less than 5 minutes (see Precautions).
</p>

<p>INTERMITTENT INTRAVENOUS INFUSION: 300 mg q 6 to 8 hours, infused over
15 to 20 minutes. In some patients it may be necessary to increase dosage.
When this is necessary, the increases should be made by more frequent administration
of a 300 mg dose, but should not exceed 2400 mg per day. VIALS: Dilute
Cimetidine Injection, 300 mg, in at least 50 mL of 5% Dextrose Injection,
or another compatible I.V. solution (see Stability of Cimetidine Injection).
PLASTIC CONTAINERS: Use premixed Cimetidine Injection, 300 mg, in 0.9%
Sodium Chloride in 50 mL plastic containers. ADD-VANTAGE VIALS: Dilute
contents of one vial in an ADD-Vantage Diluent Container, available in
50 mL and 100 mL sizes of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, and 5% Dextrose
Injection. </p>

<p>CONTINUOUS INTRAVENOUS INFUSION: 37.5 mg/hour (900 mg/day). For patients
requiring a more rapid elevation of gastric pH, continuous infusion may
be preceded by a 150 mg loading dose administered by I.V. infusion as described
above. Dilute 900 mg Cimetidine Injection in a compatible I.V. fluid (see
Stability of Cimetidine Injection) for constant rate infusion over a 24-hour
period. Note: Cimetidine may be diluted in 100 to 1000 mL; however, a volumetric
pump is recommended if the volume for 24-hour infusion is less than 250
mL. In one study in patients with pathological hypersecretory states, the
mean infused dose of cimetidine was 160 mg/hour with a range of 40 to 600
mg/hour. </p>

<p>These doses maintained the intragastric acid secretory rate at 10 mEq/hour
or less. The infusion rate should be adjusted to individual patient requirements.
</p>

<p>DOSAGE ADJUSTMENT FOR PATIENTS WITH IMPAIRED RENAL FUNCTION </p>

<p>Patients with severely impaired renal function have been treated with
Cimetidine. However, such usage has been very limited. On the basis of
this experience the recommended dosage is 300 mg q 12 hours orally or by
intravenous injection. Should the patient's condition require, the frequency
of dosing may be increased to q 8 hours or even further with caution. In
severe renal failure, accumulation may occur and the lowest frequency of
dosing compatible with an adequate patient response should be used. When
liver impairment is also present further reductions in dosage may be necessary.
Hemodialysis reduces the level of circulating Cimetidine. Ideally, the
dosage schedule should be adjusted so that the timing of a scheduled dose
coincides with the end of hemodialysis. </p>

<p>Patients with creatinine clearance less than 30 cc/min. who are being
treated for prevention of upper gastrointestinal bleeding should receive
half the recommended dose. </p>

<p>DUODENAL ULCER </p>

<p>Cimetidine has been shown to be effective in the treatment of active
duodenal ulcer and, at reduced dosage, in maintenance therapy following
healing of active ulcers. </p>

<p>ACTIVE DUODENAL ULCER: Cimetidine accelerates the rate of duodenal ulcer
healing. Healing rates reported in U.S. and foreign controlled trials with
Cimetidine are summarized below, beginning with the regimen providing the
lowest nocturnal dose. </p>

------------------------------------------------------------------------------  </pre>

<p>* Averages from controlled clinical trials. </p>

<p>A U.S., double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study demonstrated
that all once-daily at bedtime (h.s.) Cimetidine regimens were superior
to placebo in ulcer healing and that Cimetidine 800 mg h.s. healed 75%
of patients at 4 weeks. The healing rate with 800 mg h.s. was significantly
superior to 400 mg h.s. (66%) and not significantly different from 1600
mg h.s. (81%). </p>

<p>In the U.S. dose-ranging trial, over 80% of patients receiving Cimetidine
800 mg h.s. experienced nocturnal pain relief after 1 day. Relief from
daytime pain was reported in approximately 70% of patients after 2 days.
As with ulcer healing, the 800 mg h.s. dose was superior to 400 mg h.s.
and not different from 1600 mg h.s. </p>

<p>In foreign, double-blind studies with Cimetidine 800 mg h.s., 79% to
85% of patients were healed at four weeks. </p>

<p>While short-term treatment with Cimetidine can result in complete healing
of the duodenal ulcer, acute therapy will not prevent ulcer recurrence
after Cimetidine has been discontinued. Some follow-up studies have reported
that the rate of recurrence once therapy was discontinued was slightly
higher for patients healed on Cimetidine than for patients healed on other
forms of therapy; however, the Cimetidine-treated patients generally had
more severe disease. </p>

<p>MAINTENANCE THERAPY IN DUODENAL ULCER: Treatment with a reduced dose
of Cimetidine has been proven effective as maintenance therapy following
healing of active duodenal ulcers. </p>

<p>In numerous placebo-controlled studies conducted worldwide, the percent
of patients with observed ulcers at the end of 1 year's therapy with Cimetidine
400 mg h.s. was significantly lower (10% to 45%) than in patients receiving
placebo (44% to 70%). Thus, from 55% to 90% of patients were maintained
free of observed ulcers at the end of 1 year with Cimetidine 400 mg h.s.
</p>

<p>Factors such as smoking, duration and severity of disease, gender, and
genetic traits may contribute to variations in actual percentages. </p>

<p>Trials of other anti-ulcer therapy, whether placebo-controlled, positive-
controlled or open, have demonstrated a range of results similar to that
seen with Cimetidine. </p>

<p>ACTIVE BENIGN GASTRIC ULCER </p>

<p>Cimetidine has been shown to be effective in the short-term treatment
of active benign gastric ulcer. </p>

<p>In a multicenter, double-blind U.S. study, patients with endoscopically
confirmed benign gastric ulcer were treated with Cimetidine 300 mg four
times a day or with placebo for 6 weeks. Patients were limited to those
with ulcers ranging from 0.5 to 2.5 cm in size. Endoscopically confirmed
healing at 6 weeks was seen in significantly* more Cimetidine-treated patients
than in patients receiving placebo, as shown below: </p>

<pre>                                        Cimetidine                PLACEBO

In a similar multicenter U.S. study of the 800 mg h.s. oral regimen, the
endoscopically confirmed healing rates were:  
 
                                        Cimetidine                PLACEBO

Similarly, in worldwide double-blind clinical studies, endoscopically evaluated 
benign gastric ulcer healing rates were consistently higher with Cimetidine than
with placebo.  
 
GASTROESOPHAGEAL REFLUX DISEASE 
 
In two multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in patients with

<p>In these trials Cimetidine was superior to placebo by most measures
in improving symptoms of day- and night-time heartburn, with many of the
differences statistically significant. The q.i.d. regimen was generally
somewhat better than the b.i.d. regimen where these were compared. </p>

<p>PREVENTION OF UPPER GASTROINTESTINAL BLEEDING IN CRITICALLY ILL PATIENTS
</p>

<p>A double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized study of continuous infusion
cimetidine was performed in 131 critically ill patients (mean APACHE II
score = 15.99) to compare the incidence of upper gastrointestinal bleeding,
manifested as hematemesis or bright red blood which did not clear after
adjustment of the nasogastric tube and a 5 to 10 minute lavage, persistent
Gastroccult positive coffee grounds for 8 consecutive hours which did not
clear with 100 cc lavage and/or which were accompanied by a drop in hematocrit
of 5 percentage points, or melena, with an endoscopically documented upper
gastrointestinal source of bleed. 14% (9/65) of patients treated with cimetidine
continuous infusion developed bleeding compared to 33% (22/66) of the placebo
group. Coffee grounds was the manifestation of bleeding that accounted
for the difference between groups. Another randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled
study confirmed these results for an end point of upper gastrointestinal
bleeding with a confirmed upper gastrointestinal source noted on endoscopy,
and by post hoc analyses of bleeding episodes between groups. </p>

<p>PATHOLOGICAL HYPERSECRETORY CONDITIONS </p>

<p>(such as Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome) </p>

<p>Cimetidine significantly inhibited gastric acid secretion and reduced
occurrence of diarrhea, anorexia and pain in patients with pathological
hypersecretion associated with Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome, systemic mastocytosis
and multiple endocrine adenomas. Use of Cimetidine was also followed by
healing of intractable ulcers. </p>

<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><b>DESCRIPTION 
</b> <p>
Desogestrel and ethinyl estradiol provide an oral contraceptive regimen
containing desogestrel (13-ethyl-11-methylene-18,19-dinor-17 alpha-pregn-4-en-20-yn-17-ol)
and ethinyl estradiol (19-nor-17 alpha-pregna-1,3,5 (10)-trien-20-yne-3,17,diol).
desogestrel 
 <p>
<a name="ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY"></a><b>ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 
</b> <p>
Pharmacodynamics 
 <p>
Combination oral contraceptives act by suppression of gonadotropins. Although
the primary mechanism of this action is inhibition of ovulation, other
alterations include changes in the cervical mucus, which increase the
difficulty of sperm entry into the uterus, and changes in the endometrium which 
reduce the likelihood of implantation.  
 <p>
Receptor binding studies, as well as studies in animals and humans, have shown
that 3-keto-desogestrel, the biologically active metabolite of desogestrel,
combines high progestational activity with minimal intrinsic androgenicity
(REF. 91,92). Desogestrel, in combination with ethinyl estradiol, does not
counteract the estrogen-induced increases in SHBG, resulting in lower serum
levels of free testosterone (REF. 96-99).  
 <p>
Pharmacokinetics 
 <p>
Desogestrel is rapidly and almost completely absorbed and converted into 3-keto 
desogestrel, its biologically active metabolite. Following oral administration
the relative bioavailability of desogestrel, as measured by serum levels of 3
keto-desogestrel, is approximately 84%.  
 <p>
In the third cycle of use after a single dose of Desogestrel and ethinyl estradiol, maximum
concentrations of 3-keto-desogestrel of 2,805+/- 1,203 pg/mL (mean+/- SD) are
reached at 1.4+/- 0.8 hours. The area under the curve (AUC(0-infinity)) is 33
858+/- 11,043 pg/mL.hr after a single dose. At steady state, attained from at
least day 19 onwards, maximum concentrations of 5,840+/- 1,667 pg/mL are
reached at 1.4+/- 0.9 hours. The minimum plasma levels of 3-keto-desogestrel at 
steady state are 1,400+/- 560 pg/mL. The AUC(0-24) at steady state is 52,299+/- 
17,878 pg/mL.hr.  
 <p>
The mean AUC(0-infinity) for 3-keto-desogestrel at single dose is significantly 
lower than the mean AUC(0-24) at steady state. This indicates that the kinetics 
of 3-keto-desogestrel are non-linear due to an increase in binding of 3-keto-
desogestrel to sex hormone-binding globulin in the cycle, attributed to
increased sex hormone-binding globulin levels which are induced by the daily
administration of ethinyl estradiol. Sex hormone-binding globulin levels
increased significantly in the third treatment cycle from day 1 (150+/- 64
nmol/L) to day 21 (230+/- 59 nmol/L).  
 <p>
The elimination half-life for 3-keto-desogestrel is approximately 38+/- 20
hours at steady state. In addition to 3-keto-desogestrel, other phase I
metabolites are 3alpha-OH-desogestrel, 3beta-OH-desogestrel, and 3alpha-OH
5alpha-H- desogestrel. These other metabolites are not known to have any
pharmacologic effects, and are further converted in part by conjugation (phase
II metabolism) into polar metabolites, mainly sulfates and glucuronides.  
 <p>
Ethinyl estradiol is rapidly and almost completely absorbed. In the third cycle 
of use after a single dose of Desogestrel and ethinyl estradiol, the relative bioavailability is
approximately 83%.  <p>
 
In the third cycle of use after a single dose of Desogestrel and ethinyl estradiol, maximum
concentrations of ethinyl estradiol of 95+/- 34 pg/mL are reached at 1.5+/- 0.8 
hours. The AUC(0-infinity) is 1,471+/- 268 pg/mL.hr after a single dose. At
steady state, attained from at least day 19 onwards, maximum ethinyl estradiol
concentrations of 141+/- 48 pg/mL are reached at about 1.4+/- 0.7 hours. The
minimum serum levels of ethinyl estradiol at steady state are 24+/- 8.3 pg/mL.  
The AUC(0-24), at steady state is 1,117+/- 302 pg/mL.hr. The mean AUC(0-
infinity) for ethinyl estradiol following a single dose during treatment cycle
3 does not significantly differ from the mean AUC(0-24) at steady state. This
finding indicates linear kinetics for ethinyl estradiol.  
 <p>
The elimination half-life is 26+/- 6.8 hours at steady state. Ethinyl estradiol 
is subject to a significant degree of presystemic conjugation (phase II
metabolism). Ethinyl estradiol escaping gut wall conjugation undergoes phase I
metabolism and hepatic conjugation (phase II metabolism). Major phase I
metabolites are 2-OH-ethinyl estradiol and 2-methoxy-ethinyl estradiol. Sulfate 
and glucuronide conjugates of both ethinyl estradiol and phase I metabolites,
which are excreted in bile, can undergo enterohepatic circulation.  <p>
 
<a name="INDICATIONS AND USAGE"></a><b>INDICATIONS AND USAGE 
</b> <p>
Desogestrel and ethinyl estradiol Tablets are indicated for the prevention of pregnancy in women
who elect to use oral contraceptives as a method of contraception.  
 <p>
Oral contraceptives are highly effective. Table I lists the typical accidental
pregnancy rates for users of combination oral contraceptives and other methods
of contraception. The efficacy of these contraceptive methods, except
sterilization, depends upon the reliability with which they are used. Correct
and consistent use of these methods can result in lower failure rates.  <p><pre>

<a name="WARNINGS"></a><b>WARNINGS 
</b> 
 <p>
CIGARETTE SMOKING INCREASES THE RISK OF SERIOUS CARDIOVASCULAR SIDE EFFECTS
FROM ORAL CONTRACEPTIVE USE. THIS RISK INCREASES WITH AGE AND WITH HEAVY
SMOKING (15 OR MORE CIGARETTES PER DAY) AND IS QUITE MARKED IN WOMEN OVER 35
YEARS OF AGE.  WOMEN WHO USE ORAL CONTRACEPTIVES SHOULD BE STRONGLY ADVISED NOT 
TO SMOKE.  
 <p>
 
The use of oral contraceptives is associated with increased risks of several
serious conditions including myocardial infarction, thromboembolism, stroke,
hepatic neoplasia, and gallbladder disease, although the risk of serious
morbidity or mortality is very small in healthy women without underlying risk
factors. The risk of morbidity and mortality increases significantly in the
presence of other underlying risk factors such as hypertension, hyperlipidemias 
obesity and diabetes.  <p>
 
Practitioners prescribing oral contraceptives should be familiar with the
following information relating to these risks.  
 <p>
The information contained in this package insert is principally based on
studies carried out in patients who used oral contraceptives with formulations
of higher doses of estrogens and progestogens than those in common use today.
The effect of long term use of the oral contraceptives with formulations of
lower doses of both estrogens and progestogens remains to be determined.  
 <p>
Throughout this labeling, epidemiological studies reported are of two types: 
retrospective or case control studies and prospective or cohort studies. Case
control studies provide a measure of the relative risk of a disease, namely, a
Ratio of the incidence of a disease among oral contraceptive users to that
among nonusers. The relative risk does not provide information on the actual
clinical occurrence of a disease. Cohort studies provide a measure of
attributable risk, which is the Difference in the incidence of disease between
oral contraceptive users and nonusers. The attributable risk does provide
information about the actual occurrence of a disease in the population (Adapted 
from refs. 2 and 3 with the author's permission). For further information, the
reader is referred to a text on epidemiological methods.  
 <p>
1. THROMBOEMBOLIC DISORDERS AND OTHER VASCULAR PROBLEMS 
 <p>
a. Myocardial infarction 
 <p>
An increased risk of myocardial infarction has been attributed to oral
contraceptive use. This risk is primarily in smokers or women with other
underlying risk factors for coronary artery disease such as hypertension,
hypercholesterolemia, morbid obesity, and diabetes. The relative risk of heart
attack for current oral contraceptive users has been estimated to be two to six 
(REF. 4-10). The risk is very low in women under the age of 30.  
 <p>
Smoking in combination with oral contraceptive use has been shown to contribute 
substantially to the incidence of myocardial infarctions in women in their mid- 
thirties or older with smoking accounting for the majority of excess cases
(REF. 11). Mortality rates associated with circulatory disease have been shown
to increase substantially in smokers, especially in those 35 years of age and
older among women who use oral contraceptives.  <p>
 

Oral contraceptives may compound the effects of well-known risk factors, such
as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemias, age and obesity. (REF. 13) In
particular, some progestogens are known to decrease HDL cholesterol and cause
glucose intolerance, while estrogens may create a state of hyperinsulinism
(REF. 14-18). Oral contraceptives have been shown to increase blood pressure
among users (see section 9 in WARNINGS). Similar effects on risk factors have
been associated with an increased risk of heart disease. Oral contraceptives
must be used with caution in women with cardiovascular disease risk factors.  
 <p>
b. Thromboembolism 
 <p>
An increased risk of thromboembolic and thrombotic disease associated with the
use of oral contraceptives is well established. Case control studies have found 
the relative risk of users compared to nonusers to be 3 for the first episode
of superficial venous thrombosis, 4 to 11 for deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary 
embolism, and 1.5 to 6 for women with predisposing conditions for venous
thromboembolic disease (REF. 2,3,19-24). Cohort studies have shown the relative 
risk to be somewhat lower, about 3 for new cases and about 4.5 for new cases
requiring hospitalization (REF. 25). The risk of thromboembolic disease
associated with oral contraceptives is not related to length of use and
disappears after pill use is stopped (REF. 2).  
 <p>
A two- to four-fold increase in relative risk of post-operative thromboembolic
complications has been reported with the use of oral contraceptives (REF. 9). 
The relative risk of venous thrombosis in women who have predisposing
conditions is twice that of women without such medical conditions (REF. 26). If 
feasible, oral contraceptives should be discontinued at least four weeks prior
to and for two weeks after elective surgery of a type associated with an
increase in risk of thromboembolism and during and following prolonged
immobilization. Since the immediate postpartum period is also associated with
an increased risk of thromboembolism, oral contraceptives should be started no
earlier than four weeks after delivery in women who elect not to breast feed. 
 <p>
c. Cerebrovascular diseases 
 <p>
Oral contraceptives have been shown to increase both the relative and
attributable risks of cerebrovascular events (thrombotic and hemorrhagic
strokes), although, in general, the risk is greatest among older (&gt;35 years),
hypertensive women who also smoke. Hypertension was found to be a risk factor
for both users and nonusers, for both types of strokes, and smoking interacted
to increase the risk of stroke (REF. 27-29).  
 <p>
In a large study, the relative risk of thrombotic strokes has been shown to
range from 3 for normotensive users to 14 for users with severe hypertension
(REF. 30). The relative risk of hemorrhagic stroke is reported to be 1.2 for
non-smokers who used oral contraceptives, 2.6 for smokers who did not use oral
contraceptives, 7.6 for smokers who used oral contraceptives, 1.8 for
normotensive users and 25.7 for users with severe hypertension (REF. 30). The
attributable risk is also greater in older women (REF. 3).  
 <p>
d. Dose-related risk of vascular disease from oral contraceptives 
 <p>
A positive association has been observed between the amount of estrogen and
progestogen in oral contraceptives and the risk of vascular disease (REF. 31
33). A decline in serum high density lipoproteins (HDL) has been reported with
many progestational agents (REF. 14-16). A decline in serum high density
lipoproteins has been associated with an increased incidence of ischemic heart
disease. Because estrogens increase HDL cholesterol, the net effect of an oral
contraceptive depends on a balance achieved between doses of estrogen and
progestogen and the nature and absolute amount of progestogens used in the
contraceptives. The amount of both hormones should be considered in the choice
of an oral contraceptive.  
 <p>
Minimizing exposure to estrogen and progestogen is in keeping with good
principles of therapeutics. For any particular estrogen/progestogen combination 
the dosage regimen prescribed should be one which contains the least amount of
estrogen and progestogen that is compatible with a low failure rate and the
needs of the individual patient. New acceptors of oral contraceptive agents
should be started on preparations containing 0.035 mg or less of estrogen.  
 <p>
e. Persistence of risk of vascular disease 
                          <p>
There are two studies which have shown persistence of risk of vascular disease
for ever-users of oral contraceptives. In a study in the United States, the
risk of developing myocardial infarction after discontinuing oral
contraceptives persists for at least 9 years for women 40-49 years old who had
used oral contraceptives for five or more years, but this increased risk was
not demonstrated in other age groups (REF. 8). In another study in Great
Britain, the risk of developing cerebrovascular disease persisted for at least
6 years after discontinuation of oral contraceptives, although excess risk was
very small (REF. 34). However, both studies were performed with oral
contraceptive formulations containing 0.050 mg or higher of estrogens.

2. ESTIMATES OF MORTALITY FROM CONTRACEPTIVE USE 
 <p>
One study gathered data from a variety of sources which have estimated the
mortality rate associated with different methods of contraception at different
ages (Table III). These estimates include the combined risk of death associated 
with contraceptive methods plus the risk attributable to pregnancy in the event 
of method failure. Each method of contraception has its specific benefits and
risks. The study concluded that with the exception of oral contraceptive users
35 and older who smoke and 40 and older who do not smoke, mortality associated
with all methods of birth control is low and below that associated with
childbirth.  <p>
 
The observation of an increase in risk of mortality with age for oral
contraceptive users is based on data gathered in the 1970's (REF. 35). Current
clinical recommendation involves the use of lower estrogen dose formulations
and a careful consideration of risk factors. In 1989, the Fertility and
Maternal Health Drugs Advisory Committee was asked to review the use of oral
contraceptives in women 40 years of age and over. The committee concluded that
although cardiovascular disease risk may be increased with oral contraceptive
use after age 40 in healthy non-smoking women (even with the newer low-dose
formulations), there are also greater potential health risks associated with
pregnancy in older women and with the alternative surgical and medical
procedures which may be necessary if such women do not have access to effective 
and acceptable means of contraception. The Committee recommended that the
benefits of low-dose oral contraceptive use by healthy non-smoking women over
40 may outweigh the possible risks.  
 <p>
Of course, older women, as all women who take oral contraceptives, should take
an oral contraceptive which contains the least amount of estrogen and
progestogen that is compatible with a low failure rate and individual patient
needs.

3. CARCINOMA OF THE REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS AND BREASTS 
 <p>
Numerous epidemiological studies have been performed on the incidence of breast 
endometrial, ovarian and cervical cancer in women using oral contraceptives. 
While there are conflicting reports most studies suggest that the use of oral
contraceptives is not associated with an overall increase in the risk of
developing breast cancer. Some studies have reported an increased relative risk 
of developing breast cancer, particularly at a younger age. This increased
relative risk appears to be related to duration of use (REF. 36-43,79-89).  
 <p>
Some studies suggest that oral contraceptive use has been associated with an
increase in the risk of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia in some populations
of women (REF. 45-48). However, there continues to be controversy about the
extent to which such findings may be due to differences in sexual behavior and
other factors.  
 <p>
4. HEPATIC NEOPLASIA <p>
 
Benign hepatic adenomas are associated with oral contraceptive use, although
the incidence of benign tumors is rare in the United States. Indirect
calculations have estimated the attributable risk to be in the range of 3.3
cases/100,000 for users, a risk that increases after four or more years of use
especially with oral contraceptives of higher dose (REF. 49). Rupture of rare,
benign, hepatic adenomas may cause death through intra-abdominal hemorrhage
(REF. 50,51).  
 <p>
Studies from Britain have shown an increased risk of developing hepatocellular
carcinoma (REF. 52-54) in long-term (&gt;8 years) oral contraceptive users. 
However, these cancers are rare in the U.S. and the attributable risk (the
excess incidence) of liver cancers in oral contraceptive users approaches less
than one per million users.  
 <p>
5. OCULAR LESIONS <p>
 
There have been clinical case reports of retinal thrombosis associated with the 
use of oral contraceptives. Oral contraceptives should be discontinued if there 
is unexplained partial or complete loss of vision; onset of proptosis or
diplopia; papilledema; or retinal vascular lesions. Appropriate diagnostic and
therapeutic measures should be undertaken immediately.  
 <p>
6. ORAL CONTRACEPTIVE USE BEFORE OR DURING EARLY PREGNANCY 
 <p>
Extensive epidemiological studies have revealed no increased risk of birth
defects in women who have used oral contraceptives prior to pregnancy (REF. 56
57). The majority of recent studies also do not indicate a teratogenic effect,
particularly in so far as cardiac anomalies and limb reduction defects are
concerned (REF. 55,56,58,59), when oral contraceptives are taken inadvertently
during early pregnancy.  
 <p>
The administration of oral contraceptives to induce withdrawal bleeding should
not be used as a test for pregnancy. Oral contraceptives should not be used
during pregnancy to treat threatened or habitual abortion.  
 <p>
It is recommended that for any patient who has missed two consecutive periods,
pregnancy should be ruled out before continuing oral contraceptive use. If the
patient has not adhered to the prescribed schedule, the possibility of
pregnancy should be considered at the time of the first missed period. Oral
contraceptive use should be discontinued until pregnancy is ruled out.  
 <p>
7. GALLBLADDER DISEASE <p>
 
Earlier studies have reported an increased lifetime relative risk of
gallbladder surgery in users of oral contraceptives and estrogens (REF. 60,61). 
More recent studies, however, have shown that the relative risk of developing
gallbladder disease among oral contraceptive users may be minimal (REF. 62-64). 
The recent findings of minimal risk may be related to the use of oral
contraceptive formulations containing lower hormonal doses of estrogens and
progestogens.  <p>
 
8. CARBOHYDRATE AND LIPID METABOLIC EFFECTS 
 <p>
Oral contraceptives have been shown to cause a decrease in glucose tolerance in 
a significant percentage of users (REF. 17). This effect has been shown to be
directly related to estrogen dose (REF. 65). In general, progestogens increase
insulin secretion and create insulin resistance, this effect varying with
different progestational agents (REF. 17,66). In the nondiabetic woman, oral
contraceptives appear to have no effect on fasting blood glucose (REF. 67). 
Because of these demonstrated effects, prediabetic and diabetic women should be 
carefully monitored while taking oral contraceptives.  
 <p>
A small proportion of women will have persistent hypertriglyceridemia while on
the pill. As discussed earlier (see WARNINGS 1.a. and 1.d.), changes in serum
triglycerides and lipoprotein levels have been reported in oral contraceptive
users.  <p>
 
9. ELEVATED BLOOD PRESSURE 
 <p>
An increase in blood pressure has been reported in women taking oral
contraceptives (REF. 68) and this increase is more likely in older oral
contraceptive users (REF. 69) and with extended duration of use (REF. 61). Data 
from the Royal College of General Practitioners (REF. 12) and subsequent
randomized trials have shown that the incidence of hypertension increases with
increasing progestational activity.  <p>
Women with a history of hypertension or hypertension-related diseases, or renal 
disease (REF. 70) should be encouraged to use another method of contraception.  
If women elect to use oral contraceptives, they should be monitored closely and 
if significant elevation of blood pressure occurs, oral contraceptives should
be discontinued. For most women, elevated blood pressure will return to normal
after stopping oral contraceptives (REF. 69), and there is no difference in the 
occurrence of hypertension among former and never users (REF. 68,70,71).  
 <p>
10. HEADACHE 
 <p>
The onset or exacerbation of migraine or development of headache with a new
pattern which is recurrent, persistent or severe requires discontinuation of
oral contraceptives and evaluation of the cause.  
 <p>
11. BLEEDING IRREGULARITIES 
 <p>
Breakthrough bleeding and spotting are sometimes encountered in patients on
oral contraceptives, especially during the first three months of use.
Nonhormonal causes should be considered and adequate diagnostic measures taken
to rule out malignancy or pregnancy in the event of breakthrough bleeding, as
in the case of any abnormal vaginal bleeding. If pathology has been excluded,
time or a change to another formulation may solve the problem. In the event of
amenorrhea, pregnancy should be ruled out.  
 <p>
Some women may encounter post-pill amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea, especially
when such a condition was pre-existent.  
 <p>
12. ECTOPIC PREGNANCY 
 <p>
Ectopic as well as intrauterine pregnancy may occur in contraceptive failures.  
 <p>
<a name="PRECAUTIONS"></a><b>PRECAUTIONS 
</b> <p>
1. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION AND FOLLOW UP 
 <p>
A complete medical history and physical examination should be taken prior to
the initiation or reinstitution of oral contraceptives and at least annually
during use of oral contraceptives. These physical examinations should include
special reference to blood pressure, breasts, abdomen and pelvic organs,
including cervical cytology, and relevant laboratory tests. In case of
undiagnosed, persistent or recurrent abnormal vaginal bleeding, appropriate
diagnostic measures should be conducted to rule out malignancy. Women with a
strong family history of breast cancer or who have breast nodules should be
monitored with particular care.  
 <p>
2. LIPID DISORDERS 
 <p>
Women who are being treated for hyperlipidemias should be followed closely if
they elect to use oral contraceptives. Some progestogens may elevate LDL levels 
and may render the control of hyperlipidemias more difficult.  
 <p>
3. LIVER FUNCTION 
 <p>
If jaundice develops in any woman receiving such drugs, the medication should
be discontinued. Steroid hormones may be poorly metabolized in patients with
impaired liver function.  
 <p>
4. FLUID RETENTION 
 <p>
Oral contraceptives may cause some degree of fluid retention. They should be
prescribed with caution, and only with careful monitoring, in patients with
conditions which might be aggravated by fluid retention.  
 <p>
5. EMOTIONAL DISORDERS 
 <p>
Women with a history of depression should be carefully observed and the drug
discontinued if depression recurs to a serious degree.  
 <p>
6. CONTACT LENSES 
 <p>
Contact lens wearers who develop visual changes or changes in lens tolerance
should be assessed by an ophthalmologist.  
 <p>
7. DRUG INTERACTIONS 
 <p>
Reduced efficacy and increased incidence of breakthrough bleeding and menstrual 
irregularities have been associated with concomitant use of rifampin. A similar 
association, though less marked, has been suggested with barbiturates,
phenylbutazone, phenytoin sodium, carbamazepine and possibly with griseofulvin, 
ampicillin and tetracyclines (REF. 72).  
 <p>
8. INTERACTIONS WITH LABORATORY TESTS 
 <p>
Certain endocrine and liver function tests and blood components may be affected 
by oral contraceptives:  
 <p>
a. Increased prothrombin and factors VII, VIII, IX and X; decreased
antithrombin 3; increased norepinephrine-induced platelet aggregability.  
 <p>
b. Increased thyroid binding globulin (TBG) leading to increased circulating
total thyroid hormone, as measured by protein-bound iodine (PBI), T4 by column
or by radioimmunoassay. Free T3 resin uptake is decreased, reflecting the
elevated TBG; free T4 concentration is unaltered.  
 <p>
c. Other binding proteins may be elevated in serum.  
 <p>
d. Sex hormone binding globulins are increased and result in elevated levels of 
total circulating sex steroids however, free or biologically active levels
either decrease or remain unchanged.  
 <p>
e. High-density lipoprotein (HDL-C) and triglycerides may be increased, while
low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and total cholesterol (Total-C) may 
be decreased or unchanged.  
 <p>
f. Glucose tolerance may be decreased.  
 <p>
g. Serum folate levels may be depressed by oral contraceptive therapy. This may 
be of clinical significance if a woman becomes pregnant shortly after
discontinuing oral contraceptives.  
 <p>
9. CARCINOGENESIS 
 <p>
See WARNINGS section.  
 <p>
10. PREGNANCY 
 <p>
Pregnancy Category X. See CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS sections.  
 <p>
11. NURSING MOTHERS 
 <p>
Small amounts of oral contraceptive steroids have been identified in the milk
of nursing mothers and a few adverse effects on the child have been reported,
including jaundice and breast enlargement. In addition, oral contraceptives
given in the postpartum period may interfere with lactation by decreasing the
quantity and quality of breast milk. If possible, the nursing mother should be
advised not to use oral contraceptives but to use other forms of contraception
until she has completely weaned her child.  
 <p>
<a name="DRUG INTERACTIONS"></a><b>DRUG INTERACTIONS 
</b> <p>
Reduced efficacy and increased incidence of breakthrough bleeding and menstrual 
irregularities have been associated with concomitant use of rifampin. A similar 
association, though less marked, has been suggested with barbiturates,

ampicillin and tetracyclines (REF. 72).  
 
(See Also PRECAUTIONS) 
 <p>

<a name="OVERDOSAGE"></a><b>OVERDOSAGE 
</b> <p>
Serious ill effects have not been reported following acute ingestion of large
doses of oral contraceptives by young children. Overdosage may cause nausea,
and withdrawal bleeding may occur in females.  
 <p>
NON-CONTRACEPTIVE HEALTH BENEFITS 
 <p>
The following non-contraceptive health benefits related to the use of oral
contraceptives are supported by epidemiological studies which largely utilized
oral contraceptive formulations containing estrogen doses exceeding 0.035 mg of 
ethinyl estradiol or 0.05 mg of mestranol (REF. 73-78).  
 <p>
Effects on menses:  
 <p>
--increased menstrual cycle regularity 
 <p>
--decreased blood loss and decreased incidence of iron deficiency anemia 
 <p>
--decreased incidence of dysmenorrhea 
 <p>
Effects related to inhibition of ovulation:  
 <p>
--decreased incidence of functional ovarian cysts 
 <p>
--decreased incidence of ectopic pregnancies 
 <p>
Effects from long-term use:  
 <p>
--decreased incidence of fibroadenomas and fibrocystic disease of the breast 
 <p>
--decreased incidence of acute pelvic inflammatory disease 
 <p>
--decreased incidence of endometrial cancer 
 <p>
--decreased incidence of ovarian cancer 
 <p>
<a name="DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION"></a><b>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION 
</b> <p>
To achieve maximum contraceptive effectiveness, Desogestrel and ethinyl estradiol must be taken
exactly as directed and at intervals not exceeding 24 hours.
 <p>
ALL ORAL CONTRACEPTIVES 
 <p>
Breakthrough bleeding, spotting, and amenorrhea are frequent reasons for
patients discontinuing oral contraceptives. In breakthrough bleeding, as in all 
cases of irregular bleeding from the vagina, nonfunctional causes should be
borne in mind. In undiagnosed persistent or recurrent abnormal bleeding from
the vagina, adequate diagnostic measures are indicated to rule out pregnancy or 
malignancy. If pathology has been excluded, time or a change to another
formulation may solve the problem. Changing to an oral contraceptive with a
higher estrogen content, while potentially useful in minimizing menstrual
irregularity, should be done only if necessary since this may increase the risk 
of thromboembolic disease.  
 <p>
Use of oral contraceptives in the event of a missed menstrual period:  
 <p>
1. If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed schedule, the possibility
of pregnancy should be considered at the time of the first missed period and
oral contraceptive use should be discontinued until pregnancy is ruled out.  
 <p>
2. If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two
consecutive periods, pregnancy should be ruled out before continuing oral
contraceptive use.

information!</B></P>

<HR width="100%"></P>

<P><A NAME="DESCRIPTION"></A><B>DESCRIPTION </B></P>

<P>Chemically, meclizine HCl is 1-(p-chloro-alpha-phenylbenzyl)-4-(m- methylbenzyl)piperazine
dihydrochloride monohydrate. Meclizine is an H(1) histamine receptor blocker
of the piperazine side chain group. It exhibits its action by an effect
on the Central Nervous System (CNS), possibly by its ability to block muscarinic
receptors in the brain. </P>

<P><A NAME="ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY"></A><B>ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
</B></P>

<P>Meclizine is an antihistamine which shows marked protective activity
against nebulized histamine and lethal doses of intravenously injected
histamine in guinea pigs. It has a marked effect in blocking the vasodepressor
response to histamine, but only a slight blocking action against acetylcholine.
Its activity is relatively weak in inhibiting the spasmogenic action of
histamine on isolated guinea pig ileum. </P>

<P><A NAME="INDICATIONS AND USAGE"></A><B>INDICATIONS AND USAGE </B></P>

<P>Based on a review of this drug by the National Academy of Sciences-National
Research Council and/or other information, FDA has classified the indications
as follows: </P>

<P>Effective: Management of nausea and vomiting, and dizziness associated
with motion sickness. </P>

<P>Possibly Effective: Management of vertigo associated with diseases affecting
the vestibular system. </P>

<P>Final classification of the less than effective indications requires
further investigation. </P>

<P><A NAME="CONTRAINDICATIONS"></A><B>CONTRAINDICATIONS </B></P>

<P>Meclizine HCl is contraindicated in individuals who have shown a previous
hypersensitivity to it. </P>

<P><A NAME="WARNINGS"></A><B>WARNINGS </B></P>

<P>Since drowsiness may, on occasion, occur with use of this drug, patients
should be warned of this possibility and cautioned against driving a car
or operating dangerous machinery. </P>

<P>Patients should avoid alcoholic beverages while taking this drug. Due
to its potential anticholinergic action, this drug should be used with
caution in patients with asthma, glaucoma, or enlargement of the prostate
gland. </P>

<P>USAGE IN CHILDREN </P>

<P>Clinical studies establishing safety and effectiveness in children have
not been done; therefore, usage is not recommended in children under 12
years of age. </P>

<P>USAGE IN PREGNANCY </P>

<P>Pregnancy Category B. Reproduction studies in rats have shown cleft
palates at 25-50 times the human dose. Epidemiological studies in pregnant
women, however, do not indicate that meclizine increases the risk of abnormalities
when administered during pregnancy. Despite the animal findings, it would
appear that the possibility of fetal harm is remote. Nevertheless, meclizine,
or any other medication, should be used during pregnancy only if clearly
necessary. </P>

<P><A NAME="ADVERSE REACTIONS"></A><B>ADVERSE REACTIONS </B></P>

<P>Drowsiness, dry mouth and, on rare occasions, blurred vision have been
reported. </P>

<P><A NAME="DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION"></A><B>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
</B></P>

<P>Vertigo: </P>

<P>For the control of vertigo associated with diseases affecting the vestibular
system, the recommended dose is 25 to 100 mg daily, in divided dosage,
depending upon clinical response. </P>

<P>Motion Sickness: </P>

<P>The initial dose of 25 to 50 mg of Meclizine should be taken one hour
prior to embarkation for protection against motion sickness. Thereafter,
the dose may be repeated every 24 hours for the duration of the journey.
</P>

<p><a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><b>DESCRIPTION </b></p>

<p>Testosterone USP is a white, or creamy white crystalline powder or crystals
chemically described as 17beta-hydroxyandrost-4-en-3-one.Testosterone C19H28O2
: mw 288.43. </p>

<p><a name="ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY"></a><b>ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
</b></p>

<p>Testosterone (transdermal system) delivers physiologic amounts of testosterone
producing circulating testosterone concentrations that approximate the
normal circadian rhythm of healthy young men. </p>

<p>Testosterone (transdermal system) delivers testosterone, the primary
androgenic hormone. Testosterone is responsible for the normal growth and
development of the male sex organs and for maintenance of secondary sex
characteristics. These effects include the growth and maturation of the
prostate, seminal vesicles, penis, and scrotum; development of male hair
distribution, such as facial, pubic, chest, and axillary hair; laryngeal
enlargement; vocal cord thickening; and alterations in body musculature
and fat distribution. </p>

<p>Male hypogonadism results from insufficient secretion of testosterone
and is characterized by low serum testosterone concentrations. Symptoms
associated with male hypogonadism include the following: impotence and
decreased sexual desire; fatigue and loss of energy; mood depression; and
regression of secondary sexual characteristics. </p>

<p>GENERAL ANDROGEN EFFECTS </p>

<p>Androgens promote retention of nitrogen, sodium, potassium, and phosphorus,
and decreased urinary excretion of calcium. Androgens have been reported
to increase protein anabolism and decrease protein catabolism. Nitrogen
balance is improved only when there is sufficient intake of calories and
protein. </p>

<p>Androgens are also responsible for the growth spurt of adolescence and
for the eventual termination of linear growth that is brought about by
the fusion of the epiphyseal growth centers. In children, exogenous androgens
accelerate linear growth rates but may cause disproportionate advancement
in bone maturation. Use over long periods may result in fusion of the epiphyseal
growth centers and termination of the growth process. </p>

<p>Androgens have been reported to stimulate the production of red blood
cells by enhancing erythropoietin production. </p>

<p>During exogenous administration of androgens, endogenous testosterone
release is inhibited through feedback inhibition of pituitary LH secretion.
With large doses of exogenous androgens, spermatogenesis may also be suppressed
through feedback inhibition of pituitary follicle stimulating hormone (FSH)
secretion. There is a lack of substantial evidence that androgens are effective
in accelerating fracture healing or in shortening post-surgical convalescence.
</p>

<p>PHARMACOKINETICS </p>

<p>ABSORPTION </p>

<p>Following Testosterone (transdermal system) application to non-scrotal
skin, testosterone is continuously absorbed during the 24-hour dosing period.
Daily application of 2 systems at approximately 10 PM results in a serum
testosterone concentration profile that mimics the normal circadian variation
observed in healthy young men. Maximum concentrations occur in the early
morning hours with minimum concentrations in the evening (Table 1 below).

<p>In a group of 34 hypogonadal men, application of two Testosterone (transdermal

average testosterone absorption of 4 to 5 mg over 24 hours. The serum testosterone
concentration profiles during application were similar for these sites
(Table 2). Applications to the chest and shins resulted in greater inter-individual
variability and average 24 hour absorption of 3 to 4 mg. </p>

<p>In a steady-state study of 12 hypogonadal men, nightly application of
1, 2, or 3 Testosterone (transdermal system) systems resulted in increases
in the mean morning serum testosterone concentrations. These concentrations
averaged 424, 584, and 766 ng/dL with the application of 1, 2, and 3 systems,
respectively. The mean baseline serum testosterone concentration was 76
ng/dL. Normal range morning serum testosterone concentrations are reached
during the first day of dosing. There is no accumulation of testosterone
during continuous treatment. </p>

<p>DISTRIBUTION </p>

<p>In serum, testosterone is bound with high affinity to sex hormone binding
globulin (SHBG) and with low affinity to albumin. The albumin bound portion
easily dissociates and is presumed to be bioactive. The SHBG-bound portion
is not considered to be bioactive. The amount of SHBG in serum and the
total testosterone concentration determine the distribution of bioactive
and non- bioactive androgen. </p>

<p>Bioactive serum testosterone concentrations (BT) measured during Testosterone
(transdermal system) treatment paralleled the serum testosterone profile
and remained within the normal reference range. </p>

<p>METABOLISM </p>

<p>Inactivation of testosterone occurs primarily in the liver. Testosterone
(T) is metabolized to various 17-keto steroids through two different pathways,
and the major active metabolites are estradiol (E2) and dihydrotestosterone
(DHT). DHT binds with greater affinity to SHBG than does testosterone.
In reproductive tissues, DHT is further metabolized to 3-alpha and 3-beta
androstanediol. In many tissues, the activity of testosterone appears to
depend on reduction to DHT, which binds to cytosol receptor proteins. The
steroid- receptor complex is transported to the nucleus, where it initiates
transcription events and cellular changes related to androgen action. </p>

<p>During steady-state pharmacokinetic studies in hypogonadal men treated
with Testosterone (transdermal system) , the average DHT:T and E2:T ratios
were comparable to those in normal men, approximately 1:10 and 1:200, respectively.
</p>

<p>Upon removal of the Testosterone (transdermal system) systems, serum
testosterone concentrations decrease with an apparent half-life of approximately
70 minutes. Hypogonadal concentrations are reached within 24 hours following
system removal. Testosterone (transdermal system) therapy suppresses endogenous
testosterone secretion via the pituitary/gonadal axis, resulting in a reduction
in baseline serum testosterone concentrations compared to the untreated
state. </p>

<p>EXCRETION </p>

<p>Approximately 90% of a testosterone dose given intramuscularly is excreted
in the urine as glucuronide and sulfate conjugates of testosterone and
its metabolites; about 6% is excreted in the feces, mostly in unconjugated
form. </p>

<p>SPECIAL POPULATIONS </p>

<p>Geriatric </p>

<p>No age related effects on testosterone pharmacokinetics were observed
in clinical trials of Testosterone (transdermal system) in men up to 65
years of age. In a group of 9 elderly testosterone deficient men (65-79
years of age, average baseline testosterone level 184 +/- 50 ng/dL), a
single application of 2 Testosterone (transdermal system) systems to the
back resulted in an average testosterone level of 591 +/- 121 ng/dL with
a Tmax of 14.2 +/- 4.2 hours. The total testosterone delivered over the
24-hour application time was 3.8 +/- 0.6 mg, approximately 20% less than
the average amount delivered in younger patients. </p>

<p>Race </p>

<p>There is insufficient information available from Testosterone (transdermal
system) trials to compare testosterone pharmacokinetics in different racial
groups. </p>

<p>Renal Insufficiency </p>

<p>There is no experience with use of Testosterone (transdermal system)
in patients with renal insufficiency. </p>

<p>Hepatic Insufficiency </p>

<p>There is no experience with use of Testosterone (transdermal system)
in patients with hepatic insufficiency. </p>

<p>Drug-Drug Interactions </p>

<p>See &quot;Precautions&quot; below </p>

<p>CLINICAL STUDIES </p>

<p>In clinical studies, 93% of patients were treated with two Testosterone
(transdermal system) systems daily, 6% used three systems daily, and 1%
used one system daily. </p>

<p>The hormonal effects of Testosterone (transdermal system) as a treatment
for male hypogonadism were demonstrated in four open-label trials that
included 94 hypogonadal men, ages 15 to 65 years. In these trials, Testosterone
(transdermal system) produced average morning serum testosterone concentrations
within the normal reference range in 92% of patients. The mean (SD) serum
hormone concentrations and percentage of patients who achieved average
concentrations within the normal ranges are shown in Table 3 below. </p>

<p>A physiological suppression of the pituitary/gonadal axis occurs during
continuous Testosterone (transdermal system) treatment leading to reduced
serum LH concentrations. In clinical trials, 10 of 21 (48%) of men with
primary (hypergonadotropic) hypogonadism achieved normal range LH concentrations
within 6 to 12 months of treatment. LH concentrations may remain elevated
in some patients despite serum testosterone concentrations within the normal
range. </p>

<p>Twenty-nine patients, previously treated with testosterone, completed
12 months of Testosterone (transdermal system) treatment. Following an
8-week androgen withdrawal period, Testosterone (transdermal system) treatment
produced positive effects on fatigue, mood and sexual function. The percent
of patients complaining of fatigue decreased from 79% to 10% during treatment
(p&lt;0.001). The average patient depression score (Beck Depression Inventory)
decreased from 6.9 to 3.9 (p&lt;0.001). Nocturnal penile tumescence and
rigidity monitoring showed an increase in mean duration of erections 0.23
to 0.39 hours per night (p=0.01) and an increase in penile tip rigidity
from 18% to 50% (p&lt;0.001). The total number of self-reported erections
reported increased from 2.3 to 7.8 per week (p&lt;0.001). </p>

<p>COMPARISON WITH INTRAMUSCULAR TESTOSTERONE: Sixty-six patients, previously
treated with testosterone injections, received Testosterone (transdermal
system) or intramuscular testosterone enanthate (200 mg every 2 weeks)
treatment for 6 months. The percent of time that serum concentrations measured
throughout the dosing interval remained within the normal range were as
follows:</p>

Sexual function was comparable between groups.</pre>

<p>EFFECT ON PLASMA LIPIDS: In 67 men treated for 6 to 12 months, the average
(SE) serum total cholesterol and HDL concentrations were 199 (7.6) ng/dL
and 46 (2.3) ng/dL. Compared to baseline values during a hypogonadal state
achieved by 8 weeks of androgen withdrawal in 29 patients, the following
changes in lipids were observed during 1 year of Testosterone (transdermal
system) treatment: Cholesterol decreased 1.2%; HDL decreased 8%; Cholesterol/HDL
ratio increased 9%. In these patients, lipids measured during Testosterone
(transdermal system) treatment were not significantly different from those
measured during prior IM injection treatment. </p>

<p>EFFECTS ON THE PROSTATE: Prostate size and serum prostate specific antigen
(PSA) concentrations during treatment were comparable to values reported
for eugonadal men. One case of prostate carcinoma occurred during Testosterone
(transdermal system) treatment; two cases were detected during IM treatment.
</p>

<p><a name="INDICATIONS AND USAGE"></a><b>INDICATIONS AND USAGE </b></p>

<p>Testosterone (transdermal system) is indicated for testosterone replacement
therapy in men for conditions associated with a deficiency or absence of
endogenous testosterone. </p>

<p>Primary hypogonadism (congenital or acquired)--Testicular failure due
to cryptorchidism, bilateral torsion, orchitis, vanishing testis syndrome,
or orchidectomy, Klinefelter's syndrome, chemotherapy, or toxic damage
from alcohol or heavy metals. These men usually have low serum testosterone
concentrations accompanied by gonadotropins (FSH, LH) above the normal
range. </p>

<p>Secondary, i.e., hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (congenital or acquired)--
idiopathic gonadotropin or luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH)
deficiency, or pituitary-hypothalamic injury from tumors, trauma, or radiation.
These men have low serum testosterone concentrations without associated
elevation in gonadotropins. Appropriate adrenal cortical and thyroid hormone
replacement therapy may be necessary in patients with multiple pituitary
or hypothalamic abnormalities. </p>

<p><a name="CONTRAINDICATIONS"></a><b>CONTRAINDICATIONS </b></p>

<p>Androgens are contraindicated in men with carcinoma of the breast or
known or suspected carcinoma of the prostate. </p>

<p>Testosterone (transdermal system) therapy has not been evaluated in
women and must not be used in women. </p>

<p>Testosterone may cause fetal harm. </p>

<p>Testosterone (transdermal system) is contraindicated in patients with
known hypersensitivity to any of its components. </p>

<p><a name="WARNINGS"></a><b>WARNINGS </b></p>

<p>Prolonged use of high doses of orally active 17-alpha-alkyl androgens
(e.g., methyltestosterone) has been associated with the development of
peliosis hepatis, cholestatic jaundice and hepatic neoplasms, including
hepatocellular carcinoma (see PRECAUTIONS, Carcinogenesis). Peliosis hepatis
can be a life- threatening or fatal complication. Testosterone is not known
to produce these adverse effects. </p>

<p>Geriatric patients treated with androgens may be at an increased risk
for the development of prostatic hyperplasia. </p>

<p>Geriatric patients and other patients with clinical or demographic characteristics
that are recognized to be associated with an increased risk of prostate
cancer should be evaluated for the presence of subclinical or clinical
prostate cancer prior to initiation of testosterone replacement therapy,
because testosterone therapy may promote the growth of existing subclinical
foci of prostate cancer.(REF. 2) </p>

<p>In men receiving testosterone replacement therapy, surveillance for
prostate cancer should be consistent with current practices for eugonadal
men (see PRECAUTIONS, Carcinogenesis). </p>

<p>Edema, with or without congestive heart failure, may be a serious complication
of androgen treatment in patients with preexisting cardiac, renal, or hepatic
disease. In addition to discontinuation of the drug, diuretic therapy may
be required. </p>

<p>Gynecomastia frequently develops and occasionally persists in patients
being treated for hypogonadism. </p>

<p><a name="PRECAUTIONS"></a><b>PRECAUTIONS </b></p>

<p>GENERAL </p>

<p>The physician should instruct patients to report any of the following
side effects of androgens: </p>

<p>--Too frequent or persistent erections of the penis </p>

<p>--Any nausea, vomiting, jaundice, or ankle swelling </p>

<p>Virilization of female sexual partners has been reported with male use
of a topical testosterone solution. Topically applied creams leave as much
as 90 mg residual testosterone on the skin. The occlusive backing film
on Testosterone (transdermal system) prevents the partner from coming in
contact with the active material in the system. Transfer of the system
to the partner is unlikely. Changes in body hair distribution, significant
increase in acne, or other signs of virilization of the female partner
should be brought to the attention of a physician. </p>

<p>INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS </p>

<p>Advise patients of the following: </p>

<p>Testosterone (transdermal system) should not be applied to the scrotum.
</p>

<p>Testosterone (transdermal system) does not have to be removed during
sexual intercourse, nor while taking a shower or bath. </p>

<p>Testosterone (transdermal system) systems should be applied nightly.
</p>

<p>LABORATORY TESTS </p>

<p>Hemoglobin and hematocrit should be checked periodically to detect polycythemia
in patients who are receiving androgen therapy. </p>

<p>Liver function, prostate specific antigen, total cholesterol and HDL
cholesterol should be checked periodically. </p>

<p>DRUG INTERACTIONS </p>

<p>ANTICOAGULANTS: C-17 substituted derivatives of testosterone, such as
methandrostenolone, have been reported to decrease the anticoagulant requirements
of patients receiving oral anticoagulants. Patients receiving oral anticoagulants
require close monitoring especially when androgens are started or stopped.
</p>

<p>OXYPHENBUTAZONE: Concurrent administration of oxyphenbutazone and androgens
may result in elevated serum levels of oxyphenbutazone. </p>

<p>INSULIN: In diabetic patients, the metabolic effects of androgens may
decrease blood glucose and, therefore, insulin requirements. </p>

<p>DRUG/LABORATORY TEST INTERFERENCES </p>

<p>Androgens may decrease levels of thyroxine- binding globulin, resulting
in decreased total T4 serum levels and increased resin uptake of T3 and
T4. Free thyroid hormone levels remain unchanged, however, and there is
no clinical evidence of thyroid dysfunction. </p>

<p>CARCINOGENESIS, MUTAGENESIS, IMPAIRMENT OF FERTILITY </p>

<p>ANIMAL DATA: Testosterone has been tested by subcutaneous injection
and implantation in mice and rats. The implant induced cervical-uterine
tumors in mice, which metastasized in some cases. There is suggestive evidence
that injection of testosterone into some strains of female mice increases
their susceptibility to hepatoma. Testosterone is also known to increase
the number of tumors and decrease the degree of differentiation of chemically
induced carcinomas of the liver in rats. </p>

<p>HUMAN DATA: There are rare reports of hepatocellular carcinoma in patients
receiving long-term therapy with androgens in high doses. Withdrawal of
drugs did not lead to regression of the tumors in all cases. </p>

<p>Geriatric patients treated with androgens may be at an increased risk
for the development of prostatic hyperplasia. </p>

<p>Geriatric patients and other patients with clinical or demographic characteristics
that are recognized to be associated with an increased risk of prostate
cancer should be evaluated for the presence of subclinical or clinical
prostate cancer prior to initiation of testosterone replacement therapy,
because testosterone therapy may promote the growth of existing subclinical
foci of prostate cancer.(REF. 2) </p>

<p>In men receiving testosterone replacement therapy, surveillance for

<p>PREGNANCY CATEGORY X: (See Contraindications). </p>

<p>TERATOGENIC EFFECTS: Testosterone (transdermal system) must not be used
in women. </p>

<p>NURSING MOTHERS: Testosterone (transdermal system) must not be used
in women. </p>

<p>PEDIATRIC USE: Testosterone (transdermal system) has not been evaluated
clinically in males under 15 years of age. </p>

Rechallenge with components of the system showed ethanol sensitization
in 4 patients. One reaction was attributed to testosterone. These patients
experienced no adverse sequelae related to oral alcohol ingestion or injectable
testosterone use. Older patients may be more prone to develop allergic
contact dermatitis. Local blister reactions, characterized by erythema
and vesicles or bullae at the site of Testosterone (transdermal system)
application occurred at a rate of approximately 1 in 6,500 system applications.

<p><a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><b>DESCRIPTION </b></p>

<p>Each Mesalamine delayed-release tablet for oral administration contains
400 mg of mesalamine, an anti-inflammatory drug. The Mesalamine delayed-
release tablets are coated with acrylic based resin, Eudragit S (methacrylic
acid copolymer B, NF), which dissolves at pH 7 or greater, releasing mesalamine
in the terminal ileum and beyond for topical anti-inflammatory action in
the colon. Mesalamine has the chemical name 5-amino-2-hydroxybenzoic acid.
Molecular Formula: C7H7NO3 Molecular Weight: 153.1 </p>

<p><a name="ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY"></a><b>ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
</b></p>

<p>Mesalamine is thought to be the major therapeutically active part of
the sulfasalazine molecule in the treatment of ulcerative colitis. Sulfasalazine
is converted to equimolar amounts of sulfapyridine and mesalamine by bacterial
action in the colon. The usual oral dose of sulfasalazine for active ulcerative
colitis is 3 to 4 grams daily in divided doses, which provides 1.2 to 1.6
grams of mesalamine to the colon. </p>

<p>The mechanism of action of mesalamine (and sulfasalazine) is unknown,
but appears to be topical rather than systemic. Mucosal production of arachidonic
acid (AA) metabolites, both through the cyclooxygenase pathways, i.e.,
prostanoids, and through the lipoxygenase pathways, i.e., leukotrienes
(LTs) and hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs), is increased in patients
with chronic inflammatory bowel disease, and it is possible that mesalamine
diminishes inflammation by blocking cyclooxygenase and inhibiting prostaglandin
(PG) production in the colon. </p>

<p>PHARMACOKINETICS: Mesalamine tablets are coated with an acrylic-based
resin that delays release of mesalamine until it reaches the terminal ileum
and beyond. This has been demonstrated in human studies conducted with
radiological and serum markers. Approximately 28% of the mesalamine in
Mesalamine tablets is absorbed after oral ingestion, leaving the remainder
available for topical action and excretion in the feces. Absorption of
mesalamine is similar in fasted and fed subjects. The absorbed mesalamine
is rapidly acetylated in the gut mucosal wall and by the liver. It is excreted
mainly by the kidney as N-acetyl- 5- aminosalicylic acid. </p>

<p>Mesalamine from orally administered Mesalamine tablets appears to be
more extensively absorbed than the mesalamine released from sulfasalazine.
Maximum plasma levels of mesalamine and N-acetyl- 5-aminosalicylic acid
following multiple Mesalamine doses are about 1.5 to 2 times higher than
those following an equivalent dose of mesalamine in the form of sulfasalazine.
Combined mesalamine and N- acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid AUC's and urine
drug dose recoveries following multiple doses of Mesalamine tablets are
about 1.3 to 1.5 times higher than those following an equivalent dose of
mesalamine in the form of sulfasalazine. </p>

<p>The tmax for mesalamine and its metabolite, N- acetyl-5-aminosalicylic
acid, is usually delayed, reflecting the delayed release, and ranges from
4 to 12 hours. The half-lives of elimination (t1/2elm) for mesalamine and
N-acetyl- 5- aminosalicylic acid are usually about 12 hours, but are variable,
ranging from 2 to 15 hours. There is a large intersubject variability in
the plasma concentrations of mesalamine and N-acetyl- 5-aminosalicyclic
acid and in their elimination half-lives following administration of Mesalamine
tablets. </p>

<p>CLINICAL STUDIES: Two placebo-controlled studies have demonstrated the
efficacy of Mesalamine tablets in patients with mildly to moderately active
ulcerative colitis. In one randomized, double- blind, multicenter trial
of 158 patients, Mesalamine doses of 1.6 g/day and 2.4 g/day were compared
to placebo. At the dose of 2.4 g/day, Mesalamine tablets reduced the disease
activity, with 21 of 43 (49%). Mesalamine patients showing improvement
in sigmoidoscopic appearance of the bowel compared to 12 of 44 (27%) placebo
patients (p=0.048). In addition, significantly more patients in the Mesalamine
2.4 g/day group showed improvement in rectal bleeding and stool frequency.
The 1.6 g/day dose did not produce consistent evidence of effectiveness.
</p>

<p>In a second randomized, double-blind, placebo- controlled clinical trial
of 6 weeks duration in 87 ulcerative colitis patients, Mesalamine tablets,
at a dose of 4.8 g/day, gave sigmoidoscopic improvement in 28 of 38 (74%)
patients compared to 10 of 38 (26%) placebo patients (p&lt;0.001). Also,
more patients in the Mesalamine 4.8 g/day group showed improvement in overall
symptoms. </p>

<p>The effect of Mesalamine (mesalamine) on sulfasalazine-induced impairment
of male fertility was examined in an open-label study. Nine patients (age
&lt;40 years) with chronic ulcerative colitis in clinical remission on
sulfasalazine 2-3 g/day were crossed over to an equivalent Mesalamine dose
(0.8-1.2 g/day) for 3 months. Improvement in sperm count (p&lt;0.02) and
morphology (p&lt;0.02) occurred in all cases. Improvement in sperm motility
(p&lt;0.001) occurred in 8 of the 9 patients. </p>

<p><a name="INDICATIONS AND USAGE"></a><b>INDICATIONS AND USAGE </b></p>

<p>Mesalamine tablets are indicated for the treatment of mildly to moderately
active ulcerative colitis. </p>

<p><a name="CONTRAINDICATIONS"></a><b>CONTRAINDICATIONS </b></p>

<p>Mesalamine tablets are contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity
to salicylates or to any of the components of the Mesalamine tablet. </p>

<p><a name="PRECAUTIONS"></a><b>PRECAUTIONS </b></p>

<p>GENERAL: Patients with pyloric stenosis may have prolonged gastric retention
of Mesalamine tablets which could delay release of mesalamine in the colon.
Exacerbation of the symptoms of colitis, thought to have been caused by
mesalamine or sulfasalazine has been reported in 3% of patients in controlled
clinical trials. This acute reaction, characterized by cramping, abdominal
pain, bloody diarrhea, and occasionally by fever, headache, malaise, pruritus,
rash, and conjunctivitis, has been reported after the initiation of Mesalamine
tablets as well as other mesalamine products. Symptoms usually abate when
Mesalamine tablets are discontinued. </p>

<p>Some patients who have experienced a hypersensitivity reaction to sulfasalazine
may have a similar reaction to Mesalamine tablets or to other compounds
which contain or are converted to mesalamine. </p>

<p>RENAL: Renal impairment, including minimal change nephropathy, and acute
and chronic interstitial nephritis, has been reported in patients taking
Mesalamine tablets as well as in patients taking other mesalamine products.
In animal studies (rats, dogs), the kidney is the principal target organ
for toxicity. At doses of approximately 750-1000 mg/kg (15-20 times the
administered recommended human dose (based on a 50 kg person) on a mg/kg
basis and 3-4 times on a mg/M(square) basis), mesalamine causes renal papillary
necrosis. THEREFORE, CAUTION SHOULD BE EXERCISED WHEN USING Mesalamine
(MESALAMINE) OR OTHER COMPOUNDS CONVERTED TO MESALAMINE OR ITS METABOLITES
IN PATIENTS WITH KNOWN RENAL DYSFUNCTION OR HISTORY OF RENAL DISEASE. IT
IS RECOMMENDED THAT ALL PATIENTS HAVE AN EVALUATION OF RENAL FUNCTION PRIOR
TO INITIATION OF Mesalamine TABLETS AND PERIODICALLY WHILE ON Mesalamine
THERAPY. </p>

<p>INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS: Patients should be instructed to swallow the
Mesalamine tablets whole, taking care not to break the outer coating. The
outer coating is designed to remain intact to protect the active ingredient
and thus ensure mesalamine availability for action in the colon. In 2-3%
of patients in clinical studies, intact or partially intact tablets have
been reported in the stool. If this occurs repeatedly, patients should
contact their physician. </p>

<p>DRUG INTERACTIONS: There are no known drug interactions. </p>

<p>CARCINOGENESIS, MUTAGENESIS, IMPAIRMENT OF FERTILITY: Long-term studies
in animals have not been performed to evaluate the carcinogenicity potential
of mesalamine. Mesalamine was not mutagenic in fluctuation assay in K.
Pneumoniae and Ames assay in S. Typhimurium. Mesalamine, at oral doses
up to 480 mg/kg/day, had no adverse effect on fertility or reproductive
performance of male and female rats. The oligospermia and infertility in
men associated with sulfasalazine have not been reported with Mesalamine
delayed- release tablets. </p>

<p>PREGNANCY: TERATOGENIC EFFECTS: Pregnancy Category B: Reproduction studies
in rats and rabbits at oral doses up to 480 mg/kg/day have revealed no
evidence of teratogenic effects or fetal toxicity due to mesalamine. There
are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women.
Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human
response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.
</p>

<p>NURSING MOTHERS: Low concentrations of mesalamine and higher concentrations
of its N-acetyl metabolite have been detected in human breast milk. While
the clinical significance of this has not been determined, caution should
be exercised when mesalamine is administered to a nursing woman. </p>

<p>PEDIATRIC USE: Safety and effectiveness of Mesalamine tablets in children
have not been established. </p>

<p>Mesalamine tablets have been evaluated in about 1830 inflammatory bowel
disease patients (most patients with ulcerative colitis) in controlled
and open-label studies. Adverse events seen in clinical trials with Mesalamine
tablets have generally been mild and reversible. In two short- term (6
weeks) placebo- controlled clinical studies involving 245 patients, 155
of whom were randomized to Mesalamine tablets, five (3.2%) of the Mesalamine
patients discontinued Mesalamine therapy because of adverse events as compared
to two (2.2%) of the placebo patients. Adverse reactions leading to withdrawal
from Mesalamine tablets included (each in one patient): diarrhea and colitis
flare; dizziness, nausea, joint pain, and headache; rash, lethargy and
constipation; dry mouth, malaise, lower back discomfort, mild disorientation,
mild indigestion and cramping; headache, nausea, malaise, aching, vomiting,
muscle cramps, a stuffy head, plugged ears, and fever. </p>

<p>Adverse events occurring at a frequency of 2% or greater in the two
short-term, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials mentioned above are
listed in Table 1 below. Overall, the incidence of adverse events seen
with Mesalamine tablets was similar to placebo. </p>

<pre>************************************************************************ 
*  ESTROGENS HAVE BEEN REPORTED TO INCREASE THE RISK TO INCREASE THE  
* 
*  RISK OF ENDOMETRIAL CARCINOMA IN POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN. THIS&nbsp;FINDING * 
*  REFERS TO ESTROGENS GIVEN WITHOUT PROGESTIN.                        * 
*  Progestins taken with estrogen drugs significantly reduce but do    * 
*  not eliminate this risk. Close clinical surveillance of all women   * 
*  taking estrogens is important. Adequate diagnostic measures,        * 
*  including endometrial sampling when indicated, should be undertaken * 
*  to rule out malignancy in all cases of undiagnosed persistent or    * 
*  recurring abnormal vaginal bleeding. There is no evidence that      * 
*  &quot;natural&quot; estrogens are more or less hazardous than &quot;synthetic&quot;     * 
*  estrogens at equiestrogenic doses.                                  * 
*  ESTROGENS/PROGESTINS SHOULD NOT BE USED DURING PREGNANCY.           * 
*  There is no indication for estrogen therapy during pregnancy or     * 
*  during the immediate postpartum period. Estrogen therapy during     * 
*  pregnancy os associated with an increased risk of congenital        * 
*  defects in the reproductive organs of the fetus, and possibly other * 
*  birth defects. Estrogens are not indicated for the prevention of    * 
*  partum breast enlargement.                                          * 
*  Studies of women who received diethylstilbestrol (DES) during       * 
*  pregnancy have shown that female offspring have an increased risk   * 
*  of vaginal adenosis, squamous cell dysplasia of the uterine cervix, * 
*  and clear cell vaginal cancer later in life. The 1985 DES Task      * 
*  Force concluded that use of DES during pregnancy is associated with * 
*  subsequent increased risk of breast cancer in the mothers, although * 
*  a casual relationship remains unproven and the observed level of    * 
*  excess risk is similar to that for a number of other breast cancer  * 
*  risk factors.                                                       * 
*  Several reports also suggest an association between intrauterine    * 
*  exposure to progestational drugs in the first trimester of          * 
*  pregnancy and genital abnormalities in male and female fetuses. The * 
*  risk of hypospadias, 5 to 8 per 1000 male births in the general     * 
*  population, may be approximately doubled with exposure to these     * 
*  drugs. There are insufficient data to quantify the risk to exposed  * 
*  female fetuses; some of these drugs induce mild virilization of the * 
*  external genitalia of the female fetus. If the patient is exposed   * 
*  to Conjugated Estrogens and Medroxyprogesterone                     *
*  during pregnancy, or if she becomes pregnant while taking           *
*  these drugs, she should be apprised of the potential risk to the    * 
*  fetus.                                                              * 
*  Estrogens are ineffective for the prevention or treatment of        * 
*  threatened or habitual abortion. There is no adequate evidence that * 
*  progestational agents are effective in preventing habitual abortion * 
*  when such drugs are given during the first trimester of pregnancy.  * 
*  Furthermore, in the vast majority of women, the cause of abortion   * 
*  is a defective ovum, which progestational agents could not be       * 
*  expected to influence. In addition, the use of progestational       * 
*  agents with their uterine-relaxant properties, in patients with     * 
*  fertilized defective ova, may cause a delay in spontaneous          * 
*  abortion.                                                           *

<p>Conjugated Estrogens and Medroxyprogesterone therapy consists of two
separate tablets: Conjugated estrogens tablets, and Medroxyprogesterone
acetate (MPA), tablets, for oral administration. </p>

<p>Conjugated Estrogens are a mixture of sodium estrone sulfate and sodium
equilin sulfate. They contain as concomitant components sodium sulfate
conjugates 17-estradiol and 17-estradiol and 17-dihydroequilin. </p>

<p>Medroxyprogesterone acetate is a derivative of progesterone. It is white
to off-white, odorless, crystalline powder, stable in air, melting between
200o C and 210o C. It is freely soluble in chloroform, soluble in acetone
and in dioxane, sparingly soluble in alcohol and in methanol, slightly
soluble in ether, and insoluble in water. </p>

<p><a name="ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY"></a><b>ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
</b></p>

<p>Estrogens are important in the development and maintenance of the female
reproductive system and secondary sex characteristics. By a direct action,
they cause growth and development of the uterus, fallopian tubes, and vagina.
With other hormones, such as pituitary hormones and progesterone, they
cause enlargement of the breasts through promotion of ductal growth, stromal
development, and the accretion of fat. </p>

<p>Estrogens are intricately involved with other hormones, especially progesterone,
in the processes of the ovulatory menstrual cycle and pregnancy and affect
the release of pituitary gonadotropins. They also contribute to the shaping
of the skeleton, maintenance of tone and elasticity of urogenital structures,
changes in the epiphyses of the long bones that allow for the pubertal
growth spurt and its termination, and pigmentation of the nipples and genitals.
</p>

<p>The use of unopposed estrogen therapy has been associated with an increased
risk of endometrial hyperplasia, a possible precursor of endometrial adenocarcinoma.
The results of clinical studies indicate that the addition of a progestin
to an estrogen replacement regimen for more than 10 days per cycle reduces
the incidence of endometrial hyperplasia and the attendant risk of adenocarcinoma
in women with intact uteri. The addition of a progestin to an estrogen
replacement regimen has not been shown to interfere with the efficacy of
estrogen replacement therapy for its approved indications. Data from a
large clinical trial indicate that MPA administered in the recommended
dose to women receiving Conjugated estrogens 0.625 mg reduces the incidence
of hyperplastic changes and hence reduces the risk of developing adenocarcinoma.
This is the clinical rationale for Conjugated Estrogens and Medroxyprogesterone.
</p>

<p>The following table summarizes the incidence of endometrial hyperplasia
after 1 year treatment with the combined regimens. (TABLE 1). </p>

conducted in a 97% Caucasian population at low risk fore cardiovascular
disease show that Conjugated Estrogens and Medroxyprogesterone increases
HDL-C and the HDL2- C subfraction significantly less than Conjugated estrogens
alone, but lower after 1 year of treatment than at baseline, the HDL/Total
Cholesterol ratio showed a significantly smaller rise with Conjugated Estrogens
and Medroxyprogesterone than with Conjugated estrogens alone. </p>

+Conjugated Estrogens/Medroxyprogesterone </pre>

<p>The pharmacologic effects of the administered conjugated estrogens are
similar to those of endogenous estrogens. In responsive tissue (female
genital organs, breasts, hypothalamus, pituitary) estrogens enter the cell
and are transported into the nucleus. As a result of the estrogen action,
specific RNA and protein synthesis occurs. </p>

<p>Androgenic and anabolic effects of MPA have been noted, but the drug
is apparently devoid of significant estrogenic activity. Parenterally administered
MPA inhibits gonadotropin production, which in turn prevents follicular
maturation and ovulation, although available data indicate that this does
not occur when the usually recommended oral dosage is given as single daily
doses. MPA may achieve its beneficial effect on the endometrium in part
by decreasing nuclear estradiol receptors and suppression of epithelial
DNA synthesis in endometrial tissue. </p>

<p>Pharmacokinetics </p>

<p>ABSORPTION: Conjugated estrogens are soluble in water and are well absorbed
from the gastrointestinal tract after release from the drug formulation.
However, Conjugated Estrogens and Medroxyprogesterone contains a modified-release
formulation of conjugated estrogens that slowly releases estrogens over
several hours. Maximum plasma concentrations of the various conjugated
and unconjugated estrogens are attained within 4 to 10 hours after dose
administration. MPA is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract,
and maximum MPA plasma concentrations are attained within 2 to 4 hours
after dose administration. </p>

<p>DISTRIBUTION: The conjugated estrogens bind mainly to albumin, but the
unconjugated estrogens bind to both albumin and sex-hormone-binding globulin
(SHBG). The apparent terminal-phase disposition half-life (t1/2) of the
various estrogens is prolonged by the slow absorption from Conjugated Estrogens
and Medroxyprogesterone and ranges from 10 to 24 hours. MPA is approximately
90% bound to plasma proteins but does not bind to SHBG. MPA has a t1/2
of 24 to 36 hours. </p>

<p>METABOLISM: Metabolism and inactivation of estrogens occur primarily
in the liver. Some estrogens are excreted into the bile; however, they
are reabsorbed from the intestine and returned to the liver through the
portal venous system. Metabolism and elimination of MPA occurs primarily
in the liver via hydroxylation, with subsequent conjugation and elimination
in the urine. </p>

<p>EXCRETION: Water-soluble estrogen conjugates are strongly acidic and
are ionized in body fluids, which favor excretion through the kidneys since
tubular reabsorption is minimal. Most metabolites of MPA are excreted as
glucuronide conjugates with only minor amounts excreted as sulfates. </p>

<p><a name="DRUG-DRUG"></a>DRUG-DRUG INTERACTIONS: Coadministration of
conjugated estrogens with MPA does not affect the pharmacokinetic profile
of MPA; similarly, MPA does not affect the pharmacokinetic profile of the
conjugated or unconjugated estrogens. </p>

<p>FOOD-DRUG INTERACTIONS: Administration with food does not affect the
pharmacokinetic profile of the conjugated or unconjugated estrogen. Administration
with food approximately doubles MPA Cmax and increases MPA AUC by approximately
30%. </p>

<p><a name="INDICATIONS AND USAGE"></a><b>INDICATIONS AND USAGE </b></p>

<p>Conjugated Estrogens and Medroxyprogesterone therapy (Conjugated estrogens
brand conjugated estrogens and Medroxyprogesterone brand of medroxyprogesterone
acetate) is indicated in women with an intact uterus for the: </p>

<p>1. Treatment of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms associated with
the menopause. There is no adequate evidence that estrogens are effective
for nervous symptoms or depression which might occur during menopause and
they should not be used to treat these conditions. </p>

<p>2. Treatment of vulvar and vaginal atrophy. </p>

<p>3. Prevention of osteoporosis. </p>

<p>Since estrogen administration is associated with risks as well as benefits,
selection of patients should ideally be based on prospective identification
of risk factors for developing osteoporosis. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, there is no certain way to identify those women who will
develop osteoporotic fractures. Most prospective studies of efficacy for
this indication have been carried out in white menopausal women, without
stratification by other risk factors, and tend to show a universally salutary
effect on bone. Thus, patient selection must be individualized based on
the balance of risks and benefits. </p>

<p>Estrogen replacement therapy reduces bone resorption and retards or
halts postmenopausal bone loss. Case-control studies have shown an approximately
60% reduction in hip and wrist fractures in women whose estrogen replacement
was begun within a few years of menopause. Studies also suggest that estrogen
reduces the rate of vertebral fractures. Even when started as late as 6
years after menopause, estrogen may prevent further loss of bone mass for
as long as the treatment is continued. When estrogen therapy is discontinued,
bone mass declines at a rate comparable to that in the immediate postmenopausal
period. There is no evidence that estrogen replacement therapy restores
bone mass to premenopausal levels. At skeletal maturity there are sex and
race differences in both the total amount of bone present and its destiny,
in favor of men and blacks. Thus, women are at higher risk than men because
they start with less bone mass and for several years following natural
or induced menopause, the rate of bone mass declined is accelerated. White
and Asian women are at higher risk than black women. </p>

<p>Early menopause is one of the strongest predictors for the development
of osteoporosis. In addition, other factors affecting the skeleton which
are associated with osteoporosis include genetic factors (small build,
family history), endocrine factors (nulliparity, thyrotoxicosis, hyperparathyroidism,
Cushing's syndrome, hyperprolactinemia, type I diabetes), life-style (cigarette
smoking, alcohol abuse, sedentary exercise habits), and nutrition (below
average body weight, dietary calcium intake). </p>

<p>The mainstays of prevention of osteoporosis are estrogen, an adequate
lifetime calcium intake, and exercise. Postmenopausal women absorb dietary
calcium less efficiently than premenopausal women and require an average
of 1500 mg/day of elemental calcium to remain in neutral calcium balance.
By comparison, premenopausal women require about 1000 mg/day and the average
calcium intake in the USA is 400-600 mg/day. Therefore, when not contraindicated,
calcium supplementation may be helpful. </p>

<p>Weight-bearing exercise and nutrition may be important adjuncts to the
prevention and management of osteoporosis. Immobilization and prolonged
bed rest produce rapid bone loss, while weight-bearing exercise has been
shown both to reduce bone less and to increase bone mass. The optimal type
and amount of physical activity that would prevent osteoporosis have not
been established; however, in two studies an hour of walking and running
exercises two or three times weekly significantly increased lumbar spine
bone mass. </p>

<p><a name="CONTRAINDICATIONS"></a><b>CONTRAINDICATIONS </b></p>

<p>Estrogens/progestins combined should not be used in women under any
of the following conditions or circumstances: </p>

<p>1. Known or suspected pregnancy, including use for missed abortion or
as a diagnostic test for pregnancy (see BOXED WARNING). Estrogen or progestin
may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. </p>

<p>2. Known or suspected cancer of the breast. </p>

<p>3. Known or suspected estrogen-dependent neoplasia. </p>

<p>4. Undiagnosed abnormal genital bleeding. </p>

<p>5. Active or past history of thrombophlebitis, thromboembolic disorders,
or stroke. </p>

<p>6. Liver dysfunction or disease. </p>

<p>Conjugated Estrogens and Medroxyprogesterone therapy should not be used
in patients hypersensitive to the ingredients contained in Conjugated estrogens
or Medroxyprogesterone. </p>

<p><a name="WARNINGS"></a><b>WARNINGS &nbsp; </b></p>

<p>ALL WARNINGS BELOW PERTAIN TO THE USE OF THIS COMBINATION PRODUCT. </p>

<p>Based on experience with estrogens and/or progestins: </p>

<p>1. Induction of malignant neoplasms </p>

<p>Breast cancer. Some studies have reported a moderately increased risk
of breast cancer (relative risk of 1.3 to 2.0) in those women of estrogen
replacement therapy taking higher doses, or in those taking lower doses
for prolonged periods of time, especially in excess of 10 years. The majority
of studies, however, have not shown an association in women who have ever
used estrogen replacement therapy. </p>

<p>The effect of added progestin on the risk of breast cancer in unknown,
although a moderately increased risk in those taking combination estrogen/progestin
therapy has been reported. Other studies have not shown this relationship.
In a one year clinical trials of Conjugated Estrogens and Medroxyprogesterone
and Conjugated estrogens alone, 5 new cases of breast cancer were detected
among 1377 women who received the combination treatments, while no new
cases were detected among 347 women who received Conjugated estrogens alone.
The overall incidence of breast cancer in this clinical trial does not
exceed that expected in the general population. </p>

<p>Women on hormone replacement therapy should have regular breast examinations
and should be instructed in breast self-examination, and women over the
age of 50 should have regular mammograms. Endometrial cancer. The reported
endometrial cancer risk among users unopposed estrogen was about 2- to
12-fold or greater than in nonusers and appears dependent on duration of
treatment and on estrogen dose. There is no significant increased risk
associated with use of estrogens for less than one year. The greatest risk
appears associated with prolonged use, with increased risks of 15- to 24-fold
for five years or more. In one study, a significant decrease in the incidence
of endometrial cancer occurred six months after estrogen withdrawal. </p>

<p>A large clinical trial has demonstrated that when MPA is administered
with Conjugated estrogens, there is a markedly reduced incidence of endometrial
hyperplasia, a possible precursor of endometrial cancer. Endometrial hyperplasia
has been reported in a large clinical trial to occur at a rate of approximately
1% or less with Conjugated Estrogens and Medroxyprogesterone. Studies have
also demonstrated a reduced risk of endometrial cancer when a progestin
is administered with estrogen replacement therapy. In the large clinical
trial described above, only a single case of endometrial cancer was reported
to occur among women taking combination Conjugated estrogens/MPA therapy.
</p>

<p>Clinical surveillance of all women taking estrogen/progestin combinations
is important. Adequate diagnostic measures, including endometrial sampling
when indicated, should be undertaken to rule out malignancy in all cases
of undiagnosed persistent or recurring abnormal vaginal bleeding. </p>

<p>2. Cardiovascular disease. Large doses of estrogens (5 mg conjugated
estrogens per day), comparable to those used to treat cancer of the prostate
and breast, have been shown in large prospective clinical trial in men
to increase the risk of nonfatal myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism,
and thrombophlebitis. These risks cannot necessarily be extrapolated from
men to women or from unopposed estrogen to combination estrogen/progestin
therapy. However, to avoid the theoretical cardiovascular risk to women
caused by high estrogen doses, the dose for estrogen replacement therapy
should not exceed the lowest effective dose. </p>

<p>3. Effects during pregnancy. Use in pregnancy is not recommended. See
BOXED WARNING. </p>

<p>4. Gallbladder disease. Two studies have reported a 2- to 4-fold increase
in the risk of surgically confirmed gallbladder disease in women receiving
postmenopausal estrogens. In a large clinical trial, 5 of 1029 subjects
taking Conjugated estrogens/Medroxyprogesterone at doses comparable to
Conjugated Estrogens and Medroxyprogesterone developed cholecystitis with
cholelithiasis that required cholecystectomy. </p>

<p>5. Elevated blood pressure. Occasional blood pressure increases during
estrogen replacement therapy have been attributed to idiosyncratic reactions
to estrogens. More often, blood pressure has remained the same or has dropped.
One study showed that postmenopausal estrogen users have higher blood pressure
than nonusers. In a large clinical trial, transient elevations from baseline
of 40 mm Hg or more systolic and 20 mm Hg or more diastolic were reported
in less than 2% and 4% of postmenopausal subjects, respectively. Two other
studies showed slightly lower blood pressure among estrogen users compared
to nonusers. Postmenopausal estrogen use does not increase the risk of
stroke. Nonetheless, blood pressure should be monitored at regular intervals
with estrogen use. 6. Hypercalcemia. Administration of estrogens may lead
to severe hypercalcemia in patients with breast cancer and bone metastases.
If this occurs, the drugs should be stopped and appropriate measures taken
to reduce the serum calcium level. </p>

<p>7. Thromboembolic disorders. The physician should be alert to the earliest
manifestations of thrombotic disorders (thrombophlebitis, cerebrovascular
disorders, pulmonary embolism, and retinal thrombosis). Should any of these
occur or be suspected, the drugs should be discontinued immediately. </p>

<p>8. Visual abnormalities. Discontinue medication pending examination
if there is sudden partial or complete loss of vision, or a sudden onset
of proptosis, diplopia, or migraine. If examinations reveals papilledema
or retinal vascular lesions, medication should be withdrawn. </p>

<p><a name="PRECAUTIONS"></a><b>PRECAUTIONS </b></p>

<p>GENERAL: Based on experience with estrogens and/or progestins: </p>

<p>1. Cardiovascular risk. A casual relationship between estrogen replacement
therapy and reduction of cardiovascular disease in postmenopausal women
has not been proven. Furthermore, the effect of added progestins on this
putative benefit is not yet known. </p>

<p>In recent years many published studies have suggested that there may
be a cause-effect relationship between postmenopausal oral estrogen replacement
therapy without added progestins and a decrease in cardiovascular disease
in women. Although most of the observational studies which assessed this
statistical association have reported a 20% to 50% reduction in coronary
heart disease risk and associated mortality in estrogen takers, the following
should be considered when interpreting these reports. </p>

<p>Because only one of these studies was randomized and it was too small
to yield statistically significant results, all relevant studies were subject
to selection bias. Thus, the apparently reduced risk of coronary artery
disease cannot be attributed with certainty to estrogen replacement therapy.
It may instead have been caused by life-style and medical characteristics
of the women studied with the result that healthier women were selected
for estrogen therapy. In general, treated women were of higher socioeconomic
and educational status, more slender, more physically active, more likely
to have undergone surgical menopause, and less likely to have diabetes
than the untreated women. Although some studies attempted to control for
these selection factors, it is common for properly designed randomized
trials to fail to confirm benefits suggested by less rigorous study designs.
Thus, ongoing and future large- scale randomized trials may fail to confirm
this apparent benefit. </p>

<p>Current medical practice often includes the use of concomitant progestin
therapy in women with intact uteri. While the effects of added progestins
on the risk of ischemic heart disease are not known, medroxyprogesterone
acetate at the dose in Conjugated Estrogens and Medroxyprogesterone attenuates
much of the favorable effect of conjugated estrogens on LDL levels (see
CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY). </p>

<p>While the effects of added progestins on the risk of breast cancer are
also unknown, available epidemiologic evidence suggests that progestins
do not reduce, and may enhance, the moderately increased breast cancer
risk that had been reported with prolonged estrogen replacement therapy
(see WARNINGS). </p>

<p>The safety data regarding Conjugated Estrogens and Medroxyprogesterone
were obtained from clinical trials and epidemiologic studies of postmenopausal
Caucasian women, who were at generally low risk for cardiovascular disease
and higher than average risk for osteoporosis. The safety profile of Conjugated
Estrogens and Medroxyprogesteron derived from these study demographic composition.
When considering prescribing Conjugated Estrogens and Medroxyprogesterone,
physicians are advised to weigh the potential benefits and risks of therapy
as applicable to each individual patient. </p>

<p>2. Use in hysterectomized women. Existing data do not support the use
of the combination of estrogen and progestin in postmenopausal women without
a uterus. There are possible risks which may be associated with the inclusion
of progestin in estrogen, replacement regimens. The potential risks include
some deterioration in glucose tolerance, as reported in a large clinical
trial of Conjugated Estrogens and Medroxyprogesterone/, and adverse effects
on lipid metabolism as compared to the lipid effects of Conjugated estrogens
alone (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY). </p>

<p>3. Physical examination. A complete medical and family history should
be taken prior to the initiation of any estrogen/progestin therapy. The
pretreatment and periodic physical examinations should include special
reference to blood pressure, breasts, abdomen, and pelvic organs, and should
include a Papanicolaou smear. As a general rule, estrogen should not be
prescribed for longer than one year without another physical examination
being performed. </p>

<p>4. Fluid retention. Because estrogens/progestins may cause some degree
of fluid retention, conditions which might be influenced by this factor,
such as asthma, epilepsy, migraine, and cardiac or renal dysfunction, require
careful observation. </p>

<p>5. Uterine bleeding. Certain patients may develop abnormal uterine bleeding.
In cases of undiagnosed abnormal bleeding, adequate diagnostic measures
are indicated. (see WARNINGS). </p>

<p>6. The pathologist should be advised of estrogen/progestin therapy when
relevant specimens are submitted. </p>

<p>Based on experience with estrogens: </p>

<p>1. Familial hyperlipoproteinemia. Estrogen therapy may be associated
with massive elevations of plasma triglycerides leading to pancreatitis
and other complications in patients with familial defects of lipoprotein
metabolism. </p>

<p>2. Hypercoagulability. Some studies have shown that women taking estrogen
replacement therapy have hypercoagulability primarily related to decreased
antithrombin activity. This effect appears dose- and duration- dependent
and is less pronounced than that associated with oral contraceptive use.
Also, postmenopausal women tend to have changes in levels of coagulation
parameters at baseline compared to premenopausal women, although the majority
of studies (of primarily conjugated estrogens users) report no such increase.
There is insufficient information on hypercoagulability in women who have
had previous thromboembolic disease. In a large clinical trial of Conjugated
Estrogens and Medroxyprogesterone, factors VII and X concentrations and
plasminogen activity increased by 20%, 13%, and 14% over baseline, respectively,
and antithrombin III activity decreased approximately 5% from baseline.
</p>

<p>3. Mastodynia. Certain patients may develop undesirable manifestations
of estrogenic stimulation such as mastodynia. In a large clinical trial
of Conjugated Estrogens and Medroxyprogesterone, approximately one third
of the subjects reported breast pain during treatment with Conjugated Estrogens
and Medroxyprogesterone, versus 12% for Conjugated estrogens alone. Based
on experience with progestins: </p>

<p>1. Lipoprotein metabolism. See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY. </p>

<p>2. Impaired glucose tolerance. See Use in hysterectomized women, above.
</p>

<p>3. Depression. Patients who have a history of depression should be observed
and the drugs discontinued if the depression recurs to a serious degree.
</p>

<p>Information For The Patient: </p>

<p>Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions: </p>

<p>1. Accelerated prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, and platelet
aggregation time; increased platelet count; increased factors II, VII antigen,
VIII coagulant activity, IX, X, XII, VII-X complex, II- VII-X complex,
and beta-thromboglobulin; decreased levels of anti-factor Xa and antithrombin
III decreased antithrombin III activity; increased levels of fibrinogen
and fibrinogen activity; increased plasminogen antigen and activity. </p>

<p>2. Increased thyroid-binding globulin (TBG) leading to increased circulating
total thyroid hormone, as measured by protein-bound iodine (PBI), T4 levels
(by column or by radioimmunoassay) or T3 by radioimmunoassay. T3 resin
uptake is decreased, reflecting the elevated TBG. Free T4 and free T3 concentrations
are unaltered. </p>

<p>3. Other binding proteins may be elevated in serum, i.e., corticosteroid
binding globulin (CBG), sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), leading to
increased circulating corticosteroids and sex steroids respectively. Free
or biologically active hormone concentrations are unchanged. Other plasma
proteins may be increased (angiotensinogen/renin substrated, alpha-1- antitrypsin,
ceruloplasmin). </p>

<p>4. Increased plasma HDL and HDL-2 subfraction concentrations, reduced
LDL cholesterol concentration, increased triglycerides levels. </p>

<p>5. Impaired glucose tolerance. For this reason, diabetic patients should
be carefully observed while receiving estrogen/progestin therapy. </p>

<p>6. Reduced response to metyrapone test. </p>

<p>7. Reduced serum folate concentration. </p>

<p>8. Aminoglutethimide administered concomitantly with MPA may significantly
depress the bioavailability of MPA. </p>

<p>Mutagenesis and Carcinogenesis: In a two-year oral study in which female
rats were exposed to dosages of up to 5000 &amp;181g/kg/day in their diets
(50 times higher-based on AUC values-than the level observed experimentally
in women taking 10 mg of MPA), a dose-related increase in pancreatic islet
cell tumors (adenomas and carcinomas) occurred. Pancreatic tumor incidence
increased at 1000 and 5000 &amp;181g/kg/day, but not at 200 &amp;181g/kg/day.
</p>

<p>A decreased incidence of spontaneous mammary gland tumors was observed
in all three MPA-treated groups, compared to controls, in the two-year
rat study. The mechanism for the decreased incidence of mammary gland tumors
observed in the MPA-treated rats may be linked to the significant decrease
in serum prolactin concentration observed in rats. </p>

<p>Beagle dogs treated with MPA developed mammary nodules, some of which
were malignant. Although nodules occasionally appeared in control animals,
they are intermittent in nature, whereas the nodules in the drug-treated
animals were larger, more numerous, persistent, and there were some breast
malignancies with metastases. It is known that progestogens stimulate synthesis
and release growth hormone in dogs. The growth hormone, along progestogen,
stimulates mammary growth and tumors. In contrast, growth hormone in humans
is not increased, nor does growth hormone have any significant mammotrophic
role. Therefore, the MPA- induced increase of mammary tumors in dogs probably
has no significance to humans. No pancreatic tumors occurred in dogs. </p>

<p>Pregnancy Category X: Estrogens/progestins should not be used during
pregnancy. See CONTRAINDICATIONS and BOXED WARNING. </p>

<p>Nursing Mothers: As a general principle, the administration of any drug
to nursing mothers should be done only when clearly necessary since many
drugs are excreted in human milk. Estrogen administration to nursing mothers
has been shown to decrease the quantity and quality of the milk. Detectable
amounts of progestin have been identified in the milk of mothers receiving
the drug. The effect of this on the nursing infant has not been determined.

<p><a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><b>DESCRIPTION </b></p>

<p>Ofloxacin is a synthetic broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent for oral
administration. Chemically, ofloxacin, a fluorinated carboxyquinolone,
is the racemate, (+/- )-9-fluoro-2,3-dihydro-3- methyl-10-(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl)
-7-oxo-7H-pyrido(1,2,3-de)-1,4-benzoxazine-6 carboxylic acid. </p>

<p>Its empirical formula is C18H20FN3O4, and its molecular weight is 361.4.
Ofloxacin is an off-white to pale yellow crystalline powder. The molecule
exists as a zwitterion at the pH conditions in the small intestine. The
relative solubility characteristics of ofloxacin at room temperature, as
defined by USP nomenclature, indicate that ofloxacin is considered to be
Soluble in aqueous solutions with pH between 2 and 5. It is Sparingly to
Slightly Soluble in aqueous solutions with pH 7 and Freely Soluble in aqueous
solutions with pH above 9. Ofloxacin has the potential to form stable coordination
compounds with many metal ions. This In Vitro chelation potential has the
following formation order: Fe+3&gt;Al+3&gt; Cu+2&gt;Ni+2&gt;Pb+2&gt;Zn+2&gt;Mg+2&gt;Ca+2&gt;Ba+2.
</p>

<p><a name="ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY"></a><b>ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
</b></p>

<p>Following oral administration, the bioavailability of ofloxacin in the
tablet formulation is approximately 98%. Maximum serum concentrations are
achieved one to two hours after an oral dose. Absorption of ofloxacin after
single or multiple doses of 200 to 400 mg is predictable, and the amount
of drug absorbed increases proportionately with the dose. </p>

<p>Ofloxacin has biphasic elimination. Following multiple oral doses at
steady state administration, the half-lives are approximately 4-5 hours
and 20-25 hours. However, the longer half-life represents less than 5%
of the total AUC. Accumulation at steady-state can be estimated using a
half-life of 9 hours. The total clearance and volume of distribution are
approximately similar after single or multiple doses. Elimination is mainly
by renal excretion. The following are mean peak serum concentrations in
healthy 70-80 kg male volunteers after single oral doses of 200, 300, or
400 mg of ofloxacin or after multiple oral doses of 400 mg. </p>

<pre>                                SERUM                         AREA UNDER        
                                CONCENTRATION                 THE CURVE         
                                2 HOURS AFTER ADMIN.          (AUC(0-)          
ORAL DOSE                       (MCGM/ML)                     (MCGM.H/ML)       
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------   
200 mg single dose              1.5                           14.1              
300 mg single dose              2.4                           21.2              
400 mg single dose              2.9                           31.4              
400 mg steady state             4.6                           61.0              
----------------------------------------------------------------------------- </pre>

<p>Steady-state concentrations were attained after four oral doses and
the area under the curve (AUC) was approximately, 40% higher than the AUC
after single doses. Therefore, after multiple-dose administration of 200
mg and 300 mg doses peak serum levels of 2.2 mcgm/mL and 3.6 mcgm/mL, respectively,
are predicted at steady-state. </p>

<p>In Vitro, approximately 32% of the drug in plasma is protein bound.
</p>

<p>The single dose and steady-state plasma profiles of ofloxacin injection
were comparable in extent of exposure (AUC) to those of ofloxacin tablets
when the injectable and tablet formulations of ofloxacin were administered
in equal doses (mg/mg) to the same group of subjects. The mean steady state
AUC(0-12) attained after the intravenous administration of 400 mg over
60 min was 43.5 mcgm.h/mL; the mean steady state AUC(0-12) attained after
the oral administration of 400 mg was 41.2 mcgm.h/mL (two one-sided t-test,
90% confidence interval was 103-109). </p>

<p>Between 0 and 6 h following the administration of a single 200 mg oral
dose of ofloxacin to 12 healthy volunteers, the average urine ofloxacin
concentration was approximately 220 mcgm/mL. Between 12 and 24 hours after
administration, the average urine ofloxacin level was approximately 34
mcgm/mL. </p>

<p>Following oral administration of recommended therapeutic doses, ofloxacin
has been detected in blister fluid, cervix, lung tissue, ovary, prostatic
fluid, prostatic tissue, skin, and sputum. The mean concentration of ofloxacin
in each of these various body fluids and tissues after one or more doses
was 0.8 to 1.5 times the concurrent plasma level. Inadequate data are presently
available on the distribution or levels of ofloxacin in the cerebrospinal
fluid or brain tissue. </p>

<p>Ofloxacin has a pyridobenzoxazine ring that appears to decrease the
extent of parent compound metabolism. Between 65% and 80% of the administered
oral dose of ofloxacin is excreted unchanged via the kidneys within 48
hours of dosing. Studies indicate that less than 5% of an administered
dose is recovered in the urine as the desmethyl or N-oxide metabolites.
Four to eight percent of an ofloxacin dose is excreted in the feces. This
indicates a small degree of biliary excretion of ofloxacin. </p>

<p>The effect that food has on the absorption of ofloxacin tablets has
not been studied. </p>

<p>Following the administration of oral doses of ofloxacin to healthy elderly
volunteers (64-74 years of age) with normal renal function, the apparent
half- life of ofloxacin was 7 to 8 hours, as compared to approximately
6 hours in younger adults. Drug absorption, however, appears to be unaffected
by age. </p>

<p>Clearance of ofloxacin is reduced in patients with impaired renal function
(creatinine clearance rate &lt; or =50 mL/min), and dosage adjustment is
necessary. (See PRECAUTIONS: GENERAL And DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION.) </p>

<p>MICROBIOLOGY </p>

<p>Ofloxacin has In Vitro activity against a broad-spectrum of gram-positive
and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Ofloxacin is often bactericidal
at concentrations equal to or slightly greater than inhibitory concentrations.
Ofloxacin is thought to exert a bactericidal effect on susceptible micro-
organisms by inhibiting DNA gyrase, an essential enzyme that is a critical
catalyst in the duplication, transcription, and repair of bacterial DNA.
</p>

<p>Ofloxacin has been shown to be active against most strains of the following
organisms both In Vitro and in specific clinical infections: (See INDICATIONS
AND USAGE.) </p>

<pre>Chlamydia Trachomatis 
 
Citrobacter Diversus 
 
Enterobacter Aerogenes 
 
Escherichia Coli 
 
Haemophilus Influenzae 
 
Klebsiella Pneumoniae 
 
Neisseria Gonorrhoeae 
 
Proteus Mirabilis 
 
Pseudomonas Aeruginosa 
 
Staphylococcus Aureus 
 
Streptococcus Aureus 
 
Streptococcus Pneumoniae 
 
Streptococcus Pyogenes </pre>

<p>The following In Vitro data are available; HOWEVER, THEIR CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE
IS UNKNOWN. </p>

<p>Ofloxacin exhibits In Vitro minimum inhibitory concentrations of 2 mcgm/mL
or less against most strains of the following organisms; however, the safety
and effectiveness of ofloxacin in treating clinical infections due to these
organisms have not been established in adequate and well-controlled trials:
</p>

<p>Many strains of other streptococcal species, Enterococcus species, and
anaerobes are resistant to ofloxacin. </p>

<p>Ofloxacin has not been shown to be active against Treponema Pallidum.
(See WARNINGS.) </p>

<p>Resistance to ofloxacin due to spontaneous mutation In Vitro is a rare
occurrence (range: 10-9 to 10-11). To date, emergence of resistance has
been relatively uncommon in clinical practice. With the exception of Pseudomonas
Aeruginosa (10%), less than a 4% rate of resistance emergence has been
reported for most other species. Although cross-resistance has been observed
between ofloxacin and other fluoroquinolones, some organisms resistant
to other quinolones may be susceptible to ofloxacin. </p>

<p>SUSCEPTIBILITY TESTS </p>

<p>DIFFUSION TECHNIQUES: Quantitative methods that require measurement
of zone diameters give the most precise estimate of the susceptibility
of bacteria to antimicrobial agents. One such standardized procedure (REF.
1) that has been recommended for use with disks to test the susceptibility
of organisms to ofloxacin uses the 5-mcgm ofloxacin disk. Interpretation
involves correlation of the diameter obtained in the disk test with the
minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for ofloxacin. </p>

<p>Reports from the laboratory giving results of the standard single-disk
susceptibility test with a 5-mcgm ofloxacin disk should be interpreted
according to the following criteria: </p>

<pre>ZONE DIAMETER (MM)                                 INTERPRETATION               
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------   
&gt;/=16                                              Susceptible                  
13-15                                              Intermediate

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------   </pre>

<p>A report of &quot;Susceptible&quot; indicates that the pathogen is likely
to be inhibited by generally achievable drug concentrations. A report of
&quot;Intermediate&quot; indicates that the result should be considered
equivocal, and, if the organism is not fully susceptible to alternative,
clinically feasible drugs, the test should be repeated. This category provides
a buffer zone that prevents small uncontrolled technical factors from causing
major discrepancies in interpretation. A report of &quot;Resistant&quot;
indicates that achievable drug concentrations are unlikely to be inhibitory,
and other therapy should be selected. </p>

<p>Standardized susceptibility test procedures require the use of laboratory
control organisms. The 5-mcgm ofloxacin disk should give the following
zone diameters: </p>

DILUTION TECHNIQUES: Use a standardized dilution method (REF. 2) (broth, agar,
or microdilution) or equivalent with ofloxacin powder. The MIC values obtained
should be interpreted according to the following criteria:

<p>*--Although treatment of infections due to this organism in this infection
demonstrated a clinically acceptable overall outcome, efficacy was demonstrated
in fewer than 10 infections. </p>

<p>Appropriate culture and susceptibility tests should be performed before
treatment in order to isolate and identify organisms causing the infection
and to determine their susceptibility to ofloxacin. Therapy with ofloxacin
may be initiated before results of these tests are known; once results
become available, appropriate therapy should be continued. </p>

<p>As with other drugs in this class, some strains of Pseudomonas Aeruginosa
may develop resistance fairly rapidly during treatment with ofloxacin.
Culture and susceptibility testing performed periodically during therapy
will provide information not only on the therapeutic effect of the antimicrobial
agent but also on the possible emergence of bacterial resistance. </p>

<p>If anaerobic organisms are suspected of contributing to the infection,
appropriate therapy for anaerobic pathogens should be administered. </p>

<p><a name="CONTRAINDICATIONS"></a><b>CONTRAINDICATIONS </b></p>

<p>Ofloxacin is contraindicated in persons with a history of hypersensitivity
to ofloxacin or members of the quinolone group of antimicrobial agents.
</p>

<p><a name="WARNINGS"></a><b>WARNINGS </b></p>

<p>THE SAFETY AND EFFICACY OF OFLOXACIN IN CHILDREN, ADOLESCENTS (UNDER
THE AGE OF 18 YEARS), PREGNANT WOMEN, AND LACTATING WOMEN HAVE NOT BEEN
ESTABLISHED. (SEE PEDIATRIC USE, USE IN PREGNANCY, AND NURSING MOTHERS
SUBSECTIONS IN THE PRECAUTIONS SECTION.) </p>

<p>In the immature rat, the oral administration of ofloxacin at 5 to 16
times the recommended maximum human dose based on mg/kg or 1-3 times based
on mg/m(square) increased the incidence and severity of osteochondrosis.
The lesions did not regress after 13 weeks of drug withdrawal. Other quinolones
also produce similar erosions in the weight-bearing joints and other signs
of arthropathy in immature animals of various species. (See ANIMAL PHARMACOLOGY.)
</p>

<p>OFLOXACIN HAS NOT BEEN SHOWN TO BE EFFECTIVE IN THE TREATMENT OF SYPHILIS.
Antimicrobial agents used in high doses for short periods of time to treat
gonorrhea may mask or delay the symptoms of incubating syphilis. All patients
with gonorrhea should have a serologic test for syphilis at the time of
diagnosis. Patients treated with ofloxacin should have a follow-up serologic
test for syphilis after three months. </p>

<p>Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic/anaphylactoid)
reactions have been reported in patients receiving therapy with quinolones,
including ofloxacin. These reactions often occur following the first dose.
Some reactions were accompanied by cardiovascular collapse, hypotension/shock,
seizure, loss of consciousness, tingling, angioedema (including tongue,
laryngeal, throat or facial edema/swelling, etc.), airway obstruction (including
bronchospasm, shortness of breath and acute respiratory distress), dyspnea,
urticaria/hives, itching, and other serious skin reactions. A few patients
had a history of hypersensitivity reactions. The drug should be discontinued
immediately at the first appearance of a skin rash or any other sign of
hypersensitivity. Serious acute hypersensitivity reactions may require
treatment with epinephrine and other resuscitative measures, including
oxygen, intravenous fluids, antihistamines, corticosteroids, pressor amines,
and airway management, as clinically indicated. (See PRECAUTIONS and ADVERSE
REACTIONS.) </p>

<p>Serious and sometimes fatal events of uncertain etiology have been reported
in patients receiving therapy with quinolones including, extremely rarely,
ofloxacin. These events may be severe and generally occur following the
administration of multiple doses. Clinical manifestations may include one
or more of the following: fever, rash or severe dermatologic reactions
(e.g., toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, etc.); vasculitis,
arthralgia, myalgia, serum sickness; allergic pneumonitis; interstitial
nephritis, acute renal insufficiency/failure; hepatitis, jaundice, acute
hepatic necrosis/failure; anemia including hemolytic and aplastic, thrombocytopenia,
including thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, leukopenia, agranulocytosis,
pancytopenia, and/or other hematologic abnormalities. The drug should be
discontinued immediately at the first appearance of a skin rash or any
other sign or hypersensitivity and supportive measures instituted. (See
PRECAUTIONS: INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS and ADVERSE REACTIONS.) </p>

<p>Convulsions, increased intracranial pressure, and toxic psychosis have
been reported in patients receiving quinolones, including ofloxacin. Quinolones,
including ofloxacin, may also cause central nervous system stimulation
which may lead to: tremors, restlessness/agitation, nervousness/anxiety,
lightheadedness, confusion, hallucinations, paranoia and depression, nightmares
insomnia, and rarely suicidal thoughts or acts. These reactions may occur
following the first dose. If these reactions occur in patients receiving
ofloxacin, the drug should be discontinued and appropriate measures instituted.
As with all quinolones, ofloxacin should be used with caution in patients
with a known or suspected CNS disorder that may predispose to seizures
or lower the seizure threshold (e.g., severe cerebral arteriosclerosis,
epilepsy, etc.) or in the presence of other risk factors that may predispose
to seizures or lower the seizure threshold (e.g., certain drug therapy,
renal dysfunction, etc.). (See PRECAUTIONS: GENERAL, DRUG INTERACTIONS
and ADVERSE REACTIONS.) </p>

<p>PSEUDOMEMBRANOUS COLITIS HAS BEEN REPORTED WITH NEARLY ALL ANTIBACTERIAL
AGENTS INCLUDING OFLOXACIN, AND MAY RANGE IN SEVERITY FROM MILD TO LIFE-THREATENING.
THEREFORE, IT IS IMPORTANT TO CONSIDER THIS DIAGNOSIS IN PATIENTS WHO PRESENT
WITH DIARRHEA SUBSEQUENT TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF ANY ANTIBACTERIAL AGENTS.
</p>

<p>Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon
and may permit overgrowth of clostridia. Studies indicate a toxin produced
by Clostridium Difficile is one primary cause of &quot;antibiotic-associated
colitis&quot;. </p>

<p>After the diagnosis of pseudomembranous colitis has been established,
therapeutic measures should be initiated. Mild cases of pseudomembranous
colitis usually respond to drug discontinuation alone. In moderate to severe
cases, consideration should be given to management with fluids and electrolytes
protein supplementation, and treatment with an antibacterial drug clinically
effective against C. Difficile colitis. (See ADVERSE REACTIONS.) </p>

<p><a name="PRECAUTIONS"></a><b>PRECAUTIONS </b></p>

<p>GENERAL: </p>

<p>Adequate hydration of patients receiving ofloxacin should be maintained
to prevent the formation of a highly concentrated urine. </p>

<p>Administer ofloxacin with caution in the presence of renal or hepatic
insufficiency/impairment. In patients with known or suspected renal or
hepatic insufficiency/impairment, careful clinical observation and appropriate
laboratory studies should be performed prior to and during therapy since
elimination of ofloxacin may be reduced. In patients with impaired renal
function (creatinine clearance &lt; or =50 mg/mL), alteration of the dosage
regimen is necessary. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION.)
</p>

<p>Moderate to severe phototoxicity reactions have been observed in patients
exposed to direct sunlight while receiving some drugs in this class, including
ofloxacin. Excessive sunlight should be avoided. Therapy should be discontinued
if phototoxicity (e.g., a skin eruption, etc.) occurs. </p>

<p>As with all quinolones, ofloxacin should be used with caution in any
patient with a known or suspected CNS disorder that may predispose to seizures
or lower the seizure threshold (e.g., severe cerebral arteriosclerosis,
epilepsy, etc.) or in the presence of other risk factors that may predispose
to seizures or lower the seizure threshold (e.g., certain drug therapy,
renal dysfunction, etc.). (See WARNINGS and DRUG INTERACTIONS.) </p>

<p>As with other quinolones, disturbances of blood glucose, including symptomatic
hyper- and hypoglycemia, have been reported, usually in diabetic patients
receiving concomitant treatment with an oral hypoglycemic agent (e.g.,
glyburide/glibenclamide, etc.) or with insulin. In these patients careful
monitoring of blood glucose is recommended. If a hypoglycemic reaction
occurs in a patient being treated with ofloxacin, discontinue ofloxacin
immediately and consult a physician. (See DRUG INTERACTIONS and ADVERSE
REACTIONS.) </p>

<p>As with any potent drug, periodic assessment of organ system functions,
including renal, hepatic, and hematopoietic, is advisable during prolonged
therapy. (See WARNINGS and ADVERSE REACTIONS.) </p>

<p>INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS </p>

<p>Patients should be advised: </p>

<p>--to drink fluids liberally. </p>

<p>--that mineral supplements, vitamins with iron or minerals, calcium-,
aluminum- or magnesium-based antacids or sucralfate should not be taken
within the two- hour period before or within the two-hour period after
taking ofloxacin. (See DRUG INTERACTIONS.) </p>

<p>--that ofloxacin should not be taken with food. </p>

<p>--that ofloxacin may cause neurologic adverse effects (e.g., dizziness,
lightheadedness, etc.) and that patients should know how they react to
ofloxacin before they operate an automobile or machinery or engage in activities
requiring mental alertness and coordination. (See WARNINGS and ADVERSE
REACTIONS.) </p>

<p>--that ofloxacin may be associated with hypersensitivity reactions,
even following the first dose, to discontinue the drug at the first sign
of a skin rash, hives or other skin reactions, a rapid heartbeat, difficulty
in swallowing or breathing, any swelling suggesting angioedema (e.g., swelling
of the lips, tongue, face; tightness of the throat, hoarseness, etc.),
or any other symptom of an allergic reaction. (See WARNINGS and ADVERSE
REACTIONS.) </p>

<p>--to avoid excessive sunlight or artificial ultraviolet light while
receiving ofloxacin and to discontinue therapy if phototoxicity (e.g.,
skin eruption, etc.) occurs. </p>

<p>--that if they are diabetic and are being treated with insulin or an
oral hypoglycemic drug, to discontinue ofloxacin immediately if a hypoglycemic
reaction occurs and consult a physician. (See PRECAUTIONS: GENERAL and
DRUG INTERACTIONS.) </p>

<p>DRUG INTERACTIONS </p>

<p>Antacids, Sucralfate, Metal Cations, Multi-Vitamins: Quinolones form
chelates with alkaline earth and transition metal cations. Administration
of quinolones with antacids containing calcium, magnesium, or aluminum,
with sucralfate, with divalent or trivalent cations such as iron, or with
multivitamins containing zinc may substantially interfere with the absorption
of quinolones resulting in systemic levels considerably lower than desired.
These agents should not be taken within the two-hour period before or within
the two-hour period after ofloxacin administration. (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION.)
</p>

<p>Caffeine: Interactions between ofloxacin and caffeine have not been
detected. </p>

<p>Cimetidine: Cimetidine has demonstrated interference with the elimination
of some quinolones. This interference has resulted in significant increases
in half-life and AUC of some quinolones. The potential for interaction
between ofloxacin and cimetidine has not been studied. </p>

<p>Cyclosporine: Elevated serum levels of cyclosporine have been reported
with concomitant use of cyclosporine with some other quinolones. The potential
for interaction between ofloxacin and cyclosporine has not been studied.
</p>

<p>Drugs Metabolized By Cytochrome P450 Enzymes: Most quinolone antimicrobial
drugs inhibit cytochrome P450 enzyme activity. This may result in a prolonged
half-life for some drugs that are also metabolized by this system (e.g.,
cyclosporine, theophylline/methylxanthines, warfarin, etc.) when co administered
with quinolones. The extent of this inhibition varies among different quinolones.
(See other DRUG INTERACTIONS.) </p>

<p>Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs: The concomitant administration
of a non- steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, with a quinolone, including
ofloxacin, may increase the risk of CNS stimulation and convulsive seizures.
(See WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS: GENERAL.) </p>

<p>Probenecid: The concomitant use of probenecid with certain other quinolones
has been reported to affect renal tubular secretion. The effect of probenecid
on the elimination of ofloxacin has not been studied. </p>

<p>Theophylline: Although concurrent administration of some quinolones
with theophylline may result in impaired elimination of theophylline, the
extent of such impairment varies among different quinolones. Steady-state
theophylline levels may increase when ofloxacin and theophylline are administered
concurrently. In a pharmacokinetic study involving 15 healthy male subjects,
steady-state peak theophylline concentration increased by an average of
approximately 9%, and the AUC increased by an average of approximately
13% when oral ofloxacin and theophylline were administered concurrently.
In clinical trials with intravenous ofloxacin, theophylline concentrations
were determined in 41 patients who were treated with both drugs. In 38
patients, no apparent elevation in the serum theophylline was discernible.
Marginal increases above the theophylline therapeutic range were reported
in three patients; clinical toxicity was, however, not reported in these
three patients. Generally, patients receiving theophylline in clinical
trials of the intravenous formulation of ofloxacin reported nausea more
frequently than those patients not receiving theophylline. As with some
other quinolones, concomitant administration of ofloxacin may prolong the
half-life of theophylline, elevate serum theophylline levels, and may increase
the risk of theophylline-related adverse reactions. Theophylline levels
should be closely monitored and theophylline dosage adjustments made, if
appropriate, when ofloxacin is co administered. </p>

<p>Warfarin: Some quinolones have been reported to enhance the effects
of the oral anticoagulant warfarin or its derivatives. Therefore, if a
quinolone antimicrobial is administered concomitantly with warfarin or
its derivatives, the prothrombin time or other suitable coagulation test
should be closely monitored. </p>

<p>Antidiabetic Agents (e.g., Insulin, Glyburide/glibenclamide, Etc.):
Since disturbances of blood glucose, including hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia,
have been reported in patients treated concurrently with quinolones and
an antidiabetic agent, careful monitoring of blood glucose is recommended
when these agents are used concomitantly (See PRECAUTIONS: GENERAL and
INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS.) </p>

<p>CARCINOGENESIS, MUTAGENESIS, IMPAIRMENT OF FERTILITY: </p>

<p>Long-term studies to determine the carcinogenic potential of ofloxacin
have not been conducted. </p>

<p>Ofloxacin was not mutagenic in the Ames bacterial test, In Vitro and
IN VIVO cytogenetic assay, sister chromatid-exchange (Chinese Hamster and
Human Cell Lines), unscheduled DNA Repair (UDS) using human fibroblasts,
dominant lethal assays, or mouse micronucleus assay. Ofloxacin was positive
in the UDS test using rat hepatocytes and Mouse Lymphoma Assay. </p>

<p>PREGNANCY: Teratogenic Effects. Pregnancy Category C. </p>

<p>Ofloxacin has not been shown to have any teratogenic effects at oral
doses as high as 810 mg/kg/day (11 times the recommended maximum human
dose based on mg/m(square) or 50 times based on mg/kg) and 160 mg/kg/day
(4 times the recommended maximum human dose based on mg/m(square) or 10
times based on mg/kg) when administered to pregnant rats and rabbits, respectively.
Additional studies in rats with oral doses up to 360 mg/kg/day (5 times
the recommended maximum human dose based on mg/m(square) or 23 times based
on mg/kg) demonstrated no adverse effect on late fetal development, labor,
delivery, lactation, neonatal viability, or growth of the newborn. Doses
equivalent to 50 and 10 times the recommended maximum human dose of ofloxacin
(based on mg/kg) were fetotoxic (i.e., decreased fetal body weight and
increased fetal mortality) in rats and rabbits, respectively. Minor skeletal
variations were reported in rats receiving doses of 810 mg/kg/day, which
is more than 10 times higher than the recommended maximum human dose based
on mg/m(square). </p>

<p>There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant
women. Ofloxacin should be used during pregnancy only if the potential
benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. (See WARNINGS.) </p>

<p>NURSING MOTHERS: </p>

<p>In lactating females, a single oral 200-mg dose of ofloxacin resulted
in concentrations of ofloxacin in milk that were similar to those found
in plasma. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions from
ofloxacin in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether the discontinue
nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance
of the drug to the mother. (See WARNINGS and ADVERSE REACTIONS.) </p>

<p>PEDIATRIC USE: </p>

<p>Safety and effectiveness in children and adolescents below the age of
18 years have not been established. Ofloxacin causes arthropathy (arthrosis)
and osteochondrosis in juvenile animals of several species. (See WARNINGS.)

received 3 grams of ofloxacin intravenously over 45 minutes. A blood sample
obtained 15 minutes after the completion of the infusion revealed an ofloxacin
level of 39.3 mcgm/mL. In 7 h, the level had fallen to 16.2 mcgm/mL, and
by 24 h to 2.7 mcgm/mL. During the infusion, the patient developed drowsiness,
nausea, dizziness, hot and cold flushes, subjective facial swelling and
numbness, slurring of speech, and mild to moderate disorientation. All
complaints except the dizziness subsided within 1 h after discontinuation
of the infusion. The dizziness, most bothersome while standing, resolved
in approximately 9 h. Laboratory testing reportedly revealed no clinically
significant changes in routine parameters in this patient. </p>

<p>In the event of acute overdose, the stomach should be emptied. The patient
should be observed and appropriate hydration maintained. Ofloxacin is not
efficiently removed by hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. </p>

<p><a name="DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION"></a><b>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Women: 0.85 X the value calculated for men.                                     
The serum creatinine should represent a steady-state of renal function. </pre>

<p>PATIENTS WITH CIRRHOSIS: </p>

<p>The excretion of ofloxacin may be reduced in patients with severe liver
function disorders (e.g., cirrhosis with or without ascites). A maximum
dose of 400 mg of ofloxacin per day should therefore not be exceeded. </p>

<p>ANIMAL PHARMACOLOGY </p>

<p>Ofloxacin, as well as other drugs of the quinolone class, has been shown
to cause arthropathies (arthrosis) in immature dogs and rats. In addition,
these drugs are associated with an increased incidence of osteochondrosis
in rats as compared to the incidence observed in vehicle-treated rats.
(See WARNINGS.) There is no evidence of arthropathies in fully mature dogs
at intravenous doses up to 3 times the recommended maximum human dose (on
a mg/M(square) basis or 5 times based on mg/kg basis), for a one-week exposure
period. </p>

<p>Long-term, high-dose systemic use of other quinolones in experimental
animals has caused lenticular opacities; however, this finding was not
observed in any animal studies with ofloxacin. </p>

<p>Reduced serum globulin and protein levels were observed in animals treated
with other quinolones. In one ofloxacin study, minor decreases in serum
globulin and protein levels were noted in female cynomolgus monkeys dosed
orally with 40 mg/kg ofloxacin for one year. These changes, however, were
considered to be within normal limits for monkeys. </p>

<p>Crystalluria and ocular toxicity were not observed in any animals treated
with ofloxacin. </p>

<p>(SEE CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS, ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, AND
PRECAUTIONS: DRUG INTERACTIONS.) </p>

<p>Terfenadine and pseudoephedrine extended-release t ablets are available
for oral administration. Terfenadine is a histamine H1-receptor antagonist
with the chemical name alpha- (4-(1,1-Dimethylethyl)phenyl)-4-(hydroxydiphenylmethyl)-1-piperidinebutanol
(+/ ). </p>

<p>The molecular weight is 471.68. The molecular formula is C32H41NO2.
</p>

<p>Terfenadine occurs as a white to off-white crystalline powder. It is
freely soluble in chloroform, soluble in ethanol, and very slightly soluble
in water. </p>

<p>Pseudoephedrine hydrochloride is an adrenergic (vasoconstrictor) agent
with the chemical name (S-(R*,R*))-alpha-(1-(methylamino)ethyl)-benzenemethanol
hydrocholoride. </p>

<p>The molecular weight is 201.70. The molecular formula is C10H15NO.HCl.
</p>

<p>Pseudoephedrine hydrochloride occurs as fine, white to off-white crystals
or powder, having a faint characteristic odor. It is very soluble in water,
freely soluble in alcohol, and sparingly soluble in chloroform. </p>

<p><a name="ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY"></a><b>ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
</b></p>

<p>Terfenadine, a histamine H1-receptor antagonist, is chemically distinct
from other antihistamines. </p>

<p>Histamine skin wheal studies have shown that terfenadine in single and
repeated doses of 60 mg in 64 subjects has an antihistaminic effect beginning
at 1-2 hours, reaching its maximum at 3-4 hours, and lasting in excess
of 12 hours. The correlation between response on skin wheal testing and
clinical efficacy is unclear. </p>

<p>The four best controlled and largest clinical trials of terfenadine
each lasted 7 days and involved about 1,000 total patients in comparisons
of terfenadine (60 mg b.i.d.) with an active drug (chlorpheniramine, 4
mg t.i.d.; dexchlorpheniramine 2 mg t.i.d.; or clemastine 1 mg b.i.d.).
About 50-70% of terfenadine or other antihistamine recipients had moderate
to complete relief of symptoms, compared with 30-50% of placebo recipients.
The frequency of drowsiness with terfenadine was similar to the frequency
with placebo and less than with other antihistamines. In studies which
included 52 subjects in whom EEG assessments were made, no depressant effects
have been observed. Terfenadine and pseudoephedrine has not been studied
for effectiveness in relieving the symptoms of the common cold. </p>

<p>Animal studies have demonstrated that terfenadine is a histamine H1-receptor
antagonist. In these animal studies, no sedative or anticholinergic effects
were observed at effective antihistaminic doses. Radioactive disposition
and autoradiographic studies in rats and radioligand binding studies with
guinea pig brain H1-receptors indicate that, at effective antihistamine
doses, neither terfenadine nor its metabolites penetrate the blood brain
barrier well. </p>

<p>On the basis of a mass balance study using 14C labeled terfenadine the
oral absorption of terfenadine was estimated to be at least 70%. Terfenadine
itself undergoes extensive (99%) first pass metabolism to two primary metabolites,
an active acid metabolite and an inactive dealkylated metabolite. Therefore,
systemic availability of terfenadine is low under normal conditions, and
parent terfenadine is not normally detectable in plasma at levels &gt;
10 ng/mL. Although in rare cases there was measurable plasma terfenadine
in apparently normal individuals without identifiable risk factors, the
implications of this finding with respect to the variability of terfenadine
metabolism in the normal population cannot be assessed without further
study. Further studies of terfenadine metabolism in the general population
are pending. From information gained in the 14C study it appears that approximately
forty percent of the total dose is eliminated renally (40% as acid metabolite,
30% dealkyl metabolite, and 30% minor unidentified metabolites). Sixty
percent of the dose is eliminated in the feces (50% as the acid metabolite,
2% unchanged terfenadine, and the remainder as minor unidentified metabolites).
Studies investigating the effect of hepatic and renal insufficiency on
the metabolism and excretion of terfenadine are incomplete. Preliminary
information indicates that in cases of hepatic impairment, significant
concentrations of unchanged terfenadine can be detected with the rate of
acid metabolite formation being decreased. A single- dose study in patients
with hepatic impairment revealed increased parent terfenadine and impaired
metabolism, suggesting that additional drug accumulation may occur after
repetitive dosing in such patients. Terfenadine is contraindicated for
use in patients with significant hepatic dysfunction. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS
and WARNINGS.) In subjects with normal hepatic function, unchanged terfenadine
plasma concentrations have not been detected. ELEVATED LEVELS OF PARENT
TERFENADINE, WHETHER DUE TO SIGNIFICANT HEPATIC DYSFUNCTION, CONCOMITANT
MEDICATIONS, OR OVERDOSE, HAVE BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH QT INTERVAL PROLONGATION
AND SERIOUS CARDIAC ADVERSE EVENTS. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS.)
In controlled clinical trials in otherwise normal patients with rhinitis,
small increases QTc interval were observed at doses of 60 mg b.i.d. In
studies at 300 mg b.i.d. a mean increase in QTc of 10% (range -4% to +30%)
(mean increase of 46 msec) was observed. </p>

<p>Data have been reported demonstrating that compared to young subjects,
elderly subjects experience a 25% reduction in clearance of the acid metabolite
after single-dose oral administration of 120 mg. Further studies are necessary
to fully characterize pharmacokinetics in the elderly. </p>

<p>In vitro studies demonstrate that terfenadine is extensively (97%) bound
to human serum protein while the acid metabolite is approximately 70% bound
to human serum protein. Based on data gathered from in vitro models of
antihistaminic activity, the acid metabolite of terfenadine has approximately
30% of the H1-blocking activity of terfenadine. The relative contribution
of terfenadine and the acid metabolite to the pharmacodynamic effects have
not been clearly defined. Since unchanged terfenadine is usually not detected
in plasma and active acid metabolite concentrations are relatively high,
the acid metabolite may be the entity responsible for the majority of efficacy
after oral administration of terfenadine. </p>

<p>In a study involving the administration of a single 60 mg terfenadine
tablet to 24 subjects, mean peak plasma levels of the acid metabolite were
263 ng/mL (range 133-423 ng/mL) and occurred approximately 2.5 hours after
dosing. Plasma concentrations of unchanged terfenadine were not detected.
The elimination profile of the acid metabolite was biphasic in nature with
an initial mean plasma half-life of 3.5 hours followed by a mean plasma
half-life of 6 hours. Ninety percent of the plasma level time curve was
associated with these half- lives. Although the elimination profile is
somewhat complex, the effective pharmacokinetic half-life can be estimated
at approximately 8.5 hours. However, receptor binding and pharmacologic
effects, both therapeutic and adverse, may persist well beyond that time.
</p>

<p>Pseudoephedrine is an orally active sympathomimetic amine and exerts
a decongestant action on the nasal mucosa. It is recognized as an effective
agent for the relief of nasal congestion due to allergic rhinitis. Pseudoephedrine
produces peripheral effects similar to those of epinephrine and central
effects similar to, but less intense than, amphetamines. It has the potential
for excitatory side effects. At the recommended oral dose it has little
or no pressor effect in normotensive adults. The serum half-life of pseudoephrine
is approximately 4 to 6 hours. The serum half-life is decreased with increased
excretion of drug at urine pH lower than 6 and may be increased with decreased
excretion at urine pH higher than 8. </p>

<p>Ingestion of food was found not to affect the absorption of pseudoephedrine
from Terfenadine and pseudoephedrine. The effect of food on the absorption
of terfenadine from Terfenadine and pseudoephedrine is not known; however,
plasma levels of active metabolite do not appear to be affected by food
administered with Terfenadine and pseudoephedrine. </p>

<p>A bioavailability study comparing Terfenadine and pseudoephedrine to
immediate-release terfenadine and immediate-release pseudoephedrine showed
that pseudoephedrine is slowly released from Terfenadine and pseudoephedrine
to permit twice daily dosage. </p>

<p><a name="INDICATIONS AND USAGE"></a><b>INDICATIONS AND USAGE </b></p>

<p>Terfenadine and pseudoephedrine is indicated for the relief of symptoms
associated with seasonal allergic rhinitis such as sneezing, rhinorrhea,
pruritus, lacrimation, and nasal congestion. It should be administered
when both the antihistaminic properties of terfenadine (terfenadine) and
the nasal decongestant activity of pseudoephedrine hydrochloride are desired
(see ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY). Terfenadine and pseudoephedrine has
not been studied for effectiveness in relieving the symptoms of the common
cold. </p>

<p><a name="CONTRAINDICATIONS"></a><b>CONTRAINDICATIONS </b></p>

<p>CONCOMITANT ADMINISTRATION OF Terfenadine and pseudoephedrine WITH KETOCONAZOLE
(NIZORAL) OR ITRACONAZOLE (SPORANOX) IS CONTRAINDICATED. Terfenadine and
pseudoephedrine IS ALSO CONTRAINDICATED IN PATIENTS WITH DISEASE STATES
OR OTHER CONCOMITANT MEDICATIONS KNOWN TO IMPAIR ITS METABOLISM, INCLUDING
SIGNIFICANT HEPATIC DYSFUNCTION, AND CONCURRENT USE OF CLARITHROMYCIN,
ERYTHROMYCIN, OR TROLEANDOMYCIN. QT PROLONGATION HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED
IN SOME PATIENTS TAKING TERFENADINE IN THESE SETTINGS, AND RARE CASES OF
SERIOUS CARDIOVASCULAR EVENTS, INCLUDING DEATH, CARDIAC ARREST, AND TORSADES
DE POINTES, HAVE BEEN REPORTED IN THESE PATIENT POPULATIONS. (See WARNINGS
and PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions.) </p>

<p>Terfenadine and pseudoephedrine is contraindicated in nursing mothers,
patients with severe hypertension or severe coronary artery disease, patients
receiving monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor therapy, and in patients with
a known hypersensitivity to any of its ingredients (see DESCRIPTION section).

<p>Terfenadine undergoes extensive metabolism in the liver by a specific
cytochrome P450 isoenzyme. This metabolic pathway may be impaired in patients
with hepatic dysfunction (alcoholic cirrhosis, hepatitis) or who are taking
drugs such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, or clarithromycin, erythromycin,
or troleandomycin (macrolide antibiotics), or other potent inhibitors of
this isoenzyme. Interference with this metabolism can lead to elevated
terfenadine plasma levels associated with QT prolongation and increased
risk of ventricular tachyarrhythmias (such as torsades de pointes, ventricular
tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation) at the recommended dose. Terfenadine
and pseudoephedrine is contraindicated for use by patients with these conditions
(see WARNING BOX, CONTRAINDICATIONS, and PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions).
</p>

<p>Other patients who may be at risk for these adverse cardiovascular events
include patients who may experience new or increased QT prolongation while
receiving certain drugs or having conditions which lead to QT prolongation.
These include patients taking certain antiarrhythmics, bepridil, certain
psychotropics, probucol, or astemizole; patients with electrolyte abnormalities
such as hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia, or taking diuretics with potential
for inducing electrolyte abnormalities; and patients with congenital QT
syndrome. Terfenadine and pseudoephedrine is not recommended for use by
patients with these conditions. </p>

is unclear; nonetheless Terfenadine and pseudoephedrine should also be
used with caution in these patients. </p>

<p>Sympathomimetic amines should be used judiciously and sparingly in patients
with hypertension, diabetes mellitus, ischemic heart disease, increased
intraocular pressure, hyperthyroidism, or prostatic hypertrophy (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).
Sympathomimetic amines may produce CNS stimulation with convulsions or
cardiovascular collapse with accompanying hypotension. </p>

<p>Use In Elderly </p>

<p>The elderly are more likely to have adverse reactions to sympathomimetic
amines. </p>

<p><a name="PRECAUTIONS"></a><b>PRECAUTIONS </b></p>

<p>General </p>

<p>Terfenadine and pseudoephedrine should be used with caution in patients
with diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and hyperreactivity
to ephedrine. </p>

<p>Information For Patients </p>

<p>Patients taking Terfenadine and pseudoephedrine should receive the following
information and instructions. Patients should be advised to take Terfenadine
and pseudoephedrine only as needed and NOT TO EXCEED THE PRESCRIBED DOSE.
Patients should be questioned about use of any other prescription or over-the-counter
medication, and should be cautioned regarding the potential for life-threatening
arrhythmias with concurrent use of ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin,
erythromycin, or troleandomycin. Patients should be advised to consult
the physician before concurrent use of other medications with terfenadine.
Patients should be questioned about pregnancy or lactation before starting
Terfenadine and pseudoephedrine therapy, since the drug is contraindicated
in nursing women and should be used in pregnancy only if the potential
benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Patients should be directed
to swallow the tablet whole. Patients should also be instructed to store
this medication in a tightly closed container in a cool, dry place, away
from heat, moisture, or direct sunlight, and away from children. </p>

<p>Drug Interactions (see CONTRAINDICATIONS) </p>

<p>Monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors and beta-adrenergic agonists increase
the effect of sympathomimetic amines. Sympathomimetic amines may reduce
the antihypertensive effects of methyldopa, mecamylamine, and reserpine.
MAO inhibitors may prolong and intensify the effects of antihistamines.
</p>

<p>Care should be taken in the administration of Terfenadine and pseudoephedrine
concomitantly with other sympathomimetic amines because combined effects
on the cardiovascular system may be harmful to the patient. </p>

<p>KETOCONAZOLE </p>

<p>Spontaneous adverse reaction reports of patients taking concomitant
ketoconazole with recommended doses of terfenadine demonstrate QT interval
prolongation and rare serious cardiac events, e.g. death, cardiac arrest,
and ventricular arrhythmia including torsades de pointes. Pharmacokinetic
data indicate that ketoconazole markedly inhibits the metabolism of terfenadine,
resulting in elevated plasma terfenadine levels. Presence of unchanged
terfenadine is associated with statistically significant prolongation of
the QT and QTc intervals. CONCOMITANT ADMINISTRATION OF KETOCONAZOLE AND
Terfenadine and pseudoephedrine IS CONTRAINDICATED (see CONTRAINDICATIONS,
WARNINGS, and ADVERSE REACTIONS). </p>

<p>ITRACONAZOLE </p>

<p>Torsades de pointes and elevated parent terfenadine levels have been
reported during concomitant use of terfenadine and itraconazole in clinical
trials of itraconazole and from foreign post-marketing sources. One death
has also been reported from foreign post-marketing sources. CONCOMITANT
ADMINISTRATION OF ITRACONAZOLE AND Terfenadine and pseudoephedrine IS CONTRAINDICATED
(see CONTRAINDICATION, WARNINGS and ADVERSE REACTIONS). </p>

<p>Due to the chemical similarity of other azole-type antifungal agents
(including fluconazole, metronidazole, and miconazole) to ketoconazole
and itraconazole, concomitant use of these products with Terfenadine and
pseudoephedrine is not recommended pending full examination of potential
interactions. </p>

<p>MACROLIDES </p>

<p>Clinical drug interactions studies indicate that erythromycin and clarithromycin
can exert an effect on terfenadine metabolism by a mechanism which may
be similar to that of ketoconazole, but to a lesser extent. Although erythromycin
measurably decreases the clearance of the terfenadine acid metabolite,
its influence on terfenadine plasma levels is still under investigation.
A few spontaneous accounts of QT interval prolongation with ventricular
arrhythmia including torsades de pointes have been reported in patients
receiving erythromycin or troleandomycin. </p>

<p>CONCOMITANT ADMINISTRATION OF Terfenadine and pseudoephedrine WITH CLARITHROMYCIN,
ERYTHROMYCIN, OR TROLEANDOMYCIN IS CONTRAINDICATED (see CONTRAINDICATIONS,
WARNINGS, and ADVERSE REACTIONS). Pending full characterization of potential
interactions, concomitant administration of Terfenadine and pseudoephedrine
with other macrolide antibiotics, including azithromycin, is not recommended.
Studies to evaluate the potential interaction of terfenadine with azithromycin
are in progress. </p>

<p>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment Of Fertility </p>

<p>No studies have been conducted to evaluate the carcinogenic potential
of Terfenadine and pseudoephedrine. </p>

<p>Oral doses of terfenadine, corresponding to 63 times the recommended
human daily dose, in mice for 18 months or in rats for 24 months, revealed
no evidence of tumorigenicity. Microbial and micronucleus test assays with
terfendine have revealed no evidence of mutagenesis. </p>

<p>Reproduction and fertility studies with terfenadine in rats showed no
effects on male or female fertility at oral doses of up to 21 times the
human daily dose. At 63 times the human daily dose there was a small but
significant reduction in implants and at 125 times the human daily dose
reduced implants and increased post-implantation losses were observed,
which were judged to be secondary to maternal toxicity. Animal reproduction
studies have not been carried out with pseudoephedrine. </p>

<p>Pregnancy Category C </p>

<p>The combination of terfenadine and pseudoephedrine hydrochloride (in
a ratio of 1:2 by weight) has been shown to produce reduced fetal weight
in rats and rabbits at 42 times the human dose, and delayed ossification
with wavy ribs in few fetuses when given to rats at a dose of 63 times
the human daily dose. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies
in pregnant women. Terfenadine and pseudoephedrine should be used during
pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to
the fetus. </p>

<p>Nursing Mothers (see CONTRAINDICATIONS) </p>

<p>Terfenadine has caused decreased pup weight gain and survival in rats
given doses 63 times and 125 times the human daily dose throughout pregnancy
and lactation. </p>

<p>Pediatric Use </p>

<p>Safety and effectiveness of Terfenadine and pseudoephedrine in children
below the age of 12 years have not been established. </p>

<p>(See Also PRECAUTIONS) </p>

<p><a name="ADVERSE REACTIONS"></a><b>ADVERSE REACTIONS </b></p>

<p>Cardiovascular Adverse Events </p>

<p>With terfenadine, rare reports of severe cardiovascular adverse effects
have been received which include ventricular tachyarrhythmias (torsades
de pointes, ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, and cardiac
arrest), hypotension, palpitations, syncope, and dizziness. Rare reports
of deaths resulting from ventricular tachyarrhythmias have been received
(see CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS, and PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions).
Hypotension, palpitations, syncope, and dizziness could reflect undetected
ventricular arrhythmia. IN SOME PATIENTS, DEATH, CARDIAC ARREST, OR TORSADES
DE POINTES HAVE BEEN PRECEDED BY EPISODES OF SYNCOPE. (See WARNING BOX.)
Rare reports of serious cardiovascular adverse events have been received,
some involving QT prolongation and torsades de pointes, in apparently normal
individuals without identifiable risk factors; there is not conclusive
evidence of a causal relationship of these events with terfenadine. Although
in rare cases there was measurable plasma terfenadine, the implications
of this finding with respect to the variability of terfenadine metabolism
in the normal population cannot be assessed without further study. In controlled
clinical trials in otherwise normal patients with rhinitis, small increases
in QTc interval were observed at doses of 60 mg b.i.d. In studies at 300
mg b.i.d. a mean increase in QTc of 10% (range -4% to +30%) (mean increase
of 46 msec) was observed. </p>

<p>General Adverse Events </p>

<p>In double-blind, parallel, controlled studies in over 300 patients in
which Terfenadine and pseudoephedrine was compared to extended-release
pseudoephedrine, adverse reactions reported for greater than 1% of the
patients receiving Terfenadine and pseudoephedrine were not clinically
different from those reported for patients receiving pseudoephedrine (see
Table below). </p>

<p>* Terfenadine and pseudoephedrine B.I.D., pseudoephedrine 120 mg B.I.D.
</p>

<p>Pseudoephedrine may cause ephedrine-like reactions such as tachycardia,
palpitations, headache, dizziness, or nausea. Sympathomimetic drugs have
also been associated with certain untoward reactions including fear, anxiety,
tenseness, restlessness, tremor, weakness, pallor, respiratory difficulty,
dysuria, insomnia, hallucinations, convulsions, CNS depression, arrhythmias,
and cardiovascular collapse with hypotension. </p>

<p>In controlled clinical trials with terfenadine, using the recommended
daily dose of 60 mg b.i.d., the incidence of adverse events in patients
receiving terfenadine was similar to that reported in patients receiving
placebo. These effects included: Central Nervous System-Drowsiness, headache,
fatigue, dizziness, nervousness, weakness, appetite increase; Gastrointestinal
System- Abdominal distress, nausea, vomiting, change in bowel habits; Eye,
Ear, Nose And Throat- Dry mouth/nose/throat, cough, sore throat, epistaxis;
Skin-Eruption (including rash and urticaria) or itching. Also reported
spontaneously during the marketing of terfenadine were: alopecia (hair
loss or thinning), anaphylaxis, angioedema, bronchospasm, confusion, depression,
galactorrhea, insomnia, menstrual disorders (including dysmenorrhea), musculoskeletal
symptoms, nightmares, paresthesia, photosensitivity, rapid flare of psoriasis,
seizures, sinus tachycardia, sweating, thrombocytopenia, tremor, urinary
frequency, and visual disturbances. </p>

<p>Also in clinical trials, several instances of mild or, in one case,
moderate transaminase elevations were seen in patients receiving terfenadine.
Mild elevations were also seen in placebo treated patients. Marketing experiences
include isolated reports of jaundice, cholestatic hepatitis, and hepatitis.
In most cases available information is incomplete. </p>

<p><a name="OVERDOSAGE"></a><b>OVERDOSAGE </b></p>

<p>Acute overdosage with Terfenadine and pseudoephedrine tablets may produce
clinical signs of CNS stimulation or depression and various cardiovascular
effects, including cardiac collapse and death. Sympathomimetic amines should
be used with great caution in the presence of pseudoephedrine. Patients
with signs of stimulation should be treated conservatively. </p>

<p>Adverse cardiac events including cardiac arrest, ventricular arrhythmias
including torsades de pointes and QT prolongation have been reported at
overdoses of 360 mg or more of terfenadine and occur more frequently at
doses in excess of 600 mg, and QTc prolongations of up to 30% have been
observed at a dose of 300 mg b.i.d. Seizures and syncope have also been
reported. USE OF DOSES IN EXCESS OF ONE TABLET B.I.D. IS NOT RECOMMENDED.
(See WARNING, ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, and ADVERSE REACTIONS.) </p>

<p>In overdose cases, where ventricular arrhythmias are associated with
significant QTc prolongation, treatment with antiarrhythmics known to prolong
QTc intervals is not recommended. </p>

<p>Therefore, in cases of overdosage, cardiac monitoring for at least 24
hours is recommended and for as long as QTc is prolonged, along with standard
measures to remove any unabsorbed drug. Limited experience with the use
of hemoperfusion (N = 1) or hemodialysis (N = 3) was not successful in
completely removing the acid metabolite of terfenadine from the blood.
</p>

<p>Oral LD50 values for tertenadine were greater than 5000 mg/kg in mature
mice and rats. The oral LD50 was 438 mg/kg in newborn rats. The LD50 of
pseudoephedrine hydrochloride alone in male and female rats was 1674 mg/kg,
while the LD50 of pseudoephedrine hydrochloride administered with terfenadine
was 3017 mg/kg. </p>

<p><a name="DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION"></a><b>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
</b></p>

<p>Adults and children 12 years and older: one tablet swallowed whole,
morning and night. </p>

<p>USE OF DOSES IN EXCESS OF ONE TABLET B.I.D. IS NOT RECOMMENDED BECAUSE
OF THE INCREASED POTENTIAL FOR QT INTERVAL PROLONGATION AND ADVERSE CARDIAC
EVENTS. (See WARNING) USE OF Terfenadine and pseudoephedrine IN PATIENTS
WITH SIGNIFICANT HEPATIC DYSFUNCTION AND IN PATIENTS TAKING KETOCONAZOLE,
ITRACONAZOLE, CLARITHROMYCIN, ERYTHROMYCIN, OR TROLEANDOMYCIN IS CONTRAINDICATED.

<p>Indapamide is an oral antihypertensive/diuretic. Its molecule contains
both a polar sulfamoyl chlorobenzamide moiety and a lipid-soluble methylindoline
moiety. It differs chemically from the thiazides in that it does not possess
the thiazide ring system and contains only one sulfonamide group. The chemical
name of Indapamide is 1-(4-chloro-3-sulfamoylbenzamido)-2- methylindoline,
and its molecular weight is 365.84. The compound is a weak acid pKa = 8.8,
and is soluble in aqueous solutions of strong bases. It is a white to yellow-white
crystalline (tetragonal) powder. </p>

<p><a name="ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY"></a><b>ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
</b></p>

<p>Indapamide is the first of a new class of antihypertensive/diuretics,
the indolines. The oral administration of 2.5 mg (two 1.25 mg tablets)
of indapamide to male subjects produced peak concentrations of approximately
115 ng/mL of the drug in blood within two hours. The oral administration
of 5 mg (two 2.5-mg tablets) of indapamide to healthy male subjects produced
peak concentrations of approximately 260 ng/mL of the drug in the blood
within two hours. A minimum of 70% of a single oral dose is eliminated
by the kidneys and an additional 23% by the gastrointestinal tract, probably
including the biliary route. The half-life of Indapamide in whole blood
is approximately 14 hours. </p>

<p>Indapamide is preferentially and reversibly taken up by the erythrocytes
in the peripheral blood. The whole blood/plasma ratio is approximately
6:1 at the time of peak concentration and decreases to 3.5:1 at eight hours.
From 71 to 79% of the Indapamide in plasma is reversibly bound to plasma
proteins. </p>

<p>Indapamide is an extensively metabolized drug with only about 7% of
the total dose administered, recovered in the urine as unchanged drug during
the first 48 hours after administration. The urinary elimination of 14C-labeled
indapamide and metabolites is biphasic with a terminal half-life of excretion
of total radioactivity of 26 hours. </p>

<p>In a parallel design double-blind, placebo controlled trial in hypertension,
daily doses of indapamide between 1.25 mg and 10.0 mg produced dose-related
antihypertensive effects. Doses of 5.0 and 10.0 mg were not distinguishable
from each other although each was differentiated from placebo and 1.25
mg indapamide. At daily doses of 1.25 mg, 5.0 mg and 10.0 mg, a mean decrease
of serum potassium of 0.28, 0.61 and 0.76 mEq/L, respectively, was observed
and uric acid increased by about 0.69 mg/100 mL. </p>

<p>In other parallel design, dose-ranging clinical trials in hypertension
and edema, daily doses of indapamide between 0.5 and 5.0 mg produced dose-related
effects. Generally, doses of 2.5 and 5.0 mg were not distinguishable from
each other although each was differentiated from placebo and from 0.5 or
1.0 mg indapamide. At daily doses of 2.5 and 5.0 mg a mean decrease of
serum potassium of 0.5 and 0.6 mEq/Liter, respectively, was observed and
uric acid increased by about 1.0 mg/100 mL. </p>

<p>At these doses, the effects of indapamide on blood pressure and edema
are approximately equal to those obtained with conventional doses of other
antihypertensive/diuretics. </p>

<p>In hypertensive patients, daily doses of 1.25, 2.5 and 5.0 mg of indapamide
have no appreciable cardiac inotropic or chronotropic effect. The drug
decreases peripheral resistance, with little or no effect on cardiac output,
rate or rhythm. Chronic administration of indapamide to hypertensive patients
has little or no effect on glomerular filtration rate or renal plasma flow.
</p>

<p>Indapamide had an antihypertensive effect in patients with varying degrees
of renal impairment, although in general, diuretic effects declined as
renal function decreased. </p>

<p>In a small number of controlled studies, Indapamide taken with other
antihypertensive drugs such as hydralazine, propranolol, guanethidine,
and methyldopa, appeared to have the additive effect typical of thiazide-type
diuretics. </p>

<p><a name="INDICATIONS AND USAGE"></a><b>INDICATIONS AND USAGE </b></p>

<p>Indapamide is indicated for the treatment of hypertension, alone or
in combination with other antihypertensive drugs. </p>

<p>Indapamide is also indicated for the treatment of salt and fluid retention
associated with congestive heart failure. </p>

<p>Usage In Pregnancy: The routine use of diuretics in an otherwise healthy
woman is inappropriate and exposes mother and fetus to unnecessary hazard
(see PRECAUTIONS below). </p>

<p>Diuretics do not prevent development of toxemia of pregnancy, and there
is no satisfactory evidence that they are useful in the treatment of developed
toxemia. </p>

<p>Edema during pregnancy may arise from pathological causes or from the
physiologic and mechanical consequences of pregnancy. Indapamide is indicated
in pregnancy when edema is due to pathologic causes, just as it is in the
absence of pregnancy (however, see PRECAUTIONS below). Dependent edema
in pregnancy, resulting from restriction of venous return by the expanded
uterus, is properly treated through elevation of the lower extremities
and use of support hose; use of diuretics to lower intravascular volume
in this case is illogical and unnecessary. There is hypervolemia during
normal pregnancy which is not harmful to either the fetus or the mother
(in the absence of cardiovascular disease), but which is associated with
edema, including generalized edema in the majority of pregnant women. If
this edema produces discomfort, increased recumbency will often provide
relief. In rare instances, this edema may cause extreme discomfort which
is not relieved by rest. In these cases, a short course of diuretics may
provide relief and may be appropriate. </p>

<p><a name="CONTRAINDICATIONS"></a><b>CONTRAINDICATIONS </b></p>

<p>Anuria. Known hypersensitivity to indapamide or to other sulfonamide-derived
drugs. </p>

<p><a name="WARNINGS"></a><b>WARNINGS </b></p>

<p>Infrequent cases of severe hyponatremia, accompanied by hypokalemia,
have been reported with 2.5 mg and 5.0 mg indapamide primarily in elderly
females. Symptoms were reversed by electrolyte replenishment. Hyponatremia
considered possibly clinically significant (&lt;125 mEq/L) has not been
observed in clinical trials with the 1.25 mg dosage (see PRECAUTIONS).
</p>

<p>Hypokalemia occurs commonly with diuretics (SEE ADVERSE REACTIONS, HYPOKALEMIA)
and electrolyte monitoring is essential, particularly in patients who would
be at increased risk from hypokalemia, such as those with cardiac arrhythmias
or who are receiving concomitant cardiac glycosides. </p>

<p>In general, diuretics should not be given concomitantly with lithium
because they reduce its renal clearance and add a high risk of lithium
toxicity. Read prescribing information for lithium preparations before
use of such concomitant therapy. </p>

<p><a name="PRECAUTIONS"></a><b>PRECAUTIONS </b></p>

<p>GENERAL: </p>

<p>1. Hypokalemia, Hyponatremia, And Other Fluid And Electrolyte Imbalances:
Periodic determinations of serum electrolytes should be performed at appropriate
intervals. In addition, patients should be observed for clinical signs
of fluid or electrolyte imbalance, such as hyponatremia, hypochloremic
alkalosis, or hypokalemia. Warning signs include dry mouth, thirst, weakness,
fatigue, lethargy, drowsiness, restlessness, muscle pains or cramps, hypotension,
oliguria, tachycardia, and gastrointestinal disturbance. Electrolyte determinations
are particularly important in patients who are vomiting excessively or
receiving parenteral fluids, in patients subject to electrolyte imbalance
(including those with heart failure, kidney disease, and cirrhosis), and
in patients on a salt-restricted diet. </p>

<p>The risk of hypokalemia secondary to diuresis and natriuresis is increased
when larger doses are used, when the diuresis is brisk, when severe cirrhosis
is present and during concomitant use of corticosteroids or ACTH. Interference
with adequate oral intake of electrolytes will also contribute to hypokalemia.
Hypokalemia can sensitize or exaggerate the response of the heart to the
toxic effects of digitalis, such as increased ventricular irritability.
</p>

<p>Dilutional hyponatremia may occur in edematous patients; the appropriate
treatment is restriction of water rather than administration of salt, except
in rare instances when the hyponatremia is life threatening. However, in
actual salt depletion, appropriate replacement is the treatment of choice.
Any chloride deficit that may occur during treatment is generally mild
and usually does not require specific treatment except in extraordinary
circumstances as in liver or renal disease. Thiazide-like diuretics have
been shown to increase the urinary excretion of magnesium; this may result
in hypomagnesemia. </p>

<p>2. Hyperuricemia And Gout: Serum concentrations of uric acid increased
by an average of 0.69 mg/100 mL in patients treated with indapamide 1.25
mg, and by an average of 1.0 mg/100 mL in patients treated with indapamide
2.5 mg and 5.0 mg, and frank gout may be precipitated in certain patients
receiving indapamide (see ADVERSE REACTIONS below). Serum concentrations
of uric acid should, therefore, be monitored periodically during treatment.
</p>

<p>3. Renal Impairment: Indapamide, like the thiazides, should be used
with caution in patients with severe renal disease, as reduced plasma volume
may exacerbate or precipitate azotemia. If progressive renal impairment
is observed in a patient receiving indapamide, withholding or discontinuing
diuretic therapy should be considered. Renal function tests should be performed
periodically during treatment with indapamide. </p>

<p>4. Impaired Hepatic Function: Indapamide, like the thiazides, should
be used with caution in patients with impaired hepatic function or progressive
liver disease, since minor alterations of fluid and electrolyte balance
may precipitate hepatic coma. </p>

<p>5. Glucose Tolerance: Latent diabetes may become manifest and insulin
requirements in diabetic patients may be altered during thiazide administration.
A mean increase in glucose of 6.47 mg/dL was observed in patients treated
with indapamide 1.25 mg, which was not considered clinically significant
in these trials. Serum concentrations of glucose should be monitored routinely
during treatment with Indapamide. </p>

<p>6. Calcium Excretion: Calcium excretion is decreased by diuretics pharmacologically
related to indapamide. After six to eight weeks of indapamide 1.25 mg treatment
and in long-term studies of hypertensive patients with higher doses of
indapamide, however, serum concentrations of calcium increased only slightly
with indapamide. Prolonged treatment with drugs pharmacologically related
to indapamide may in rare instances be associated with hypercalcemia and
hypophosphatemia secondary to physiologic changes in the parathyroid gland;
however, the common complications of hyperparathyroidism, such as renal
lithiasis, bone resorption, and peptic ulcer, have not been seen. Treatment
should be discontinued before tests for parathyroid function are performed.
Like the thiazides, indapamide may decrease serum PBI levels without signs
of thyroid disturbance. </p>

<p>7. Interaction With Systemic Lupus Erythematosus: Thiazides have exacerbated
or activated systemic lupus erythematosus and this possibility should be
considered with indapamide as well. </p>

<p>DRUG INTERACTIONS </p>

<p>1. Other Antihypertensives: Indapamide may add to or potentiate the
action of other antihypertensive drugs. In limited controlled trials that
compared the effect of indapamide combined with other antihypertensive
drugs with the effect of the other drugs administered alone, there was
no notable change in the nature or frequency of adverse reactions associated
with the combined therapy. </p>

<p>2. Lithium: See WARNINGS. </p>

<p>3. Post-Sympathectomy Patient: The antihypertensive effect of the drug
may be enhanced in the postsympathectomized patient. </p>

<p>4. Norepinephrine: Indapamide, like the thiazides, may decrease arterial
responsiveness to norepinephrine, but this diminution is not sufficient
to preclude effectiveness of the pressor agent for therapeutic use. </p>

<p>CARCINOGENESIS, MUTAGENESIS, IMPAIRMENT OF FERTILITY: Both mouse and
rat lifetime carcinogenicity studies were conducted. There was no significant
difference in the incidence of tumors between the indapamide-treated animals
and the control groups. </p>

<p>Pregnancy/Teratogenic Effects: Pregnancy Category B. Reproduction studies
have been performed in rats, mice, and rabbits at doses up to 6,250 times
the therapeutic human dose and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility
or harm to the fetus due to Indapamide. Postnatal development in rats and
mice was unaffected by pretreatment of parent animals during gestation.
There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant
women. Moreover, diuretics are known to cross the placental barrier and
appear in cord blood. Because animal reproduction studies are not always
predictive of human response this drug should be used during pregnancy
only if clearly needed. There may be hazards associated with this use such
as fetal or neonatal jaundice, thrombocytopenia, and possibly other adverse
reactions that have occurred in the adult. </p>

<p>Nursing Mothers: It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human
milk. Because most drugs are excreted in human milk, if use of this drug
is deemed essential, the patient should stop nursing. </p>

<p>Because most of these data are from long-term studies (up to 40 weeks
of treatment), it is probable that many of the adverse experiences reported
are due to causes other than the drug. Approximately 10% of patients given
indapamide discontinued treatment in long-term trials because of reactions
either related or unrelated to the drug. </p>

<p>Hypokalemia with concomitant clinical signs or symptoms occurred in
3% of patients receiving indapamide 2.5 mg q.d. and 7% of patients receiving
indapamide 5 mg q.d. In long-term controlled clinical trials comparing
the hypokalemic effects of daily doses of indapamide and hydrochlorothiazide,
however, 47% of patients receiving indapamide 2.5 mg, 72% of patients receiving
indapamide 5 mg, and 44% of patients receiving hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg
had at least one potassium value (out of a total of 11 taken during the
study) below 3.5 mEq/L. In the indapamide 2.5 mg group, over 50% of those
patients returned to normal serum potassium values without intervention.

<p>Other adverse reactions reported with antihypertensive/diuretics are
jaundice (intrahepatic cholestatic jaundice), sialadenitis, xanthopsia,
photosensitivity purpura, bullous eruptions, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome,
necrotizing angiitis, fever, respiratory distress (including pneumonitis),
and anaphylactic reactions; also, agranulocytosis, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia,
and aplastic anemia. These reactions should be considered as possible occurrences
with clinical usage of Indapamide. </p>

<p><a name="OVERDOSAGE"></a><b>OVERDOSAGE </b></p>

<p>Symptoms of overdosage include nausea, vomiting, weakness, gastrointestinal
disorders and disturbances of electrolyte balance. In severe instances,
hypotension and depressed respiration may be observed. If this occurs,
support of respiration and cardiac circulation should be instituted. There
is no specific antidote. An evacuation of the stomach is recommended by
emesis and gastric lavage after which the electrolyte and fluid balance
should be evaluated carefully. </p>

<p><a name="DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION"></a><b>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
</b></p>

<p>Hypertension: The adult starting indapamide dose for hypertension is
1.25 mg as a single daily dose taken in the morning. if the response to
1.25 mg is not satisfactory after four weeks, the daily dose may be increased
to 2.5 mg taken once daily. If the response to 2.5 mg is not satisfactory
after four weeks, the daily dose may be increased to 5.0 mg taken once
daily, but adding another antihypertensive should be considered. </p>

<p>Edema Of Congestive Heart Failure: The adult starting indapamide dose
for edema of congestive heart failure is 2.5 mg as a single daily dose
taken in the morning. If the response to 2.5 mg is not satisfactory after
one week, the daily dose may be increased to 5.0 mg taken once daily. </p>

<p>If the antihypertensive response to indapamide is insufficient, Indapamide
may be combined with other antihypertensive drugs, with careful monitoring
of blood pressure. It is recommended that the usual dose of other agents
be reduced by 50% during initial combination therapy. As the blood pressure
response becomes evident, further dosage adjustments may be necessary.
</p>

<p>In general, doses of 5.0 mg and larger have not appeared to provide
additional effects on blood pressure or heart failure, but are associated
with a greater degree of hypokalemia. There is minimal clinical trial experience
in patients with doses greater than 5.0 mg once a day. </p>

<p><a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><b>DESCRIPTION </b></p>

<p>Triamcinolone acetonide, USP, is a glucocorticosteroid with a molecular
weight of 434.5 and with the chemical designation 9-Fluoro-11beta,16alpha,17,21-tetrahydroxypregna-1,4-diene
3,20-dione cyclic 16,17-acetal with acetone. (C24H31FO6). </p>

<p><a name="ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY"></a><b>ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
</b></p>

<p>Triamcinolone acetonide is a more potent derivative of triamcinolone.
Although triamcinolone itself is approximately one to two times as potent
as prednisone in animal models of inflammation, triamcinolone acetonide
is approximately 8 times more potent than prednisone. </p>

<p>Although the precise mechanism of glucocorticoid antiallergic action
is unknown glucocorticoids are very effective. However, when allergic symptoms
are very severe, local treatment with recommended doses (microgram) of
any available aerosolized corticoid are not as effective as treatment with
larger doses (milligram) of oral or parenteral formulations. </p>

<p>Corticoids do not have an immediate effect on allergic signs and symptoms.
Treatment effects may be observed as early as 12 hours after onset of treatment
and, generally, it takes 3-4 days to reach maximum benefit. Similarly when
corticoids are prematurely discontinued symptoms may not recur for several
days. </p>

<p>Based upon intravenous dosing of triamcinolone acetonide phosphate ester,
the half-life of triamcinolone acetonide was reported to be 88 minutes.
The volume of distribution (Vd) reported was 99.5 L (SD +/- 27.5) and clearance
was 45.2 L/ hour (SD +/- 9.1) for triamcinolone acetonide. The plasma half-life
of corticoids does not correlate well with the biologic half-life. </p>

<p>When administered intranasally to man at 440 mcg/day dose, the peak
plasma concentration was &lt;1 ng/mL and occurred on average at 3.4 hours
(range 0.5-8.0 hours) post dosing. The apparent half-life was 4.0 hours
(range 1.0-7.0 hours); however, this value probably reflects lingering
absorption. Intranasal doses below 440 mcg/day gave sparse data and did
not allow for the calculation of meaningful pharmacokinetic parameters.
</p>

<p>Three metabolites of triamcinolone acetonide have been identified. They
are 6beta-hydroxytriamcinolone acetonide, 21-carboxytriamcinolone acetonide
and 21- carboxy-6beta-hydroxytriamcinolone acetonide. All three metabolites
are expected to be substantially less active than the parent compound due
to (a) the dependence of anti-inflammatory activity on the presence of
a 21-hydroxyl group, (b) the decreased activity observed upon 6-hydroxylation,
and (c) the markedly increased water solubility favoring rapid elimination.
There appeared to be some quantitative differences in the metabolites among
species. No differences were detected in metabolic pattern as a function
of route of administration. </p>

<p>CLINICAL TRIALS </p>

<p>In double-blind, parallel, placebo-controlled clinical trials of seasonal
and perennial allergic rhinitis, in fixed total daily doses of 110, 220
and 440 mcg per day, the responses to aerosolized triamcinolone acetonide
demonstrated a statistically significant improvement over placebo. In open
label trials where the doses were sometimes adjusted according to patients'
signs and symptoms, the daily doses and regimens varied. The most commonly
used dose was 110 mcg per day. </p>

<p>In attempting to determine if systemic absorption played a role in the
response to Triamcinolone, a clinical study comparing intranasal and depot
intramuscular triamcinolone acetonide was conducted. The doses used were
based on bioavailability studies of each formulation. The final doses of
Triamcinolone 440 mcg once a day and Kenalog-40, 4 mg intramuscularly once
a week, were chosen to deliver comparable total amounts of weekly triamcinolone
acetonide. However, the weekly injection yielded sustained plasma levels
throughout the dosing interval while the daily Triamcinolone application
resulted in daily peak and trough concentrations, the mean of which was
3.5 times below the Kenalog plasma levels. Both topical Triamcinolone and
intramuscular Kenalog-40 were clinically effective. In addition, in some
studies there was evidence of improvement of eye symptoms. This suggests
that Triamcinolone, at least to some degree is acting by a systemic mechanism.
</p>

<p>In order to evaluate the effects of systemic absorption on the Hypothalamic-
Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) axis, Triamcinolone in doses of 440 mcg once a
day was compared to placebo and 42 days of a single morning dose of prednisone
10 mg. Adrenal response to a six-hour cosyntropin stimulation test suggests
that intranasal Triamcinolone 440 mcg/day for six weeks did not measurably
affect adrenal activity. Conversely, oral prednisone at 10 mg/day significantly
reduced the response to ACTH. </p>

<p>INDIVIDUALIZATION OF DOSAGE </p>

<p>Individual patients will experience a variable time to onset and degree
of symptom relief when using Triamcinolone. It is recommended that dosing
be started at 220 mcg once a day and the effect be assessed in four-seven
days. Some relief can be expected in approximately two-thirds of patients
within that time. If greater effect is desired an increase of dose to 440
mcg once a day can be tried. If adequate relief has not been obtained by
the third week of Triamcinolone treatment, consideration to alternate forms
of treatment should be given. </p>

<p>A dose-response between 110 mcg/day (one spray/nostril/ day) and 440
mcg/day (four sprays/nostril/day) is not clearly discernible. In general,
in the clinical trials the highest dose tended to provide relief sooner.
This suggests an alternative approach to starting therapy with Triamcinolone,
E.g., starting treatment with 440 mcg (four sprays/nostril/day) and then,
depending on the patient's response, decreasing the dose by one spray per
day every four to seven days. </p>

<p>Although Triamcinolone may be used at 220 mcg/day or 440 mcg/day divided
into two or four times a day, the degree of relief does not seem to be
significantly different compared to once-a-day dosing. As with other nasal
corticoids, the vehicle used to deliver the corticoid may cause symptoms
that are difficult to distinguish from the patient's rhinitis symptoms.
Thus, depending upon the balance between these vehicle side effects and
the benefits of treatment, in determining the optimal dose for the relief
of symptoms, individual patients may need to have a trial of high and low
doses. </p>

<p>After symptoms have been brought under control, reducing the daily dose
to 110 mcg has been shown to be effective in control of symptoms in approximately
one half of patients being treated long term for allergic rhinitis. It
is always desirable to titrate an individual patient to the minimum effective
dose to reduce the possibility of side effects (see PRECAUTIONS, WARNINGS,
INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS and ADVERSE REACTIONS sections). </p>

<p><a name="INDICATIONS AND USAGE"></a><b>INDICATIONS AND USAGE </b></p>

<p>Triamcinolone Nasal Inhaler is indicated for the nasal treatment of
seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis symptoms. </p>

<p><a name="CONTRAINDICATIONS"></a><b>CONTRAINDICATIONS </b></p>

<p>Hypersensitivity to any of the ingredients of this preparation contraindicates
its use. </p>

<p><a name="WARNINGS"></a><b>WARNINGS </b></p>

<p>The replacement of a systemic corticosteroid with a topical corticoid
can be accompanied by signs of adrenal insufficiency and, in addition,
some patients may experience symptoms of withdrawal, e.g., joint and/or
muscular pain, lassitude and depression. Patients previously treated for
prolonged periods with systemic corticosteroids and transferred to topical
corticoids should be carefully monitored for acute adrenal insufficiency
in response to stress. In those patients who have asthma or other clinical
conditions requiring long-term systemic corticosteroid treatment, too rapid
a decrease in systemic corticosteroids may cause a severe exacerbation
of their symptoms. </p>

<p>Children who are on immunosuppressant drugs are more susceptible to
infections than healthy children. Chickenpox and measles, for example,
can have a more serious or even fatal course in children on immunosuppressant
doses of corticosteroids. In such children, or in adults who have not had
these diseases particular care should be taken to avoid exposure. If exposed,
therapy with vanicella zoster immune globulin (VZIG) or pooled intravenous
immunoglobulin (IVIG), as appropriate, may be indicated. If chickenpox
develops, treatment with antiviral agents may be considered. </p>

<p>The use of Triamcinolone Nasal Inhaler with alternate-day systemic prednisone
could increase the likelihood of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) suppression
compared to a therapeutic dose of either one alone. Therefore, Triamcinolone
Nasal Inhaler should be used with caution in patients already receiving
alternate-day prednisone treatment for any disease. </p>

<p><a name="PRECAUTIONS"></a><b>PRECAUTIONS </b></p>

<p>GENERAL: In clinical studies with triamcinolone acetonide administered
intranasally, the development of localized infections of the nose and pharynx
with Candida Albicans has rarely occurred. When such an infection develops
it may require treatment with appropriate local therapy and discontinuance
of treatment with Triamcinolone Nasal Inhaler. </p>

<p>Triamcinolone acetonide administered intranasally has been shown to
be absorbed into the systemic circulation in humans. Patients with active
rhinitis showed absorption similar to that found in normal volunteers.
Triamcinolone at 440 mcg/day for 42 days did not measurably affect adrenal
response to a six-hour cosyntropin test. In the same study prednisone 10
mg/day significantly reduced adrenal response to ACTH over the same period
(see CLINICAL TRIALS section). </p>

<p>Triamcinolone Nasal Inhaler should be used with caution, if at all,
in patients with active or quiescent tuberculous infections of the respiratory
tract or in patients with untreated fungal, bacterial, or systemic viral
infections or ocular herpes simplex. </p>

<p>Because of the inhibitory effect of corticosteroids on wound healing
in patients who have experienced recent nasal septal ulcers, nasal surgery
or trauma, a corticosteroid should be used with caution until healing has
occurred. As with other nasally inhaled corticosteroids, nasal septal perforations
have been reported in rare instances. </p>

<p>When used at excessive doses, systemic corticosteroid effects such as
hypercorticism and adrenal suppression may appear. If such changes occur,
Triamcinolone Nasal Inhaler should be discontinued slowly, consistent with
accepted procedures for discontinuing oral steroid therapy. </p>

<p>INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS: Patients being treated with Triamcinolone
Nasal Inhaler should receive the following information and instructions.
</p>

<p>Patients who are on immunosuppressant doses of corticosteriods should
be warned to avoid exposure to chickenpox or measles and, if exposed, to
obtain medical advice. Patients should use Triamcinolone Nasal Inhaler
at regular intervals since its effectiveness depends on its regular use.
A decrease in symptoms may occur as soon as 12 hours after starting steroid
therapy and generally can be expected to occur within a few days of initiating
therapy in allergic rhinitis. The patient should take the medication as
directed and should not exceed the prescribed dosage. The patient should
contact the physician if symptoms do not improve after three weeks, or
if the condition worsens. Nasal irritation and/or burning or stinging after
use of the spray occur only rarely with this product. The patient should
contact the physician if they occur. </p>

<p>For the proper use of this unit and to attain maximum improvement, the
patient should read and follow the accompanying patient instructions carefully.
Because the amount dispensed per puff may not be consistent, it is important
to shake the canister well. Also, the canister should be discarded after
100 actuations. </p>

<p>CARCINOGENESIS, MUTAGENESIS: Animal studies of triamcinolone acetonide
to test its carcinogenic potential are underway. </p>

<p>IMPAIRMENT OF FERTILITY: Male and female rats which were administered
oral triamcinolone acetonide at doses as high as 15 mcg/kg/day (110 mcg/M(square)/day,
as calculated on a surface area basis) exhibited no evidence of impaired
fertility. The maximum human dose, for comparison, is 6.3 mcg/kg/day (240
mcg/M(square)/day). However, a few female rats which received maternally
toxic doses of 8 or 15 mcg/kg/day (60 mcg/M(square)/day or 110 mcg/M(square)/day,
respectively, as calculated on a surface area basis) exhibited dystocia
and prolonged delivery. Developmental toxicity, which included increases
in fetal resorptions and stillbirths and decreases in pup body weight and
survival, also occurred at the maternally toxic doses (2.5-15.0 mcg/kg/day
or 20-110 mcg/M(square)/day, as calculated on a surface area basis). Reproductive
performance of female rats and effects on fetuses and offspring were comparable
between groups that received placebo and non-toxic or marginally toxic
doses (0.5 and 1.0 mcg/kg/day or 3.8 mcg/M(square)/day and 7.0 mcg/M(square)/day).
</p>

<p>PREGNANCY: Pregnancy Category C. Like other corticoids, triamcinolone
acetonide has been shown to be teratogenic in rats and rabbits. Teratogenic
effects, which occurred in both species at 0.02, 0.04 and 0.08 mg/kg/day
(approximately 135, 270 and 540 mcg/M(square)/day in the rat and 320, 640
and 1280 mcg/ M(square)/day in the rabbit, as calculated on a surface area
basis), included a low incidence of cleft palate and/or internal hydrocephaly
and axial skeletal defects. Teratogenic effects, including CNS and cranial
malformations, have also been observed in non-human primates at 0.5 mg/kg/day
(approximately 6.7 mg/M(square)/day). The doses of 0.02, 0.04, 0.08, and
0.5 mg/kg/day used in these toxicology studies are approximately 12.8,
25.5, 51, and 318.7 times the minimum recommended dose of 110 mcg of Triamcinolone
per day and 3.2, 6.4, 12.7, and 80 times the maximum recommended dose of
440 mcg of Triamcinolone per day based on a patient body weight of 70 kg.
Administration of aerosol by inhalation to pregnant rats and rabbits produced
embryotoxic and fetotoxic effects which were comparable to those produced
by administration by other routes. There are no adequate and well-controlled
studies in pregnant women. Triamcinolone acetonide should be used during
pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to
the fetus. </p>

<p>Experience with oral corticoids since their introduction in pharmacologic
as opposed to physiologic doses suggests that rodents are more prone to
teratogenic effects from corticoids than humans. In addition, because there
is a natural increase in glucocorticoid production during pregnancy, most
women will require a lower exogenous steroid dose and many will not need
corticoid treatment during pregnancy. </p>

<p>NONTERATOGENIC EFFECTS: Hypoadrenalism may occur in infants born of
mothers receiving corticosteroids during pregnancy. Such infants should
be carefully observed. </p>

<p>NURSING MOTHERS: It is not known whether triamcinolone acetonide is
excreted in human milk. Because other corticosteroids are excreted in human
milk, caution should be exercised when Triamcinolone Nasal Inhaler is administered
to nursing women. </p>

<p>PEDIATRIC USE: Safety and effectiveness have not been established in
children below the age of 12. Oral corticoids have been shown to cause
growth suppression in children and teenagers, particularly with higher
doses over extended periods. If a child or teenager on any corticoid appears
to have growth suppression, the possibility that they are particularly
sensitive to this effect of steroids should be considered. </p>

<p><a name="ADVERSE REACTIONS"></a><b>ADVERSE REACTIONS </b></p>

<p>In controlled and uncontrolled studies, 1257 patients received treatment
with intranasal triamcinolone acetonide. Adverse reactions are based on
the 567 patients who received a product similar to the marketed Triamcinolone
canister. These patients were treated for an average of 48 days (range
1 to 117 days). The 145 patients enrolled in uncontrolled studies received
treatment from 1 to 820 days (average 332 days). </p>

<p>The most prevalent adverse experience was headache, being reported by
approximately 18% of the patients who received Triamcinolone. Nasal irritation
was reported by 2.8% of the patients receiving Triamcinolone. Other nasopharyngeal
side effects were reported by fewer than 5% of the patients who received
Triamcinolone and included: dry mucous membranes, naso-sinus congestion,
throat discomfort, sneezing, and epistaxis. The complaints do not usually
interfere with treatment and in the controlled and uncontrolled studies
approximately 1% of patients have discontinued because of these nasal adverse
effects. </p>

<p>In the event of accidental overdose, an increased potential for these
adverse experiences may be expected, but systemic adverse experiences are
unlikely (see OVERDOSAGE section). </p>

<p><a name="OVERDOSAGE"></a><b>OVERDOSAGE </b></p>

<p>Acute overdosage with this dosage form is unlikely. The acute topical
application of the entire 15 mg of the canister would most likely cause
nasal irritation and headache. It would be unlikely to see acute systemic
adverse effects if the nasal application of the 15 mg of triamcinolone
acetonide was administered all at once. </p>

<p><a name="DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION"></a><b>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
</b></p>

<p>A decrease in symptoms may occur as soon as 12 hours after starting
steroid therapy and generally can be expected to occur within a few days
of initiating therapy in allergic rhinitis. </p>

<p>If improvement is not evident after 2-3 weeks, the patient should be
re- evaluated. (See INDIVIDUALIZATION OF DOSAGE section.) </p>

<p>ADULTS AND CHILDREN 12 YEARS OF AGE AND OLDER: The recommended starting
dose of Triamcinolone Nasal Inhaler is 220 mcg per day given as two sprays
(approximately 55 mcg/spray) in each nostril once a day. If needed, the
dose may be increased to 440 mcg per day (approximately 55 mcg/spray) either
as once a day dosage or divided up to four times a day, i.e., twice a day
(two sprays/nostril), or four times a day (one spray/nostril). After the
desired effect is obtained, some patients may be maintained on a dose of
as little as one spray (approximately 55 mcg) in each nostril once a day
(total daily dose 110 mcg per day). </p>

<p>Losartan/HCTZ (losartan potassium-hydrochlorothiazide), combines an
angiotensin II receptor (type AT1) antagonist and a diuretic, hydrochlorothiazide.
Losartan potassium, a non-peptide molecule, is chemically described as
2-butyl- 4-chloro-1-(P-(O- 1H-tetrazol-5-ylphenyl)benzyl)imidazole- 5-methanol
monopotassium salt. Its empirical formula is C22H22ClKN6O. </p>

<p>Losartan potassium is a white to off-white free- flowing crystalline
powder with a molecular weight of 461.01. It is freely soluble in water,
soluble in alcohols, and slightly soluble in common organic solvents, such
as acetonitrile and methyl ethyl ketone. Oxidation of the 5-hydroxymethyl
group on the imidazole ring results in the active metabolite of losartan.
</p>

<p>Hydrochlorothiazide is 6-chloro-3,4-dihydro-2H- 1,2,4-benzothiadiazine-7-
sulfonamide 1,1-dioxide. Its empirical formula is C7H8ClN3O4S2. Hydrochlorothiazide
is a white, or practically white, crystalline powder with a molecular weight
of 297.72, which is slightly soluble in water, but freely soluble in sodium
hydroxide solution. </p>

<p><a name="ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY"></a><b>ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
</b></p>

<p>Mechanism Of Action </p>

<p>Angiotensin II (formed from angiotensin I in a reaction catalyzed by
angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE, kininase II)), is a potent vasoconstrictor,
the primary vasoactive hormone of the renin-angiotensin system and an important
component in the pathophysiology of hypertension. It also stimulates aldosterone
secretion by the adrenal cortex. Losartan and its principal active metabolite
block the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin
II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT1 receptor
found in many tissues, (e.g., vascular smooth muscle, adrenal gland). There
is also an AT2 receptor found in many tissues but it is not known to be
associated with cardiovascular homeostasis. Both losartan and its principal
active metabolite do not exhibit any partial agonist activity at the AT1
receptor and have much greater affinity (about 1000-fold) for the AT1 receptor
than for the AT2 receptor. In Vitro binding studies indicate that losartan
is a reversible, competitive inhibitor of the AT1 receptor. The active
metabolite is 10 to 40 times more potent by weight than losartan and appears
to be a reversible, non- competitive inhibitor of the AT1 receptor. </p>

<p>Neither losartan nor its active metabolite inhibits ACE (kininase II,
the enzyme that converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II and degrades bradykinin);
nor do they bind to or block other hormone receptors or ion channels known
to be important in cardiovascular regulation. </p>

<p>Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic. Thiazides affect the renal
tubular mechanisms of electrolyte reabsorption, directly increasing excretion
of sodium and chloride in approximately equivalent amounts. Indirectly,
the diuretic action of hydrochlorothiazide reduces plasma volume, with
consequent increases in plasma renin activity, increases in aldosterone
secretion, increases in urinary potassium loss, and decreases in serum
potassium. The renin- aldosterone link is mediated by angiotensin II, so
coadministration of an angiotensin II receptor antagonist tends to reverse
the potassium loss associated with these diuretics. </p>

<p>The mechanism of the antihypertensive effect of thiazides is unknown.
</p>

<p>Pharmacokinetics </p>

<p>General </p>

<p>Losartan Potassium </p>

<p>Losartan is an orally active agent that undergoes substantial first-pass
metabolism by cytochrome P450 enzymes. It is converted, in part, to an
active carboxylic acid metabolite that is responsible for most of the angiotensin
II receptor antagonism that follows losartan treatment. The terminal half-life
of losartan is about 2 hours and of the metabolite is about 6-9 hours.
The pharmacokinetics of losartan and its active metabolite are linear with
oral losartan doses up to 200 mg and do not change over time. Neither losartan
nor its metabolite accumulate in plasma upon repeated once-daily dosing.
Following oral administration, losartan is well absorbed (based on absorption
of radiolabeled losartan) and undergoes substantial first-pass metabolism;
the systemic bioavailability of losartan is approximately 33%. About 14%
of an orally-administered dose of losartan is converted to the active metabolite.
Mean peak concentrations of losartan and its active metabolite are reached
in 1 hour and in 3-4 hours, respectively. While maximum plasma concentrations
of losartan and its active metabolite are approximately equal, the AUC
of the metabolite is about 4 times as great as that of losartan. A meal
slows absorption of losartan and decreases its Cmax but has only minor
effects on losartan AUC or on the AUC of the metabolite (about 10% decreased).
</p>

<p>Both losartan and its active metabolite are highly bound to plasma proteins,
primarily albumin, with plasma free fractions of 1.3% and 0.2% respectively.
Plasma protein binding is constant over the concentration range achieved
with recommended doses. Studies in rats indicate that losartan crosses
the blood- brain barrier poorly, if at all. </p>

<p>Losartan metabolites have been identified in human plasma and urine.
In addition to the active carboxylic acid metabolite, several inactive
metabolites are formed. Following oral and intravenous administration of
14C-labeled losartan potassium, circulating plasma radioactivity is primarily
attributed to losartan and its active metabolite. In Vitro studies indicate
that cytochrome P450 2C9 and 3A4 are involved in the biotransformation
of losartan to its metabolites. Minimal conversion of losartan to the active
metabolite (less than 1% of the dose compared to 14% of the dose in normal
subjects) was seen in about one percent of individuals studied. </p>

<p>The volume of distribution of losartan is about 34 liters and of the
active metabolite is about 12 liters. Total plasma clearance of losartan
and the active metabolite is about 600 mL/min and 50 mL/min, respectively,
with renal clearance of about 75 mL/min and 25 mL/min, respectively. When
losartan is administered orally, about 4% of the dose is excreted unchanged
in the urine and about 6% is excreted in urine as active metabolite. Biliary
excretion contributes to the elimination of losartan and its metabolites.
Following oral 14C-labeled losartan, about 35% of radioactivity is recovered
in the urine and about 60% in the feces. Following an intravenous dose
of 14C- labeled losartan, about 45% of radioactivity is recovered in the
urine and 50% in the feces. </p>

<p>Special Populations </p>

<p>Pediatric: Losartan pharmacokinetics have not been investigated in patients
&lt;18 years of age. </p>

<p>Geriatric And Gender: Losartan pharmacokinetics have been investigated
in the elderly (65-75 years) and in both genders. Plasma concentrations
of losartan and its active metabolite are similar in elderly and young
hypertensives. Plasma concentrations of losartan were about twice as high
in female hypertensives as male hypertensives, but concentrations of the
active metabolite were similar in males and females. </p>

<p>Race: Pharmacokinetic differences due to race have not been studied.
Renal Insufficiency: Plasma concentrations of losartan are not altered
in patients with creatinine clearance above 30 mL/min. In patients with
lower creatinine clearance, AUCs are about 50% greater and are doubled
in hemodialysis patients. Plasma concentrations of the active metabolite
are not significantly altered in patients with renal impairment or in hemodialysis
patients. Neither losartan nor its active metabolite can be removed by
hemodialysis. </p>

<p>Hepatic Insufficiency: Following oral administration in patients with
mild to moderate alcoholic cirrhosis of the liver, plasma concentrations
of losartan and its active metabolite were, respectively, 5 times and about
1.7 times those in young male volunteers. Compared to normal subjects the
total plasma clearance of losartan in patients with hepatic insufficiency
was about 50% lower and the oral bioavailability was about 2-times higher.
The lower starting dose of losartan recommended for use in patients with
hepatic impairment cannot be given using Losartan/HCTZ. Its use in such
patients as a means of losartan titration is, therefore, not recommended
(see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). </p>

<p>Drug Interactions </p>

<p>Losartan Potassium </p>

<p>Losartan, administered for 12 days, did not affect the pharmacokinetics
or pharmacodynamics of a single dose of warfarin. Losartan did not affect
the pharmacokinetics of oral or intravenous digoxin. Coadministration of
losartan and cimetidine led to an increase of about 18% in AUC of losartan
but did not affect the pharmacokinetics of its active metabolite. Coadministration
of losartan and phenobarbital led to a reduction of about 20% in the AUC
of losartan and that of its active metabolite. There is no pharmacokinetic
interaction between losartan and hydrochlorothiazide. </p>

<p>Hydrochlorothiazide </p>

<p>After oral administration of hydrochlorothiazide, diuresis begins within
2 hours, peaks in about 4 hours and lasts about 6 to 12 hours. </p>

<p>Hydrochlorothiazide is not metabolized but is eliminated rapidly by
the kidney. When plasma levels have been followed for at least 24 hours,
the plasma half- life has been observed to vary between 5.6 and 14.8 hours.
At least 61 percent of the oral dose is eliminated unchanged within 24
hours. Hydrochlorothiazide crosses the placental but not the blood-brain
barrier and is excreted in breast milk. </p>

<p>Pharmacodynamics And Clinical Effects </p>

<p>Losartan Potassium </p>

<p>Losartan inhibits the pressor effect of angiotensin II (as well as angiotensin
I) infusions. A dose of 100 mg inhibits the pressor effect by about 85%
at peak with 25-40% inhibition persisting for 24 hours. Removal of the
negative feedback of angiotensin II causes a 2-3 fold rise in plasma renin
activity and consequent rise in angiotensin II plasma concentration in
hypertensive patients. Losartan does not affect the response to bradykinin,
whereas ACE inhibitors increase the response to bradykinin. Aldosterone
plasma concentrations fall following losartan administration. In spite
of the effect of losartan on aldosterone secretion, very little effect
on serum potassium was observed. </p>

<p>In a single-dose study in normal volunteers, losartan had no effects
on glomerular filtration rate, renal plasma flow or filtration fraction.
In multiple dose studies in hypertensive patients, there were no notable
effects on systemic or renal prostaglandin concentrations, fasting triglycerides,
total cholesterol or HDL- cholesterol or fasting glucose concentrations.
There was a small uricosuric effect leading to a minimal decrease in serum
uric acid (mean decrease &lt;0.4 mg/dL) during chronic oral administration.
</p>

<p>The antihypertensive effects of losartan were demonstrated principally
in 4 placebo-controlled 6-12 week trials of dosages from 10 to 150 mg per
day in patients with baseline diastolic blood pressures of 95-115. The
studies allowed comparisons of two doses (50-100 mg/day) as once- daily
or twice-daily regimens, comparisons of peak and trough effects, and comparisons
of response by gender, age, and race. Three additional studies examined
the antihypertensive effects of losartan and hydrochlorothiazide in combination.
</p>

<p>The 4 studies of losartan monotherapy included a total of 1075 patients
randomized to several doses of losartan and 334 to placebo. The 10 and
25 mg doses produced some effect at peak (6 hours after dosing) but small
and inconsistent trough (24 hour) responses. Doses of 50, 100, and 150
mg once daily gave statistically significant systolic/diastolic mean decreases
in blood pressure, compared to placebo in the range of 5.5-10.5/3.5-7.5
mmHg, with the 150 mg dose giving no greater effect than 50-100 mg. Twice-
daily dosing at 50- 100 mg/day gave consistently larger trough responses
than once daily dosing at the same total dose. Peak (6 hour) effects were
uniformly, but moderately larger than trough effects, with the trough to
peak ratio for systolic and diastolic responses 50-95% and 60-90% respectively.
</p>

<p>Analysis of age, gender, and race subgroups of patients showed that
men and women, and patients over and under 65, had generally similar responses.
Black patients, however, had notably smaller responses to losartan monotherapy.
The effect of losartan is substantially present within one week but in
some studies the maximal effect occurred in 3-6 weeks. In long-term follow-up
studies (without placebo control) the effect of losartan appeared to be
maintained for up to a year. There is no apparent rebound effect after
abrupt withdrawal of losartan. There was essentially no change in average
heart rate in losartan- treated patients in controlled trials. </p>

<p>The 3 controlled studies of losartan and hydrochlorothiazide included
over 1300 patients assessing the antihypertensive efficacy of various doses
of losartan (25, 50 and 100 mg) and concomitant hydrochlorothiazide (6.25,
12.5 and 25 mg). A factorial study compared the combination of losartan/hydrochlorothiazide
50/12.5 mg with its components and placebo. The combination of losartan/hydrochlorothiazide
50/12.5 mg resulted in an approximately additive placebo-adjusted systolic/diastolic
response (15.5/9.0 mmHg for the combination compared to 8.5/5.0 mmHg for
losartan alone and 7.0/3.0 mmHg for hydrochlorothiazide alone). Another
study investigated the dose-response relationship of various doses of hydrochlorothiazide
(6.25, 12.5 and 25 mg) or placebo on a background of losartan (50 mg) in
patients not adequately controlled (SiDBP 93-120 mmHg) on losartan (50
mg) alone. The third study investigated the dose-response relationship
of various doses of losartan (25, 50 and 100 mg) or placebo on a background
of hydrochlorothiazide (25 mg) in patients not adequately controlled (SiDBP
93-120 mmHg) on hydrochlorothiazide (25 mg) alone. These studies showed
an added antihypertensive response at trough (24 hours post-dosing) of
hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 or 25 mg added to losartan 50 mg of 5.5/3.5 and
10.0/6.0 mmHg, respectively. Similarly, there was an added antihypertensive
response at trough when losartan 50 or 100 mg was added to hydrochlorothiazide
25 mg of 9.0/5.5 and 12.5/6.5 mmHg, respectively. There was no significant
effect on heart rate. </p>

<p>There was no difference in response for men and women or in patients
over or under 65 years of age. </p>

<p>Black patients had a larger response to hydrochlorothiazide than non-black
patients and a smaller response to losartan. The overall response to the
combination was similar for black and non-black patients. </p>

<p>Fetal/Neonatal Morbidity And Mortality </p>

<p>Drugs that act directly on the renin-angiotensin system can cause fetal
and neonatal morbidity and death when administered to pregnant women. Several
dozen cases have been reported in the world literature in patients who
were taking angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. When pregnancy is
detected, Losartan/HCTZ should be discontinued as soon as possible. </p>

<p>The use of drugs that act directly on the renin- angiotensin system
during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy has been associated
with fetal and neonatal injury, including hypotension, neonatal skull hypoplasia,
anuria, reversible or irreversible renal failure, and death. Oligohydramnios
has also been reported, presumably resulting from decreased fetal renal
function; oligohydramnios in this setting has been associated with fetal
limb contractures, craniofacial deformation, and hypoplastic lung development.
Prematurity, intrauterine growth retardation, and patent ductus arteriosus
have also been reported, although it is not clear whether these occurrences
were due to exposure to the drug. </p>

<p>These adverse effects do not appear to have resulted from intrauterine
drug exposure that has been limited to the first trimester. </p>

<p>Mothers whose embryos and fetuses are exposed to an angiotensin II receptor
antagonist only during the first trimester should be so informed. Nonetheless,
when patients become pregnant, physicians should have the patient discontinue
the use of Losartan/HCTZ as soon as possible. </p>

<p>Rarely (probably less often than once in every thousand pregnancies),
no alternative to an angiotensin II receptor antagonist will be found.
In these rare cases, the mothers should be apprised of the potential hazards
to their fetuses, and serial ultrasound examinations should be performed
to assess the intra-amniotic environment. </p>

<p>If oligohydramnios is observed, Losartan/HCTZ should be discontinued
unless it is considered life-saving for the mother. Contraction stress
testing (CST), a non- stress test (NST), or biophysical profiling (BPP)
may be appropriate, depending upon the week of pregnancy. Patients and
physicians should be aware, however, that oligohydramnios may not appear
until after the fetus has sustained irreversible injury. </p>

<p>Infants with histories of In Utero exposure to an angiotensin II receptor
antagonist should be closely observed for hypotension, oliguria, and hyperkalemia.
If oliguria occurs, attention should be directed toward support of blood
pressure and renal perfusion. Exchange transfusion or dialysis may be required
as means of reversing hypotension and/or substituting for disordered renal
function. </p>

<p>There was no evidence of teratogenicity in rats or rabbits treated with
a maximum losartan potassium dose of 10 mg/kg/day in combination with 2.5
mg/kg/day of hydrochlorothiazide. At these dosages, respective exposures
(AUCs) of losartan, its active metabolite, and hydrochlorothiazide in rabbits
were approximately 5-, 1.5-, and 1.0-times those achieved in humans with
100 mg losartan in combination with 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide. AUC values
for losartan, its active metabolite and hydrochlorothiazide, extrapolated
from data obtained with losartan administered to rats at a dose of 50 mg/kg/day
in combination with 12.5 mg/kg/day of hydrochlorothiazide, were approximately
6, 2, and 2 times greater than those achieved in humans with 100 mg of
losartan in combination with 25 mg of hydrochlorothiazide. Fetal toxicity
in rats, as evidenced by a slight increase in supernumerary ribs, was observed
when females were treated prior to and throughout gestation with 10 mg/kg/day
losartan in combination with 2.5 mg/kg/day hydrochlorothiazide. As also
observed in studies with losartan alone, adverse fetal and neonatal effects,
including decreased body weight, renal toxicity, and mortality, occurred
when pregnant rats were treated during late gestation and/or lactation
with 50 mg/kg/day losartan in combination with 12.5 mg/kg/day hydrochlorothiazide.
Respective AUCs for losartan, its active metabolite and hydrochlorothiazide
at these dosages in rats were approximately 35, 10 and 10 times greater
than those achieved in humans with the administration of 100 mg of losartan
in combination with 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide. When hydrochlorothiazide
was administered without losartan to pregnant mice and rats during their
respective periods of major organogenesis, at doses up to 3000 and 1000
mg/kg/day, respectively, there was no evidence of harm to the fetus. </p>

<p>Thiazides cross the placental barrier and appear in cord blood. There
is a risk of fetal or neonatal jaundice, thrombocytopenia, and possibly
other adverse reactions that have occurred in adults. </p>

<p>Hypotension--Volume-Depleted Patients </p>

<p>In patients who are intravascularly volume- depleted (e.g., those treated
with diuretics), symptomatic hypotension may occur after initiation of
therapy with Losartan/HCTZ. This condition should be corrected prior to
administration of Losartan/HCTZ (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). </p>

<p>Impaired Hepatic Function </p>

<p>Losartan Potassium-Hydrochlorothiazide </p>

<p>Losartan/HCTZ is not recommended for patients with hepatic impairment
who require titration with losartan. The lower starting dose of losartan
recommended for use in patients with hepatic impairment cannot be given
using Losartan/HCTZ. Hydrochlorothiazide </p>

<p>Thiazides should be used with caution in patients with impaired hepatic
function or progressive liver disease, since minor alterations of fluid
and electrolyte balance may precipitate hepatic coma. </p>

<p>Hypersensitivity Reaction </p>

<p>Hypersensitivity reactions to hydrochlorothiazide may occur in patients
with or without a history of allergy or bronchial asthma, but are more
likely in patients with such a history. </p>

<p>Systemic Lupus Erythematosus </p>

<p>Thiazide diuretics have been reported to cause exacerbation or activation
of systemic lupus erythematosus. </p>

<p>Lithium Interaction </p>

<p>Lithium generally should not be given with thiazides (see PRECAUTIONS,
Drug Interactions, Hydrochlorothiazide, Lithium). </p>

<p>General </p>

<p>Losartan Potassium-Hydrochlorothiazide </p>

<p>In double-blind clinical trials of various doses of losartan potassium
and hydrochlorothiazide, the incidence of hypertensive patients who developed
hypokalemia (serum potassium &lt;3.5 mEq/L) was 6.7% versus 3.5% for placebo;
the incidence of hyperkalemia (serum potassium &gt;5.7 mEq/L) was 0.4%.
No patient discontinued due to increases or decreases in serum potassium.
The mean decrease in serum potassium in patients treated with various doses
of losartan and hydrochlorothiazide was 0.123 mEq/L. In patients treated
with various doses of losartan and hydrochlorothiazide, there was also
a dose- related decrease in the hypokalemic response to hydrochlorothiazide
as the dose of losartan was increased, as well as a dose-related decrease
in serum uric acid with increasing doses of losartan. </p>

<p>Hypersensitivity. See ADVERSE REACTIONS, Post- Marketing Experience.
</p>

<p>Hydrochlorothiazide </p>

<p>Periodic determination of serum electrolytes to detect possible electrolyte
imbalance should be performed at appropriate intervals. </p>

<p>All patients receiving thiazide therapy should be observed for clinical
signs of fluid or electrolyte imbalance: hyponatremia, hypochloremic alkalosis,
and hypokalemia. Serum and urine electrolyte determinations are particularly
important when the patient is vomiting excessively or receiving parenteral
fluids. Warning signs or symptoms of fluid and electrolyte imbalance, irrespective
of cause, include dryness of mouth, thirst, weakness, lethargy, drowsiness,
restlessness, confusion, seizures, muscle pains or cramps, muscular fatigue,
hypotension, oliguria, tachycardia, and gastrointestinal disturbances such
as nausea and vomiting. </p>

<p>Hypokalemia may develop, especially with brisk diuresis, when severe
cirrhosis is present, or after prolonged therapy. </p>

<p>Interference with adequate oral electrolyte intake will also contribute
to hypokalemia. Hypokalemia may cause cardiac arrhythmia and may also sensitize
or exaggerate the response of the heart to the toxic effects of digitalis
(e.g., increased ventricular irritability). </p>

<p>Although any chloride deficit is generally mild and usually does not
require specific treatment except under extraordinary circumstances (as
in liver disease or renal disease), chloride replacement may be required
in the treatment of metabolic alkalosis. </p>

<p>Dilutional hyponatremia may occur in edematous patients in hot weather;
appropriate therapy is water restriction, rather than administration of
salt except in rare instances when the hyponatremia is life-threatening.
In actual salt depletion, appropriate replacement is the therapy of choice.
</p>

<p>Hyperuricemia may occur or frank gout may be precipitated in certain
patients receiving thiazide therapy. Because losartan decreases uric acid,
losartan in combination with hydrochlorothiazide attenuates the diuretic-
induced hyperuricemia. </p>

<p>In diabetic patients dosage adjustments of insulin or oral hypoglycemic
agents may be required. Hyperglycemia may occur with thiazide diuretics.
Thus latent diabetes mellitus may become manifest during thiazide therapy.
The antihypertensive effects of the drug may be enhanced in the postsympathectomy
patient. </p>

<p>If progressive renal impairment becomes evident consider withholding
or discontinuing diuretic therapy. </p>

<p>Thiazides have been shown to increase the urinary excretion of magnesium;
this may result in hypomagnesemia. </p>

<p>Thiazides may decrease urinary calcium excretion. Thiazides may cause
intermittent and slight elevation of serum calcium in the absence of known
disorders of calcium metabolism. Marked hypercalcemia may be evidence of
hidden hyperparathyroidism. Thiazides should be discontinued before carrying
out tests for parathyroid function. </p>

<p>Increases in cholesterol and triglyceride levels may be associated with
thiazide diuretic therapy. </p>

<p>Impaired Renal Function </p>

<p>As a consequence of inhibiting the renin- angiotensin-aldosterone system,
changes in renal function may be anticipated in susceptible individuals.
In patients whose renal function may depend on the activity of the renin-
angiotensin- aldosterone system (e.g., patients with severe congestive
heart failure), treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors
has been associated with oliguria and/or progressive azotemia and (rarely)
with acute renal failure and/or death. Losartan would be expected to behave
similarly. In studies of ACE inhibitors in patients with unilateral or
bilateral renal artery stenosis, increases in serum creatinine or BUN have
been reported. There has been no known use of losartan in patients with
unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis, but a similar effect should
be anticipated. </p>

<p>Thiazides should be used with caution in severe renal disease. In patients
with renal disease, thiazides may precipitate azotemia. Cumulative effects
of the drug may develop in patients with impaired renal function. </p>

<p>Information For Patients </p>

<p>Pregnancy: Female patients of childbearing age should be told about
the consequences of second- and third-trimester exposure to drugs that
act on the renin-angiotensin system, and they should also be told that
these consequences do not appear to have resulted from intrauterine drug
exposure that has been limited to the first trimester. These patients should
be asked to report pregnancies to their physicians as soon as possible.
</p>

<p>Symptomatic Hypotension: A patient receiving Losartan/HCTZ should be
cautioned that lightheadedness can occur, especially during the first days
of therapy, and that it should be reported to the prescribing physician.
The patients should be told that if syncope occurs, Losartan/HCTZ should
be discontinued until the physician has been consulted. </p>

<p>All patients should be cautioned that inadequate fluid intake, excessive
perspiration, diarrhea, or vomiting can lead to an excessive fall in blood
pressure, with the same consequences of lightheadedness and possible syncope.
Potassium Supplements: A patient receiving Losartan/HCTZ should be told
not to use potassium supplements or salt substitutes containing potassium
without consulting the prescribing physician. </p>

<p>Drug Interactions </p>

<p>Losartan Potassium </p>

<p>No significant drug-drug pharmacokinetic interactions have been found
in interaction studies with hydrochlorothiazide, digoxin, warfarin, cimetidine
and phenobarbital. (See ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Drug Interactions.)
Potent inhibitors of cytochrome P450 3A4 and 2C9 have not been studied
clinically but In Vitro studies show significant inhibition of the formation
of the active metabolite by inhibitors of P450 3A4 (ketoconazole, troleandomycin,
gestodene), or P450 2C9 (sulfaphenazole) and nearly complete inhibition
by the combination of sulfaphenazole and ketoconazole. The pharmacodynamic
consequences of concomitant use of losartan and these inhibitors have not
been examined. Hydrochlorothiazide </p>

<p>When administered concurrently the following drugs may interact with
thiazide diuretics: </p>

<p>Alcohol, Barbiturates, Or Narcotics--potentiation of orthostatic hypotension
may occur. </p>

<p>Antidiabetic Drugs (oral agents and insulin)--dosage adjustment of the
antidiabetic drug may be required. </p>

<p>Other Antihypertensive Drugs--additive effect or potentiation. </p>

<p>Cholestyramine And Colestipol Resins--Absorption of hydrochlorothiazide
is impaired in the presence of anionic exchange resins. Single doses of
either cholestyramine or colestipol resins bind the hydrochlorothiazide
and reduce its absorption from the gastrointestinal tract by up to 85 and
43 percent, respectively. </p>

<p>Corticosteroids, ACTH--intensified electrolyte depletion, particularly
hypokalemia. </p>

<p>Pressor Amines (e.g., Norepinephrine)--possible decreased response to
pressor amines but not sufficient to preclude their use. </p>

<p>Skeletal Muscle Relaxants, Nondepolarizing (e.g., Tubocurarine)--possible
increased responsiveness to the muscle relaxant. </p>

<p>Lithium--should not generally be given with diuretics. Diuretic agents
reduce the renal clearance of lithium and add a high risk of lithium toxicity.
Refer to the package insert for lithium preparations before use of such
preparations with Losartan/HCTZ. </p>

<p>Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs--In some patients, the administration
of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent can reduce the diuretic, natriuretic,
and antihypertensive effects of loop, potassium-sparing and thiazide diuretics.
Therefore, when Losartan/HCTZ and non-steroidal anti- inflammatory agents
are used concomitantly, the patient should be observed closely to determine
if the desired effect of the diuretic is obtained. </p>

<p>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment Of Fertility </p>

<p>Losartan Potassium-Hydrochlorothiazide </p>

<p>No carcinogenicity studies have been conducted with the losartan potassium-
hydrochlorothiazide combination. </p>

<p>Losartan potassium-hydrochlorothiazide when tested at a weight ratio
of 4:1, was negative in the Ames microbial mutagenesis assay and the V-79
Chinese hamster lung cell mutagenesis assay. In addition, there was no
evidence of direct genotoxicity in the In Vitro alkaline elution assay
in rat hepatocytes and In Vitro chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese
hamster ovary cells at noncytotoxic concentrations. </p>

<p>Losartan potassium, coadministered with hydrochlorothiazide, had no
effect on the fertility or mating behavior of male rats of dosages up to
135 mg/kg/day of losartan and 33.75mg/kg/day of hydrochlorothiazide. These
dosages have been shown to provide respective systemic exposures (AUCs)
for losartan, its active metabolite and hydrochlorothiazide that are approximately
60, 60 and 30 times greater than those achieved in humans with 100 mg of
losartan potassium in combination with 25 mg of hydrochlorothiazide. In
female rats, however, the coadministration of doses as low as 10 mg/kg/day
of losartan and 2.5 mg/kg/day of hydrochlorothiazide was associated with
slight but statistically significant decreases in fecundity and fertility
indices. AUC values for losartan, its active metabolite and hydrochlorothiazide,
extrapolated from data obtained with losartan administered to rats at a
dose of 50 mg/kg/day in combination with 12.5 mg/kg/day of hydrochlorothiazide,
were approximately 6, 2, and 2 times greater than those achieved in humans
with 100 mg of losartan in combination with 25 mg of hydrochlorothiazide.
</p>

<p>Losartan Potassium </p>

<p>Losartan potassium was not carcinogenic when administered at maximally
tolerated dosages to rats and mice for 105 and 92 weeks, respectively.
Female rats given the highest dose (270 mg/kg/day) had a slightly higher
incidence of pancreatic acinar adenoma. The maximally tolerated dosages
(270 mg/kg/day in rats, 200 mg/kg/day in mice) provided systemic exposures
for losartan and its pharmacologically active metabolite that were approximately
160 and 90 times (rats) and 30 and 15 times (mice) the exposure of a 50
kg human given 100 mg per day. </p>

<p>Losartan potassium was negative in the microbial mutagenesis and V-79
mammalian cell mutagenesis assays and in the In Vitro alkaline elution
and In Vitro and In Vivo chromosomal aberration assays. In addition, the
active metabolite showed no evidence of genotoxicity in the microbial mutagenesis,
In Vitro alkaline elution, and In Vitro chromosomal aberration assays.
</p>

<p>Fertility and reproductive performance were not affected in studies
with male rats given oral doses of losartan potassium up to approximately
150 mg/kg/day. </p>

<p>The administration of toxic dosage levels in females (300/200 mg/kg/day)
was associated with a significant (p&lt;0.05) decrease in the number of
corpora lutea/female, implants/female, and live fetuses/female at C- section.
At 100 mg/kg/day only a decrease in the number of corpora lutea/female
was observed. </p>

<p>The relationship of these findings to drug-treatment is uncertain since
there was no effect at these dosage levels on implants/pregnant female,
percent post- implantation loss, or live animals/litter at parturition.
In nonpregnant rats dosed at 135 mg/kg/day for 7 days, systemic exposure
(AUCs) for losartan and its active metabolite were approximately 66 and
26 times the exposure achieved in man at the maximum recommended human
daily dosage (100 mg). </p>

<p>Hydrochlorothiazide </p>

<p>Two-year feeding studies in mice and rats conducted under the auspices
of the National Toxicology Program (NTP) uncovered no evidence of a carcinogenic
potential of hydrochlorothiazide in female mice (at doses of up to approximately
600 mg/kg/day) or in male and female rats (at doses of up to approximately
100 mg/kg/day). The NTP, however, found equivocal evidence for hepatocarcinogenicity
in male mice. </p>

<p>Hydrochlorothiazide was not genotoxic In Vitro in the Ames mutagenicity
assay of Salmonella Typhimurium strains TA 98, TA 100, TA 1535, TA 1537,
and TA 1538 and in the Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) test for chromosomal
aberrations, or In Vivo in assays using mouse germinal cell chromosomes,
Chinese hamster bone marrow chromosomes, and the Drosophila sex-linked
recessive lethal trait gene. Positive test results were obtained only in
the In Vitro CHO Sister Chromatid Exchange (clastogenicity) and in the
Mouse Lymphoma Cell (mutagenicity) assays, using concentrations of hydrochlorothiazide
from 43 to 1300 mcgm/mL, and in the Aspergillus Nidulans non-disjunction
assay at an unspecified concentration. Hydrochlorothiazide had no adverse
effects on the fertility of mice and rats of either sex in studies wherein
these species were exposed, via their diet, to doses of up to 100 and 4
mg/kg, respectively, prior to mating and throughout gestation. </p>

<p>Pregnancy </p>

<p>Pregnancy Categories C (first trimester) and D (second and third trimesters).
See WARNINGS, Fetal/Neonatal Morbidity And Mortality. </p>

<p>Nursing Mothers </p>

<p>It is not known whether losartan is excreted in human milk, but significant
levels of losartan and its active metabolite were shown to be present in
rat milk. Thiazides appear in human milk. Because of the potential for
adverse effects on the nursing infant, a decision should be made whether
to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the
importance of the drug to the mother. </p>

<p>Pediatric Use </p>

<p>Safety and effectiveness in children have not been established. </p>

<p>Use In The Elderly </p>

<p>Of the total number of patients in controlled clinical studies of hypertension
with Losartan/HCTZ, 107 patients (12.5%) were 65 years and over, while
9 patients (1.0%) were 75 years and over. No overall differences in effectiveness
or safety were observed between these patients and younger patients, but
greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. </p>

<p>Post-Marketing Experience </p>

<p>The following adverse reactions have been reported in post-marketing
experience: Hypersensitivity: Angioedema (involving swelling of the face,
lips, and/or tongue) has been reported rarely in patients treated with
losartan. </p>

<p>Laboratory Test Findings </p>

<p>In controlled clinical trials, clinically important changes in standard
laboratory parameters were rarely associated with administration of Losartan/HCTZ.
Creatinine, Blood Urea Nitrogen: Minor increases in blood urea nitrogen
(BUN) or serum creatinine were observed in 0.6 and 0.8 percent, respectively,
of patients with essential hypertension treated with Losartan/HCTZ alone.
No patient discontinued taking Losartan/HCTZ due to increased BUN. One
patient discontinued taking Losartan/HCTZ due to a minor increase in serum
creatinine. </p>

<p>Hemoglobin And Hematocrit: Small decreases in hemoglobin and hematocrit
(mean decreases of approximately 0.14 grams percent and 0.72 volume percent,
respectively) occurred frequently in patients treated with Losartan/HCTZ
alone, but were rarely of clinical importance. No patients were discontinued
due to anemia. </p>

<p>Liver Function Tests: Occasional elevations of liver enzymes and/or
serum bilirubin have occurred. In patients with essential hypertension
treated with Losartan/HCTZ alone, no patients were discontinued due to
these laboratory adverse experiences. </p>

<p>Serum Electrolytes: See PRECAUTIONS. </p>

<p><a name="OVERDOSAGE"></a><b>OVERDOSAGE </b></p>

<p>Losartan Potassium </p>

<p>Significant lethality was observed in mice and rats after oral administration
of 1000 mg/kg and 2000 mg/kg, respectively, about 44 and 170 times the
maximum recommended human dose on a mg/M(squared) basis. </p>

<p>Limited data are available in regard to overdosage in humans. The most
likely manifestation of overdosage would be hypotension and tachycardia;
bradycardia could occur from parasympathetic (vagal) stimulation. If symptomatic
hypotension should occur, supportive treatment should be instituted. </p>

<p>Neither losartan nor its active metabolite can be removed by hemodialysis.
</p>

<p>Hydrochlorothiazide </p>

<p>The oral LD50 of hydrochlorothiazide is greater than 10 g/kg in both
mice and rats. The most common signs and symptoms observed are those caused
by electrolyte depletion (hypokalemia, hypochloremia, hyponatremia) and
dehydration resulting from excessive diuresis. If digitalis has also been
administered, hypokalemia may accentuate cardiac arrhythmias. The degree
to which hydrochlorothiazide is removed by hemodialysis has not been established.
</p>

<p><a name="DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION"></a><b>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
</b></p>

<p>The usual starting dose of losartan is 50 mg once daily, with 25 mg
recommended for patients with intravascular volume depletion (e.g., patients
treated with diuretics) (see WARNINGS, Hypotension--Volume-Depleted Patients)
and patients with a history of hepatic impairment (see WARNINGS, Impaired
Hepatic Function). </p>

<p>Losartan can be administered once or twice daily at total daily doses
of 25 to 100 mg. If the antihypertensive effect measured at trough using
once-a-day dosing is inadequate, a twice-a-day regimen at the same total
daily dose or an increase in dose may give a more satisfactory response.
</p>

<p>Hydrochlorothiazide is effective in doses of 12.5 to 100 mg once daily
and can be given at doses of 12.5 to 25 mg as Losartan/HCTZ. </p>

<p>To minimize dose-independent side effects, it is usually appropriate
to begin combination therapy only after a patient has failed to achieve
the desired effect with monotherapy. </p>

<p>The side effects (see WARNINGS) of losartan are generally rare and apparently
independent of dose; those of hydrochlorothiazide are a mixture of dose-
dependent (primarily hypokalemia) and dose-independent phenomena (e.g.,
pancreatitis), the former much more common than the latter. Therapy with
any combination of losartan and hydrochlorothiazide will be associated
with both sets of dose-independent side effects. </p>

<p>REPLACEMENT THERAPY: The combination may be substituted for the titrated
components. </p>

<p>DOSE TITRATION BY CLINICAL EFFECT: A patient whose blood pressure is
not adequately controlled with losartan monotherapy (see above) may be
switched to Losartan/HCTZ (losartan 50 mg/hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg)
once daily. If blood pressure remains uncontrolled after about 3 weeks
of therapy, the dose may be increased to two tablets once daily. </p>

<p>A patient whose blood pressure is inadequately controlled by 25 mg once
daily of hydrochlorothiazide, or is controlled but who experiences hypokalemia
with this regimen, may be switched to Losartan/HCTZ (losartan 50 mg/hydrochlorothiazide
12.5 mg) once daily, reducing the dose of hydrochlorothiazide without reducing
the overall expected antihypertensive response. The clinical response to
Losartan/HCTZ should be subsequently evaluated and if blood pressure remains
uncontrolled after about 3 weeks of therapy, the dose may be increased
to two tablets once daily. </p>

<p>The usual dose of Losartan/HCTZ is one tablet once daily. More than
two tablets once daily is not recommended. The maximal antihypertensive
effect is attained about 3 weeks after initiation of therapy. </p>

<p>USE IN PATIENTS WITH RENAL IMPAIRMENT: The usual regimens of therapy
with Losartan/HCTZ may be followed as long as the patient's creatinine
clearance is &gt;30 mL/min. In patients with more severe renal impairment,
loop diuretics are preferred to thiazides, so Losartan/HCTZ is not recommended.
</p>

<p>PATIENTS WITH HEPATIC IMPAIRMENT: Losartan/HCTZ is not recommended for
titration in patients with hepatic impairment (see WARNINGS, Impaired Hepatic
Function) because the appropriate 25 mg starting dose of losartan cannot
be given. </p>

<p>Losartan/HCTZ may be administered with other antihypertensive agents.
</p>

<p>Losartan/HCTZ may be administered with or without food. </p>

<p>Misoprostol oral tablets contain either 100 mcg or 200 mcg of misoprostol,
a synthetic prostaglandin E1 analog. Misoprostol contains approximately
equal amounts of the two diastereomers presented below with their enantiomers
indicated by (+/-): C22H38O5: M.W. = 382.5 (+/-) methyl 11alpha, 16-dihydroxy-16-methyl-9-oxoprost-13E-en-1-oate
</p>

<p>Misoprostol is a water-soluble, viscous liquid. </p>

<p><a name="ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY"></a><b>ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
</b></p>

<p>PHARMACOKINETICS: Misoprostol is extensively absorbed, and undergoes
rapid de- esterification to its free acid, which is responsible for its
clinical activity and, unlike the parent compound, is detectable in plasma.
The alpha side chain undergoes beta oxidation and the beta side chain undergoes
omega oxidation followed by reduction of the ketone to give prostaglandin
F analogs. In normal volunteers, Misoprostol is rapidly absorbed after
oral administration with a Tmax of misoprostol acid of 12 +/- 3 minutes
and a terminal half-life of 20-40 minutes. </p>

<p>There is high variability of plasma levels of misoprostol acid between
and within studies but mean values after single doses show a linear relationship
with dose over the range of 200-400 mcg. No accumulation of misoprostol
acid was noted in multiple dose studies; plasma steady state was achieved
within two days. </p>

<p>Maximum plasma concentrations of misoprostol acid are diminished when
the dose is taken with food and total availability of misoprostol acid
is reduced by use of concomitant antacid. Clinical trials were conducted
with concomitant antacid, however, so this effect does not appear to be
clinically important.</p>

                    significant, p&lt;0.05.</pre>

<p>After oral administration of radiolabeled misoprostol, about 80% of
detected radioactivity appears in urine. Pharmacokinetic studies in patients
with varying degrees of renal impairment showed an approximate doubling
of T1/2, Cmax, and AUC compared to normals, but no clear correlation between
the degree of impairment and AUC. In subjects over 64 years of age, the
AUC for misoprostol acid is increased. No routine dosage adjustment is
recommended in older patients or patients with renal impairment, but dosage
may need to be reduced if the usual dose is not tolerated. </p>

<p>Misoprostol does not affect the hepatic mixed function oxidase (cytochrome
P-450) enzyme systems in animals. </p>

<p>Drug interaction studies between misoprostol and several nonsteroidal
anti- inflammatory drugs showed no effect on the kinetics of ibuprofen
or diclofenac, and a 20% decrease in aspirin AUC, not thought to be clinically
significant. Pharmacokinetic studies also showed a lack of drug interaction
with antipyrine and propranolol when these drugs were given with misoprostol.
Misoprostol given for one week had no effect on the steady state pharmacokinetics
of diazepam when the two drugs were administered two hours apart. </p>

<p>The serum protein binding of misoprostol acid is less than 90% and is
concentration-independent in the therapeutic range. </p>

<p>PHARMACODYNAMICS: Misoprostol has both antisecretory (inhibiting gastric
acid secretion) and (in animals) mucosal protective properties. NSAIDs
inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, and a deficiency of prostaglandins within
the gastric mucosa may lead to diminishing bicarbonate and mucus secretion
and may contribute to the mucosal damage caused by these agents. Misoprostol
can increase bicarbonate and mucus production, but in man this has been
shown at doses 200 mcg and above that are also antisecretory. It is therefore
not possible to tell whether the ability of misoprostol to prevent gastric
ulcer is the result of its antisecretory effect, its mucosal protective
effect, or both. In Vitro studies on canine parietal cells using tritiated
misoprostol acid as the ligand have led to the identification and characterization
of specific prostaglandin receptors. Receptor binding is saturable, reversible,
and stereospecific. The sites have a high affinity for misoprostol, for
its acid metabolite, and for other E type prostaglandins, but not for F
or I prostaglandins and other unrelated compounds, such as histamine or
cimetidine. Receptor-site affinity for misoprostol correlates well with
an indirect index of antisecretory activity. It is likely that these specific
receptors allow misoprostol taken with food to be effective topically,
despite the lower serum concentrations attained. </p>

<p>Misoprostol produces a moderate decrease in pepsin concentration during
basal conditions, but not during histamine stimulation. It has no significant
effect on fasting or postprandial gastrin nor on intrinsic factor output.
</p>

<p>EFFECTS ON GASTRIC ACID SECRETION: Misoprostol, over the range of 50-200
mcg, inhibits basal and nocturnal gastric acid secretion, and acid secretion
in response to a variety of stimuli, including meals, histamine, pentagastrin,
and coffee. Activity is apparent 30 minutes after oral administration and
persists for at least 3 hours. In general, the effects of 50 mcg were modest
and shorter lived, and only the 200-mcg dose had substantial effects on
nocturnal secretion or on histamine and meal-stimulated secretion. </p>

<p>UTERINE EFFECTS: Misoprostol has been shown to produce uterine contractions
that may endanger pregnancy. (See Contraindications and Warnings.) In studies
in women undergoing elective termination of pregnancy during the first
trimester, Misoprostol caused partial or complete expulsion of the uterine
contents in 11% of the subjects and increased uterine bleeding in 41%.
</p>

<p>OTHER PHARMACOLOGIC EFFECTS: Misoprostol does not produce clinically
significant effects on serum levels of prolactin, gonadotropins, thyroid-
stimulating hormone, growth hormone, thyroxine, cortisol, gastrointestinal
hormones (somatostatin, gastrin, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, and
motilin), creatinine, or uric acid. Gastric emptying, immunologic competence,
platelet aggregation, pulmonary function, or the cardiovascular system
are not modified by recommended doses of Misoprostol. </p>

<p>CLINICAL STUDIES: In a series of small short-term (about one week) placebo-
controlled studies in healthy human volunteers, doses of misoprostol were
evaluated for their ability to prevent NSAID-induced mucosal injury. Studies
of 200 mcg q.i.d. of misoprostol with tolmetin and naproxen, and of 100
and 200 mcg q.i.d. with ibuprofen, all showed reduction of the rate of
significant endoscopic injury from about 70-75% on placebo to 10-30% on
misoprostol. Doses of 25-200 mcg q.i.d. reduced aspirin-induced mucosal
injury and bleeding. </p>

<p>PREVENTING GASTRIC ULCERS CAUSED BY NONSTEROIDAL ANTI-INFLAMMATORY DRUGS
</p>

<p>(NSAIDS): Two 12-week, randomized, double-blind trials in osteoarthritic
patients who had gastrointestinal symptoms but no ulcer on endoscopy while
taking an NSAID compared the ability of 200 mcg of Misoprostol, 100 mcg
of Misoprostol, and placebo to prevent gastric ulcer (GU) formation. Patients
were approximately equally divided between ibuprofen, piroxicam, and naproxen,
and continued this treatment throughout the 12 weeks. The 200-mcg dose
caused a marked, statistically significant reduction in gastric ulcers
in both studies. The lower dose was somewhat less effective, with a significant
result in only one of the studies.</p>

** Combined data from Study No. 1 and Study No. 2.</pre>

<p>In these trials there were no significant differences between Misoprostol
and placebo in relief of day or night abdominal pain. No effect of Misoprostol
in preventing duodenal ulcers was demonstrated, but relatively few duodenal
lesions were seen. </p>

<p>In another clinical trial, 239 patients receiving aspirin 650-1300 mg
q.i.d. for rheumatoid arthritis who had endoscopic evidence of duodenal
and/or gastric inflammation were randomized to misoprostol 200 mcg q.i.d.
or placebo for eight weeks while continuing to receive aspirin. The study
evaluated the possible interference of Misoprostol on the efficacy of aspirin
in these patients with rheumatoid arthritis by analyzing joint tenderness,
joint swelling, physician's clinical assessment, patient's assessment,
change in ARA classification, change in handgrip strength, change in duration
of morning stiffness, patient's assessment of pain at rest, movement, interference
with daily activity, and ESR. Misoprostol did not interfere with the efficacy
of aspirin in these patients with rheumatoid arthritis. </p>

<p><a name="INDICATIONS AND USAGE"></a><b>INDICATIONS AND USAGE </b></p>

<p>Misoprostol is indicated for the prevention of NSAID (nonsteroidal anti-
inflammatory drugs, including aspirin)-induced gastric ulcers in patients
at high risk of complications from gastric ulcer, eg, the elderly and patients
with concomitant debilitating disease, as well as patients at high risk
of developing gastric ulceration, such as patients with a history of ulcer.
Misoprostol has not been shown to prevent duodenal ulcers in patients taking
NSAIDs. Misoprostol should be taken for the duration of NSAID therapy.
Misoprostol has been shown to prevent gastric ulcers in controlled studies
of three months' duration. It had no effect, compared to placebo, on gastrointestinal
pain or discomfort associated with NSAID use. </p>

<p><a name="PRECAUTIONS"></a><b>PRECAUTIONS </b></p>

<p>INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS: Misoprostol is contraindicated in women who
are pregnant, and should not be used in women of childbearing potential
unless the patient requires nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)
therapy and is at high risk of complications from gastric ulcers associated
with the use of the NSAID, or is at high risk of developing gastric ulceration.
Women of childbearing potential should be told that they must not be pregnant
when Misoprostol therapy is initiated, and that they must use an effective
contraception method while taking Misoprostol. See boxed CONTRAINDICATIONS
AND WARNINGS. </p>

<p>Patients should be advised of the following: </p>

<p>Misoprostol is intended for administration along with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs (NSAIDs), including aspirin, to decrease the chance of developing
an NSAID-induced gastric ulcer. </p>

<p>Misoprostol should be taken only according to the directions given by
a physician. If the patient has questions about or problems with Misoprostol,
the physician should be contacted promptly. </p>

<p>THE PATIENT SHOULD NOT GIVE Misoprostol TO ANYONE ELSE. Misoprostol
has been prescribed for the patient's specific condition, may not be the
correct treatment for another person, and may be dangerous to the other
person if she were to become pregnant. </p>

<p>The Misoprostol package the patient receives from the pharmacist will
include a <a href="misopro.htm#PATIENT PACKAGE INSERT">leaflet</a> containing
patient information. The patient should read the leaflet before taking
Misoprostol and each time the prescription is renewed because the leaflet
may have been revised. </p>

<p>Keep Misoprostol out of the reach of children. </p>

<p>SPECIAL NOTE FOR WOMEN: Misoprostol MUST NOT BE USED BY PREGNANT WOMEN.
Misoprostol MAY CAUSE MISCARRIAGE. MISCARRIAGES CAUSED BY Misoprostol MAY
BE INCOMPLETE, WHICH COULD LEAD TO POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS BLEEDING, HOSPITALIZATION,
SURGERY, INFERTILITY, OR MATERNAL OR FETAL DEATH. </p>

<p>Misoprostol is available only as a unit-of-use package that includes
a leaflet containing patient information. <a href="misopro.htm#PATIENT PACKAGE INSERT">See
Patient Information at the end of this labeling</a>. </p>

<p>DRUG INTERACTIONS: See Actions/Clinical Pharmacology. Misoprostol has
not been shown to interfere with the beneficial effects of aspirin on signs
and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis. Misoprostol does not exert clinically
significant effects on the absorption, blood levels, and antiplatelet effects
of therapeutic doses of aspirin. Misoprostol has no clinically significant
effect on the kinetics of diclofenac or ibuprofen. </p>

<p>ANIMAL TOXICOLOGY: A reversible increase in the number of normal surface
gastric epithelial cells occurred in the dog, rat, and mouse. No such increase
has been observed in humans administered Misoprostol for up to one year.
An apparent response of the female mouse to Misoprostol in long-term studies
at 100 to 1000 times the human dose was hyperostosis, mainly of the medulla
of sternebrae. Hyperostosis did not occur in long-term studies in the dog
and rat and has not been seen in humans treated with Misoprostol. </p>

<p>CARCINOGENESIS, MUTAGENESIS, IMPAIRMENT OF FERTILITY: There was no evidence
of an effect of Misoprostol on tumor occurrence or incidence in rats receiving
daily doses up to 150 times the human dose for 24 months. Similarly, there
was no effect of Misoprostol on tumor occurrence or incidence in mice receiving
daily doses up to 1000 times the human dose for 21 months. The mutagenic
potential of Misoprostol was tested in several In Vitro assays, all of
which were negative. Misoprostol, when administered to breeding male and
female rats at doses 6.25 times to 625 times the maximum recommended human
therapeutic dose, produced dose-related pre- and post-implantation losses
and a significant decrease in the number of live pups born at the highest
dose. These findings suggest the possibility of a general adverse effect
on fertility in males and females. </p>

<p>PREGNANCY: PREGNANCY CATEGORY X. See boxed CONTRAINDICATIONS AND WARNINGS.
</p>

<p>NONTERATOGENIC EFFECTS: Misoprostol may endanger pregnancy (may cause
miscarriage) and thereby cause harm to the fetus when administered to a
pregnant women. Misoprostol produces uterine contractions, uterine bleeding,
and expulsion of the products of conception. Miscarriages caused by Misoprostol
may be incomplete. In studies in women undergoing elective termination
of pregnancy during the first trimester, Misoprostol caused partial or
complete expulsion of the products of conception in 11% of the subjects
and increased uterine bleeding in 41%. Anecdotal reports, primarily from
Brazil, of congenital anomalies and reports of fetal death subsequent to
misuse of misoprostol as an abortifacient have been received (see Contraindications
and Warnings.) If a woman is or becomes pregnant while taking this drug,
the drug should be discontinued and the patient apprised of the potential
hazard to the fetus. </p>

<p>TERATOGENIC EFFECTS: Misoprostol is not fetotoxic or teratogenic in
rats and rabbits at doses 625 and 63 times the human dose, respectively.
</p>

<p>NURSING MOTHERS: See Contraindications. It is unlikely that Misoprostol
is excreted in human milk since it is rapidly metabolized throughout the
body. However, it is not known if the active metabolite (misoprostol acid)
is excreted in human milk. Therefore, Misoprostol should not be administered
to nursing mothers because the potential excretion of misoprostol acid
could cause significant diarrhea in nursing infants. </p>

<p>PEDIATRIC USE: Safety and effectiveness in children below the age of
18 years have not been established. </p>

<p><a name="DRUG INTERACTIONS"></a><b>DRUG INTERACTIONS </b></p>

<p>See Actions/Clinical Pharmacology. Misoprostol has not been shown to
interfere with the beneficial effects of aspirin on signs and symptoms
of rheumatoid arthritis. Misoprostol does not exert clinically significant
effects on the absorption, blood levels, and antiplatelet effects of therapeutic
doses of aspirin. Misoprostol has no clinically significant effect on the
kinetics of diclofenac or ibuprofen. (See Also PRECAUTIONS) </p>

<p><a name="ADVERSE REACTIONS"></a><b>ADVERSE REACTIONS </b></p>

<p>The following have been reported as adverse events in subjects receiving
Misoprostol: </p>

<p>GASTROINTESTINAL: In subjects receiving Misoprostol 400 or 800 mcg daily
in clinical trials, the most frequent gastrointestinal adverse events were
diarrhea and abdominal pain. The incidence of diarrhea at 800 mcg in controlled
trials in patients on NSAIDs ranged from 14-40% and in all studies (over
5,000 patients) averaged 13%. Abdominal pain occurred in 13-20% of patients
in NSAID trials and about 7% in all studies, but there was no consistent
difference from placebo. Diarrhea was dose related and usually developed
early in the course of therapy (after 13 days), usually was self-limiting
(often resolving after 8 days), but sometimes required discontinuation
of Misoprostol (2% of the patients). Rare instances of profound diarrhea
leading to severe dehydration have been reported. Patients with an underlying
condition such as inflammatory bowel disease, or those in whom dehydration,
were it to occur, would be dangerous, should be monitored carefully if
Misoprostol is prescribed. The incidence of diarrhea can be minimized by
administering after meals and at bedtime, and by avoiding coadministration
of Misoprostol with magnesium- containing antacids. </p>

<p>GYNECOLOGICAL: Women who received Misoprostol during clinical trials
reported the following gynecological disorders: spotting (0.7%), cramps
(0.6%), hypermenorrhea (0.5%), menstrual disorder (0.3%) and dysmenorrhea
(0.1%). Postmenopausal vaginal bleeding may be related to Misoprostol administration.
If it occurs, diagnostic workup should be undertaken to rule out gynecological
pathology. </p>

<p>ELDERLY: There were no significant differences in the safety profile
of Misoprostol in approximately 500 ulcer patients who were 65 years of
age or older compared with younger patients. </p>

<p>Additional adverse events which were reported are categorized as follows:
</p>

<p>INCIDENCE GREATER THAN 1%: In clinical trials, the following adverse
reactions were reported by more than 1% of the subjects receiving Misoprostol
and may be causally related to the drug: nausea (3.2%), flatulence (2.9%),
headache (2.4%), dyspepsia (2.0%), vomiting (1.3%), and constipation (1.1%).
However, there were no significant differences between the incidences of
these events for Misoprostol and placebo. </p>

<p>CAUSAL RELATIONSHIP UNKNOWN: The following adverse events were infrequently
reported. Causal relationships between Misoprostol and these events have
not been established but cannot be excluded: </p>

<p>Body As A Whole: aches/pains, asthenia, fatigue, fever, rigors, weight
changes. </p>

<p>Skin: rash, dermatitis, alopecia, pallor, breast pain. </p>

<p>Special Senses: abnormal taste, abnormal vision, conjunctivitis, deafness,
tinnitus, earache. </p>

<p>Respiratory: upper respiratory tract infection, bronchitis, bronchospasm,
dyspnea, pneumonia, epistaxis. </p>

<p>Cardiovascular: chest pain, edema, diaphoresis, hypotension, hypertension,
arrhythmia, phlebitis, increased cardiac enzymes, syncope. </p>

<p>Gastrointestinal: Gl bleeding, Gl inflammation/infection, rectal disorder,
abnormal hepatobiliary function, gingivitis, reflux, dysphagia, amylase
increase. </p>

<p>Hypersensitivity: Anaphylaxis. </p>

<p>Metabolic: glycosuria, gout, increased nitrogen, increased alkaline
phosphatase. Genitourinary: polyuria, dysuria, hematuria, urinary tract
infection. </p>

<p>Nervous System/Psychiatric: anxiety, change in appetite, depression,
drowsiness, dizziness, thirst, impotence, loss of libido, sweating increase,
neuropathy, neurosis, confusion. </p>

<p>Musculoskeletal: arthralgia, myalgia, muscle cramps, stiffness, back
pain. Blood/Coagulation: anemia, abnormal differential, thrombocytopenia,
purpura, ESR increased. </p>

<p><a name="OVERDOSAGE"></a><b>OVERDOSAGE </b></p>

<p>The toxic dose of Misoprostol in humans has not been determined. Cumulative
total daily doses of 1600 mcg have been tolerated, with only symptoms of
gastrointestinal discomfort being reported. In animals, the acute toxic
effects are diarrhea, gastrointestinal lesions, focal cardiac necrosis,
hepatic necrosis, renal tubular necrosis, testicular atrophy, respiratory
difficulties, and depression of the central nervous system. Clinical signs
that may indicate an overdose are sedation, tremor, convulsions, dyspnea,
abdominal pain, diarrhea, fever, palpitations, hypotension, or bradycardia.
Symptoms should be treated with supportive therapy. </p>

<p>It is not known if misoprostol acid is dialyzable. However, because
misoprostol is metabolized like a fatty acid, it is unlikely that dialysis
would be appropriate treatment for overdosage. </p>

<p><a name="DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION"></a><b>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
</b></p>

<p>The recommended adult oral dose of Misoprostol for the prevention of
NSAID-induced gastric ulcers is 200 mcg four times daily with food. If
this dose cannot be tolerated, a dose of 100 mcg can be used. (See Actions/Clinical
Pharmacology: Clinical Studies.) Misoprostol should be taken for the duration
of NSAID therapy as prescribed by the physician. Misoprostol should be
taken with a meal, and the last dose of the day should be at bedtime. </p>

<p>RENAL IMPAIRMENT: Adjustment of the dosing schedule in renally impaired
patients is not routinely needed, but dosage can be reduced if the 200-mcg
dose is not tolerated. (See Actions/Clinical Pharmacology.) </p>

<p><a name="PATIENT PACKAGE INSERT"></a><b>PATIENT PACKAGE INSERT </b></p>

<p>PATIENT INFORMATION </p>

<p>Read this leaflet before taking Misoprostol and each time your prescription
is renewed, because the leaflet may be changed. Misoprostol is being prescribed
by your doctor to decrease the chance of getting stomach ulcers related
to the arthritis/pain medication that you take. </p>

<p>Misoprostol can cause miscarriage, often associated with potentially
dangerous bleeding. This may result in hospitalization, surgery, infertility,
or death. DO NOT TAKE IT IF YOU ARE PREGNANT AND DO NOT BECOME PREGNANT
WHILE TAKING THIS MEDICINE. </p>

<p>If you become pregnant during Misoprostol therapy, stop taking Misoprostol
and contact your physician immediately. Remember that even if you are on
a means of birth control it is still possible to become pregnant. Should
this occur, stop taking Misoprostol and contact your physician immediately.
</p>

<p>Misoprostol may cause diarrhea, abdominal cramping, and/or nausea in
some people. In most cases these problems develop during the first few
weeks of therapy and stop after about a week. You can minimize possible
diarrhea by making sure you take Misoprostol with food. </p>

<p>Because these side effects are usually mild to moderate and usually
go away in a matter of days, most patients can continue to take Misoprostol.
If you have prolonged difficulty (more than 8 days), or if you have severe
diarrhea, cramping and/or nausea, call your doctor. </p>

<p>Take Misoprostol only according to the directions given by your physician.
Do not give Misoprostol to anyone else. It has been prescribed for your
specific condition, may not be the correct treatment for another person,
and would be dangerous if the other person were pregnant. </p>

<p>This information sheet does not cover all possible side effects of Misoprostol.
This patient information leaflet does not address the side effects of your
arthritis/pain medication. See your doctor if you have questions. </p>

<p>Keep out of reach of children. </p>

<p>WARNINGS:</p>

<p>1. ESTROGENS HAVE BEEN REPORTED TO INCREASE THE RISK OF ENDOMETRIAL
CARCINOMA IN POST-MENOPAUSAL WOMEN.</p>

<p>Close clinical surveillance of all women taking estrogens is important.
Adequate diagnostic measures, including endometrial sampling when indicated,
should be undertaken to rule out malignancy in all cases of undiagnosed
persistent or recurring abnormal vaginal bleeding. There is no evidence
that &quot;natural&quot; estrogens are more or less hazardous than &quot;synthetic&quot;
estrogens at equi-estrogenic doses.</p>

<p>2. ESTROGENS SHOULD NOT BE USED DURING PREGNANCY.</p>

<p>There is no indication for estrogen therapy during pregnancy or during
the immediate postpartum period. Estrogens are ineffective for the prevention
or treatment of threatened, or habitual abortion. Estrogens are not indicated
for the prevention of postpartum breast engorgement. Estrogen therapy during
pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of congenital defects in
the reproductive organs of the fetus, and possibly other birth defects.
Studies of women who received diethylstilbestrol (DES) during pregnancy
have shown that female offspring have an increased risk of vaginal adenosis,
squamous cell dysplasia of the uterine cervix, and clear cell vaginal cancer
later in life; male offspring have an increased risk of urogenital abnormalities
and possibly testicular cancer later in life. The 1985 DES Task Force concluded
that use of DES during pregnancy is associated with a subsequent increased
risk of breast cancer in the mothers, although a causal relationship remains
unproven and the observed level of excess risk is similar to that for a
number of other breast cancer risk factors.</p>

<p><a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><b>DESCRIPTION </b></p>

<p>OGEN (estropipate tablets), (formerly piperazine estrone sulfate), is
a natural estrogenic substance prepared from purified crystalline estrone,
solubilized as the sulfate and stabilized with piperazine. It is appreciably
soluble in water and has almost no odor or taste - properties which are
ideally suited for oral administration. The amount of piperazine in OGEN
is not sufficient to exert a pharmacological action. Its addition ensures
solubility, stability, and uniform potency of the estrone sulfate. Chemically
estropipate, molecular weight: 436.56, is represented by estra-1,3,5(10)-trien-17-one,3-(sulfooxy)-,
compound with piperazine (1:1). The structural formula may be represented
as follows:</p>

<center><p><img src="http://www.rxlist.com/cgi/brand/image/ogen.gif"
border=0 height=200 width=300></p></center>

<p>OGEN is available as tablets for oral administration containing either
0.75 mg (OGEN .625), 1.5 mg (OGEN 1.25), or 3 mg (OGEN 2.5) estropipate
(Calculated as sodium estrone sulfate 0.625 mg, 1.25 mg, and 2.5 mg, respectively).</p>

<p>Inactive Ingredients </p>

<p>Each tablet contains: Colloidal silicon dioxide, dibasic potassium phosphate,
hydrogenated vegetable oil wax, hydroxypropyl cellulose, lactose, magnesium
stearate, microcrystalline cellulose, sodium starch glycolate and tromethamine.</p>

<p>OGEN .625 also contains: D&amp;C Yellow No. 10 and FD&amp;C Yellow No.
6.</p>

<p>OGEN 1.25 also contains: FD&amp;C Yellow No. 6.</p>

<p>OGEN 2.5 also contains: FD&amp;C Blue No. 2.</p>

<p><a name="CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY"></a><b>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY </b></p>

<p>Estrogen drug products act by regulating the transcription of a limited
number of genes. Estrogens diffuse through cell membranes, distribute themselves
throughout the cell, and bind to and activate the nuclear estrogen receptor,
a DNA-binding protein which is found in estrogen-responsive tissues. The
activated estrogen receptor binds to specific DNA sequences, or hormone-response
elements, which enhance the transcription of adjacent genes and in turn
lead to the observed effects. Estrogen receptors have been identified in
tissues of the reproductive tract, breast, pituitary, hypothalamus, liver,
and bone of women. Estrogens are important in the development and maintenance
of the female reproductive system and secondary sex characteristics. By
a direct action, they cause growth and development of the uterus, Fallopian
tubes, and vagina. With other hormones, such as pituitary hormones and
progesterone, they cause enlargement of the breasts through promotion ofductal
growth, stromal development, and the accretion of fat. Estrogens are intricately
involved with other hormones, especially progesterone, in the processes
of the ovulatory menstrual cycle and pregnancy, and affect the release
of pituitary gonadotropins. They also contribute to the shaping of the
skeleton, maintenance of tone and elasticity of urogenital structures,
changes in the epiphyses of the long bones that allow for the pubertal
growth spurt and its termination, and pigmentation of the nipples and genitals.</p>

<p>Estrogens occur naturally in several forms. The primary source of estrogen
in normally cycling adult women is the ovarian follicle, which secretes
70 to 500 micrograms of estradiol daily, depending on the phase of the
menstrual cycle. This is converted primarily to estrone, which circulates
in roughly equal proportion to estradiol, and to small amounts of estriol.
After menopause, most endogenous estrogen is produced by conversion of
androstenedione, secreted by the adrenal cortex, to estrone by peripheral
tissues. Thus, estrone - especially in its sulfate ester form - is the
most abundant circulating estrogen in postmenopausal women. Although circulating
estrogens exist in a dynamic equilibrium of metabolic interconversions,
estradiol is the principal intracellular human estrogen and is substantially
more potent than estrone or estriol at the receptor. Estrogens used in
therapy are well absorbed through the skin, mucous membranes, and gastrointestinal
tract. When applied for a local action, absorption is usually sufficient
to cause systemic effects. When conjugated with aryl and alkyl groups for
parenteral administration, the rate of absorption of oily preparations
is slowed with a prolonged duration of action, such that a single intramuscular
injection of estradiol valerate or estradiol cypionate is absorbed over
several weeks.</p>

<p>Administered estrogens and their esters are handled within the body
essentially the same as the endogenous hormones. Metabolic conversion of
estrogens occurs primarily in the liver (first pass effect), but also at
local target tissue sites. Complex metabolic processes result in a dynamic
equilibrium of circulating conjugated and unconjugated estrogenic forms
which are continually interconverted, especially between estrone and estradiol
and between esterified and unesterified forms. Although naturally-occurring
estrogens circulate in the blood largely bound to sex hormone-binding globulin
and albumin, only unbound estrogens enter target tissue cells. A significant
proportion of the circulating estrogen exists as sulfate conjugates, especially
estrone sulfate, which serves as a circulating reservoir for the formation
of more active estrogenic species. A certain proportion of the estrogen
is excreted into the bile and then reabsorbed from the intestine. During
this enterohepatic recirculation, estrogens are desulfated and resulfated
and undergo degradation through conversion to less active estrogens (estriol
and other estrogens), oxidation to nonestrogenic substances (catecholestrogens,
which interact with catecholamine metabolism, especially in the central
nervous system), and conjugation with glucuronic acids (which are then
rapidly excreted in the urine).</p>

<p>When given orally, naturally-occurring estrogens and their esters are
extensively metabolized (first pass effect) and circulate primarily as
estrone sulfate, with smaller amounts of other conjugated and unconjugated
estrogenic species. This results in limited oral potency. By contrast,
synthetic estrogens, such as ethinyl estradiol and the nonsteroidal estrogens,
are degraded very slowly in the liver and other tissues, which results
in their high intrinsic potency. Estrogen drug products administered by
non-oral routes are not subject to first-pass metabolism, but also undergo
significant hepatic uptake, metabolism, and enterohepatic recycling.</p>

<p><a name="INDICATIONS AND USAGE"></a><b>INDICATIONS AND USAGE </b></p>

<p>Estrogen drug products are indicated in the:</p>

<p>1. Treatment of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms associated with
the menopause. There is no adequate evidence that estrogens are effective
for nervous symptoms or depression which might occur during menopause and
they should not be used to treat these conditions.</p>

<p>2. Treatment of vulval and vaginal atrophy.</p>

<p>3. Treatment of hypoestrogenism due to hypogonadism, castration or primary
ovarian failure.</p>

<p>4. Prevention of osteoporosis.</p>

<p>Since estrogen administration is associated with risk, selection of
patients should ideally be based on prospective identification of risk
factors for developing osteoporosis. Unfortunately, there is no certain
way to identify those women who will develop osteoporotic fractures. Most
prospective studies of efficacy for this indication have been carried out
in white menopausal women, without stratification by other risk factors,
and tend to show a universally salutary effect on bone. Thus, patient selection
must be individualized based on the balance of risks and benefits. A more
favorable risk/benefit ratio exists in a hysterectomized woman because
she has no risk of endometrial cancer (see BOXED WARNINGS). Estrogen replacement
therapy reduces bone resorption and retards or halts postmenopausal bone
loss. Case-control studies have shown an approximately 60 percent reduction
in hip and wrist fractures in women whose estrogen replacement was begun
within a few years of menopause. Studies also suggest that estrogen reduces
the rate of vertebral fractures. Even when started as late as 6 years after
menopause, estrogen prevents further loss of bone mass for as long as the
treatment is continued. The results of a double-blind, placebo-controlled
two-year study have shown that treatment with one tablet of OGEN .625 daily
for 25 days (of a 31-day cycle per month) prevents vertebral bone mass
loss in postmenopausal women. When estrogen therapy is discontinued, bone
mass declines at a rate comparable to the immediate postmenopausal period.
There is no evidence that estrogen replacement therapy restores bone mass
to premenopausal levels. At skeletal maturity there are sex and race differences
in both the total amount of bone present and its density, in favor of men
and blacks. Thus, women are at higher risk than men because they start
with less bone mass and, for several years following natural or induced
menopause, the rate of bone mass decline is accelerated. White and Asian
women are at higher risk than black women.</p>

<p>Early menopause is one of the strongest predictors for the development
of osteoporosis. In addition, other factors affecting the skeleton which
are associated with osteoporosis include genetic factors (small build,
family history), endocrine factors (nulliparity, thyrotoxicosis, hyperparathyroidism,
Cushing's syndrome, hyperprolactinemia, Type I diabetes), lifestyle (cigarette
smoking, alcohol abuse, sedentary exercise habits) and nutrition (below
average body weight, dietary calcium intake). The mainstays of prevention
and management of osteoporosis are estrogen, an adequate lifetime calcium
intake, and exercise. Postmenopausal women absorb dietary calcium less
efficiently than premenopausal women and require an average of 1500 mg/day
of elemental calcium to remain in neutral calcium balance. By comparison,
premenopausal women require about 1000 mg/day and the average calcium intake
in the USA is 400-600 mg/day. Therefore, when not contraindicated, calcium
supplementation may be helpful.</p>

<p>Weight-bearing exercise and nutrition may be important adjuncts to the
prevention and management of osteoporosis. Immobilization and prolonged
bed rest produce rapid bone loss, while weight-bearing exercise has been
shown both to reduce bone loss and to increase bone mass. The optimal type
and amount of physical activity that would prevent osteoporosis have not
been established, however in two studies an hour of walking and running
exercises twice or three times weekly significantly increased lumbar spine
bone mass.</p>

<p><a name="CONTRAINDICATIONS"></a><b>CONTRAINDICATIONS </b></p>

<p>Estrogens should not be used in individuals with any of the following
conditions:</p>

<p>1. Known or suspected pregnancy (see BOXED WARNINGS). Estrogens may
cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman.</p>

<p>2. Undiagnosed abnormal genital bleeding.</p>

<p>3. Known or suspected cancer of the breast except in appropriately selected
patients being treated for metastatic disease.</p>

<p>4. Known or suspected estrogen-dependent neoplasia.</p>

<p>5. Active thrombophlebitis or thromboembolic disorders.</p>

<p><a name="WARNINGS"></a><b>WARNINGS </b></p>

<p>1. Induction of malignant neoplasms.</p>

<p>Endometrial cancer. The reported endometrial cancer risk among unopposed
estrogen users is about 2-12-fold greater than in nonusers, and appears
dependent on duration of treatment and on estrogen dose. Most studies show
no significant increased risk associated with use of estrogens for less
than one year. The greatest risk appears associated with prolonged use
- with increased risks of 15-24-fold for five to ten years or more. In
three studies, persistence of risk was demonstrated for 8 to over 15 years
after cessation of estrogen treatment. In one study a significant decrease
in the incidence of endometrial cancer occurred six months after estrogen
withdrawal. Concurrent progestin therapy may offset this risk but the overall
health impact in postmenopausal women in not known (see PRECAUTIONS).</p>

<p>Breast Cancer. While the majority of studies have not shown an increased
risk of breast cancer in women who have ever used estrogen replacement
therapy, some have reported a moderately increased risk (relative risks
of 1.3-2.0) in those taking higher doses or those taking lower doses for
prolonged periods of time, especially in excess of 10 years. Other studies
have not shown this relationship.</p>

<p>Congenital lesions with malignant potential. Estrogen therapy during
pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of fetal congenital reproductive
tract disorders, and possibly other birth defects. Studies of women who
received DES during pregnancy have shown that female offspring have an
increased risk of vaginal adenosis, squamous cell dysplasia of the uterine
cervix, and clear cell vaginal cancer later in life; male offspring have
an increased risk of urogenital abnormalities and possibly testicular cancer
later in life. Although some of these changes are benign, others are precursors
of malignancy.</p>

<p>2. Gallbladder disease. Two studies have reported a 2- to 4-fold increase
in the risk of gallbladder disease requiring surgery in women receiving
postmenopausal estrogens.</p>

<p>3. Cardiovascular disease. Large doses of estrogen (5 mg conjugated
estrogens per day), comparable to those used to treat cancer of the prostate
and breast, have been shown in a large prospective clinical trial in men
to increase the risks of nonfatal myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism,
and thrombophlebitis. These risks cannot necessarily be extrapolated from
men to women. However, to avoid the theoretical cardiovascular risk to
women caused by high estrogen doses, the dose for estrogen replacement
therapy should not exceed the lowest effective dose.</p>

<p>4. Elevated blood pressure. Occasional blood pressure increases during
estrogen replacement therapy have been attributed to idiosyncratic reactions
to estrogens. More often, blood pressure has remained the same or has dropped.
One study showed that postmenopausal estrogen users have higher blood pressure
than nonusers. Two other studies showed slightly lower blood pressure among
estrogen users compared to nonusers. Postmenopausal estrogen use does not
increase the risk of stroke. Nonetheless, blood pressure should be monitored
at regular intervals with estrogen use.</p>

<p>5. Hypercalcemia. Administration of estrogens may lead to severe hypercalcemia
in patients with breast cancer and bone metastases. If this occurs, the
drug should be stopped and appropriate measures taken to reduce the serum
calcium level.</p>

<p><a name="PRECAUTIONS"></a><b>PRECAUTIONS </b></p>

<p>A. General </p>

<p>1. Addition of a progestin. Studies of the addition of a progestin for
seven or more days of a cycle of estrogen administration have reported
a lowered incidence of endometrial hyperplasia which would otherwise be
induced by estrogen treatment. Morphological and biochemical studies of
endometrium suggest that 10 to 14 days of progestin are needed to provide
maximal maturation of the endometrium and to eliminate any hyperplastic
changes. There are possible additional risks which may be associated with
the inclusion of progestins in estrogen replacement regimens. These include:
(1) adverse effects on lipoprotein metabolism (lowering HDL and raising
LDL) which may diminish the possible cardioprotective effect of estrogen
therapy (see PRECAUTIONS, D.4., below); (2) impairment of glucose tolerance;
and (3) possible enhancement of mitotic activity in breast epithelial tissue
(although few epidemiological data are available to address this point).
The choice of progestin, its dose, and its regimen may be important in
minimizing these adverse effects, but these issues remain to be clarified.</p>

<p>2. Physical examination. A complete medical and family history should
be taken prior to the initiation of any estrogen therapy. The pretreatment
and periodic physical examinations should include special reference to
blood pressure, breasts, abdomen, and pelvic organs, and should include
a Papanicolaou smear. As a general rule, estrogen should not be prescribed
for longer than one year without reexamining the patient.</p>

<p>3. Hypercoagulability. Some studies have shown that women taking estrogen
replacement therapy have hypercoagulability, primarily related to decreased
antithrombin activity. This effect appears dose- and duration-dependent
and is less pronounced than that associated with oral contraceptive use.
Also, postmenopausal women tend to have increased coagulation parameters
at baseline compared to premenopausal women. There is some suggestion that
low dose postmenopausal mestranol may increase the risk of thromboembolism,
although the majority of studies (of primarily conjugated estrogen users)
report no such increase. There is insufficient information on hypercoagulability
in women who have had previous thromboembolic disease.</p>

<p>4. Familial hyperlipoproteinemia. Estrogen therapy may be associated
with massive elevations of plasma triglycerides leading to pancreatitis
and other complications in patients with familial defects of lipoprotein
metabolism.</p>

<p>5. Fluid retention. Because estrogens may cause some degree of fluid
retention, conditions which might be exacerbated by this factor, such as
asthma, epilepsy, migraine, and cardiac or renal dysfunction, require careful
observation.</p>

<p>6. Uterine bleeding and mastodynia. Certain patients may develop undesirable
manifestations of estrogenic stimulation, such as abnormal uterine bleeding
and mastodynia.</p>

<p>7. Impaired liver function. Estrogen may be poorly metabolized in patients
with impaired liver function and should be administered with caution.</p>

<p>B. Information for the Patient. </p>

<p>See text of Patient Package Insert below.</p>

<p>C. Laboratory Tests.</p>

<p>Estrogen administration should generally be guided by clinical response
at the smallest dose, rather than laboratory monitoring, for relief of
symptoms for those indications in which symptoms are observable. For prevention
and treatment of osteoporosis, however, see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION section.</p>

<p>D. Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions.</p>

<p>1. Accelerated prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, and platelet
aggregation time; increased platelet count; increased factors II, VII antigen,
VIII antigen, VIII coagulant activity, IX, X, XII, VII-X complex, II-VII-X
complex, and beta-thromboglobulin; decreased levels of anti-factor Xa and
antithrombin III, decreased antithrombin III activity; increased levels
of fibrinogen and fibrinogen activity; increased plasminogen antigen and
activity.</p>

<p>2. Increased thyroid-binding globulin (TBG) leading to increased circulating
total thyroid hormone, as measured by protein-bound iodine (PBI), T4 levels
(by column or by radioimmunoassay) or T3 levels by radioimmunoassay. T3
resin uptake is decreased, reflecting the elevated TBG. Free T4 and free
T3 concentrations are unaltered.</p>

<p>3. Other binding proteins may be elevated in serum, i.e., corticosteroid
binding globulin (CBG), sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), leading to
increased circulating corticosteroids and sex steroids respectively. Free
or biologically active hormone concentrations are unchanged. Other plasma
proteins may be increased (angiotensinogen/renin substrate, alpha-l-antitrypsin,
ceruloplasmin).</p>

<p>4. Increased plasma HDL and HDL-2 subfraction concentrations, reduced
LDL cholesterol concentration, increased triglycerides levels.</p>

<p>5. Impaired glucose tolerance.</p>

<p>6. Reduced response to metyrapone test.</p>

<p>7. Reduced serum folate concentration.</p>

<p>E. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility.</p>

<p>Long term continuous administration of natural and synthetic estrogens
in certain animal species increases the frequency of carcinomas of the
breast, uterus, cervix, vagina, testis, and liver. See &quot;CONTRAINDICATIONS&quot;
and &quot;WARNINGS&quot; sections.</p>

<p>F. Pregnancy Category X. </p>

<p>Estrogens should not be used during pregnancy. See &quot;CONTRAINDICATIONS&quot;
and BOXED WARNINGS.</p>

<p>G. Nursing Mothers. As a general principle, the administration of any
drug to nursing mothers should be done only when clearly necessary since
many drugs are excreted in human milk. In addition, estrogen administration
to nursing mothers has been shown to decrease the quantity and quality
of the milk.</p>

<p><a name="ADVERSE REACTIONS"></a><b>ADVERSE REACTIONS </b></p>

<p>The following additional adverse reactions have been reported with estrogen
therapy (see WARNINGS regarding induction of neoplasia, adverse effects
on the fetus, increased incidence of gallbladder disease, cardiovascular
disease, elevated blood pressure, and hypercalcemia).</p>

<p>1. Genitourinary system.</p>

<p>Changes in vaginal bleeding pattern and abnormal withdrawal bleeding
or flow; breakthrough bleeding, spotting.</p>

<p>Increase in size of uterine leiomyomata.</p>

<p>Vaginal candidiasis.</p>

<p>Change in amount of cervical secretion.</p>

<p>2. Breast.</p>

<p><a name="OVERDOSAGE"></a><b>OVERDOSAGE </b></p>

<p>Serious ill effects have not been reported following acute ingestion
of large doses of estrogen-containing oral contraceptives by young children.
Overdosage of estrogen may cause nausea and vomiting, and withdrawal bleeding
may occur in females.</p>

<p><a name="DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION"></a><b>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
</b></p>

<p>1. For treatment of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms, vulval and
vaginal atrophy associated with the menopause, the lowest dose and regimen
that will control symptoms should be chosen and medication should be discontinued
as promptly as possible.</p>

<p>Attempts to discontinue or taper medication should be made at 3-month
to 6-month intervals.</p>

<p>Usual dosage ranges:</p>

<p>Vasomotor symptoms-One OGEN .625 (0.75 mg estropipate) tablet to two
OGEN 2.5 (3 mg estropipate) tablets per day. The lowest dose that will
control symptoms should be chosen. If the patient has not menstruated within
the last two months or more, cyclic administration is started arbitrarily.
If the patient is menstruating, cyclic administration is started on day
5 of bleeding.</p>

<p>Vulval and vaginal atrophy-One OGEN .625 (0.75 mg estropipate) tablet
to two OGEN 2.5 (3 mg estropipate) tablets daily, depending upon the tissue
response of the individual patient. The lowest dose that will control symptoms
should be chosen. Administer cyclically.</p>

<p>2. For treatment of female hypoestrogenism due to hypogonadism, castration,
or primary ovarian failure.</p>

<p>Usual dosage ranges:</p>

<p>Female hypogonadism-A daily dose of one OGEN 1.25 (1.5 mg estropipate)
tablet to three OGEN 2.5 (3 mg estropipate) tablets may be given for the
first three weeks of a theoretical cycle, followed by a rest period of
eight to ten days. The lowest dose that will control symptoms should be
chosen. If bleeding does not occur by the end of this period, the same
dosage schedule is repeated. Thenumber of courses of estrogen therapy necessary
to produce bleeding may vary depending on the responsiveness of the endometrium.
If satisfactory withdrawal bleeding does not occur, an oral progestogen
may be given in addition to estrogen during the third week of the cycle.</p>

<p>Female castration or primary ovarian failure-A daily dose of one OGEN
1.25 (1.5 mg estropipate) tablet to three OGEN 2.5 (3 mg estropipate) tablets
may be given for the first three weeks of a theoretical cycle, followed
by a rest period of eight to ten days. Adjust dosage upward or downward
according to severity of symptoms and response of the patient. For maintenance,
adjust dosage to lowest level that will provide effective control.</p>

<p>Treated patients with an intact uterus should be monitored closely for
signs of endometrial cancer and appropriate diagnostic measures should
be taken to rule out malignancy in the event of persistent or recurring
abnormal vaginal bleeding.</p>

<p>3. For prevention of osteoporosis. A daily dose of one OGEN .625 (0.75
mg estropipate) tablet for 25 days of a 31-day cycle per month.</p>

<p>PATIENT INFORMATION </p>

<p>WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT ESTROGENS Ogen&reg; brand of estropipate
tablets, USP </p>

<p>INTRODUCTION </p>

<p>This leaflet describes when and how to use estrogens, and the risks
and benefits of estrogen treatment.</p>

<p>Estrogens have important benefits but also some risks. You must decide,
with your doctor, whether the risks to you of estrogen use are acceptable
because of their benefits. If you use estrogens, check with your doctor
to be sure you are using the lowest possible dose that works, and that
you don't use them longer than necessary. How long you need to use estrogens
will depend on the reason for use.</p>

<p>USES OF ESTROGEN </p>

<p>(Not every estrogen drug is approved for every use listed in this section.
If you want to know which of these possible uses are approved for the medicine
prescribed for you, ask your doctor or pharmacist to show you the professional
labeling. You can also look up the specific estrogen product in a book
called the &quot;Physicians' Desk Reference&quot;, which is available in
many book stores and public libraries. Generic drugs carry virtually the
same labeling information as their brand name versions.)</p>

<p>* To reduce moderate or severe menopausal symptoms. Estrogens are hormones
made by the ovaries of normal women. Between ages 45 and 55, the ovaries
normally stop making estrogens. This leads to a drop in body estrogen levels
which causes the &quot;change of life&quot; or menopause (the end of monthly
menstrual periods). If both ovaries are removed during an operation before
natural menopause takes place, the sudden drop in estrogen levels causes
&quot;surgical menopause&quot;.</p>

<p>When the estrogen levels begin dropping, some women develop very uncomfortable
symptoms, such as feelings of warmth in the face, neck, and chest, or sudden
intense episodes of heat and sweating (&quot;hot flashes&quot; or &quot;hot
flushes&quot;). Using estrogen drugs can help the body adjust to lower
estrogen levels and reduce these symptoms. Most women have only mild menopausal
symptoms or none at all and do not need to use estrogen drugs for these
symptoms. Others may need to take estrogens for a few months while their
bodies adjust to lower estrogen levels. The majority of women do not need
estrogen replacement for longer than six months for these symptoms.</p>

<p>* To treat vulval and vaginal atrophy (itching, burning, dryness in
or around the vagina, difficulty or burning on urination) associated with
menopause.</p>

<p>* To treat certain conditions in which a young woman's ovaries do not
produce enough estrogen naturally.</p>

<p>* To treat certain types of abnormal vaginal bleeding due to hormonal
imbalance when your doctor has found no serious cause of the bleeding.</p>

<p>* To treat certain cancers in special situations, in men and women.
* To prevent thinning of bones.</p>

<p>Osteoporosis is a thinning of the bones that makes them weaker and allows
them to break more easily. The bones of the spine, wrists and hips break
most often in osteoporosis. Both men and women start to lose bone mass
after about age 40, but women lose bone mass faster after the menopause.
Using estrogens after the menopause slows down bone thinning and may prevent
bones from breaking. Lifelong adequate calcium intake, either in the diet
(such as dairy products) or by calcium supplements (to reach a total daily
intake of 1000 milligrams per day before menopause or 1500 milligrams per
day after menopause), may help to prevent osteoporosis. Regular weight-bearing
exercise (like walking and running for an hour, two or three times a week)
may also help to prevent osteoporosis. Before you change your calcium intake
or exercise habits, it is important to discuss these lifestyle changes
with your doctor to find out if they are safe for you.</p>

<p>Since estrogen use has some risks, only women who are likely to develop
osteoporosis should use estrogens for prevention. Women who are likely
to develop osteoporosis often have the following characteristics: white
or Asian race, slim, cigarette smokers, and a family history of osteoporosis
in a mother, sister, or aunt. Women who have relatively early menopause,
often because their ovaries were removed during an operation (&quot;surgical
menopause&quot;), are more likely to develop osteoporosis than women whose
menopause happens at the average age.</p>

<p>WHO SHOULD NOT USE ESTROGENS </p>

<p>Estrogens should not be used:</p>

<p>* During pregnancy (see BOXED WARNINGS).</p>

<p>If you think you may be pregnant, do not use any form of estrogen-containing
drug. Using estrogens while you are pregnant may cause your unborn child
to have birth defects. Estrogens do not prevent miscarriage.</p>

<p>* If you have unusual vaginal bleeding which has not been evaluated
by your doctor (see BOXED WARNINGS).</p>

<p>Unusual vaginal bleeding can be a warning sign of cancer of the uterus,
especially if it happens after menopause. Your doctor must find out the
cause of the bleeding so that he or she can recommend the proper treatment.
Taking estrogens without visiting your doctor can cause you serious harm
if your vaginal bleeding is caused by cancer of the uterus.</p>

<p>* If you have had cancer.</p>

<p>Since estrogens increase the risk of certain types of cancer, you should
not use estrogens if you have ever had cancer of the breast or uterus,
unless your doctor recommends that the drug may help in the cancer treatment.
(For certain patients with breast or prostate cancer, estrogens may help.)</p>

<p>* If you have any circulation problems.</p>

<p>Estrogen drugs should not be used except in unusually special situations
in which your doctor judges that you need estrogen therapy so much that
the risks are acceptable. Men and women with abnormal blood clotting conditions
should avoid estrogen use (see DANGERS OF ESTROGENS, below). * When they
do not work.</p>

<p>During menopause, some women develop nervous symptoms or depression.
Estrogens do not relieve these symptoms. You may have heard that taking
estrogens for years after menopause will keep your skin soft and supple
and keep you feeling young. There is no evidence for these claims and such
long-term estrogen use may have serious risks.</p>

<p>* After childbirth or when breastfeeding a baby.</p>

<p>Estrogens should not be used to try to stop the breasts from filling
with milk after a baby is born. Such treatment may increase the risk of
developing blood clots (see DANGERS OF ESTROGENS, below).</p>

<p>If you are breastfeeding, you should avoid using any drugs because many
drugs pass through to the baby in the milk. While nursing a baby, you should
take drugs only on the advice of your health care provider.</p>

<p>DANGERS OF ESTROGENS </p>

<p>* Cancer of the uterus.</p>

<p>Your risk of developing cancer of the uterus gets higher the longer
you use estrogens and the larger doses you use. One study showed that after
women stop taking estrogens, this higher cancer risk quickly returns to
the usual level of risk (as if you had never used estrogen therapy). Three
other studies showed that the cancer risk stayed high for 8 to more than
15 years after stopping estrogen treatment. Because of this risk, IT IS
IMPORTANT TO TAKE THE LOWEST DOSE THAT WORKS AND TO TAKE IT ONLY AS LONG
AS YOU NEED IT. Using progestin therapy together with estrogen therapy
may reduce the higher risk of uterine cancer related to estrogen use (but
see OTHER INFORMATION, below).</p>

<p>If you have had your uterus removed (total hysterectomy), there is no
danger of developing cancer of the uterus.</p>

<p>* Cancer of the breast.</p>

<p>Most studies have not shown a higher risk of breast cancer in women
who have ever used estrogens. However, some studies have reported that
breast cancer developed more often (up to twice the usual rate) in women
who used estrogens for long periods of time (especially more than 10 years),
or who used higher doses for shorter time periods.</p>

<p>Regular breast examinations by a health professional and monthly self-examination
are recommended for all women.</p>

<p>* Gallbladder disease.</p>

<p>Women who use estrogens after menopause are more likely to develop gallbladder
disease needing surgery than women who do not use estrogens. * Abnormal
blood clotting.</p>

<p>Taking estrogens may cause changes in your blood clotting system. These
changes allow the blood to clot more easily, possibly allowing clots to
form in your bloodstream. If blood clots do form in your bloodstream, they
can cut off the blood supply to vital organs, causing serious problems.
These problems may include a stroke (by cutting off blood to the brain),
a heart attack (by cutting off blood to the heart), a pulmonary embolus
(by cutting off blood to the lungs), or other problems. Any of these conditions
may cause death or serious long term disability. However, most studies
of low dose estrogen usage by women do not show an increased risk of these
complications.</p>

<p>SIDE EFFECTS </p>

<p>In addition to the risks listed above, the following side effects have
been reported with estrogen use:</p>

<p>Nausea and vomiting.</p>

<p>Breast tenderness or enlargement.</p>

<p>Enlargement of benign tumors (&quot;fibroids&quot;) of the uterus.</p>

<p>Retention of excess fluid. This may make some conditions worsen, such
as asthma, epilepsy, migraine, heart disease, or kidney disease.</p>

<p>A spotty darkening of the skin, particularly on the face.</p>

<p>REDUCING RISK OF ESTROGEN USE </p>

<p>If you use estrogens, you can reduce your risks by doing these things:</p>

<p>* See your doctor regularly. While you are using estrogens, it is important
to visit your doctor at least once a year for a check-up. If you develop
vaginal bleeding while taking estrogens, you may need further evaluation.
If members of your family have had breast cancer or if you have ever had
breast lumps or an abnormal mammogram (breast x-ray), you may need to have
more frequent breast examinations.</p>

<p>* Reassess your need for estrogens. You and your doctor should reevaluate
whether or not you still need estrogens at least every six months.</p>

<p>* Be alert for signs of trouble. If any of these warning signals (or
any other unusual symptoms) happen while you are using estrogens, call
your doctor immediately:</p>

<p>Abnormal bleeding from the vagina (possible uterine cancer). Pains in
the calves or chest, sudden shortness of breath, or coughing blood (possible
clot in the legs, heart, or lungs).</p>

<p>Severe headache or vomiting, dizziness, faintness, changes in vision
or speech, weakness or numbness of an arm or leg (possible clot in the
brain or eye).</p>

<p>Breast lumps (possible breast cancer; ask your doctor or health professional
to show you how to examine your breasts monthly).</p>

<p>Yellowing of the skin or eyes (possible liver problem).</p>

<p>Pain, swelling, or tenderness in the abdomen (possible gallbladder problem).</p>

<p>OTHER INFORMATION </p>

<p>Some doctors may choose to prescribe a progestin, a different hormonal
drug, for you to take together with your estrogen treatment. Progestins
lower your risk of developing endometrial hyperplasia (a possible pre-cancerous
condition of the uterus) while using estrogens. Taking estrogens and progestins
together may also protect you from the higher risk of uterine cancer, but
this has not been clearly established. Combined use of progestin and estrogen
treatment may have additional risks, however. The possible risks include
unhealthy effects on blood fats (especially a lowering of HDL cholesterol,
the &quot;good&quot; blood fat which protects against heart disease risk),
unhealthy effects on blood sugar (which might worsen a diabetic condition),
and a possible further increase in the breast cancer risk which may be
associated with long-term estrogen use. The type of progestin drug used
and its dosage schedule may be important in minimizing these effects.</p>

<p>Your doctor has prescribed this drug for you and you alone. Do not give
the drug to anyone else.</p>

<p>If you will be taking calcium supplements as part of the treatment to
help prevent osteoporosis, check with your doctor about how much to take.</p>

<p>Keep this and all drugs out of the reach of children. In case of overdose,
call your doctor, hospital or poison control center immediately.</p>

<p>This leaflet provides a summary of the most important information about
estrogens. If you want more information, ask your doctor or pharmacist
to show you the professional labeling. The professional labeling is also
published in a book called the &quot;Physicians' Desk Reference&quot;,
which is available in book stores and public libraries. Generic drugs carry
virtually the same labeling information as their brand name versions.</p>

<p><a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><b>DESCRIPTION </b></p>

<p>Tamoxifen Tablets, a nonsteroidal antiestrogen, are for oral administration.
Tamoxifen Tablets are available as: 10 MG TABLETS. Each tablet contains
15.2 mg of tamoxifen citrate which is equivalent to 10 mg of tamoxifen.
20 MG TABLETS. Each tablet contains 30.4 mg of tamoxifen citrate which
is equivalent to 20 mg of tamoxifen. Chemically, Tamoxifen is the trans-isomer
of a triphenylethylene derivative. The chemical name is (Z)2-(4-(1,2-diphenyl-1-butenyl)
phenoxy)-N, N- dimethylethanamine 2-hydroxy- 1,2,3-propanetricarboxylate
(1:1). The empirical formula is C32H37NO8. Tamoxifen citrate has a molecular
weight of 563.62, the pKa' is 8.85, the equilibrium solubility in water
at 37 deg C is 0.5 mg/mL and in 0.02 N HCl at 37 deg C, it is 0.2 mg/mL.
</p>

<p><a name="ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY"></a><b>ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
</b></p>

<p>Tamoxifen is a nonsteroidal agent which has demonstrated potent antiestrogenic
properties in animal test systems. The antiestrogenic effects may be related
to its ability to compete with estrogen for binding sites in target tissues
such as breast. Tamoxifen inhibits the induction of rat mammary carcinoma
induced by dimethylbenzanthracene (DMBA) and causes the regression of already
established DMBA-induced tumors. In this rat model, tamoxifen appears to
exert its antitumor effects by binding the estrogen receptors. It is also
recognized that tamoxifen displays estrogenic like effects on several sites
including the endometrium, bone and lipids. </p>

<p>In cytosols derived from human breast adenocarcinomas, tamoxifen competes
with estradiol for estrogen receptor protein. </p>

<p>Tamoxifen is extensively metabolized after oral administration. Studies
in women receiving 20 mg of 14C tamoxifen have shown that approximately
65% of the administered dose was excreted from the body over a period of
2 weeks with fecal excretion as the primary route of elimination. The drug
was excreted mainly as polar conjugates, with unchanged drug and unconjugated
metabolites accounting for less than 30% of the total fecal radioactivity.
</p>

<p>N-desmethyl tamoxifen was the major metabolite found in patients' plasma.
The biological activity of N-desmethyl tamoxifen appears to be similar
to tamoxifen. 4-Hydroxytamoxifen and a side chain primary alcohol derivative
of tamoxifen have been identified as minor metabolites in plasma. </p>

<p>Following a single oral dose of 20 mg tamoxifen, an average peak plasma
concentration of 40 ng/mL (range 35 to 45 ng/mL) occurred approximately
5 hours after dosing. The decline in plasma concentrations of tamoxifen
is biphasic with a terminal elimination half-life of about 5 to 7 days.
The average peak plasma concentration for N-desmethyl tamoxifen is 15 ng/mL
(range 10 to 20 ng/mL). Chronic administration of 10 mg tamoxifen given
twice daily for three months to patients results in average steady-state
plasma concentrations of 120 ng/mL (range 67-183 ng/mL) for tamoxifen and
336 ng/mL (range 148-654 ng/mL) for N- desmethyl tamoxifen. The average
steady- state plasma concentrations of tamoxifen and N- desmethyl tamoxifen
after administration of 20 mg tamoxifen once daily for three months are
122 ng/mL (range 71-183 ng/mL) and 353 ng/mL (range 152-706 ng/mL), respectively.
After initiation of therapy, steady state concentrations for tamoxifen
are achieved in about 4 weeks and steady state concentrations for N-desmethyl
tamoxifen are achieved in about 8 weeks, suggesting a half-life of approximately
14 days for this metabolite. </p>

<p>In a 3-month crossover steady-state bioavailability study with Tamoxifen
10 mg twice a day versus Tamoxifen 20 mg given once daily, the results
demonstrated that Tamoxifen 20 mg taken once daily has comparable bioavailability
to Tamoxifen 10 mg taken twice a day. </p>

<p>CLINICAL STUDIES: </p>

<p>The Early Breast Cancer Trialists' Collaborative Group (EBCTCG) conducted
worldwide overviews of systemic adjuvant therapy for early breast cancer
in 1985 and again in 1990. In 1992, 10-year outcome data were reported
for 29,892 women in 40 randomized trials of adjuvant tamoxifen using doses
of 20-40 mg/day for 1- 5+ years (median 2 years). Fifty-one percent were
entered into trials comparing tamoxifen to no adjuvant therapy and 49%
were entered into trials of tamoxifen in combination with chemotherapy
vs. the same chemotherapy alone. Twenty-nine percent were &lt;50 years
of age and 71% were &gt;/=50 years. Fifty- seven percent were node-positive
and 43% were node-negative. Fifty percent of the tumors were estrogen receptor
(ER) positive (&gt;/=10 fmol/mg), 18% were ER poor (&lt;10 fmol/mg), and
32% were ER unknown. </p>

<p>The overall recurrence-free survival at 10 years of follow-up was 51.2%
for tamoxifen versus 44.7% for control (logrank 2p &lt;0.00001). Overall
survival at 10 years was 58.8% for tamoxifen versus 52.6% for control (logrank
2p &lt;0.00001). Both the absolute risk of relapse and the absolute benefit
of treatment with tamoxifen were greater in women with positive nodes than
in women with negative nodes. In women with positive nodes, 10-year recurrence-free
survival was 41.9% for tamoxifen versus 33.1% for control (logrank 1p &lt;0.00001).
Ten-year survival was 50.4% for tamoxifen versus 42.2% for control (logrank
1p &lt;0.00001). In women with negative nodes, recurrence-free survival
was 68.1% for tamoxifen versus 63.1% for control (logrank 1p &lt;0.00001).
Survival at 10 years was 74.5% for tamoxifen versus 71.0% for control (logrank
1p = 0.0002). </p>

<p>The reduction in the annual odds of recurrence with tamoxifen was 12%
in women &lt;50 years of age versus 29% in women &gt;/=50 years. Similarly,
the reduction in the annual odds of death was 6% versus 20%. The reduction
in the annual odds of recurrence with tamoxifen was significantly greater
in ER positive (32%) than in ER poor (13%) tumors (1p &lt;0.00001). The
reduction in recurrence and mortality was greater in those studies that
used tamoxifen for longer (&gt;/=2 years) rather than shorter (&lt;2 years)
periods. There was no indication that doses greater than 20 mg per day
were more effective. </p>

<p>Two studies (Hubay and NSABP B-09) demonstrated an improved disease-free
survival following radical or modified radical mastectomy in postmenopausal
women or women 50 years of age or older with surgically curable breast
cancer with positive axillary nodes when Tamoxifen was added to adjuvant
cytotoxic chemotherapy. In the Hubay study, Tamoxifen was added to &quot;low-dose&quot;
CMF (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate and fluorouracil). In the NSABP B-09
study, Tamoxifen was added to melphalan (L-phenylalanine mustard (P)) and
fluorouracil (F). </p>

<p>In the Hubay study, patients with a positive (more than 3 fmol) estrogen
receptor were more likely to benefit. In the NSABP B-09 study in women
age 50-59 years, only women with both estrogen and progesterone receptor
levels 10 fmol or greater clearly benefited, while there was a nonstatistically
significant trend toward adverse effect in women with both estrogen and
progesterone receptor levels less than 10 fmol. In women age 60-70 years,
there was a trend toward a beneficial effect of Tamoxifen without any clear
relationship to estrogen or progesterone receptor status. </p>

<p>Three prospective studies (ECOG-1178, Toronto, NATO) using Tamoxifen
adjuvantly as a single agent demonstrated an improved disease-free survival
following total mastectomy and axillary dissection for postmenopausal women
with positive axillary nodes compared to placebo/no treatment controls.
The NATO study also demonstrated an overall survival benefit. </p>

<p>One prospective, double-blind, randomized study (NSABP B-14) demonstrated
a significant improvement in disease-free survival for Tamoxifen compared
to placebo when used adjuvantly following total mastectomy and axillary
dissection or segmental resection, axillary dissection, and breast radiation
in women with axillary node-negative breast cancer whose tumors were estrogen
receptor positive (&gt;/=10 fmol/mg cytosol protein). The benefit was apparent
in both women under age 50 and those aged 50 years or more. One additional
randomized study (NATO) demonstrated improved disease-free survival for
Tamoxifen compared to no adjuvant therapy following total mastectomy and
axillary dissection in postmenopausal women with axillary node-negative
breast cancer. In this study, the benefits of Tamoxifen appeared to be
independent of estrogen receptor status. </p>

<p>Three prospective, randomized studies (Ingle, Pritchard, Buchanan) compared
Tamoxifen to ovarian ablation (oophorectomy or ovarian irradiation) in
premenopausal women with advanced breast cancer. Although the objective
response rate, time to treatment failure, and survival were similar with
both treatments, the limited patient accrual prevented a demonstration
of equivalence. In an overview analysis of survival data from the three
studies, the hazard ratio for death (Tamoxifen/ovarian ablation) was 1.00
with two- sided 95% confidence intervals of 0.73 to 1.37. Elevated serum
and plasma estrogens have been observed in premenopausal women receiving
Tamoxifen. However, the data from the randomized studies do not suggest
an adverse effect. A limited number of premenopausal patients with disease
progression during Tamoxifen therapy responded to subsequent ovarian ablation.
</p>

<p>In a large randomized trial in Sweden of adjuvant Tamoxifen 40 mg/day
for 2-5 years, the incidence of second primary breast tumors was reduced
in the tamoxifen arm (p&lt;0.05). In the NSABP B-14 trial in which patients
were randomized to Tamoxifen 20 mg/day for 5 years versus placebo, the
incidence of second primary breast cancers is also reduced. </p>

<p>Published results from 122 patients (119 evaluable) and case reports
in 16 patients (13 evaluable) treated with Tamoxifen have shown that Tamoxifen
is effective for the palliative treatment of male breast cancer. Sixty-six
of these 132 evaluable patients responded to Tamoxifen which constitutes
a 50% objective response rate. </p>

<p><a name="INDICATIONS AND USAGE"></a><b>INDICATIONS AND USAGE </b></p>

<p>ADJUVANT THERAPY: Tamoxifen is indicated for the treatment of axillary
node- negative breast cancer in women following total mastectomy or segmental
mastectomy, axillary dissection, and breast irradiation. Data are insufficient
to predict which women are most likely to benefit and to determine if Tamoxifen
provides any benefit in women with tumors less than 1 cm. </p>

<p>Tamoxifen is indicated for the treatment of node- positive breast cancer
in postmenopausal women following total mastectomy or segmental mastectomy,
axillary dissection, and breast irradiation. In some Tamoxifen adjuvant
studies, most of the benefit to date has been in the subgroup with 4 or
more positive axillary nodes. </p>

<p>The estrogen and progesterone receptor values may help to predict whether
adjuvant Tamoxifen therapy is likely to be beneficial. </p>

<p>THERAPY FOR ADVANCED DISEASE: Tamoxifen is effective in the treatment
of metastatic breast cancer in women and men. In premenopausal women with
metastatic breast cancer, Tamoxifen is an alternative to oophorectomy or
ovarian irradiation. Available evidence indicates that patients whose tumors
are estrogen receptor positive are more likely to benefit from Tamoxifen
therapy. </p>

<p><a name="CONTRAINDICATIONS"></a><b>CONTRAINDICATIONS </b></p>

<p>Tamoxifen is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity
to the drug. </p>

<p><a name="WARNINGS"></a><b>WARNINGS </b></p>

<p>Visual disturbance including corneal changes, cataracts and retinopathy
have been reported in patients receiving Tamoxifen. </p>

<p>As with other additive hormonal therapy (estrogens and androgens), hypercalcemia
has been reported in some breast cancer patients with bone metastases within
a few weeks of starting treatment with Tamoxifen. If hypercalcemia does
occur, appropriate measures should be taken and, if severe, Tamoxifen should
be discontinued. </p>

<p>An increased incidence of endometrial changes including hyperplasia,
polyps, and endometrial cancer has been reported in association with Tamoxifen
treatment. The incidence and pattern of this increase suggest that the
underlying mechanism is related to the estrogenic properties of Tamoxifen.
Any patients receiving or having previously received Tamoxifen who report
abnormal vaginal bleeding should be promptly evaluated. </p>

<p>In a large randomized trial in Sweden of adjuvant Tamoxifen 40 mg/day
for 2-5 years, an increased incidence of uterine cancer was noted. Twenty
three of 1,372 patients randomized to receive Tamoxifen versus 4 of 1,357
patients randomized to the observation group developed cancer of the uterus
(RR = 5.6 (1.9-16.2), p &lt;.001). One of the patients with cancer of the
uterus who was randomized to receive Tamoxifen never took the drug. After
approximately 6.8 years of follow-up in the ongoing NSABP B-14 trial, 15
of 1,419 women randomized to receive Tamoxifen 20 mg/day for 5 years developed
uterine cancer and 2 of the 1,424 women randomized to receive placebo,
who subsequently were treated with Tamoxifen, also developed uterine cancer.
Most of the uterine cancers were diagnosed at an early stage, but deaths
from uterine cancer have been reported. Patients receiving Tamoxifen should
have routine gynecological care and they should promptly inform their physician
if they experience any menstrual irregularities, abnormal vaginal bleeding,
change in vaginal discharge, or pelvic pain or pressure. </p>

<p>Tamoxifen has been associated with changes in liver enzyme levels, and
on rare occasions, a spectrum of more severe liver abnormalities including
fatty liver, cholestasis, hepatitis and hepatic necrosis. A few of these
serious cases included fatalities. In most reported cases the relationship
to Tamoxifen is uncertain. However, some positive rechallenges and dechallenges
have been reported. </p>

<p>In the Swedish trial using adjuvant Tamoxifen 40 mg/day for 2-5 years,
3 cases of liver cancer have been reported in the Tamoxifen-treated group
versus 1 case in the observation group. In other clinical trials evaluating
Tamoxifen, no other cases of liver cancer have been reported to date. </p>

<p>Data from the NSABP B-14 study show no increase in other (non-uterine)
cancers among patients receiving Tamoxifen. However, a number of second
primary tumors, occurring at sites other than the endometrium, have been
reported following the treatment of breast cancer with Tamoxifen in clinical
trials. Whether an increased risk for other (non-uterine) cancers is associated
with Tamoxifen is still uncertain and continues to be evaluated. </p>

<p>PREGNANCY CATEGORY D: Tamoxifen may cause fetal harm when administered
to a pregnant woman. Women should be advised not to become pregnant while
taking Tamoxifen and should use barrier or nonhormonal contraceptive measures
if sexually active. Effects on reproductive functions are expected from
the antiestrogenic properties of the drug. In reproductive studies in rats
at dose levels equal to or below the human dose, nonteratogenic developmental
skeletal changes were seen and were found reversible. In addition, in fertility
studies in rats and in teratology studies in rabbits using doses at or
below those used in humans, a lower incidence of embryo implantation and
a higher incidence of fetal death or retarded in utero growth were observed,
with slower learning behavior in some rat pups when compared to historical
controls. Several pregnant marmosets were dosed during organogenesis or
in the last half of pregnancy. No deformations were seen and, although
the dose was high enough to terminate pregnancy in some animals, those
that did maintain pregnancy showed no evidence of teratogenic malformations.
</p>

<p>In rodent models of fetal reproductive tract development, tamoxifen
(at doses 0.3 to 2.4-fold the human maximum recommended dose on a mg/M(squared)
basis) caused changes in both sexes that are similar to those caused by
estradiol, ethynylestradiol and diethylstilbestrol. Although the clinical
relevance of these changes is unknown, some of these changes, especially
vaginal adenosis, are similar to those seen in young women who were exposed
to diethylstilbestrol in utero and who have a 1 in 1000 risk of developing
clear-cell adenocarcinoma of the vagina or cervix. To date, in utero exposure
to tamoxifen has not been shown to cause vaginal adenosis, or clear-cell
adenocarcinoma of the vagina or cervix, in young women. However, only a
small number of young women have been exposed to tamoxifen in utero, and
a smaller number have been followed long enough (to age 15-20) to determine
whether vaginal or cervical neoplasia could occur as a result of this exposure.
</p>

<p>There are no adequate and well controlled trials of tamoxifen in pregnant
women. There have been a small number of reports of vaginal bleeding, spontaneous
abortions, birth defects, and fetal deaths in pregnant women. If this drug
is used during pregnancy, or the patient becomes pregnant while taking
this drug, or within approximately two months after discontinuing therapy,
the patient should be apprised of the potential risks to the fetus including
the potential long term risk of a DES-like syndrome. </p>

<p><a name="PRECAUTIONS"></a><b>PRECAUTIONS </b></p>

<p>GENERAL: Decreases in platelet counts, usually to 50,000-100,000/mm(cubed),
infrequently lower, have been occasionally reported in patients taking
Tamoxifen for breast cancer. In patients with significant thrombocytopenia,
rare hemorrhagic episodes have occurred, but it is uncertain if these episodes
are due to Tamoxifen therapy. Leukopenia has been observed, sometimes in
association with anemia and/or thrombocytopenia. There have been rare reports
of neutropenia and pancytopenia in patients receiving Tamoxifen; this can
sometimes be severe. </p>

<p>INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS: Women taking or having previously taken Tamoxifen
should be instructed to report abnormal vaginal bleeding which should be
promptly investigated. </p>

<p>LABORATORY TESTS: Periodic complete blood counts, including platelet
counts and periodic liver function tests should be obtained. </p>

<p>DRUG INTERACTIONS: When Tamoxifen is used in combination with coumarin-type
anticoagulants, a significant increase in anticoagulant effect may occur.
Where such coadministration exists, careful monitoring of the patient's
prothrombin time is recommended. </p>

<p>There is an increased risk of thromboembolic events occurring when cytotoxic
agents are used in combination with Tamoxifen. </p>

<p>Tamoxifen, N-desmethyl tamoxifen and 4-Hydroxytamoxifen have been found
to be potent inhibitors of hepatic cytochrome p-450 mixed function oxidases.
The effect of tamoxifen on metabolism and excretion of other antineoplastic
drugs, such as cyclophosphamide and other drugs that require mixed function
oxidases for activation, is not known. </p>

<p>One patient receiving Tamoxifen with concomitant phenobarbital exhibited
a steady state serum level of tamoxifen lower than that observed for other
patients (ie, 26 ng/mL vs. mean value of 122 ng/mL). However, the clinical
significance of this finding is not known. </p>

<p>Concomitant bromocriptine therapy has been shown to elevate serum tamoxifen
and N- desmethyltamoxifen. </p>

<p>DRUG/LABORATORY TESTING INTERACTIONS: During postmarketing surveillance,
T4 elevations were reported for a few postmenopausal patients which may
be explained by increases in thyroid-binding globulin. These elevations
were not accompanied by clinical hyperthyroidism. </p>

<p>Variations in the karyopyknotic index on vaginal smears and various
degrees of estrogen effect on Pap smears have been infrequently seen in
postmenopausal patients given Tamoxifen. </p>

<p>In the postmarketing experience with Tamoxifen, infrequent cases of
hyperlipidemias have been reported. Periodic monitoring of plasma triglycerides
and cholesterol may be indicated in patients with pre-existing hyperlipidemias.
CARCINOGENESIS: A conventional carcinogenesis study in rats (doses of 5,
20, and 35 mg/kg/day for up to 2 years) revealed hepatocellular carcinoma
at all doses, and the incidence of these tumors was significantly greater
among rats given 20 or 35 mg/kg/day (69%) than those given 5mg/kg/day (14%).
The incidence of these tumors in rats given 5 mg/kg/day (29.5 mg/M(squared))
was significantly greater than in controls. </p>

<p>In addition, preliminary data from 2 independent reports of 6-month
studies in rats reveal liver tumors which in one study are classified as
malignant. (See WARNINGS.) </p>

<p>Endocrine changes in immature and mature mice were investigated in a
13-month study. Granulosa cell ovarian tumors and interstitial cell testicular
tumors were found in mice receiving Tamoxifen, but not in the controls.
MUTAGENESIS: Although no genotoxic potential was found in a conventional
battery of in vivo and in vitro tests with pro- and eukaryotic test systems
with drug metabolizing systems present, increased levels of DNA adducts
have been found in the livers of rats exposed to tamoxifen. Tamoxifen also
has been found to increase levels of micronucleus formation in vitro in
human lymphoblastoid cell line (MCL-5). Based on these findings, tamoxifen
is genotoxic in rodent and human MCL-5 cells. </p>

<p>IMPAIRMENT OF FERTILITY: Fertility in female rats was decreased following
administration of 0.04 mg/kg for two weeks prior to mating through day
7 of pregnancy. There was a decreased number of implantations, and all
fetuses were found dead. </p>

<p>Following administration to rats of 0.16 mg/kg from days 7-17 of pregnancy,
there were increased numbers of fetal deaths. Administration of 0.125 mg/kg
to rabbits during days 6-18 of pregnancy resulted in abortion or premature
delivery. Fetal deaths occurred at higher doses. There were no teratogenic
changes in either rat or rabbit segment II studies. Several pregnant marmosets
were dosed with 10 mg/kg/day either during organogenesis or in the last
half of pregnancy. No deformations were seen, and although the dose was
high enough to terminate pregnancy in some animals, those that did maintain
pregnancy showed no evidence of teratogenic malformations. Rats given 0.16
mg/kg from day 17 of pregnancy to 1 day before weaning demonstrated increased
numbers of dead pups at parturition. It was reported that some rat pups
showed slower learning behavior, but this did not achieve statistical significance
in one study, and in another study where significance was reported, this
was obtained by comparing dosed animals with controls of another study.
</p>

<p>The recommended daily human dose of 20-40 mg corresponds to 0.4-0.8
mg/kg for an average 50 kg woman. </p>

<p>PREGNANCY CATEGORY D: See WARNINGS. </p>

<p>NURSING MOTHERS: It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human
milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the
potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from Tamoxifen,
a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue
the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.

<p><a name="ADVERSE REACTIONS"></a><b>ADVERSE REACTIONS </b></p>

<p>Adverse reactions to Tamoxifen are relatively mild and rarely severe
enough to require discontinuation of treatment. If adverse reactions are
severe, it is sometimes possible to control them by a simple reduction
of dosage without loss of control of the disease. </p>

<p>In patients treated with Tamoxifen for metastatic breast cancer, the
most frequent adverse reactions to Tamoxifen are hot flashes and nausea
and/or vomiting. These may occur in up to one- fourth of patients. </p>

<p>Less frequently reported adverse reactions are vaginal bleeding, vaginal
discharge, menstrual irregularities and skin rash. Usually these have not
been of sufficient severity to require dosage reduction or discontinuation
of treatment. </p>

<p>Increased bone and tumor pain and, also, local disease flare have occurred,
which are sometimes associated with a good tumor response. Patients with
increased bone pain may require additional analgesics. Patients with soft
tissue disease may have sudden increases in the size of preexisting lesions,
sometimes associated with marked erythema within and surrounding the lesions
and/or the development of new lesions. When they occur, the bone pain or
disease flare are seen shortly after starting Tamoxifen and generally subside
rapidly. Other adverse reactions which are seen infrequently are hypercalcemia,
peripheral edema, distaste for food, pruritus vulvae, depression, dizziness,
light-headedness, headache, hair thinning and/or partial hair loss, and
vaginal dryness. </p>

<p>Tamoxifen has been associated with changes in liver enzyme levels, and
on rare occasions, a spectrum of more severe liver abnormalities including
fatty liver, cholestasis, hepatitis and hepatic necrosis. A few of these
serious cases included fatalities. In most reported cases the relationship
to Tamoxifen is uncertain. However, some positive rechallenges and dechallenges
have been reported. </p>

<p>There have been a few reports of endometriosis and uterine fibroids
in women receiving Tamoxifen. The underlying mechanism may be due to the
partial estrogenic effect of Tamoxifen. Ovarian cysts have also been observed
in a small number of premenopausal patients with advanced breast cancer
who have been treated with Tamoxifen. </p>

<p>Continued clinical studies have resulted in further information which
better indicates the incidence of adverse reactions with Tamoxifen as compared
to placebo. </p>

<p>In the ongoing NSABP study B-14, women with axillary node-negative breast
cancer were randomized to 5 years of Tamoxifen 20 mg/day or placebo following
primary surgery. The reported adverse effects are tabulated below (mean
follow- up of approximately 6.8 years). The incidence of hot flashes (64%
v 48%), vaginal discharge (30% v 15%), and irregular menses (25% v 19%)
were higher with Tamoxifen compared with placebo. All other adverse effects
occurred with similar frequency in the two treatment groups, with the exception
of thrombotic events, which although rare, were more common with Tamoxifen
than with placebo. Two of the patients treated with Tamoxifen who had thrombotic
events died. </p>

<p>In the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) adjuvant breast cancer
trial, Tamoxifen or placebo was administered for 2 years to women following
mastectomy. When compared to placebo, Tamoxifen showed a significantly
higher incidence of hot flashes (19% versus 8% for placebo). The incidence
of all other adverse reactions was similar in the 2 treatment groups with
the exception of thrombocytopenia where the incidence for Tamoxifen was
10% versus 3% for placebo, an observation of borderline statistical significance.
</p>

<p>The other adverse reactions reported equally in the ECOG study for Tamoxifen
and placebo include abnormal renal function tests, fatigue, dyspnea, anorexia,
cough, and abdominal cramps. A relationship of these reactions to the administration
of Tamoxifen has not been demonstrated since the frequency was not significantly
different from that reported in placebo treated women. </p>

<p>In other adjuvant studies, Toronto and Tamoxifen Adjuvant Trial Organization
(NATO), women received either Tamoxifen or no therapy. In the Toronto study,
hot flashes and nausea and/or vomiting were observed in 29% and 19% of
patients, respectively, for Tamoxifen versus 1% and 0% in the untreated
group. In the NATO trial, hot flashes, nausea and/or vomiting and vaginal
bleeding were reported in 2.8%, 2.1% and 2.0% of women, respectively, for
Tamoxifen versus 0.2% for each in the untreated group. </p>

*   Some women had more than one adverse reaction.</pre>

<p>Tamoxifen is well tolerated in males with breast cancer. Reports from
the literature and case reports suggest that the safety profile of Tamoxifen
in males is similar to that seen in women. Loss of libido and impotence
had resulted in discontinuation of tamoxifen therapy in male patients.
Also, in oligospermic males treated with tamoxifen, LH, FSH, testosterone
and estrogen levels were elevated. No significant clinical changes were
reported. </p>

<p><a name="OVERDOSAGE"></a><b>OVERDOSAGE </b></p>

<p>Signs observed at the highest doses following studies to determine LD50
in animals were respiratory difficulties and convulsions. </p>

<p>Acute overdosage in humans has not been reported. In a study of advanced
metastatic cancer patients which specifically determined the maximum tolerated
dose of Tamoxifen in evaluating the use of very high doses to reverse multidrug
resistance, acute neurotoxicity manifested by tremor, hyperreflexia, unsteady
gait and dizziness were noted. These symptoms occurred within 3-5 days
of beginning Tamoxifen and cleared within 2-5 days after stopping therapy.
No permanent neurologic toxicity was noted. One patient experienced a seizure
several days after Tamoxifen was discontinued and neurotoxic symptoms had
resolved. The causal relationship of the seizure to Tamoxifen therapy is
unknown. Doses given in these patients were all greater than 400mg/M(squared)
loading dose, followed by maintenance doses of 150 mg/M(squared) of Tamoxifen
given twice a day. </p>

<p>In the same study, prolongation of the QT interval on the electrocardiogram
was noted when patients were given doses higher than 250 mg/M(squared)
loading dose, followed by maintenance doses of 80 mg/M(squared) of Tamoxifen
given twice a day. For a woman with a body surface area of 1.5 M(squared)
the minimal loading dose and maintenance doses given at which neurological
symptoms and QT changes occurred were at least 6 fold higher in respect
to the maximum recommended dose. </p>

<p>No specific treatment for overdosage is known; treatment must be symptomatic.
</p>

<p><a name="DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION"></a><b>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
</b></p>

<p>In women and men with metastatic breast cancer, one or two 10 mg Tamoxifen
tablets are administered twice a day (morning and evening), or one 20 mg
Tamoxifen tablet administered once or twice a day. </p>

<p>In three single agent adjuvant studies in women, one 10 mg Tamoxifen
tablet was administered two (ECOG and NATO) or three (Toronto) times a
day for two years (see ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY). In B-14, the ongoing
NSABP adjuvant study in women, one 10 mg Tamoxifen tablet is being given
twice a day for five years. </p>

<p>In the EBCTCG 1990 overview, the reduction in recurrence and mortality
was greater in those studies that used tamoxifen for two years or longer
than in those that used tamoxifen for less than two years. There was no
indication that doses greater than 20 mg per day were more effective. The
optimal duration of adjuvant therapy is not known. </p>

<p>The chemical name for ethynodiol diacetate is 19-nor-17alpha-pregn-4-en-20-yne-
3beta, 17-diol diacetate, and for ethinyl estradiol it is 19-nor-17alpha-pregna
1,3,5(10)-trien-20-yne-3, 17-diol. </p>

<p>Therapeutic class: Oral contraceptive.</p>

<p><a name="ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY"></a><b> ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
</b></p>

<p>Combination oral contraceptives act primarily by suppression of gonadotropins.
Although the primary mechanism of this action is inhibition of ovulation,
other alterations in the genital tract, including changes in the cervical
mucus (which increase the difficulty of sperm entry into the uterus) and
the endometrium (which may reduce the likelihood of implantation) may also
contribute to contraceptive effectiveness. </p>

<p><a name="INDICATIONS AND USAGE"></a><b>INDICATIONS AND USAGE </b></p>

<p>Ethynodiol and ethinyl estradiol are indicated for the prevention of
pregnancy in women who elect to use oral contraceptives as a method of
contraception. </p>

<p>Oral contraceptives are highly effective. Table 1 lists the typical
accidental pregnancy rates for users of combination oral contraceptives
and other methods of contraception. The efficacy of these contraceptive
methods, except sterilization, depends upon the reliability with which
they are used. Correct and consistent use of methods can result in lower
failure rates. </p>

<p>CIGARETTE SMOKING INCREASES THE RISK OF SERIOUS CARDIOVASCULAR SIDE
EFFECTS FROM ORAL CONTRACEPTIVE USE. THIS RISK INCREASES WITH AGE AND WITH
HEAVY SMOKING (15 OR MORE CIGARETTES PER DAY) AND IS QUITE MARKED IN WOMEN
OVER 35 YEARS OF AGE. WOMEN WHO USE ORAL CONTRACEPTIVES SHOULD BE STRONGLY
ADVISED NOT TO SMOKE. </p>

<p>The use of oral contraceptives is associated with increased risk of
several serious conditions including venous and arterial thromboembolism,
thrombotic and hemorrhagic stroke, myocardial infarction, liver tumors
or other liver lesions, and gallbladder disease. The risk of morbidity
and mortality increases significantly in the presence of other risk factors
such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia, obesity, and diabetes mellitus. </p>

<p>Practitioners prescribing oral contraceptives should be familiar with
the following information relating to these and other risks. </p>

<p>The information contained herein is principally based on studies carried
out in patients who used oral contraceptives with formulations containing
higher amounts of estrogens and progestogens than those in common use today.
The effect of long-term use of the oral contraceptives with lesser amounts
of both estrogens and progestogens remains to be determined. </p>

<p>Throughout this labeling, epidemiological studies reported are of two
types: retrospective case-control studies and prospective cohort studies.
Case-control studies provide an estimate of the relative risk of a disease,
which is defined as the Ratio of the incidence of a disease among oral
contraceptive users to that among nonusers. The relative risk (or odds
ratio) does not provide information about the actual clinical occurrence
of a disease. Cohort studies provide a measure of both the relative risk
and the attributable risk. The latter is the Difference in the incidence
of disease between oral contraceptive users and nonusers. The attributable
risk does provide information about the actual occurrence or incidence
of a disease in the subject population. For further information, the reader
is referred to a text on epidemiological methods. </p>

<p>1. THROMBOEMBOLIC DISORDERS AND OTHER VASCULAR PROBLEMS. </p>

<p>A. MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION. An increased risk of myocardial infarction
has been associated with oral contraceptive use. (REF. 2-21) This increased
risk is primarily in smokers or in women with other underlying risk factors
for coronary artery disease such as hypertension, obesity, diabetes, and
hypercholesterolemia. The relative risk for myocardial infarction in current
oral contraceptive users has been estimated to be 2 to 6. The risk is very
low under the age of 30. However, there is the possibility of a risk of
cardiovascular disease even in very young women who take oral contraceptives.
</p>

<p>Smoking in combination with oral contraceptive use has been reported
to contribute substantially to the risk of myocardial infarction in women
in their mid-thirties or older, with smoking accounting for the majority
of excess cases. (REF. 22) Mortality rates associated with circulatory
disease have been shown to increase substantially in smokers, especially
in those 35 years of age and older among women who use oral contraceptives
(see Figure 1, Table 2). </p>

<p>Oral contraceptives may compound the effects of well-known cardiovascular
risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemias, hypercholesterolemia,
age, cigarette smoking, and obesity. In particular, some progestogens decrease
HDL cholesterol (REF. 23-31) and cause glucose intolerance, while estrogens
may create a state of hyperinsulinism. (REF. 32) Oral contraceptives have
been shown to increase blood pressure among some users (see Warning No.
9). Similar effects on risk factors have been associated with an increased
risk of heart disease. </p>

<p>B. THROMBOEMBOLISM. An increased risk of thromboembolic and thrombotic
disease associated with the use of oral contraceptives is well established.
(REF. 17,33 51) Case-control studies have estimated the relative risk to
be 3 for the first episode of superficial venous thrombosis, 4 to 11 for
deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, and 1.5 to 6 for women with
predisposing conditions for venous thromboembolic disease. (REF. 34-37,45,46)
Cohort studies have shown the relative risk to be somewhat lower, about
3 for new cases (subjects with no past history of venous thrombosis or
varicose veins) and about 4.5 for new cases requiring hospitalization.
(REF. 42,47,48) The risk of venous thromboembolic disease associated with
oral contraceptives is not related to duration of use. </p>

<p>A two- to seven-fold increase in relative risk of postoperative thromboembolic
complications has been reported with the use of oral contraceptives. (REF.
38 39) The relative risk of venous thrombosis in women who have predisposing
conditions is about twice that of women without such medical conditions.
(REF. 43) If feasible, oral contraceptives should be discontinued at least
4 weeks prior to and for 2 weeks after elective surgery of a type associated
with an increased risk of thromboembolism, and also during and following
prolonged immobilization. Since the immediate postpartum period is also
associated with an increased risk of thromboembolism, oral contraceptives
should be started no earlier than 4 to 6 weeks after delivery in women
who elect not to breast feed. </p>

<p>C. CEREBROVASCULAR DISEASES. Both the relative and attributable risks
of cerebrovascular events (thrombotic and hemorrhagic strokes) have been
reported to be increased with oral contraceptive use, (REF. 14,17,18,34,42,46,52-59)
although, in general, the risk was greatest among older (over 35 years),
hypertensive women who also smoked. Hypertension was reported to be a risk
factor for both users and nonusers, for both types of strokes, while smoking
increased the risk for hemorrhagic strokes. </p>

<p>In one large study, (REF. 52) the relative risk for thrombotic stroke
was reported as 9.5 times greater in users than in nonusers. It ranged
from 3 for normotensive users to 14 for users with severe hypertension.
(REF. 54) The relative risk for hemorrhagic stroke was reported to be 1.2
for nonsmokers who used oral contraceptives, 1.9 to 2.6 for smokers who
did not use oral contraceptives, 6.1 to 7.6 for smokers who used oral contraceptives,
1.8 for normotensive users, and 25.7 for users with severe hypertension.
The risk is also greater in older women and among smokers. </p>

<p>D. DOSE-RELATED RISK OF VASCULAR DISEASE WITH ORAL CONTRACEPTIVES. A
positive association has been reported between the amount of estrogen and
progestogen in oral contraceptives and the risk of vascular disease. (REF.
41,43,53,59-64) A decline in serum high density lipoproteins (HDL) has
been reported with many progestogens. (REF. 23-31) A decline in serum high
density lipoproteins has been associated with an increased incidence of
ischemic heart disease. (REF. 65) Because estrogens increase HDL-cholesterol,
the net effect of an oral contraceptive depends on the balance achieved
between doses of estrogen and progestogen and the nature and absolute amount
of progestogens used in the contraceptives. The amount of both steroids
should be considered in the choice of an oral contraceptive. </p>

<p>Minimizing exposure to estrogen and progestogen is in keeping with good
principles of therapeutics. For any particular estrogen-progestogen combination
the dosage regimen prescribed should be one that contains the least amount
of estrogen and progestogen that is compatible with a low failure rate
and the needs of the individual patient. New acceptors of oral contraceptives
should be started on preparations containing the lowest estrogen content
that produces satisfactory results in the individual. </p>

<p>E. PERSISTENCE OF RISK OF VASCULAR DISEASE. There are three studies
that have shown persistence of risk of vascular disease for users of oral
contraceptives. In a study in the United States, the risk of developing
myocardial infarction after discontinuing oral contraceptives persisted
for at least 9 years for women 40-49 years old who had used oral contraceptives
for 5 or more years, but this increased risk was not demonstrated in other
age groups. (REF. 16) Another American study reported former use of oral
contraceptives was significantly associated with increased risk of subarachnoid
hemorrhage. (REF. 57) In another study, in Great Britain, the risk of developing
nonrheumatic heart disease plus hypertension, subarachnoid hemorrhage,
cerebral thrombosis, and transient ischemic attacks persisted for at least
6 years after discontinuation of oral contraceptives, although the excess
risk was small. (REF. 14,18,66) It should be noted that these studies were
performed with oral contraceptive formulations containing 50 mcg or more
of estrogens. </p>

<p>2. ESTIMATES OF MORTALITY FROM CONTRACEPTIVE USE. One study (REF. 67)
gathered data from a variety of sources that have estimated the mortality
rates associated with different methods of contraception at different ages
(Table 2). These estimates include the combined risk of death associated
with contraceptive methods plus the risk attributable to pregnancy in the
event of method failure. Each method of contraception has its specific
benefits and risks. The study concluded that, with the exception of oral
contraceptive users 35 and older who smoke and 40 or older who do not smoke,
mortality associated with all methods of birth control is low and below
that associated with childbirth. The observation of a possible increase
in risk of mortality with age for oral contraceptive users is based on
data gathered in the 1970's, but not reported until 1983. (REF. 67) However,
current clinical practice involves the use of lower estrogen dose formulations
combined with careful restriction of oral contraceptive use to women who
do not have the various risk factors listed in this labeling. </p>

<p>Because of these changes in practice and, also, because of some limited
new data that suggest that the risk of cardiovascular disease with the
use of oral contraceptives may now be less than previously observed, (REF.
48,152) the Fertility and Maternal Health Drugs Advisory Committee was
asked to review the topic in 1989. The Committee concluded that, although
cardiovascular disease risks may be increased with oral contraceptive use
after age 40 in healthy nonsmoking women (even with the newer low-dose
formulations), there are greater potential health risks associated with
pregnancy in older women and with the alternative surgical and medical
procedures that may be necessary if such women do not have access to effective
and acceptable means of contraception. Therefore, the Committee recommended
that the benefits of oral contraceptive use by healthy nonsmoking women
over 40 may outweigh the possible risks. Of course, older women, as all
women who take oral contraceptives, should take the lowest dose formulation
that is effective. </p>

Adapted from Ory. (REF. 67)    </pre>

<p>3. CARCINOMA OF THE BREAST AND REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS. Numerous epidemiological
studies have been performed on the incidence of breast, endometrial, ovarian,
and cervical cancer in women using oral contraceptives. While there are
conflicting reports, most studies suggest that the use of oral contraceptives
is not associated with an overall increase in the risk of developing breast
cancer. (REF. 17,40,68-78) Some studies have reported an increased relative
risk of developing breast cancer, particularly at a young age. (REF. 79-102
151) This increased relative risk appears to be related to duration of
use. </p>

<p>Some studies suggested that oral contraceptive use was associated with
an increase in the risk of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, dysplasia,
erosion, carcinoma, or microglandular dysplasia in some populations of
women. (REF. 17 50,103-115) However, there continues to be controversy
about the extent to which such findings may be due to differences in sexual
behavior and other factors. </p>

<p>In spite of many studies of the relationship between oral contraceptive
use and breast and cervical cancers, a cause and effect relationship has
not been established. </p>

<p>4. HEPATIC NEOPLASIA. Benign hepatic adenomas and other hepatic lesions
have been associated with oral contraceptive use, (REF. 116-121) although
the incidence of such benign tumors is rare in the United States. Indirect
calculations have estimated the attributable risk to be in the range of
3.3 cases per 100,000 for users, a risk that increases after 4 or more
years of use. (REF. 120) Rupture of benign, hepatic adenomas or other lesions
may cause death through intra-abdominal hemorrhage. Therefore, such lesions
should be considered in women presenting with abdominal pain and tenderness,
abdominal mass, or shock. About one quarter of the cases presented because
of abdominal masses; up to one half had signs and symptoms of acute intraperitoneal
hemorrhage. (REF. 121) Diagnosis may prove difficult. </p>

<p>Studies from the U.S., (REF. 122,150) Great Britain, (REF. 123,124)
and Italy (REF. 125) have shown an increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma
in long term (&gt;8 years; relative risk of 7-20) oral contraceptive users.
However, these cancers are rare in the United States, and the attributable
risk (the excess incidence) of liver cancers in oral contraceptive users
approaches less than 1 per 1,000,000 users. </p>

<p>5. OCULAR LESIONS. There have been reports of retinal thrombosis and
other ocular lesions associated with the use of oral contraceptives. Oral
contraceptives should be discontinued if there is unexplained, gradual
or sudden, partial or complete loss of vision; onset of proptosis or diplopia;
papilledema; or any evidence of retinal vascular lesions. Appropriate diagnostic
and therapeutic measures should be undertaken immediately. 6. ORAL CONTRACEPTIVE
USE BEFORE OR DURING PREGNANCY. Extensive epidemiological studies have
revealed no increased risk of birth defects in women who have used oral
contraceptives prior to pregnancy. (REF. 126,129) The majority of recent
studies also do not suggest a teratogenic effect, particularly insofar
as cardiac anomalies and limb reduction defects are concerned, (REF. 126-129)
when the pill is taken inadvertently during early pregnancy. </p>

<p>The administration of oral contraceptives to induce withdrawal bleeding
should not be used as a test for pregnancy. Oral contraceptives should
not be used during pregnancy to treat threatened or habitual abortion.
It is recommended that for any patient who has missed two consecutive periods,
pregnancy should be ruled out before continuing oral contraceptive use.
If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed schedule, the possibility
of pregnancy should be considered at the time of the first missed period
and further use of oral contraceptives should be withheld until pregnancy
has been ruled out. Oral contraceptive use should be discontinued if pregnancy
is confirmed. </p>

<p>7. GALLBLADDER DISEASE. Earlier studies reported an increased lifetime
relative risk of gallbladder surgery in users of oral contraceptives and
estrogens. (REF. 40,42,53,70) More recent studies, however, have shown
that the relative risk of developing gallbladder disease among oral contraceptive
users may be minimal. (REF. 130-132) The recent findings of minimal risk
may be related to the use of oral contraceptive formulations containing
lower doses of estrogens and progestogens. </p>

<p>8. CARBOHYDRATE AND LIPID METABOLIC EFFECTS. Oral contraceptives have
been shown to cause a decrease in glucose tolerance in a significant percentage
of users. (REF. 32) This effect has been shown to be directly related to
estrogen dose. (REF. 133) Progestogens increase insulin secretion and create
insulin resistance, the effect varying with different progestational agents.
(REF. 32 134) However, in the nondiabetic woman, oral contraceptives appear
to have no effect on fasting blood glucose. Because of these demonstrated
effects, prediabetic and diabetic women should be carefully observed while
taking oral contraceptives. </p>

<p>Some women may have persistent hypertriglyceridemia while on the pill.
As discussed earlier (see Warnings 1a and 1d), changes in serum triglycerides
and lipoprotein levels have been reported in oral contraceptive users.
(REF. 23- 31 135,136) </p>

<p>9. ELEVATED BLOOD PRESSURE. An increase in blood pressure has been reported
in women taking oral contraceptives (REF.. 50,53,137-139) and this increase
is more likely in older oral contraceptive users (REF. 137) and with extended
duration of use. (REF. 53) Data from the Royal College of General Practitioners
(REF. 138) and subsequent randomized trials have shown that the incidence
of hypertension increases with increasing concentrations of progestogens.
</p>

<p>Women with a history of hypertension or hypertension-related diseases,
or renal disease (REF. 139) should be encouraged to use another method
of contraception. If such women elect to use oral contraceptives, they
should be monitored closely and if significant elevation of blood pressure
occurs, oral contraceptives should be discontinued. For most women, elevated
blood pressure will return to normal after stopping oral contraceptives,
(REF. 137) and there is no difference in the occurrence of hypertension
among ever- and never-users. (REF. 140) </p>

<p>10. HEADACHE. The onset or exacerbation of migraine or the development
of headache of a new pattern that is recurrent, persistent, or severe requires
discontinuation of oral contraceptives and evaluation of the cause. </p>

<p>11. BLEEDING IRREGULARITIES. Breakthrough bleeding and spotting are
sometimes encountered in patients on oral contraceptives, especially during
the first three months of use. Nonhormonal causes should be considered
and adequate diagnostic measures taken to rule out malignancy or pregnancy
in the event of breakthrough bleeding, as in the case of any abnormal vaginal
bleeding. If a pathologic basis has been excluded, time alone or a change
to another formulation may solve the problem. In the event of amenorrhea,
pregnancy should be ruled out. </p>

<p><a name="PRECAUTIONS"></a><b>PRECAUTIONS </b></p>

<p>1. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION AND FOLLOW-UP. A complete medical history and
physical examination should be completed prior to the initiation or reinstitution
of oral contraceptives and at least annually during the use of oral contraceptives.
These physical examinations should include special reference to blood pressure,
breasts, abdomen, and pelvic organs, including cervical cytology, and relevant
laboratory tests. In case of undiagnosed, persistent, or recurrent abnormal
vaginal bleeding, appropriate diagnostic measures should be conducted to
rule out malignancy. Women with a strong family history of breast cancer
or who have breast nodules should be monitored with particular care. </p>

<p>2. LIPID DISORDERS. Women who are being treated for hyperlipidemias
should be followed closely if they elect to use oral contraceptives. Some
progestogens may elevate LDL levels and may render the control of hyperlipidemias
more difficult. </p>

<p>3. LIVER FUNCTION. If jaundice develops in any woman receiving oral
contraceptives, they should be discontinued. Steroids may be poorly metabolized
in patients with impaired liver function and should be administered with
caution in such patients. Cholestatic jaundice has been reported after
combined treatment with oral contraceptives and troleandomycin. Hepatotoxicity
following a combination of oral contraceptives and cyclosporine has also
been reported. </p>

<p>4. FLUID RETENTION. Oral contraceptives may cause some degree of fluid
retention. They should be prescribed with caution, and only with careful
monitoring, in patients with conditions that might be aggravated by fluid
retention, such as convulsive disorders, migraine syndrome, asthma, or
cardiac, hepatic, or renal dysfunction. </p>

<p>5. EMOTIONAL DISORDERS. Women with a history of depression should be
carefully observed and the drug discontinued if depression recurs to a
serious degree. </p>

<p>6. CONTACT LENSES. Contact lens wearers who develop visual changes or
changes in lens tolerance should be assessed by an opthalmologist. </p>

<p>7. DRUG INTERACTIONS. Reduced efficacy and increased incidence of breakthrough
bleeding and menstrual irregularities have been associated with concomitant
use of rifampin. A similar association, though less marked, has been suggested
for barbiturates, phenylbutazone, phenytoin sodium, and possibly with griseofulvin,
ampicillin, and tetracyclines. </p>

<p>8. LABORATORY TEST INTERACTIONS. Certain endocrine and liver function
tests and blood components may be affected by oral contraceptives: </p>

<p>a. Increased prothrombin and factors VII, VIII, IX, and X; decreased
antithrombin III; increased platelet aggregability. </p>

<p>b. Increased thyroid binding globulin (TBG), leading to increased circulating
total thyroid hormone as measured by protein-bound iodine (PBI), T4 by
column or by radioimmunoassay. Free T3 resin uptake is decreased, reflecting
the elevated TBG; free T4 concentration is unaltered. </p>

<p>c. Other binding proteins may be elevated in the serum. </p>

<p>d. Sex-steroid binding globulins are increased and result in elevated
levels of total circulating sex steroids and corticoids; however, free
or biologically active levels remain unchanged. </p>

<p>e. Triglycerides and phospholipids may be increased. </p>

<p>f. Glucose tolerance may be decreased. </p>

<p>g. Serum folate levels may be depressed. This may be of clinical significance
if a woman becomes pregnant shortly after discontinuing oral contraceptives.
</p>

<p>h. Increased sulfobromophthalein and other abnormalities in liver function
tests may occur. </p>

<p>i. Plasma levels of trace minerals may be altered. </p>

<p>j. Response to the metyrapone test may be reduced. </p>

<p>9. CARCINOGENESIS. See Warnings. </p>

<p>10. PREGNANCY. Pregnancy Category X. See Contraindications and Warnings.
</p>

<p>11. NURSING MOTHERS. Small amounts of oral contraceptive steroids have
been identified in the milk of nursing mothers (REF. 141-143) and a few
adverse effects on the child have been reported, including jaundice and
breast enlargement. In addition, oral contraceptives given in the postpartum
period may interfere with lactation by decreasing the quantity and quality
of breast milk. If possible, the nursing mother should be advised not to
use oral contraceptives, but to use other forms of contraception until
she has completely weaned her child. </p>

<p>12. VENEREAL DISEASES. Oral contraceptives are of no value in the prevention
or treatment of venereal disease. The prevalence of cervical Chlamydia
Trachomatis and Neisseria Gonorrhoeae in oral contraceptive users is increased
several- fold. (REF. 144,145) It should not be assumed that oral contraceptives
afford protection against pelvic inflammatory disease from chlamydia. (REF.
144) </p>

<p>13. GENERAL. </p>

<p>a. The pathologist should be advised of oral contraceptive therapy when
relevant specimens are submitted. </p>

<p>b. Treatment with oral contraceptives may mask the onset of the climacteric.
(See Warnings regarding risks in this age group.) </p>

<p><a name="DRUG INTERACTIONS"></a><b>DRUG INTERACTIONS </b></p>

<p>Reduced efficacy and increased incidence of breakthrough bleeding and
menstrual irregularities have been associated with concomitant use of rifampin.

<p><a name="OVERDOSAGE"></a><b>OVERDOSAGE </b></p>

<p>Serious ill effects have not been reported following acute ingestion
of large doses of oral contraceptives by young children. (REF. 180,181)
Overdosage may cause nausea, and withdrawal bleeding may occur in females.
</p>

<p>NON-CONTRACEPTIVE HEALTH BENEFITS </p>

<p>The following non-contraceptive health benefits related to the use of
oral contraceptives are supported by epidemiological studies that largely
utilized oral contraceptive formulations containing estrogen doses exceeding
35 mcg of ethinyl estradiol or 50 mcg of mestranol. (REF. 148,149) </p>

<p>Effects On Menses: </p>

<p>-- Increased menstrual cycle regularity </p>

<p>-- Decreased blood loss and decreased risk of iron-deficiency anemia
</p>

<p>-- Decreased frequency of dysmenorrhea </p>

<p>Effects Related To Inhibition Of Ovulation:</p>

<p> -- Decreased risk of functional ovarian cysts </p>

<p>-- Decreased risk of ectopic pregnancies </p>

<p>Effects From Long-term Use: </p>

<p>-- Decreased risk of fibroadenomas and fibrocystic disease of the breast
</p>

<p>-- Decreased risk of acute pelvic inflammatory disease </p>

<p>-- Decreased risk of endometrial cancer </p>

<p>-- Decreased risk of ovarian cancer </p>

<p>-- Decreased risk of uterine fibroids </p>

<p><a name="DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION"></a><b>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
</b></p>

<p>To achieve maximum contraceptive effectiveness, oral contraceptives
must be taken exactly as directed and at intervals of 24 hours. </p>

<p>IMPORTANT: The patient should be instructed to use an additional method
of protection until after the first week of administration In The Initial
Cycle. The possibility of ovulation and conception prior to initiation
of use should be considered. </p>

<p>SPECIAL NOTES </p>

<p>Spotting Or Breakthrough Bleeding: If spotting (bleeding insufficient
to require a pad) or breakthrough bleeding (heavier bleeding similar to
a menstrual flow) occurs when these products are used for contraception,
the patient should continue taking her tablets as directed. The incidence
of spotting or breakthrough bleeding is minimal, most frequently occurring
in the first cycle. Ordinarily spotting or breakthrough bleeding will stop
within a week. Usually the patient will begin to cycle regularly within
two or three courses of tablet- taking. In the event of spotting or breakthrough
bleeding organic causes should be borne in mind.</p>

<p> Missed Menstrual Periods. Withdrawal flow will normally occur 2 or
3 days after the last active tablet is taken. Failure of withdrawal bleeding
ordinarily does not mean that the patient is pregnant, providing the dosage
schedule has been correctly followed.</p>

<p> If the patient has Not adhered to the prescribed dosage regimen, the
possibility of pregnancy should be considered after the first missed period,
and oral contraceptives should be withheld until pregnancy has been ruled
out. </p>

<p>If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two
consecutive periods, pregnancy should be ruled out before continuing the
contraceptive regimen. </p>

<p>The first intermenstrual interval after discontinuing the tablets is
usually prolonged; consequently, a patient for whom a 28-day cycle is usual
might not begin to menstruate for 35 days or longer. Ovulation in such
prolonged cycles will occur correspondingly later in the cycle. Posttreatment
cycles after the first one, however, are usually typical for the individual
woman prior to taking tablets. </p>

<p>Missed Tablets: If a woman misses taking one active tablet the missed
tablet should be taken as soon as it is remembered. In addition, the next
tablet should be taken at the usual time. If two consecutive active tablets
are missed the dosage should be doubled for the next 2 days. The regular
schedule should then be resumed, but an additional method of protection
is recommended for the remainder of the cycle. </p>

<p>While there is little likelihood of ovulation if only one active tablet
is missed, the possibility of spotting or breakthrough bleeding is increased
and should be expected if two or more successive active tablets are missed.
However the possibility of ovulation increases with each successive day
that scheduled active tablets are missed. </p>

<p>Hydroxychloroquine Sulfate is a colorless crystalline solid, soluble
in water to at least 20 percent; chemically the drug is 2-((4-((7-Chloro-
4- quinolyl)amino)pentyl)ethylamino) ethanol sulfate (1:1). </p>

<p><a name="ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY"></a><b>ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
</b></p>

<p>The drug possesses antimalarial actions and also exerts a beneficial
effect in lupus erythematosus (chronic discoid or systemic) and acute or
chronic rheumatoid arthritis. The precise mechanism of action is not known.
</p>

<p>MALARIA </p>

<p>Like chloroquine phosphate, USP, Hydroxychloroquine sulfate is highly
active against the erythrocytic forms of P. Vivax and Malariae and most
strains of P. Falciparum (but not the gametocytes of P. Falciparum). </p>

<p>Hydroxychloroquine sulfate does not prevent relapses in patients with
Vivax or Malariae malaria because it is not effective against exo-erythrocytic
forms of the parasite, nor will it prevent Vivax or Malariae infection
when administered as a prophylactic. It is highly effective as a suppressive
agent in patients with Vivax or Malariae malaria, in terminating acute
attacks, and significantly lengthening the interval between treatment and
relapse. In patients with Falciparum malaria, it abolishes the acute attack
and effects complete cure of the infection, unless due to a resistant strain
of P. Falciparum. </p>

<p><a name="INDICATIONS AND USAGE"></a><b>INDICATIONS AND USAGE </b></p>

<p>Hydroxychloroquine is indicated for the suppressive treatment and treatment
of acute attacks of malaria due to Plasmodium Vivax, P. Malariae, P. Ovale,
and susceptible strains of P. Falciparum. It is also indicated for the
treatment of discoid and systemic lupus erythematosus, and rheumatoid arthritis.
</p>

<p>MALARIA </p>

<p>Hydroxychloroquine sulfate, brand of hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets,
is indicated for the treatment of acute attacks and suppression of malaria.
</p>

<p>LUPUS ERYTHEMATOSUS AND RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS </p>

<p>Hydroxychloroquine is useful in patients with the following disorders
who have not responded satisfactorily to drugs with less potential for
serious side effects: lupus erythematosus (chronic discoid and systemic)
and acute or chronic rheumatoid arthritis. </p>

<p><a name="CONTRAINDICATIONS"></a><b>CONTRAINDICATIONS </b></p>

<p>Use of this drug is contraindicated (1) in the presence of retinal or
visual field changes attributable to any 4-aminoquinoline compound, (2)
in patients with known hypersensitivity to 4-aminoquinoline compounds,
and (3) for long-term therapy in children. </p>

<p>GENERAL </p>

<p>Hydroxychloroquine is not effective against chloroquine- resistant strains
of P. Falciparum. </p>

<p>Children are especially sensitive to the 4-aminoquinoline compounds.
A number of fatalities have been reported following the accidental ingestion
of chloroquine, sometimes in relatively small doses (0.75 g or 1 g in one
3-year-old child). Patients should be strongly warned to keep these drugs
out of the reach of children. </p>

<p>Use of Hydroxychloroquine in patients with psoriasis may precipitate
a severe attack of psoriasis. When used in patients with porphyria the
condition may be exacerbated. The preparation should not be used in these
conditions unless in the judgment of the physician the benefit to the patient
outweighs the possible hazard. </p>

<p>USAGE IN PREGNANCY--Usage of this drug during pregnancy should be avoided
except in the suppression or treatment of malaria when in the judgment
of the physician the benefit outweighs the possible hazard. It should be
noted that radioactively-tagged chloroquine administered intravenously
to pregnant, pigmented CBA mice passed rapidly across the placenta. It
accumulated selectively in the melanin structures of the fetal eyes and
was retained in the ocular tissues for five months after the drug had been
eliminated from the rest of the body. </p>

<p>MALARIA </p>

<p>In recent years, it has been found that certain strains of P. Falciparum
have become resistant to 4-aminoquinoline compounds (including hydroxychloroquine)
as shown by the fact that normally adequate doses have failed to prevent
or cure clinical malaria or parasitemia. Treatment with quinine or other
specific forms of therapy is therefore advised for patients infected with
a resistant strain of parasites. </p>

<p>LUPUS ERYTHEMATOSUS AND RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS PHYSICIANS SHOULD COMPLETELY
FAMILIARIZE THEMSELVES WITH THE COMPLETE CONTENTS OF THIS LEAFLET BEFORE
PRESCRIBING Hydroxychloroquine. </p>

<p>Irreversible retinal damage has been observed in some patients who had
received long-term or high- dosage 4-aminoquinoline therapy for discoid
and systemic lupus erythematosus, or rheumatoid arthritis. Retinopathy
has been reported to be dose related. </p>

<p>When prolonged therapy with any antimalarial compound is contemplated,
initial (base line) and periodic (every three months) ophthalmologic examinations
(including visual acuity, expert slit-lamp, funduscopic, and visual field
tests) should be performed. </p>

<p>If there is any indication of abnormality in the visual acuity, visual
field, or retinal macular areas (such as pigmentary changes, loss of foveal
reflex), or any visual symptoms (such as light flashes and streaks) which
are not fully explainable by difficulties of accommodation or corneal opacities,
the drug should be discontinued immediately and the patient closely observed
for possible progression. Retinal changes (and visual disturbances) may
progress even after cessation of therapy. </p>

<p>All patients on long-term therapy with this preparation should be questioned
and examined periodically, including the testing of knee and ankle reflexes,
to detect any evidence of muscular weakness. If weakness occurs, discontinue
the drug. </p>

<p>In the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, if objective improvement (such
as reduced joint swelling, increased mobility) does not occur within six
months, the drug should be discontinued. Safe use of the drug in the treatment
of juvenile arthritis has not been established. </p>

<p><a name="PRECAUTIONS"></a><b>PRECAUTIONS </b></p>

<p>GENERAL </p>

<p>Antimalarial compounds should be used with caution in patients with
hepatic disease or alcoholism or in conjunction with known hepatotoxic
drugs. Periodic blood cell counts should be made if patients are given
prolonged therapy. If any severe blood disorder appears which is not attributable
to the disease under treatment, discontinuation of the drug should be considered.
The drug should be administered with caution in patients having G-6-PD
(glucose-6- phosphate dehydrogenase) deficiency. </p>

<p>LUPUS ERYTHEMATOSUS AND RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS </p>

<p>Dermatologic reactions to Hydroxychloroquine sulfate may occur and,
therefore, proper care should be exercised when it is administered to any
patient receiving a drug with a significant tendency to produce dermatitis.
</p>

<p>The methods recommended for early diagnosis of &quot;chloroquine retinopathy&quot;
consist of (1) funduscopic examination of the macula for fine pigmentary
disturbances or loss of the foveal reflex and (2) examination of the central
visual field with a small red test object for pericentral or paracentral
scotoma or determination of retinal thresholds to red. Any unexplained
visual symptoms, such as light flashes or streaks should also be regarded
with suspicion as possible manifestations of retinopathy. </p>

<p>If serious toxic symptoms occur from overdosage or sensitivity, it has
been suggested that ammonium chloride (8 g daily in divided doses for adults)
be administered orally three or four days a week for several months after
therapy has been stopped, as acidification of the urine increases renal
excretion of the 4-aminoquinoline compounds by 20 to 90 percent. However,
caution must be exercised in patients with impaired renal function and/or
metabolic acidosis. </p>

<p><a name="DRUG INTERACTIONS"></a><b>DRUG INTERACTIONS </b></p>

<p>SEE <a href="hquine.htm#PRECAUTIONS">PRECAUTIONS </a></p>

<p><a name="ADVERSE REACTIONS"></a><b>ADVERSE REACTIONS </b></p>

<p>MALARIA </p>

<p>Following the administration in doses adequate for the treatment of
an acute malarial attack, mild and transient headache, dizziness, and gastrointestinal
complaints (diarrhea, anorexia, nausea, abdominal cramps and, on rare occasions,
vomiting) may occur. </p>

<p>LUPUS ERYTHEMATOSUS AND RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS </p>

<p>Not all of the following reactions have been observed with every 4-
aminoquinoline compound during long-term therapy, but they have been reported
with one or more and should be borne in mind when drugs of this class are
administered. Adverse effects with different compounds vary in type and
frequency. </p>

<p>CNS REACTIONS: Irritability, nervousness, emotional changes, nightmares,
psychosis, headache, dizziness, vertigo, tinnitus, nystagmus, nerve deafness,
convulsions, ataxia. </p>

<p>NEUROMUSCULAR REACTIONS: Extraocular muscle palsies, skeletal muscle
weakness, absent or hypoactive deep tendon reflexes. </p>

<p>OCULAR REACTIONS: </p>

<p>A. Ciliary Body: Disturbance of accommodation with symptoms of blurred
vision. This reaction is dose related and reversible with cessation of
therapy. </p>

<p>B. Cornea: Transient edema, punctate to lineal opacities, decreased
corneal sensitivity. The corneal changes, with or without accompanying
symptoms (blurred vision, halos around lights, photophobia), are fairly
common, but reversible. Corneal deposits may appear as early as three weeks
following initiation of therapy. </p>

<p>The incidence of corneal changes and visual side effects appears to
be considerably lower with hydroxychloroquine than with chloroquine. </p>

<p>C. Retina: </p>

<p>MACULA: Edema, atrophy, abnormal pigmentation (mild pigment stippling
to a &quot;bull's-eye&quot; appearance), loss of foveal reflex, increased
macular recovery time following exposure to a bright light (photo-stress
test), elevated retinal threshold to red light in macular, paramacular
and peripheral retinal areas. Other Fundus Changes include optic disc pallor
and atrophy, attenuation of retinal arterioles, fine granular pigmentary
disturbances in the peripheral retina and prominent choroidal patterns
in advanced stage. </p>

<p>D. Visual Field Defects: pericentral or paracentral scotoma, central
scotoma with decreased visual acuity, rarely field constriction. </p>

<p>The most common visual symptoms attributed to the retinopathy are: reading
and seeing difficulties (words, letters, or parts of objects missing),
photophobia, blurred distance vision, missing or blacked out areas in the
central or peripheral visual field, light flashes and streaks. </p>

<p>Retinopathy appears to be dose related and has occurred within several
months (rarely) to several years of daily therapy; a small number of cases
have been reported several years after antimalarial drug therapy was discontinued.
It has not been noted during prolonged use of weekly doses of the 4-aminoquinoline
compounds for suppression of malaria. </p>

<p>Patients with retinal changes may have visual symptoms or may be asymptomatic
(with or without visual field changes). Rarely scotomatous vision or field
defects may occur without obvious retinal change. </p>

<p>Retinopathy may progress even after the drug is discontinued. In a number
of patients, early retinopathy (macular pigmentation sometimes with central
field defects) diminished or regressed completely after therapy was discontinued.
Paracentral scotoma to red targets (sometimes called &quot;premaculopathy&quot;)
is indicative of early retinal dysfunction which is usually reversible
with cessation of therapy. </p>

<p>A small number of cases of retinal changes have been reported as occurring
in patients who received only hydroxychloroquine. These usually consisted
of alteration in retinal pigmentation which was detected on periodic ophthalmologic
examination; visual field defects were also present in some instances.
A case of delayed retinopathy has been reported with loss of vision starting
one year after administration of hydroxychloroquine had been discontinued.
</p>

<p>DERMATOLOGIC REACTIONS: Bleaching of hair, alopecia, pruritus, skin
and mucosal pigmentation, skin eruptions (urticarial, morbilliform, lichenoid,
maculopapular, purpuric, erythema annulare centrifugum and exfoliative
dermatitis). </p>

<p>HEMATOLOGIC REACTIONS: Various blood dyscrasias such as aplastic anemia,
agranulocytosis, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia (hemolysis in individuals
with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-PD) deficiency). </p>

<p>GASTROINTESTINAL REACTIONS: Anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and
abdominal cramps. </p>

<p>MISCELLANEOUS REACTIONS: Weight loss, lassitude, exacerbation or precipitation
of porphyria and nonlight-sensitive psoriasis. </p>

<p>Cardiomyopathy has been rarely reported and the relationship to hydroxychloroquine
is unclear. </p>

<p><a name="OVERDOSAGE"></a><b>OVERDOSAGE </b></p>

<p>The 4-aminoquinoline compounds are very rapidly and completely absorbed
after ingestion, and in accidental overdosage, or rarely with lower doses
in hypersensitive patients, toxic symptoms may occur within 30 minutes.
These consist of headache, drowsiness, visual disturbances, cardiovascular
collapse, and convulsions, followed by sudden and early respiratory and
cardiac arrest. The electrocardiogram may reveal atrial standstill, nodal
rhythm, prolonged intraventricular conduction time, and progressive bradycardia
leading to ventricular fibrillation and/or arrest. Treatment is symptomatic
and must be prompt with immediate evacuation of the stomach by emesis (at
home, before transportation to the hospital) or gastric lavage until the
stomach is completely emptied. If finely powdered, activated charcoal is
introduced by the stomach tube, after lavage, and within 30 minutes after
ingestion of the tablets, it may inhibit further intestinal absorption
of the drug. To be effective, the dose of activated charcoal should be
at least five times the estimated dose of hydroxychloroquine ingested.
Convulsions, if present, should be controlled before attempting gastric
lavage. If due to cerebral stimulation, cautious administration of an ultrashort-acting
barbiturate may be tried but, if due to anoxia, it should be corrected
by oxygen administration, artificial respiration or, in shock with hypotension,
by vasopressor therapy. Because of the importance of supporting respiration,
tracheal intubation or tracheostomy, followed by gastric lavage, may also
be necessary. Exchange transfusions have been used to reduce the level
of 4-aminoquinoline drug in the blood. </p>

<p>A patient who survives the acute phase and is asymptomatic should be
closely observed for at least six hours. Fluids may be forced, and sufficient
ammonium chloride (8 g daily in divided doses for adults) may be administered
for a few days to acidify the urine to help promote urinary excretion in
cases of both overdosage and sensitivity. </p>

<p><a name="DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION"></a><b>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
</b></p>

<p>MALARIA </p>

<p>One tablet of 200 mg of hydroxychloroquine sulfate is equivalent to
155 mg base. MALARIA: Suppression--In Adults, 400 mg (=310 mg base) on
exactly the same day of each week. In Infants And Children, the weekly
suppressive dosage is 5 mg, calculated as base, per kg of body weight,
but should not exceed the adult dose regardless of weight. </p>

<p>If circumstances permit, suppressive therapy should begin two weeks
prior to exposure. However, failing this, in adults an initial double (loading)
dose of 800 mg (= 620 mg base), or in children 10 mg base/kg may be taken
in two divided doses, six hours apart. The suppressive therapy should be
continued for eight weeks after leaving the endemic area. </p>

<p>Treatment of the acute attack--In Adults, an initial dose of 800 mg
(= 620 mg base) followed by 400 mg (= 310 mg base) in six to eight hours
and 400 mg (310 mg base) on each of two consecutive days (total 2 g hydroxychloroquine
sulfate or 1.55 g base). An alternative method, employing a single dose
of 800 mg (= 620 mg base), has also proved effective. </p>

<p>The dosage for adults may also be calculated on the basis of body weight;
this method is preferred for infants and children. A total dose representing
25 mg of base per kg of body weight is administered in three days, as follows:
</p>

<p>First dose: 10 mg base per kg (but not exceeding a single dose of 620
mg base). </p>

<p>Second dose: 5 mg base per kg (but not exceeding a single dose of 310
mg base) 6 hours after first dose. </p>

<p>Third dose: 5 mg base per kg 18 hours after second dose. </p>

<p>Fourth dose: 5 mg base per kg 24 hours after third dose. </p>

<p>For radical cure of Vivax and Malariae malaria concomitant therapy with
an 8- aminoquinoline compound is necessary. </p>

<p>LUPUS ERYTHEMATOSUS AND RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS </p>

<p>One tablet of hydroxychloroquine sulfate, 200 mg, is equivalent to 155
mg base. </p>

<p>LUPUS ERYTHEMATOSUS--Initially, the average Adult dose is 400 mg (=310
mg base) once or twice daily. This may be continued for several weeks or
months, depending on the response of the patient. For prolonged maintenance
therapy, a smaller dose, from 200 mg to 400 mg (=155 mg to 310 mg base)
daily will frequently suffice. </p>

<p>The incidence of retinopathy has been reported to be higher when this
maintenance dose is exceeded. </p>

<p>RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS--The compound is cumulative in action and will
require several weeks to exert its beneficial therapeutic effects, whereas
minor side effects may occur relatively early. Several months of therapy
may be required before maximum effects can be obtained. If objective improvement
(such as reduced joint swelling, increased mobility) does not occur within
six months, the drug should be discontinued. Safe use of the drug in the
treatment of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis has not been established. </p>

<p>Initial Dosage--In ADULTS, from 400 mg to 600 mg (=310 mg to 465 mg
base) daily, each dose to be taken with a meal or a glass of milk. In a
small percentage of patients, troublesome side effects may require temporary
reduction of the initial dosage. Later (usually from five to ten days),
the dose may gradually be increased to the optimum response level, often
without return of side effects. </p>

<p>Maintenance Dosage--When a good response is obtained (usually in four
to twelve weeks), the dosage is reduced by 50 percent and continued at
a usual maintenance level of 200 mg to 400 mg (=155 mg to 310 mg base)
daily, each dose to be taken with a meal or a glass of milk. The incidence
of retinopathy has been reported to be higher when this maintenance dose
is exceeded. </p>

<p>Should a relapse occur after medication is withdrawn, therapy may be
resumed or continued on an intermittent schedule if there are no ocular
contraindications. </p>

<p>CORTICOSTEROIDS AND SALICYLATES may be used in conjunction with this
compound, and they can generally be decreased gradually in dosage or eliminated
after the drug has been used for several weeks. When gradual reduction
of steroid dosage is indicated, it may be done by reducing every four to
five days the dose of cortisone by no more than from 5 mg to 15 mg; of
hydrocortisone from 5 mg to 10 mg; of prednisolone and prednisone from
1 mg to 2.5 mg; of methylprednisolone and triamcinolone from 1 mg to 2
mg; and of dexamethasone from 0.25 mg to 0.5mg. </p>

<p><a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><b>DESCRIPTION </b></p>

<p>Finasteride, a synthetic 4-azasteroid compound, is a specific inhibitor
of steroid 5alpha-reductase, an intracellular enzyme that converts testosterone
into the potent androgen 5alpha-dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Finasteride
is 4-azaandrost-1-ene-17-carboxamide, N-(1,1-dimethylethyl)-3-oxo-, (5alpha,
17beta)-. The empirical formula of finasteride is C23H36N2O2 and its molecular
weight is 372.55. Finasteride is a white crystalline powder with a melting
point near 250 degC. It is freely soluble in chloroform and in lower alcohol
solvents, but is practically insoluble in water. </p>

<p><a name="ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY"></a><b>ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
</b></p>

<p>Progressive enlargement of the prostate gland is often associated with
urinary symptoms and a decrease in urine flow, although a precise correlation
between increased gland size and symptoms has not been demonstrated. Benign
prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) produces symptoms in the majority of men over
the age of 50 and its prevalence increases with age. </p>

<p>The development of the prostate gland is dependent on the potent androgen,
5alpha- dihydrotestosterone (DHT). The enzyme 5alpha- reductase metabolizes
testosterone to DHT in the prostate gland, liver and skin. DHT induces
androgenic effects by binding to androgen receptors in the cell nuclei
of these organs. </p>

<p>Finasteride is a competitive and specific inhibitor of 5alpha-reductase
with which it slowly forms a stable enzyme complex. Turnover from this
complex is extremely slow (t1/2 approximately 30 days). This has been demonstrated
both In Vivo and In Vitro. Finasteride has no affinity for the androgen
receptor. In man, the 5alpha-reduced steroid metabolites in blood and urine
are decreased after administration of finasteride. </p>

<p>In man, a single 5-mg oral dose of Finasteride produces a rapid reduction
in serum DHT concentration, with the maximum effect observed 8 hours after
the first dose. The suppression of DHT is maintained throughout the 24-hour
dosing interval and with continued treatment. Daily dosing of Finasteride
at 5 mg/day for up to 24 months has been shown to reduce the serum DHT
concentration by approximately 70%. The median circulating level of testosterone
increased by 10% but remained within the physiologic range. </p>

<p>Adult males with genetically inherited 5alpha- reductase deficiency
also have decreased levels of DHT. Except for the associated urogenital
defects present at birth, no other clinical abnormalities related to 5alpha-reductase
deficiency have been observed in these individuals. These individuals have
a small prostate gland throughout life and do not develop BPH. </p>

<p>In patients with BPH treated with finasteride (1-100 mg/day) for 7-10
days prior to prostatectomy, an approximate 80% lower DHT content was measured
in prostatic tissue removed at surgery, compared to placebo; testosterone
tissue concentration was increased up to 10 times over pretreatment levels,
relative to placebo. Intraprostatic content of prostate-specific antigen
(PSA) was also decreased. </p>

<p>In healthy male volunteers treated with Finasteride for 14 days, discontinuation
of therapy resulted in a return of DHT levels to pretreatment levels in
approximately 2 weeks. In patients treated for three months, prostate volume
returned to close to baseline value after approximately three months of
discontinuation of therapy. </p>

<p>In patients with BPH, Finasteride had no effect on circulating levels
of cortisol, estradiol, prolactin, thyroid-stimulating hormone, or thyroxine.
Nor did it affect the plasma lipid profile (i.e. total cholesterol, low
density lipoproteins, high density lipoproteins and triglycerides) of 56
patients receiving Finasteride for 12 weeks. The effects of long-term administration
of Finasteride on the plasma lipid profile are unknown. Increases of about
10% were observed in luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle- stimulating hormone
(FSH) and testosterone levels in patients receiving Finasteride, but levels
remained within the normal range. In healthy volunteers, treatment with
Finasteride did not alter the response of LH and FSH to gonadotropin- releasing
hormone, indicating that the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis was
not affected. Treatment with Finasteride for 12 weeks to evaluate semen
parameters in healthy male volunteers revealed no effects on total sperm
per ejaculate, sperm motility or morphology. A 0.5 mL median decrease on
ejaculate volume was observed and was reversible upon discontinuation of
drug. </p>

<p>Pharmacokinetics </p>

<p>Following an oral dose of 14C-finasteride in man, a mean of 39% (range,
32-46%) of the dose was excreted in the urine in the form of metabolites;
57% (range, 51-64%) was excreted in the feces. The major compound isolated
from urine was the monocarboxylic acid metabolite; virtually no unchanged
drug was recovered. The t-butyl side chain monohydroxylated metabolite
has been isolated from plasma. These metabolites possess no more than 20%
of the 5alpha-reductase inhibitory activity of finasteride. </p>

<p>In a study in 15 healthy male subjects, the mean bioavailability of
a 5-mg Finasteride tablet was 63% (range, 34-108%), based on the ratio
of AUC relative to a 5-mg intravenous dose infused over 60 minutes. Maximum
finasteride plasma concentration averaged 37 ng/mL (range, 27-49 ng/mL)
and was reached 1 to 2 hours postdose. The mean plasma half-life of elimination
was 6 hours (range, 3- 16 hours). Following the intravenous infusion, mean
plasma clearance was 165 mL/min (range, 70-279 mL/min) and mean steady-state
volume of distribution was 76 liters (range, 44-96 liters). In a separate
study, the bioavailability of finasteride was not affected by food. </p>

<p>Approximately 90% of circulating finasteride is bound to plasma proteins.
</p>

<p>Finasteride has been found to cross the blood-brain barrier. </p>

<p>There is a slow accumulation phase for finasteride after multiple dosing.
After dosing with 5 mg/day of finasteride for 17 days, plasma concentrations
of finasteride were 47% and 54% higher than after the first dose in men
45-60 years old (n=12) and &gt;/=70 years old (n=12), respectively. Mean
trough concentrations after 17 days of dosing were 6.2 ng/mL (range, 2.4-9.8
ng/mL) and 8.1 ng/mL (range, 1.8-19.7 ng/mL), respectively in the two age
groups. Although steady state was not reached in this study, mean trough
plasma concentration in another study in patients with BPH (mean age, 65
years) receiving 5 mg/day was 9.4 ng/mL (range, 7.1-13.3 ng/mL; n=22) after
over a year of dosing. </p>

<p>The elimination rate of finasteride is decreased in the elderly, but
no dosage adjustment is necessary. The mean terminal half-life of finasteride
in subjects &gt;/=70 years of age was approximately 8 hours (range, 6-15
hours) compared to 6 hours (range, 4-12 hours) in subjects 45-60 years
of age. As a result, mean AUC (0-24 hr) after 17 days of dosing was 15%
higher in subjects &gt;/=70 years of age (p=0.02). </p>

<p>No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with renal insufficiency.
In patients with chronic renal impairment, with creatinine clearances ranging
from 9.0 to 55 mL/min, area under the curve, maximum plasma concentration,
half-life, and protein binding after a single dose of 14C-finasteride were
similar to values obtained in healthy volunteers. Urinary excretion of
metabolites was decreased in patients with renal impairment. This decrease
was associated with an increase in fecal excretion of metabolites. Plasma
concentrations of metabolites were significantly higher in patients with
renal impairment (based on a 60% increase in total radioactivity AUC).
However, finasteride has been well tolerated in BPH patients with normal
renal function receiving up to 80 mg/day for 12 weeks where exposure of
these patients to metabolites would presumably be much greater. </p>

<p>In 16 subjects receiving Finasteride 5 mg/day, finasteride concentrations
in semen ranged from undetectable (&lt;1 ng/mL) to 21 ng/mL. Based on a
5mL ejaculate volume, the amount of finasteride in ejaculate was estimated
to be less than 1/50 of the dose of finasteride (5 micrograms) that had
no effect on circulating DHT levels in adults. </p>

<p>CLINICAL STUDIES </p>

<p>Patients with BPH were treated with either Finasteride 5 mg/day or placebo
in North American and international multicenter, double-blind, 12-month
studies and their 24-month open extensions for a total of 36 months. Of
543 patients originally randomized to receive Finasteride 5 mg/day, 297
completed 36 months and were available for analysis. The efficacy parameters
were regression of the enlarged prostate, improvement in maximum urinary
flow rate, and improvement in total and obstructive symptoms as measured
by a decrease in symptom scores. </p>

<p>By week 2, a reduction of serum DHT was noted and was accompanied by
regression of the enlarged prostate at the first evaluation at 3 months.
These reductions were statistically significant when compared to both baseline
and placebo and were maintained through month 36. </p>

<p>In both studies the groups treated with Finasteride demonstrated statistically
significant improvement compared to baseline in maximum urinary flow rate
(Table 1) and total symptom score within 2 weeks, which was maintained
in uncontrolled studies through month 36. Moreover, when compared to placebo,
statistically significant increases in maximum urinary flow rates were
observed in both studies. In the North American study, these were observed
by month 4 and maintained through month 12, and in the international study
were observed at months 7, 8, 11, and 12. (See Table 1.) Most patients
treated with Finasteride experienced at least a 10% increase in urinary
flow rate. (See INDICATIONS AND USAGE.) </p>

<p>Obstructive and total symptom scores were calculated based on patient
responses to a validated questionnaire. The obstructive symptoms evaluated
were hesitancy, feeling of imcomplete bladder emptying, interruption of
urinary stream, impairment of size and force of urinary stream and terminal
urinary dribbling. The total symptom score also included straining to start
urinary flow, dysuria, frequency of clothes wetting and urgency to urinate.
The scale used to evaluate symptoms ranged from 0 (absence of all symptoms)
to 36 (worst response for all symptoms). </p>

<p>The mean total symptom scores of patients in the North American and
international studies decreased from baseline starting at week 2 of treatment
with either Finasteride or placebo. Statistical significance compared to
placebo (p&lt;0.05) was reached starting at month 7 in the international
study and at month 10 in the North American study. Similar results were
observed with the obstructive symptom scores. Most patients treated with
Finasteride experienced at least a 30% improvement in symptoms. (See INDICATIONS
AND USAGE.) </p>

<p>Blinded global assessments of overall urinary function and symptoms
were performed. Greater improvement in patients treated with Finasteride
as compared to placebo was demonstrated by both the investigator's assessment
(N.Am. and Int'l, p&lt; or = 0.01) and the patient's own assessment (N.Am.,
p&lt; or = 0.01; Int'l, p&lt; or = 0.1). In both of these 12-month studies,
patients treated with Finasteride 5 mg had progressively decreasing prostate
volumes, increasing maximum urinary flow rates and improvement of symptoms
associated with BPH, suggesting an arrest in the disease process. These
improvements were maintained through the long-term open extensions for
up to 36 months. </p>

<p>In addition, regression of the enlarged prostate gland and a decrease
in PSA levels were maintained in approximately 50 patients who were treated
with Finasteride for 48 months. (REF 1)</p>

<p> Additional Clinical Trials </p>

<p>Urodynamic effects of finasteride in the treatment of bladder outlet
obstruction due to BPH were assessed by invasive techniques in a 24-week,
double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 36 patients with moderate to
severe symptoms of urinary obstruction and a maximum flow rate of less
than 15 cc/sec. Relief of obstruction, as evidenced by significant improvement
in detrusor pressure and increased mean flow rate, was demonstrated in
patients treated with 5 mg Finasteride compared to placebo. (REF. 2) </p>

<p>The effect of finasteride on the volume of the peripheral and periurethral
zones of the prostate in 20 men with BPH was evaluated by magnetic resonance
imaging in a one-year, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Patients
treated with Finasteride, but not those treated with placebo, experienced
a significant decrease (11.5 +/- 3.2 cc (SE)) in total gland size, largely
accounted for by a reduction (6.2 +/- 3 cc) in the size of the periurethral
zone. </p>

<p><a name="INDICATIONS AND USAGE"></a><b>INDICATIONS AND USAGE </b></p>

<p>Finasteride is indicated for the treatment of symptomatic benign prostatic
hyperplasia (BPH). There is a rapid regression of the enlarged prostate
gland in most treated patients. Approximately 60% of patients experience
an increase in urinary flow (of greater than 10%) and improvement in symptoms
of BPH (of greater than 30%) when treated with Finasteride. (See ACTIONS/CLINICAL
PHARMACOLOGY.) </p>

<p>The long-term effects of Finasteride on the incidence of surgery, acute
urinary obstruction or other complications of BPH are yet to be determined.
Although some patients may respond sooner, a minimum of 6 months treatment
may be necessary to determine whether an individual will respond to Finasteride.
It is not possible to identify prospectively those patients who will respond.
Prior to initiating therapy with Finasteride, appropriate evaluation should
be performed to identify other conditions, such as infection, prostate
cancer, stricture disease, hypotonic bladder or other neurogenic disorders,
that might mimic BPH. </p>

<p><a name="CONTRAINDICATIONS"></a><b>CONTRAINDICATIONS </b></p>

<p>Finasteride is contraindicated in the following: </p>

<p>Hypersensitivity to any component of this medication. </p>

<p>Pregnancy. Finasteride is contraindicated in women who are or may become
pregnant. Because of the ability of 5alpha-reductase inhibitors to inhibit
the conversion of testosterone to DHT, finasteride may cause abnormalities
of the external genitalia of a male fetus of a pregnant woman who receives
finasteride. </p>

<p>If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if pregnancy occurs while
taking this drug, the pregnant woman should be apprised of the potential
hazard to the male fetus. (See also WARNINGS, Exposure Of Women- -Risk
To Male Fetus and PRECAUTIONS, Information For Patients and Pregnancy.)
In female rats, low doses of finasteride administered during pregnancy
have produced abnormalities of the external genitalia in male offspring.
</p>

<p><a name="WARNINGS"></a><b>WARNINGS </b></p>

<p>Finasteride is not indicated for use in children (see PRECAUTIONS, Pediatric
Use) or women (see also ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacokinetics;
WARNINGS, Exposure Of Women--Risk To Male Fetus; PRECAUTIONS, Information
For Patients and Pregnancy). </p>

<p>Exposure Of Women--Risk To Male Fetus </p>

<p>It is not known whether the amount of finasteride that could potentially
be absorbed by a pregnant woman through either direct contact with crushed
Finasteride tablets or from the semen of a patient taking Finasteride can
adversely affect a developing male fetus (see ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY,
Pharmacokinetics; CONTRAINDICATIONS; PRECAUTIONS, Information For Patients
and Pregnancy; and HOW SUPPLIED). Therefore, because of the potential risk
to a male fetus, a woman who is pregnant or who may become pregnant should
not handle crushed Finasteride tablets; in addition, when the patient's
sexual partner is or may become pregnant, the patient should either avoid
exposure of his partner to semen or he should discontinue Finasteride.
</p>

<p><a name="PRECAUTIONS"></a><b>PRECAUTIONS </b></p>

<p>General </p>

<p>Digital rectal examinations, as well as other evaluations for prostate
cancer, should be performed on patients with BPH prior to initiating therapy
with Finasteride and periodically thereafter. Although currently not indicated
for this purpose, serum PSA is being increasingly used as one of the components
of the screening process to detect prostate cancer. (REF. 3) </p>

<p>(REF. 3) Catalona, W.J.; Smith, D.S.; Ratliff, T.I.; Dodds, K.M.; Coplen,
M.D.; Yuan, J.J.J.; Petros, J.A.; Andriole, G.L.: Measurement of prostate-specific
antigen in serum as a screening test for prostate cancer, N.Eng.J.Med.
324(17): 1156-1161, April 25, 1991. </p>

<p>Generally, a baseline PSA &gt;10 ng/mL (Hybritech) prompts further evaluation
and consideration of biopsy; for PSA levels between 4 and 10 ng/mL, further
evaluation is generally considered advisable. The physician should be aware
that a baseline PSA &lt;4 ng/mL does not exclude the diagnosis of prostate
cancer. </p>

<p>Finasteride causes a decrease in serum PSA levels in patients with BPH
even in the presence of prostate cancer (see Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions).
This reduction of PSA levels should be considered when evaluating PSA laboratory
data and does not suggest a beneficial effect of Finasteride on prostate
cancer. In controlled clinical trials Finasteride did not appear to alter
the rate of prostate cancer detection. </p>

<p>Any sustained increases in PSA levels while on Finasteride should be
carefully evaluated, including consideration of non-compliance to therapy
with Finasteride (see Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions). </p>

<p>Since not all patients demonstrate a response to Finasteride, patients
with a large residual urinary volume and/or severely diminished urinary
flow should be carefully monitored for obstructive uropathy. These patients
may not be candidates for this therapy. </p>

<p>Caution should be used in the administration of Finasteride in those
patients with liver function abnormalities, as finasteride is metabolized
extensively in the liver. </p>

<p>Information For Patients </p>

<p>Crushed Finasteride tablets should not be handled by a woman who is
pregnant or who may become pregnant because of the potential for absorption
of finasteride and the subsequent potential risk to the male fetus. Similarly,
when the patient's sexual partner is or may become pregnant, the patient
should either avoid exposure of his partner to semen or he should discontinue
Finasteride (see ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacokinetics; CONTRAINDICATIONS;
WARNINGS, </p>

<p>Exposure Of Women--Risk To Male Fetus; PRECAUTIONS, Pregnancy; and HOW
SUPPLIED). </p>

<p>Physicians should inform patients that the volume of ejaculate may be
decreased in some patients during treatment with Finasteride. This decrease
does not appear to interfere with normal sexual function. However, impotence
and decreased libido may occur in patients treated with Finasteride (see
ADVERSE REACTIONS, Twelve-Month Controlled Clinical Trials). </p>

<p>Physicians should instruct their patients to read the patient package
insert before starting therapy with Finasteride and to reread it each time
the prescription is renewed so that they are aware of current information
for patients regarding Finasteride. </p>

<p>Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions </p>

<p>Serum PSA concentration is correlated with patient age and prostatic
volume, and prostatic volume is correlated with patient age. (REF. 4) When
PSA laboratory determinations are evaluated, consideration should be given
to the fact that PSA levels generally decrease in patients treated with
Finasteride (see PRECAUTIONS, General). In most patients, a rapid decrease
in PSA is seen within the first months of therapy, after which time PSA
levels stabilize to a new baseline. The post- treatment baseline approximates
half of the pre- treatment value. This decrease is predictable over the
entire range of PSA values, although it may vary in individual patients.
Therefore, in typical patients treated with Finasteride for six months
or more, PSA values should be doubled for comparison to normal ranges in
untreated men. There is considerable overlap in PSA levels among men with
and without prostate cancer. Therefore, in men with BPH, PSA values within
the normal reference range do not rule out prostate cancer, regardless
of finasteride treatment. (REF. 5,6) </p>

<p>Based on a comparison of PSA levels between men diagnosed with prostate
cancer while taking Finasteride (n=10) and men not diagnosed with prostate
cancer while taking Finasteride, any ability of PSA to distinguish between
BPH and cancer was not adversely affected by treatment with Finasteride.

<p>Drug Interactions </p>

<p>Antipyrine: Antipyrine is used as a model for drugs that are metabolized
by the same isoenzymatic cytochrome P450 system. In 12 subjects receiving
Finasteride 10 mg/day for 28 days, Finasteride had no effect on the pharmacokinetic
parameters of antipyrine or its metabolites. </p>

<p>Propranolol: In 19 normal volunteers receiving Finasteride 5 mg/day
for 10 days, Finasteride did not affect the beta-adrenergic blocking activity
or plasma concentrations of propranolol enantiomers after a single dose
of propranolol. Digoxin: In 17 normal volunteers receiving Finasteride
5 mg/day for 10 days, concomitant administration of multiple doses of Finasteride
and a single dose of digoxin resulted in no effect on plasma concentrations
of digoxin and its immunoreactive metabolites. </p>

<p>Theophylline: In 12 normal volunteers receiving Finasteride 5 mg/day
for 8 days, Finasteride significantly increased theophylline clearance
by 7% and decreased its half-life by 10% after intravenous administration
of aminophylline. These changes were not clinically significant. </p>

<p>Warfarin: In 12 patients chronically treated with warfarin, the prothrombin
times and plasma concentrations of warfarin enantiomers were not altered
after treatment with Finasteride 5 mg/day for 14 days. </p>

<p>Other Concomitant Therapy: Although specific interaction studies were
not performed, Finasteride was concomitantly used in clinical studies with
alpha- blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, analgesics,
anti- convulsants, beta-adrenergic blocking agents, diuretics, calcium
channel blockers, cardiac nitrates, HMG- CoA reductase inhibitors, nonsteroidal
anti- inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), benzodiazepines, H2 antagonists and
quinolone antiinfectives without evidence of clinically significant adverse
interactions. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment Of Fertility </p>

<p>No evidence of a tumorigenic effect was observed in a 24-month study
in Sprague- Dawley rats receiving doses of finasteride up to 160 mg/kg/day
in males and 320 mg/kg/day in females. These doses produced respective
systemic exposure in rats of 111 and 274 times those observed in man receiving
the recommended human dose of 5 mg/day. All exposure calculations were
based on calculated AUC(0-24hr) for animals and mean AUC(0-24hr) for man
(0.4 mcgm.hr/mL). </p>

<p>In a 19-month carcinogenicity study in CD-1 mice, a statistically significant
(p &lt; or = 0.05) increase in the incidence of testicular Leydig cell
adenomas was observed at a dose of 250 mg/kg/day (228 times the human exposure).
In mice at a dose of 25 mg/kg/day (23 times the human exposure, estimated)
and in rats at a dose of &gt;/=40 mg/kg/day (39 times the human exposure)
an increase in the incidence of Leydig cell hyperplasia was observed. A
positive correlation between the proliferative changes in the Leydig cells
and an increase in serum LH levels (2-3 fold above control) has been demonstrated
in both rodent species treated with high doses of finasteride. No drug-related
Leydig cell changes were seen in either rats or dogs treated with finasteride
for 1 year at doses of 20 mg/kg/day and 45 mg/kg/day (30 and 350 times,
respectively, the human exposure) or in mice treated for 19 months at a
dose of 2.5 mg/kg/day (2.3 times the human exposure, estimated). </p>

<p>No evidence of mutagenicity was observed in an In Vitro bacterial mutagenesis
assay, a mammalian cell mutagenesis assay, or in an In Vitro alkaline elution
assay. In an In Vitro chromosome aberration assay, when Chinese hamster
ovary cells were treated with high concentrations (450-550 micromol) of
finasteride, there was a slight increase in chromosome aberrations. These
concentrations correspond to 4000-5000 times the peak plasma levels in
man given a total dose of 5mg. Further, the concentrations (450-550 micromol)
used in In Vitro studies are not achievable in a biological system. In
an In Vivo chromosome aberration assay in mice, no treatment-related increase
in chromosome aberration was observed with finasteride at the maximum tolerated
dose of 250 mg/kg/day (228 times the human exposure) as determined in the
carcinogenicity studies. In sexually mature male rabbits treated with finasteride
at 80 mg/kg/day (543 times the human exposure) for up to 12 weeks, no effect
on fertility, sperm count, or ejaculate volume was seen. In sexually mature
male rats treated with 80 mg/kg/day of finasteride (61 times the human
exposure), there were no significant effects on fertility after 6 or 12
weeks of treatment; however, when treatment was continued for up to 24
or 30 weeks, there was an apparent decrease in fertility, fecundity and
an associated significant decrease in the weights of the seminal vesicles
and prostate. All these effects were reversible within 6 weeks of discontinuation
of treatment. No drug-related effect on testes or on mating performance
has been seen in rats or rabbits. This decrease in fertility in finasteride-treated
rats is secondary to its effect on accessory sex organs (prostate and seminal
vesicles) resulting in failure to form a seminal plug. The seminal plug
is essential for normal fertility in rats and is not relevant in man. </p>

<p>Finasteride is not indicated for use in women. </p>

<p>Administration of finasteride to pregnant rats at doses ranging from
100 mcgm/kg/day to 100 mg/kg/day (1-1000 times the recommended human dose)
resulted in dose-dependent development of hypospadias in 3.6 to 100% of
male offspring. Pregnant rats produced male offspring with decreased prostatic
and seminal vesicular weights, delayed preputial separation and transient
nipple development when given finasteride at &gt;/=30 mcgm/kg/day (&gt;/=3/10
of the recommended human dose) and decreased anogenital distance when given
finasteride at &gt;/=3 mcgm/kg/day (&gt;/=3/100 of the recommended human
dose). The critical period during which these effects can be induced in
male rats has been defined to be days 16- 17 of gestation. The changes
described above are expected pharmacological effects of drugs belonging
to the class of 5alpha-reductase inhibitors and are similar to those reported
in male infants with a genetic deficiency of 5alpha- reductase. No abnormalities
were observed in female offspring exposed to any dose of finasteride In
Utero. </p>

<p>No developmental abnormalities have been observed in first filial generation
(F1) male or female offspring resulting from mating finasteride- treated
male rats (80 mg/kg/day; 61 times the human exposure) with untreated females.
Administration of finasteride at 3 mg/kg/day (30 times the recommended
human dose) during the late gestation and lactation period resulted in
slightly decreased fertility in F1 male offspring. No effects were seen
in female offspring. No evidence of malformations has been observed in
rabbit fetuses exposed to finasteride In Utero from days 6-18 of gestation
at doses up to 100 mg/kg/day (1000 times the recommended human dose). However,
effects on male genitalia would not be expected since the rabbits were
not exposed during the critical period of genital system development. </p>

<p><a name="ADVERSE REACTIONS"></a><b>ADVERSE REACTIONS </b></p>

<p>Finasteride is generally well tolerated; adverse reactions usually have
been mild and transient. </p>

<p>Twelve-Month Controlled Clinical Trials </p>

<p>In North American and international clinical trials, 543 patients were
treated with 5 mg of Finasteride for 12 months. Seven of these patients
(1.3%) were discontinued due to adverse experiences that were considered
to be possibly, probably or definitely drug-related; only 1 of these patients
(0.2%) discontinued therapy with Finasteride because of a sexual adverse
experience. </p>

<p>The following clinical adverse reactions were reported as possibly,
probably or definitely drug-related in &gt;/=1% of patients treated for
12 months with 5 mg/day of Finasteride or placebo, respectively: impotence
(3.7%, 1.1%), decreased libido (3.3%, 1.6%), decreased volume of ejaculate
(2.8%, 0.9%). </p>

<p>The adverse experience profile for an additional 547 patients treated
with 1 mg/day of Finasteride for 12 months was similar to that observed
in patients treated for 12 months with 5 mg/day of Finasteride. </p>

<p>Long-Term Open Extensions </p>

<p>The adverse experience profile for approximately 1100 patients who were
maintained on Finasteride 5 mg/day for 24 months and 400 patients treated
for 36 months was similar to that observed in the controlled studies. In
addition, a similar safety profile was observed in 50 patients treated
with Finasteride 5 mg/day for 48 months. There is no evidence of increased
adverse experiences with increased duration of treatment with Finasteride.
The annual incidence of drug related sexual adverse experiences decreased
with duration of treatment. Sexual adverse experiences resolved with continued
treatment in over 60% of patients who reported them. </p>

<p>The Following Additional Adverse Effects Have Been Reported In Post-Marketing

for an overdose with Finasteride can be recommended. </p>

<p>Significant lethality was observed in male and female mice at single
oral doses of 1500 mg/M(squared) (500 mg/kg) and in female and male rats

<p><a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><b>DESCRIPTION </b></p>

<p>Bisoprolol &amp; hydrochlorothiazide is indicated for the treatment
of hypertension. It combines two antihypertensive agents in a once- daily
dosage: a synthetic beta1-selective (cardioselective) adrenoceptor blocking
agent (bisoprolol fumarate) and a benzothiadiazine diuretic (hydrochlorothiazide).
</p>

<p>Bisoprolol fumarate is chemically described as (+/- )-1-(4-((2-(1- methylethoxy)ethoxy)methyl)phenoxy)
-3-((1-methylethyl) amino)-2-propanol(E)-2- butenedioate (2:1) (salt).
It possesses an asymmetric carbon atom in its structure and is provided
as a racemic mixture. The S(-) enantiomer is responsible for most of the
beta-blocking activity. Its empirical formula is (C18H31NO4)2.C4H4O4 and
it has a molecular weight of 766.97. Bisoprolol fumarate is a white crystalline
powder, approximately equally hydrophilic and lipophilic, and readily soluble
in water, methanol, ethanol, and chloroform. </p>

<p>Hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) is 6-Chloro- 3,4-dihydro-2H-1,2,4-benzothiadiazine-
7-sulfonamide 1,1-dioxide. It is a white, or practically white, practically
odorless crystalline powder. It is slightly soluble in water, sparingly
soluble in dilute sodium hydroxide solution, freely soluble in n- butylamine
and dimethylformamide, soluble in methanol, and insoluble in ether, chloroform,
and dilute mineral acids. Its empirical formula is C7H8ClN3O4S2 and it
has a molecular weight of 297.73. </p>

<p><a name="ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY"></a><b>ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
</b></p>

<p>Bisoprolol fumarate and HCTZ have been used individually and in combination
for the treatment of hypertension. The antihypertensive effects of these
agents are additive; HCTZ 6.25 mg significantly increases the antihypertensive
effect of bisoprolol fumarate. The incidence of hypokalemia with the bisoprolol
fumarate and HCTZ 6.25 mg combination (B/H) is significantly lower than
with HCTZ 25 mg. In clinical trials of Bisoprolol &amp; hydrochlorothiazide
, mean changes in serum potassium for patients treated with Bisoprolol
&amp; hydrochlorothiazide 2.5/6.25 mg, 5/6.25 mg or 10/6.25 mg or placebo
were less than +/- 0.1 mEq/L. Mean changes in serum potassium for patients
treated with any dose of bisoprolol in combination with HCTZ 25 mg ranged
from -0.1 to -0.3 mEq/L. </p>

<p>Bisoprolol fumarate is a beta1-selective (cardioselective) adrenoceptor
blocking agent without significant membrane stabilizing or intrinsic sympathomimetic
activities in its therapeutic dose range. At higher doses (&gt;/= 20 mg)
bisoprolol fumarate also inhibits beta2-adrenoreceptors located in bronchial
and vascular musculature. To retain relative selectivity, it is important
to use the lowest effective dose. </p>

<p>Hydrochlorothiazide is a benzothiadiazine diuretic. Thiazides affect
renal tubular mechanisms of electrolyte reabsorption and increase excretion
of sodium and chloride in approximately equivalent amounts. Natriuresis
causes a secondary loss of potassium. </p>

<p>PHARMACOKINETICS AND METABOLISM </p>

<p>Bisoprolol &amp; hydrochlorothiazide </p>

<p>In healthy volunteers, both bisoprolol fumarate and hydrochlorothiazide
are well absorbed following oral administration of Bisoprolol &amp; hydrochlorothiazide.
No change is observed in the bioavailability of either agent when given
together in a single tablet. Absorption is not affected whether Bisoprolol
&amp; hydrochlorothiazide is taken with or without food. Mean peak bisoprolol
fumarate plasma concentrations of about 9.0 ng/mL, 19 ng/mL and 36 ng/mL
occur approximately 3 hours after the administration of the 2.5 mg/6.25
mg, 5 mg/6.25 mg and 10 mg/6.25 mg combination tablets, respectively. Mean
peak plasma hydrochlorothiazide concentrations of 30 ng/mL occur approximately
2.5 hours following the administration of the combination. Dose proportional
increases in plasma bisoprolol concentrations are observed between the
2.5 and 5, as well as between the 5 and 10 mg doses. The elimination of
T1/2 of bisoprolol ranges from 7 to 15 hours and of hydrochlorothiazide
ranges from 4 to 10 hours. The percent of dose excreted unchanged in urine
is about 55% for bisoprolol and about 60% for hydrochlorothiazide. </p>

<p>Bisoprolol Fumarate </p>

<p>The absolute bioavailability after a 10 mg oral dose of bisoprolol fumarate
is about 80%. The first pass metabolism of bisoprolol fumarate is about
20%. The pharmacokinetic profile of bisoprolol fumarate has been examined
following single doses and at steady state. Binding to serum proteins is
approximately 30%. Peak plasma concentrations occur within 2-4 hours of
dosing with 2.5 to 20 mg, and mean peak values range from 9.0 ng/mL at
2.5 mg to 70 ng/mL at 20 mg. Once-daily dosing with bisoprolol fumarate
results in less than twofold intersubject variation in peak plasma concentrations.
Plasma concentrations are proportional to the administered dose in the
range of 2.5 to 20 mg. The plasma elimination half-life is 9-12 hours and
is slightly longer in elderly patients, in part because of decreased renal
function. Steady state is attained within 5 days with once-daily dosing.
In both young and elderly populations, plasma accumulation is low; the
accumulation factor ranges from 1.1 to 1.3, and is what would be expected
from the half-life and once-daily dosing. Bisoprolol is eliminated equally
by renal and nonrenal pathways with about 50% of the dose appearing unchanged
in the urine and the remainder in the form of inactive metabolites. In
humans, the known metabolites are labile or have no known pharmacologic
activity. Less than 2% of the dose is excreted in the feces. The pharmacokinetic
characteristics of the two enantiomers are similar. Bisoprolol is not metabolized
by cytochrome P450 II D6 (debrisoquin hydroxylase). In subjects with creatinine
clearance less than 40 mL/min, the plasma half-life is increased approximately
threefold compared to healthy subjects. In patients with liver cirrhosis,
the rate of elimination of bisoprolol is more variable and significantly
slower than that in healthy subjects, with a plasma half-life ranging from
8 to 22 hours. </p>

<p>In elderly subjects, mean plasma concentrations at steady state are
increased, in part attributed to lower creatinine clearance. However, no
significant differences in the degree of bisoprolol accumulation is found
between young and elderly populations. </p>

<p>Hydrochlorothiazide </p>

<p>Hydrochlorothiazide is well absorbed (65%-75%) following oral administration.
Absorption of hydrochlorothiazide is reduced in patients with congestive
heart failure. </p>

<p>Peak plasma concentrations are observed within 1-5 hours of dosing,
and range from 70-490 ng/mL following oral doses of 12.5-100 mg. Plasma
concentrations are linearly related to the administered dose. Concentrations
of hydrochlorothiazide are 1.6-1.8 times higher in whole blood than in
plasma. Binding to serum proteins has been reported to be approximately
40%-68%. The plasma elimination half-life has been reported to be 6-15
hours. Hydrochlorothiazide is eliminated primarily by renal pathways. Following
oral doses of 12.5-100 mg, 55%-77% of the administered dose appears in
urine and greater than 95% of the absorbed dose is excreted in urine as
unchanged drug. Plasma concentrations of hydrochlorothiazide are increased
and the elimination half-life is prolonged in patients with renal disease.

<p>Findings in clinical hemodynamics studies with bisoprolol fumarate are
similar to those observed with other beta-blockers. The most prominent
effect is the negative chronotropic effect, giving a reduction in resting
and exercise heart rate. There is a fall in resting and exercise cardiac
output with little observed change in stroke volume, and only a small increase
in right atrial pressure, or pulmonary capillary wedge pressure at rest
or during exercise. In normal volunteers, bisoprolol fumarate therapy resulted
in a reduction of exercise- and isoproterenol-induced tachycardia. The
maximal effect occurred within 1-4 hours post-dosing. Effects generally
persisted for 24 hours at doses of 5 mg or greater. </p>

<p>In controlled clinical trials, bisoprolol fumarate given as a single
daily dose has been shown to be an effective antihypertensive agent when
used alone or concomitantly with thiazide diuretics (see CLINICAL STUDIES).
</p>

<p>The mechanism of bisoprolol fumarate's antihypertensive effect has not
been completely established. Factors that may be involved include: </p>

<p>1) Decreased cardiac output </p>

<p>2) Inhibition of renin release by the kidneys </p>

<p>3) Diminution of tonic sympathetic outflow from vasomotor centers in
the brain Beta1-selectivity of bisoprolol fumarate has been demonstrated
in both animal and human studies. No effects at therapeutic doses on beta2-adrenoreceptor
density have been observed. Pulmonary function studies have been conducted
in healthy volunteers, asthmatics, and patients with chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (COPD). Doses of bisoprolol fumarate ranged from 5 to
60 mg, atenolol from 50 to 200 mg, metoprolol from 100 to 200 mg, and propranolol
from 40 to 80mg. In some studies, slight, asymptomatic increases in airway
resistance (AWR) and decreases in forced expiratory volume (FEV1) were
observed with doses of bisoprolol fumarate 20 mg and higher, similar to
the small increases in AWR noted with other cardioselective beta-blocking
agents. The changes induced by beta-blockade with all agents were reversed
by bronchodilator therapy. Electrophysiology studies in man have demonstrated
that bisoprolol fumarate significantly decreases heart rate, increases
sinus node recovery time, prolongs AV node refractory periods, and, with
rapid atrial stimulation, prolongs AV nodal conduction. </p>

<p>Hydrochlorothiazide </p>

<p>Acute effects of thiazides are thought to result from a reduction in
blood volume and cardiac output, secondary to a natriuretic effect, although
a direct vasodilatory mechanism has also been proposed. With chronic administration,
plasma volume returns toward normal, but peripheral vascular resistance
is decreased. </p>

<p>Thiazides do not affect normal blood pressure. Onset of action occurs
within 2 hours of dosing, peak effect is observed at about 4 hours, and
activity persists for up to 24 hours. </p>

<p>CLINICAL STUDIES: </p>

<p>In controlled clinical trials, bisoprolol fumarate/hydrochlorothiazide
6.25 mg has been shown to reduce systolic and diastolic blood pressure
throughout a 24- hour period when administered once daily. The effects
on systolic and diastolic blood pressure reduction of the combination of
bisoprolol fumarate and hydrochlorothiazide were additive. Further, treatment
effects were consistent across age groups (&lt;60, &gt;/=60 years), racial
groups (black, nonblack), and gender (male, female). </p>

<p>In two randomized, double-blind, placebo- controlled trials conducted
in the U.S., reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart
rate 24 hours after dosing in patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension
are shown below. In both studies mean systolic/diastolic blood pressure
and heart rate at baseline were approximately 151/101 mm Hg and 77 bpm.

<p>Blood pressure responses were seen within 1 week of treatment but the
maximum effect was apparent after 2 to 3 weeks of treatment. Overall, significantly
greater blood pressure reductions were observed on Bisoprolol &amp; hydrochlorothiazide
than on placebo. </p>

<p>Further, blood pressure reductions were significantly greater for each
of the bisoprolol fumarate plus hydrochlorothiazide combinations than for
either of the components used alone regardless of race, age, or gender.
There were no significant differences in response between black and nonblack
patients. </p>

<p><a name="INDICATIONS AND USAGE"></a><b>INDICATIONS AND USAGE </b></p>

<p>Bisoprolol &amp; hydrochlorothiazide is indicated in the management
of hypertension. </p>

<p><a name="CONTRAINDICATIONS"></a><b>CONTRAINDICATIONS </b></p>

<p>Bisoprolol &amp; hydrochlorothiazide is contraindicated in patients
in cardiogenic shock, overt cardiac failure (see WARNINGS), second or third
degree AV block, marked sinus bradycardia, anuria, and hypersensitivity
to either component of this product or to other sulfonamide-derived drugs.
</p>

<p><a name="WARNINGS"></a><b>WARNINGS </b></p>

<p>CARDIAC FAILURE: In general, beta-blocking agents should be avoided
in patients with overt congestive failure. However, in some patients with
compensated cardiac failure, it may be necessary to utilize these agents.
In such situations, they must be used cautiously. </p>

<p>PATIENTS WITHOUT A HISTORY OF CARDIAC FAILURE: Continued depression
of the myocardium with beta- blockers can, in some patients, precipitate
cardiac failure. At the first signs or symptoms of heart failure, discontinuation
of Bisoprolol &amp; hydrochlorothiazide should be considered. In some cases
Bisoprolol &amp; hydrochlorothiazide therapy can be continued while heart
failure is treated with other drugs. </p>

<p>ABRUPT CESSATION OF THERAPY: Exacerbations of angina pectoris and, in
some instances, myocardial infarction or ventricular arrhythmia, have been
observed in patients with coronary artery disease following abrupt cessation
of therapy with beta-blockers. Such patients should, therefore, be cautioned
against interruption or discontinuation of therapy without the physician's
advice. Even in patients without overt coronary artery disease, it may
be advisable to taper therapy with Bisoprolol &amp; hydrochlorothiazide
over approximately 1 week with the patient under careful observation. If
withdrawal symptoms occur, beta-blocking agent therapy should be reinstituted,
at least temporarily. </p>

<p>PERIPHERAL VASCULAR DISEASE: Beta-blockers can precipitate or aggravate
symptoms of arterial insufficiency in patients with peripheral vascular
disease. Caution should be exercised in such individuals. </p>

<p>BRONCHOSPASTIC DISEASE: PATIENTS WITH BRONCHOSPASTIC PULMONARY DISEASE
SHOULD, IN GENERAL, NOT RECEIVE BETA-BLOCKERS. Because of the relative
beta1-selectivity of bisoprolol fumarate, Bisoprolol &amp; hydrochlorothiazide
may be used with caution in patients with bronchospastic disease who do
not respond to, or who cannot tolerate other antihypertensive treatment.
Since beta1-selectivity is not absolute, the lowest possible dose of Bisoprolol
&amp; hydrochlorothiazide should be used. A beta2 agonist (bronchodilator)
should be made available. </p>

<p>ANESTHESIA AND MAJOR SURGERY: If Bisoprolol &amp; hydrochlorothiazide
treatment is to be continued perioperatively, particular care should be
taken when anesthetic agents that depress myocardial function, such as
ether, cyclopropane, and trichloroethylene, are used. See OVERDOSAGE for
information on treatment of bradycardia and hypotension. </p>

<p>DIABETES AND HYPOGLYCEMIA: Beta-blockers may mask some of the manifestations
of hypoglycemia, particularly tachycardia. Nonselective beta- blockers
may potentiate insulin-induced hypoglycemia and delay recovery of serum
glucose levels. Because of its beta1-selectivity, this is less likely with
bisoprolol fumarate. However, patients subject to spontaneous hypoglycemia,
or diabetic patients receiving insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents, should
be cautioned about these possibilities. Also, latent diabetes mellitus
may become manifest and diabetic patients given thiazides may require adjustment
of their insulin dose. Because of the very low dose of HCTZ employed, this
may be less likely with Bisoprolol &amp; hydrochlorothiazide. </p>

<p>THYROTOXICOSIS: Beta-adrenergic blockade may mask clinical signs of
hyperthyroidism, such as tachycardia. Abrupt withdrawal of beta-blockade
may be followed by an exacerbation of the symptoms of hyperthyroidism or
may precipitate thyroid storm. </p>

<p>RENAL DISEASE: Cumulative effects of the thiazides may develop in patients
with impaired renal function. In such patients, thiazides may precipitate
azotemia. In subjects with creatinine clearance less than 40 mL/min, the
plasma half- life of bisoprolol fumarate is increased up to threefold,
as compared to healthy subjects. If progressive renal impairment becomes
apparent, Bisoprolol &amp; hydrochlorothiazide should be discontinued.
(See PHARMACOKINETICS AND METABOLISM.) </p>

<p>HEPATIC DISEASE: Bisoprolol &amp; hydrochlorothiazide should be used
with caution in patients with impaired hepatic function or progressive
liver disease. Thiazides may alter fluid and electrolyte balance, which
may precipitate hepatic coma. Also, elimination of bisoprolol fumarate
is significantly slower in patients with cirrhosis than in healthy subjects.
(See PHARMACOKINETICS AND METABOLISM.) </p>

<p><a name="PRECAUTIONS"></a><b>PRECAUTIONS </b></p>

<p>GENERAL: ELECTROLYTE AND FLUID BALANCE STATUS: Although the probability
of developing hypokalemia is reduced with Bisoprolol &amp; hydrochlorothiazide
because of the very low dose of HCTZ employed, periodic determination of
serum electrolytes should be performed, and patients should be observed
for signs of fluid or electrolyte disturbances, ie, hyponatremia, hypochloremic
alkalosis, and hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia. Thiazides have been shown
to increase the urinary excretion of magnesium; this may result in hypomagnesemia.
</p>

<p>Warning signs or symptoms of fluid and electrolyte imbalance include
dryness of mouth, thirst, weakness, lethargy, drowsiness, restlessness,
muscle pains or cramps, muscular fatigue, hypotension, oliguria, tachycardia,
and gastrointestinal disturbances such as nausea and vomiting. </p>

<p>Hypokalemia may develop, especially with brisk diuresis when severe
cirrhosis is present, during concomitant use of corticosteroids or adrenocorticotropic
hormone (ACTH) or after prolonged therapy. Interference with adequate oral
electrolyte intake will also contribute to hypokalemia. Hypokalemia and
hypomagnesemia can provoke ventricular arrhythmias or sensitize or exaggerate
the response of the heart to the toxic effects of digitalis. Hypokalemia
may be avoided or treated by potassium supplementation or increased intake
of potassium-rich foods. </p>

<p>Dilutional hyponatremia may occur in edematous patients in hot weather;
appropriate therapy is water restriction rather than salt administration,
except in rare instances when the hyponatremia is life-threatening. In
actual salt depletion, appropriate replacement is the therapy of choice.
</p>

<p>PARATHYROID DISEASE: Calcium excretion is decreased by thiazides, and
pathologic changes in the parathyroid glands, with hypercalcemia and hypophosphatemia,
have been observed in a few patients on prolonged thiazide therapy. </p>

<p>HYPERURICEMIA: Hyperuricemia or acute gout may be precipitated in certain
patients receiving thiazide diuretics. Bisoprolol fumarate, alone or in
combination with HCTZ, has been associated with increases in uric acid.
However, in U.S. clinical trials, the incidence of treatment- related increases
in uric acid was higher during therapy with HCTZ 25 mg (25%) than with
B/H 6.25 mg (10%). Because of the very low dose of HCTZ employed, hyperuricemia
may be less likely with Bisoprolol &amp; hydrochlorothiazide. </p>

<p>DRUG INTERACTIONS: Bisoprolol &amp; hydrochlorothiazide may potentiate
the action of other antihypertensive agents used concomitantly. Bisoprolol
&amp; hydrochlorothiazide should not be combined with other beta-blocking
agents. Patients receiving catecholamine-depleting drugs, such as reserpine
or guanethidine, should be closely monitored because the added beta-adrenergic
blocking action of bisoprolol fumarate may produce excessive reduction
of sympathetic activity. In patients receiving concurrent therapy with
clonidine, if therapy is to be discontinued, it is suggested that Bisoprolol
&amp; hydrochlorothiazide be discontinued for several days before the withdrawal
of clonidine. </p>

<p>Bisoprolol &amp; hydrochlorothiazide should be used with caution when
myocardial depressants or inhibitors of AV conduction, such as certain
calcium antagonists (particularly of the phenylalkylamine (verapamil) and
benzothiazepine (diltiazem) classes), or antiarrhythmic agents, such as
disopyramide, are used concurrently. </p>

<p>BISOPROLOL FUMARATE: Concurrent use of rifampin increases the metabolic
clearance of bisoprolol fumarate, shortening its elimination half-life.
However, initial dose modification is generally not necessary. Pharmacokinetic
studies document no clinically relevant interactions with other agents
given concomitantly, including thiazide diuretics, digoxin and cimetidine.
There was no effect of bisoprolol fumarate on prothrombin times in patients
on stable doses of warfarin. </p>

<p>Risk of Anaphylactic Reaction: While taking beta- blockers, patients
with a history of severe anaphylactic reaction to a variety of allergens
may be more reactive to repeated challenge, either accidental, diagnostic,
or therapeutic. Such patients may be unresponsive to the usual doses of
epinephrine used to treat allergic reactions. </p>

<p>HYDROCHLOROTHIAZIDE: When given concurrently the following drugs may
interact with thiazide diuretics. </p>

<p>Alcohol, barbiturates, or narcotics--potentiation of orthostatic hypotension
may occur. </p>

<p>Antidiabetic drugs (oral agents and insulin)--dosage adjustment of the
antidiabetic drug may be required. </p>

<p>Other antihypertensive drugs--additive effect or potentiation. </p>

<p>Cholestyramine and colestipol resins--absorption of hydrochlorothiazide
is impaired in the presence of anionic exchange resins. Single doses of
cholestyramine and colestipol resins bind the hydrochlorothiazide and reduce
its absorption in the gastrointestinal tract by up to 85 percent and 43
percent, respectively. </p>

<p>Corticosteroids, ACTH--intensified electrolyte depletion, particularly
hypokalemia. </p>

<p>Pressor amines (eg, norepinephrine)--possible decreased response to
pressor amines but not sufficient to preclude their use. </p>

<p>Skeletal muscle relaxants, nondepolarizing (eg, tubocurarine)--possible
increased responsiveness to the muscle relaxant. </p>

<p>Lithium--generally should not be given with diuretics. Diuretic agents
reduce the renal clearance of lithium and add a high risk of lithium toxicity.
Refer to the package insert for lithium preparations before use of such
preparations with Bisoprolol &amp; hydrochlorothiazide. </p>

<p>Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs--in some patients, the administration
of a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent can reduce the diuretic, natriuretic,
and antihypertensive effects of loop, potassium-sparing and thiazide diuretics.
Therefore, when Bisoprolol &amp; hydrochlorothiazide and nonsteroidal anti-
inflammatory agents are used concomitantly, the patient should be observed
closely to determine if the desired effect of the diuretic is obtained.
</p>

<p>In patients receiving thiazides, sensitivity reactions may occur with
or without a history of allergy or bronchial asthma. Photosensitivity reactions
and possible exacerbation or activation of systemic lupus erythematosus
have been reported in patients receiving thiazides. The antihypertensive
effects of thiazides may be enhanced in the postsympathectomy patient.
</p>

<p>LABORATORY TEST INTERACTIONS: Based on reports involving thiazides,
Bisoprolol &amp; hydrochlorothiazide may decrease serum levels of protein-bound
iodine without signs of thyroid disturbance. </p>

<p>Because it includes a thiazide, Bisoprolol &amp; hydrochlorothiazide
should be discontinued before carrying out tests for parathyroid function
(see PRECAUTIONS- -PARATHYROID DISEASE). </p>

<p>INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS </p>

<p>Patients, especially those with coronary artery disease, should be warned
against discontinuing use of Bisoprolol &amp; hydrochlorothiazide without
a physician's supervision. </p>

<p>Patients should also be advised to consult a physician if any difficulty
in breathing occurs, or if they develop other signs or symptoms of congestive
heart failure or excessive bradycardia. </p>

<p>Patients subject to spontaneous hypoglycemia, or diabetic patients receiving
insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents, should be cautioned that beta-blockers
may mask some of the manifestations of hypoglycemia, particularly tachycardia,
and bisoprolol fumarate should be used with caution. </p>

<p>Patients should know how they react to this medicine before they operate
automobiles and machinery or engage in other tasks requiring alertness.
Patients should be advised that photosensitivity reactions have been reported
with thiazides. </p>

<p>CARCINOGENESIS, MUTAGENESIS, IMPAIRMENT OF FERTILITY: </p>

<p>CARCINOGENESIS </p>

<p>Bisoprolol &amp; hydrochlorothiazide: Long-term studies have not been
conducted with the bisoprolol fumarate/hydrochlorothiazide combination.
</p>

<p>BISOPROLOL FUMARATE: Long-term studies were conducted with oral bisoprolol
fumarate administered in the feed of mice (20 and 24 months) and rats (26
months). No evidence of carcinogenic potential was seen in mice dosed up
to 250 mg/kg/day or rats dosed up to 125 mg/kg/day. On a body-weight basis,
these doses are 625 and 312 times, respectively, the maximum recommended
human dose (MRHD) of 20 mg, or 0.4 mg/kg/day, based on 50 kg individuals;
on a body-surface-area basis, these doses are 59 times (mice) and 64 times
(rats) the MRHD. </p>

<p>HYDROCHLOROTHIAZIDE: Two-year feeding studies in mice and rats, conducted
under the auspices of the National Toxicology Program (NTP), treated mice
and rats with doses of hydrochlorothiazide up to 600 and 100 mg/kg/day,
respectively. On a body-weight basis, these doses are 2400 times (in mice)
and 400 times (in rats) the MRHD of hydrochlorothiazide (12.5 mg/day) in
Bisoprolol &amp; hydrochlorothiazide (bisoprolol fumarate </p>

<p>and hydrochlorothiazide). On a body-surface-area basis, these doses
are 226 times (in mice) and 82 times (in rats) the MRHD. These studies
uncovered no evidence of carcinogenic potential of hydrochlorothiazide
in rats or female mice, but there was equivocal evidence of hepatocarcinogenicity
in male mice. </p>

<p>MUTAGENESIS </p>

<p>Bisoprolol &amp; hydrochlorothiazide: The mutagenic potential of the
bisoprolol fumarate/hydrochlorothiazide combination was evaluated in the
microbial mutagenicity (Ames) test, the point mutation and chromosomal
aberration assays in Chinese hamster V79 cells, and the micronucleus test
in mice. There was no evidence of mutagenic potential in these In Vitro
and In Vivo assays. </p>

<p>BISOPROLOL FUMARATE: The mutagenic potential of bisoprolol fumarate
was evaluated in the microbial mutagenicity (Ames) test, the point mutation
and chromosome aberration assays in Chinese hamster V79 cells, the unscheduled
DNA synthesis test, the micronucleus test in mice, and the cytogenetics
assay in rats. There was no evidence of mutagenic potential in these In
Vitro and In Vivo assays. </p>

<p>HYDROCHLOROTHIAZIDE: Hydrochlorothiazide was not genotoxic in In Vitro
assays using strains TA 98, TA 100, TA 1535, TA 1537 and TA 1538 of Salmonella
Typhimurium (the Ames test); in the Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) test for
chromosomal aberrations; or in In Vivo assays using mouse germinal cell
chromosomes, Chinese hamster bone marrow chromosomes, and the Drosophila
sex- linked recessive lethal trait gene. Positive test results were obtained
in the In Vitro CHO Sister Chromatid Exchange (clastogenicity) test and
in the mouse Lymphoma Cell (mutagenicity) assays, using concentrations
of hydrochlorothiazide of 43 to 1300 mcgm/mL. Positive test results were
also obtained in the Aspergillus Nidulans nondisjunction assay, using an
unspecified concentration of hydrochlorothiazide. </p>

<p>IMPAIRMENT OF FERTILITY </p>

<p>Bisoprolol &amp; hydrochlorothiazide: Reproduction studies in rats did
not show any impairment of fertility with the bisoprolol fumarate/hydrochlorothiazide
combination doses containing up to 30 mg/kg/day of bisoprolol fumarate
in combination with 75 mg/kg/day of hydrochlorothiazide. On a body-weight
basis, these doses are 75 and 300 times, respectively, the MRHD of bisoprolol
fumarate and hydrochlorothiazide. On a body-surface-area basis, these study
doses are 15 and 62 times, respectively, the MRHD. </p>

<p>BISOPROLOL FUMARATE: Reproduction studies in rats did not show any impairment
of fertility at doses up to 150 mg/kg/day of bisoprolol fumarate, or 375
and 77 times the MRHD on the basis of body- weight and body-surface-area,
respectively. </p>

<p>HYDROCHLOROTHIAZIDE: Hydrochlorothiazide had no adverse effects on the
fertility of mice and rats of either sex in studies wherein these species
were exposed, via their diet, to doses of up to 100 and 4 mg/kg/day, respectively,
prior to mating and throughout gestation. Corresponding multiples of maximum
recommended human doses are 400 (mice) and 16 (rats) on the basis of body-
weight and 38 (mice) and 3.3 (rats) on the basis of body-surface-area.
</p>

<p>PREGNANCY: TERATOGENIC EFFECTS-PREGNANCY CATEGORY C: Bisoprolol &amp;
hydrochlorothiazide: In rats, the bisoprolol fumarate/hydrochlorothiazide
(B/H) combination was not teratogenic at doses up to 51.4 mg/kg/day of
bisoprolol fumarate in combination with 128.6 mg/kg/day of hydrochlorothiazide.
Bisoprolol fumarate and hydrochlorothiazide doses used in the rat study
are, as multiples of the MRHD in the combination, 129 and 514 times greater,
respectively, on a body-weight basis, and 26 and 106 times greater, respectively,
on the basis of body-surface-area. The drug combination was maternotoxic
(decreased body weight and food consumption) at B5.7/H14.3 (mg/kg/day)
and higher, and fetotoxic (increased late resorptions) at B17.1/H42.9 (mg/kg/day)
and higher. Maternotoxicity was present at 14/57 times the MRHD of B/H,
respectively, on a body- weight basis, and 3/12 times the MRHD of B/H doses,
respectively, on the basis of body- surface-area. Fetotoxicity was present
at 43/172 times the MRHD of B/H, respectively, on a body- weight basis,
and 9/35 times the MRHD of B/H doses, respectively, on the basis of body-
surface-area. In rabbits, the B/H combination was not teratogenic at doses
of B10/H25 (mg/kg/day). Bisoprolol fumarate and hydrochlorothiazide used
in the rabbit study were not teratogenic at 25/100 times the B/H MRHD,
respectively, on a body-weight basis, and 10/40 times the B/H MRHD, respectively,
on the basis of body-surface-area. The drug combination was maternotoxic
(decreased body weight) at B1/H2.5 (mg/kg/day) and higher, and fetotoxic
(increased resorptions) at B10/H25 (mg/kg/day). The multiples of the MRHD
for the B/H combination that were maternotoxic were, respectively, 2.5/10
(on the basis of body- weight) and 1/4 (on the basis of body-surface- area),
and for fetotoxicity were, respectively, 25/100 (on the basis of body-weight)
and 10/40 (on the basis of body-surface- area). </p>

<p>There are no adequate and well-controlled studies with Bisoprolol &amp;
hydrochlorothiazide in pregnant women. </p>

<p>Bisoprolol &amp; hydrochlorothiazide should be used during pregnancy
only if the potential benefit justifies the risk to the fetus. </p>

<p>BISOPROLOL FUMARATE: In rats, bisoprolol fumarate was not teratogenic
at doses up to 150 mg/kg/day, which were 375 and 77 times the MRHD on the
basis of body- weight and body-surface-area, respectively. Bisoprolol fumarate
was fetotoxic (increased late resorptions) at 50 mg/kg/day and maternotoxic
(decreased food intake and body- weight gain) at 150 mg/kg/day. The fetotoxicity
in rats occurred at 125 times the MRHD on a body- weight basis and 26 times
the MRHD on the basis of body-surface-area. The maternotoxicity occurred
at 375 times the MRHD on a body-weight basis and 77 times the MRHD on the
basis of body- surface- area. In rabbits, bisoprolol fumarate was not teratogenic
at doses up to 12.5 mg/kg/day, which is 31 and 12 times the MRHD based
on body- weight and body- surface-area, respectively, but was embryolethal
(increased early resorptions) at 12.5 mg/kg/day. </p>

<p>HYDROCHLOROTHIAZIDE: Hydrochlorothiazide was orally administered to
pregnant mice and rats during respective periods of major organogenesis
at doses up to 3000 and 1000 mg/kg/day, respectively. At these doses, which
are multiples of the MRHD equal to 12,000 for mice and 4000 for rats, based
on body-weight, and equal to 1129 for mice and 824 for rats, based on body-surface-
area, there was no evidence of harm to the fetus. There are, however, no
adequate and well- controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal
reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this
drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. </p>

<p>NONTERATOGENIC EFFECTS: Thiazides cross the placental barrier and appear
in the cord blood. The use of thiazides in pregnant women requires that
the anticipated benefit be weighed against possible hazards to the fetus.
These hazards include fetal or neonatal jaundice, pancreatitis, thrombocytopenia,
and possibly other adverse reactions which have occurred in the adult.
</p>

<p>NURSING MOTHERS: Bisoprolol fumarate alone or in combination with HCTZ
has not been studied in nursing mothers. Thiazides are excreted in human
breast milk. Small amounts of bisoprolol fumarate (&lt;2% of the dose)
have been detected in the milk of lactating rats. Because of the potential
for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be
made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking
into account the importance of the drug to the mother. </p>

<p>USE IN ELDERLY PATIENTS: In clinical trials, at least 270 patients treated
with bisoprolol fumarate plus HCTZ were 60 years of age or older. HCTZ
added significantly to the antihypertensive effect of bisoprolol in elderly
hypertensive patients. No overall differences in effectiveness or safety
were observed between these patients and younger patients. Other reported
clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between
the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older
individuals cannot be ruled out. </p>

<p>PEDIATRIC USE: Safety and effectiveness of Bisoprolol &amp; hydrochlorothiazide
in children have not been established. </p>

<p><a name="DRUG INTERACTIONS"></a><b>DRUG INTERACTIONS </b></p>

<p>Bisoprolol &amp; hydrochlorothiazide may potentiate the action of other
antihypertensive agents used concomitantly. Bisoprolol &amp; hydrochlorothiazide
should not be combined with other beta-blocking agents. </p>

<p>Patients receiving catecholamine- depleting drugs, such as reserpine
or guanethidine, should be closely monitored because the added beta-adrenergic
blocking action of bisoprolol fumarate may produce excessive reduction
of sympathetic activity. In patients receiving concurrent therapy with
clonidine, if therapy is to be discontinued, it is suggested that Bisoprolol
&amp; hydrochlorothiazide be discontinued for several days before the withdrawal
of clonidine. </p>

<p>Bisoprolol &amp; hydrochlorothiazide should be used with caution when
myocardial depressants or inhibitors of AV conduction, such as certain
calcium antagonists (particularly of the phenylalkylamine (verapamil) and
benzothiazepine (diltiazem) classes), or antiarrhythmic agents, such as
disopyramide, are used concurrently. BISOPROLOL FUMARATE: Concurrent use
of rifampin increases the metabolic clearance of bisoprolol fumarate, shortening
its elimination half-life. However, initial dose modification is generally
not necessary. Pharmacokinetic studies document no clinically relevant
interactions with other agents given concomitantly, including thiazide
diuretics, digoxin and cimetidine. There was no effect of bisoprolol fumarate
on prothrombin times in patients on stable doses of warfarin. </p>

<p>Risk of Anaphylactic Reaction: While taking beta- blockers, patients
with a history of severe anaphylactic reaction to a variety of allergens
may be more reactive to repeated challenge, either accidental, diagnostic,
or therapeutic. Such patients may be unresponsive to the usual doses of
epinephrine used to treat allergic reactions. </p>

<p>HYDROCHLOROTHIAZIDE: When given concurrently the following drugs may
interact with thiazide diuretics. </p>

<p>Alcohol, barbiturates, or narcotics--potentiation of orthostatic hypotension
may occur. </p>

<p>Antidiabetic drugs (oral agents and insulin)--dosage adjustment of the
antidiabetic drug may be required. </p>

<p>Other antihypertensive drugs--additive effect or potentiation. </p>

<p>Cholestyramine and colestipol resins--absorption of hydrochlorothiazide
is impaired in the presence of anionic exchange resins. Single doses of
cholestyramine and colestipol resins bind the hydrochlorothiazide and reduce
its absorption in the gastrointestinal tract by up to 85 and 43 percent,
respectively. </p>

<p>Corticosteroids, ACTH--intensified electrolyte depletion, particularly
hypokalemia. </p>

<p>Pressor amines (eg, norepinephrine)--possible decreased response to
pressor amines but not sufficient to preclude their use. </p>

<p>Skeletal muscle relaxants, nondepolarizing (eg, tubocurarine)--possible
increased responsiveness to the muscle relaxant. </p>

<p>Lithium--generally should not be given with diuretics. Diuretic agents
reduce the renal clearance of lithium and add a high risk of lithium toxicity.
Refer to the package insert for lithium preparations before use of such
preparations with Bisoprolol &amp; hydrochlorothiazide. </p>

<p>Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs--in some patients, the administration
of a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent can reduce the diuretic, natriuretic,
and antihypertensive effects of loop, potassium-sparing and thiazide diuretics.
Therefore, when Bisoprolol &amp; hydrochlorothiazide and nonsteroidal anti-
inflammatory agents are used concomitantly, the patient should be observed
closely to determine if the desired effect of the diuretic is obtained.
</p>

<p>In patients receiving thiazides, sensitivity reactions may occur with
or without a history of allergy or bronchial asthma. Photosensitivity reactions
and possible exacerbation or activation of systemic lupus erythematosus
have been reported in patients receiving thiazides. The antihypertensive
effects of thiazides may be enhanced in the postsympathectomy patient.

<p>Bisoprolol &amp; hydrochlorothiazide </p>

<p>Bisoprolol fumarate/H6.25 mg is well tolerated in most patients. Most
adverse effects (AEs) have been mild and transient. In more than 65,000
patients treated worldwide with bisoprolol fumarate, occurrences of bronchospasm
have been rare. Discontinuation rates for AEs were similar for B/H6.25
mg and placebo-treated patients. </p>

<p>In the United States, 252 patients received bisoprolol fumarate (2.5,
5, 10, or 40 mg)/H6.25 mg and 144 patients received placebo in two controlled
trials. In Study 1, bisoprolol fumarate 5/H6.25 mg was administered for
4 weeks. In Study 2, bisoprolol fumarate 2.5, 10 or 40/H6.25 mg was administered
for 12 weeks. All adverse experiences, whether drug related or not, and
drug related adverse experiences in patients treated with B2.5-10/H6.25

<p>LABORATORY ABNORMALITIES </p>

<p>Bisoprolol &amp; hydrochlorothiazide </p>

<p>Because of the low dose of hydrochlorothiazide in Bisoprolol &amp; hydrochlorothiazide,
adverse metabolic effects with B/H6.25 mg are less frequent and of smaller
magnitude than with HCTZ 25 mg. Laboratory data on serum potassium from
the U.S. placebo-controlled trials are shown in the following table: </p>

(b) Percentage of patients with abnormality at Week 4.
**  Combined across studies</pre>

<p>Treatment with both beta blockers and thiazide diuretics is associated
with increases in uric acid. However, the magnitude of the change in patients
treated with B/H6.25 mg was smaller than in patients treated with HCTZ
25 mg. Mean increases in serum triglycerides were observed in patients
treated with bisoprolol fumarate and hydrochlorothiazide 6.25 mg. Total
cholesterol was generally unaffected, but small decreases in HDL cholesterol
were noted. Other laboratory abnormalities that have been reported with
the individual components are listed below. </p>

<p>BISOPROLOL FUMARATE: In clinical trials, the most frequently reported
laboratory change was an increase in serum triglycerides, but this was
not a consistent finding. </p>

<p>Sporadic liver test abnormalities have been reported. In the U.S. controlled
trials experience with bisoprolol fumarate treatment for 4 to 12 weeks,
the incidence of concomitant elevations in SGOT and SGPT of between 1 and
2 times normal was 3.9%, compared to 2.5% for placebo. No patient had concomitant
elevations greater than twice normal. </p>

<p>In the long-term, uncontrolled experience with bisoprolol fumarate treatment
for 6 to 18 months, the incidence of one or more concomitant elevations
in SGOT and SGPT of between 1 and 2 times normal was 6.2%. The incidence
of multiple occurrence was 1.9%. For concomitant elevations in SGOT and
SGPT of greater than twice normal, the incidence was 1.5%. The incidence
of multiple occurrences was 0.3%. In many cases these elevations were attributed
to underlying disorders, or resolved during continued treatment with bisoprolol
fumarate. </p>

<p>Other laboratory changes included small increases in uric acid, creatinine,
BUN, serum potassium, glucose, and phosphorus and decreases in WBC and
platelets. There have been occasional reports of eosinophilia. These were
generally not of clinical importance and rarely resulted in discontinuation
of bisoprolol fumarate. </p>

<p>As with other beta-blockers, ANA conversions have also been reported
on bisoprolol fumarate. About 15% of patients in long-term studies converted
to a positive titer, although about one-third of these patients subsequently
reconverted to a negative titer while on continued therapy. </p>

<p>HYDROCHLOROTHIAZIDE: Hyperglycemia, glycosuria, hyperuricemia, hypokalemia
and other electrolyte imbalances (see PRECAUTIONS), hyperlipidemia, hypercalcemia,
leukopenia, agranulocytosis, thrombocytopenia, aplastic anemia, and hemolytic
anemia have been associated with HCTZ therapy. </p>

<p><a name="OVERDOSAGE"></a><b>OVERDOSAGE </b></p>

<p>While there have been no reports of overdose with Bisoprolol &amp; hydrochlorothiazide,
several cases of overdose with bisoprolol fumarate have been reported (maximum:
2000 mg). Bradycardia and/or hypotension were noted. Sympathomimetic agents
were given in some cases, and all patients recovered. </p>

<p>The most frequently observed signs expected with overdosage of a beta-blocker
are bradycardia and hypotension. Lethargy is also common, and with severe
overdoses, delirium, coma, convulsions, and respiratory arrest have been
reported to occur. Congestive heart failure, bronchospasm, and hypoglycemia
may occur, particularly in patients with underlying conditions. With thiazide
diuretics, acute intoxication is rare. The most prominent feature of overdose
is acute loss of fluid and electrolytes. Signs and symptoms include cardiovascular
(tachycardia, hypotension, shock), neuromuscular (weakness, confusion,
dizziness, cramps of the calf muscles, paresthesia, fatigue, impairment
of consciousness), gastrointestinal (nausea, vomiting, thirst), renal (polyuria,
oliguria, or anuria (due to hemoconcentration)), and laboratory findings
(hypokalemia, hyponatremia, hypochloremia, alkalosis, increased BUN (especially
in patients with renal insufficiency)). </p>

<p>If overdosage of Bisoprolol &amp; hydrochlorothiazide is suspected,
therapy with Bisoprolol &amp; hydrochlorothiazide should be discontinued
and the patient observed closely. Treatment is symptomatic and supportive;
there is no specific antidote. Limited data suggest bisoprolol fumarate
is not dialyzable; similarly, there is no indication that hydrochlorothiazide
is dialyzable. Suggested general measures include induction of emesis and/or
gastric lavage, administration of activated charcoal, respiratory support,
correction of fluid and electrolyte imbalance, and treatment of convulsions.
</p>

<p>Based on the expected pharmacologic actions and recommendations for
other beta- blockers and hydrochlorothiazide, the following measures should
be considered when clinically warranted: </p>

<p>Bradycardia: Administer IV atropine. If the response is inadequate,
isoproterenol or another agent with positive chronotropic properties may
be given cautiously. Under some circumstances, transvenous pacemaker insertion
may be necessary. </p>

<p>Hypotension, Shock: The patient's legs should be elevated. IV fluids
should be administered and lost electrolytes (potassium, sodium) replaced.
Intravenous glucagon may be useful. Vasopressors should be considered.
</p>

<p>Heart Block (second or third degree): Patients should be carefully monitored
and treated with isoproterenol infusion or transvenous cardiac pacemaker
insertion, as appropriate. </p>

<p>Congestive Heart Failure: Initiate conventional therapy (ie, digitalis,
diuretics, vasodilating agents, inotropic agents). </p>

<p>Bronchospasm: Administer a bronchodilator such as isoproterenol and/or
aminophylline. </p>

<p>Hypoglycemia: Administer IV glucose. </p>

<p>Surveillance: Fluid and electrolyte balance (especially serum potassium)
and renal function should be monitored until normalized. </p>

<p><a name="DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION"></a><b>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
</b></p>

<p>Bisoprolol is an effective treatment of hypertension in once-daily doses
of 2.5- 40 mg, while hydrochlorothiazide is effective in doses of 15-50
mg. In clinical trials of bisoprolol/hydrochlorothiazide combination therapy
using bisoprolol doses of 2.5-20 mg and hydrochlorothiazide doses of 6.25-25
mg, the antihypertensive effects increased with increasing doses of either
component. </p>

<p>The adverse effects (see WARNINGS) of bisoprolol are a mixture of dose-dependent
phenomena (primarily bradycardia, diarrhea, asthenia and fatigue) and dose-
independent phenomena (eg, occasional rash); those of hydrochlorothiazide
are a mixture of dose-dependent phenomena (primarily hypokalemia) and dose-independent
phenomena (eg, possibly pancreatitis); the dose- dependent phenomena for
each being much more common than the dose-independent phenomena. The latter
consist of those few that are truly idiosyncratic in nature or those that
occur with such low frequency that a dose relationship may be difficult
to discern. Therapy with a combination of bisoprolol and hydrochlorothiazide
will be associated with both sets of dose- independent adverse effects,
and to minimize these, it may be appropriate to begin combination therapy
only after a patient has failed to achieve the desired effect with monotherapy.
On the other hand, regimens that combine low doses of bisoprolol and hydrochlorothiazide
should produce minimal dose-dependent adverse effects, eg, bradycardia,
diarrhea, asthenia and fatigue, and minimal dose-dependent adverse metabolic
effects, ie, decreases in serum potassium (see ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY).
</p>

<p>THERAPY GUIDED BY CLINICAL EFFECT: A patient whose blood pressure is
not adequately controlled with 2.5-20 mg bisoprolol daily may instead be
given Bisoprolol &amp; hydrochlorothiazide.</p>

<p>Patients whose blood pressures are adequately controlled with 50 mg
of hydrochlorothiazide daily, but who experience significant potassium
loss with this regimen, may achieve similar blood pressure control without
electrolyte disturbance if they are switched to Bisoprolol &amp; hydrochlorothiazide.
</p>

<p>INITIAL THERAPY: Antihypertensive therapy may be initiated with the
lowest dose of Bisoprolol &amp; hydrochlorothiazide, one 2.5/6.25 mg tablet
once daily. Subsequent titration (14 day intervals) may be carried out
with Bisoprolol &amp; hydrochlorothiazide tablets up to the maximum recommended
dose 20/12.5 mg (two 10/6.25 mg tablets) once daily, as appropriate. </p>

<p>REPLACEMENT THERAPY: The combination may be substituted for the titrated
individual components. </p>

<p>CESSATION OF THERAPY: If withdrawal of Bisoprolol &amp; hydrochlorothiazide
therapy is planned, it should be achieved gradually over a period of about
2 weeks. Patients should be carefully observed. </p>

<p>Patients with Renal or Hepatic Impairment: As noted in the WARNINGS
section, caution must be used in dosing/titrating patients with hepatic
impairment or renal dysfunction. Since there is no indication that hydrochlorothiazide
is dialyzable, and limited data suggest that bisoprolol is not dialyzable,
drug replacement is not necessary in patients undergoing dialysis. </p>

<p>Elderly Patients: Dosage adjustment on the basis of age is not usually
necessary, unless there is also significant renal or hepatic dysfunction
(see above and WARNINGS section). </p>

<p>Children: There is no pediatric experience with Bisoprolol &amp; hydrochlorothiazide.

<p><a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><b>DESCRIPTION </b></p>

<p>Pemoline is a central nervous system stimulant. Pemoline is structurally
dissimilar to the amphetamines and methylphenidate. It is an oxazolidine
compound and is chemically identified as 2-amino-5-phenyl- 2-oxazolin-4-one.
</p>

<p>Pemoline is a white, tasteless, odorless powder, relatively insoluble
(less than 1 mg/mL) in water, chloroform, ether, acetone, and benzene;
its solubility in 95% ethyl alcohol is 2.2 mg/mL. </p>

<p><a name="ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY"></a><b>ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
</b></p>

<p>Pemoline has a pharmacological activity similar to that of other known
central nervous system stimulants; however, it has minimal sympathomimetic
effects. Although studies indicate that pemoline may act in animals through
dopaminergic mechanisms, the exact mechanism and site of action of the
drug in man is not known. </p>

<p>There is neither specific evidence which clearly establishes the mechanism
whereby Pemoline produces its mental and behavioral effects in children,
nor conclusive evidence regarding how these effects relate to the condition
of the central nervous system. </p>

<p>Pemoline is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Approximately
50% is bound to plasma proteins. The serum half-life of pemoline is approximately
12 hours. Peak serum levels of the drug occur within 2 to 4 hours after
ingestion of a single dose. Multiple dose studies in adults at several
dose levels indicate that steady state is reached in approximately 2 to
3 days. In animals given radiolabeled pemoline, the drug was widely and
uniformly distributed throughout the tissues, including the brain. </p>

<p>Pemoline is metabolized by the liver. Metabolites of pemoline include
pemoline conjugate, pemoline dione, mandelic acid, and unidentified polar
compounds. Pemoline is excreted primarily by the kidneys with approximately
50% excreted unchanged and only minor fractions present as metabolites.
</p>

<p>Pemoline has a gradual onset of action. Using the recommended schedule
of dosage titration, significant clinical benefit may not be evident until
the third or fourth week of drug administration. </p>

<p><a name="INDICATIONS AND USAGE"></a><b>INDICATIONS AND USAGE </b></p>

<p>Pemoline is indicated in Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD) with hyperactivity
as an integral part of a total treatment program which typically includes
other remedial measures (psychological, educational, social) for a stabilizing
effect in children with a behavioral syndrome characterized by the following
group of developmentally inappropriate symptoms: moderate to severe distractibility,
short attention span, hyperactivity, emotional lability, and impulsivity.
The diagnosis of this syndrome should not be made with finality when these
symptoms are only of comparatively recent origin. Nonlocalizing (soft)
neurological signs, learning disability, and abnormal EEG may or may not
be present, and a diagnosis of central nervous system dysfunction may or
may not be warranted. </p>

<p><a name="CONTRAINDICATIONS"></a><b>CONTRAINDICATIONS </b></p>

<p>Pemoline is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity
or idiosyncrasy to the drug. Pemoline should not be administered to patients
with impaired hepatic function. (See &quot;ADVERSE REACTIONS&quot; section.)
</p>

<p><a name="WARNINGS"></a><b>WARNINGS </b></p>

<p>Decrements in the predicted growth (i.e., weight gain and/or height)
rate have been reported with the long-term use of stimulants in children.
Therefore, patients requiring long-term therapy should be carefully monitored.
</p>

<p><a name="PRECAUTIONS"></a><b>PRECAUTIONS </b></p>

<p>General: Clinical experience suggests that in psychotic children, administration
of Pemoline may exacerbate symptoms of behavior disturbance and thought
disorder. Pemoline should be administered with caution to patients with
significantly impaired renal function. </p>

<p>Laboratory Tests: Liver function tests should be performed prior to
and periodically during therapy with Pemoline. The drug should be discontinued
if abnormalities are revealed and confirmed by follow-up tests. (See &quot;ADVERSE
REACTIONS&quot; section regarding reports of abnormal liver function tests,
hepatitis and jaundice.) </p>

<p>Drug Interactions: The interaction of Pemoline with other drugs has
not been studied in humans. Patients who are receiving Pemoline concurrently
with other drugs, especially drugs with CNS activity, should be monitored
carefully. Decreased seizure threshold has been reported in patients receiving
Pemoline concomitantly with Antiepileptic Medications. </p>

<p>Carcinogenesis: Long-term studies have been conducted in rats with doses
as high as 150 mg/kg/day for eighteen months. There was no significant
difference in the incidence of any neoplasm between treated and control
animals. </p>

<p>Mutagenesis: Data are not available concerning long-term effects on
mutagenicity in animals or humans. </p>

<p>Impairment Of Fertility: The results of studies in which rats were given
18.75 and 37.5 mg/kg/day indicated that pemoline did not affect fertility
in males or females at those doses. </p>

<p>Pregnancy: Teratogenic Effects: Pregnancy Category B. Reproduction studies
have been performed in rats and rabbits at doses of 18.75 and 37.5 mg/kg/day
and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus.
There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant
women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of
human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly
needed. </p>

<p>Nonteratogenic Effects: Studies in rats have shown an increased incidence
of stillbirths and cannibalization when pemoline was administered at a
dose of 37.5 mg/kg/day. Postnatal survival of offspring was reduced at
doses of 18.75 and 37.5 mg/kg/day. </p>

<p>Nursing Mothers: It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human
milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be
exercised when Pemoline is administered to a nursing woman. </p>

<p>Pediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness in children below the age of
6 years have not been established. </p>

<p>Long-term effects of Pemoline in children have not been established
(See &quot;WARNINGS&quot; section). </p>

<p>CNS stimulants, including pemoline, have been reported to precipitate
motor and phonic tics and Tourette's syndrome. Therefore, clinical evaluation
for tics and Tourette's syndrome in children and their families should
precede use of stimulant medications. </p>

<p>Drug treatment is not indicated in all cases of ADD with hyperactivity
and should be considered only in light of complete history and evaluation
of the child. The decision to prescribe Pemoline should depend on the physician's
assessment of the chronicity and severity of the child's symptoms and their
appropriateness for his/her age. Prescription should not depend solely
on the presence of one or more of the behavioral characteristics. </p>

<p><a name="DRUG INTERACTIONS"></a><b>DRUG INTERACTIONS </b></p>

<p>The interaction of Pemoline with other drugs has not been studied in
humans. Patients who are receiving Pemoline concurrently with other drugs,
especially drugs with CNS activity, should be monitored carefully. </p>

<p>Decreased seizure threshold has been reported in patients receiving
Pemoline concomitantly with Antiepileptic Medications. (See Also PRECAUTIONS)
</p>

<p><a name="ADVERSE REACTIONS"></a><b>ADVERSE REACTIONS </b></p>

<p>The following are adverse reactions in decreasing order of severity
within each category associated with Pemoline. </p>

<p>Hepatic: There have been reports of hepatic dysfunction including elevated
liver enzymes, hepatitis and jaundice in patients taking Pemoline. The
occurrence of elevated liver enzymes is not rare and these reactions appear
to be reversible upon drug discontinuance. Most patients with elevated
liver enzymes were asymptomatic. Although no causal relationship has been
established, there have been rare reports of hepatic-related fatalities
involving patients taking Pemoline. </p>

<p>Hematopoietic: There have been isolated reports of aplastic anemia.
</p>

<p>Central Nervous System: The following CNS effects have been reported
with the use of Pemoline: convulsive seizures; literature reports indicate
that Pemoline may precipitate attacks of Gilles de la Tourette syndrome;
hallucinations; dyskinetic movements of the tongue, lips, face and extremities;
abnormal oculomotor function including nystagmus and oculogyric crisis;
mild depression; dizziness; increased irritability; headache; and drowsiness.
Insomnia is the most frequently reported side effect of Pemoline; it usually
occurs early in therapy prior to an optimum therapeutic response. In the
majority of cases it is transient in nature or responds to a reduction
in dosage. </p>

<p>Gastrointestinal: Anorexia and weight loss may occur during the first
weeks of therapy. In the majority of cases it is transient in nature; weight
gain usually resumes within three to six months. Nausea and stomach ache
have also been reported. </p>

<p>Genitourinary: A case of elevated acid phosphatase in association with
prostatic enlargement has been reported in a 63 year old male who was treated
with Pemoline for sleepiness. The acid phosphatase normalized with discontinuation
of Pemoline and was again elevated with rechallenge. </p>

<p>Miscellaneous: Suppression of growth has been reported with the long-term
use of stimulants in children. (See &quot;WARNINGS&quot; section.) Skin
rash has been reported with Pemoline. </p>

<p>Mild adverse reactions appearing early during the course of treatment
with Pemoline often remit with continuing therapy. If adverse reactions
are of a significant or protracted nature, dosage should be reduced or
the drug discontinued. </p>

<p>DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE </p>

<p>Controlled Substance: Pemoline is subject to control under DEA schedule
IV. Abuse: Pemoline failed to demonstrate a potential for self-administration
in primates. However, the pharmacologic similarity of pemoline to other
psychostimulants with known dependence liability suggests that psychological
and/or physical dependence might also occur with Pemoline. There have been
isolated reports of transient psychotic symptoms occurring in adults following
the long- term misuse of excessive oral doses of pemoline. Pemoline should
be given with caution to emotionally unstable patients who may increase
the dosage on their own initiative. </p>

<p><a name="OVERDOSAGE"></a><b>OVERDOSAGE </b></p>

<p>Signs and symptoms of acute overdosage, resulting principally from overstimulation
of the central nervous system and from excessive sympathomimetic effects,
may include the following: vomiting, agitation, tremors, hyperreflexia,
muscle twitching, convulsions (may be followed by coma), euphoria, confusion,
hallucinations, delirium, sweating, flushing, headache, hyperpyrexia, tachycardia,
hypertension and mydriasis. Treatment consists of appropriate supportive
measures. The patient must be protected against self-injury and against
external stimuli that would aggravate overstimulation already present.
</p>

<p>If signs and symptoms are not too severe and the patient is conscious,
gastric contents may be evacuated. Chlorpromazine has been reported in
the literature to be useful in decreasing CNS stimulation and sympathomimetic
effects. </p>

<p>Efficacy of peritoneal dialysis or extracorporeal hemodialysis for Pemoline
overdosage has not been established. </p>

<p><a name="DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION"></a><b>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
</b></p>

<p>Pemoline is administered as a single oral dose each morning. The recommended
starting dose is 37.5 mg/day. This daily dose should be gradually increased
by 18.75 mg at one week intervals until the desired clinical response is
obtained. The effective daily dose for most patients will range from 56.25
to 75 mg. The maximum recommended daily dose of pemoline is 112.5 mg. </p>

<p>Clinical improvement with Pemoline is gradual. Using the recommended
schedule of dosage titration, significant benefit may not be evident until
the third or fourth week of drug administration. </p>

<p>Where possible, drug administration should be interrupted occasionally
to determine if there is a recurrence of behavioral symptoms sufficient
to require continued therapy. </p>

<p><a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><b>DESCRIPTION </b></p>

<p>Cefixime is a semisynthetic, cephalosporin antibiotic for oral administration.
Chemically, it is (6R, 7R)-7-(2-(2-Amino-4-thiazolyl) gloxylamido)-8-oxo-3-
vinyl-5-thia-1-azabicyclo(4.2.0)oct-2-ene-2-carboxylic acid, 7(square)-(Z)-(O-
(carboxymethyl)oxime)-trihydrate. Molecular weight = 507.50 as the trihydrate.
</p>

<p><a name="ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY"></a><b>ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
</b></p>

<p>Cefixime, given orally, is about 40% to 50% absorbed whether administered
with or without food; however, time to maximal absorption is increased
approximately 0.8 hours when administered with food. A single 200 mg tablet
of Cefixime produces an average peak serum concentration of approximately
2 mcg/mL (range 1 to 4 mcg/mL); a single 400 mg tablet produces an average
peak concentration of approximately 3.7 mcg/mL (range 1.3 to 7.7 mcg/mL).
The oral suspension produces average peak concentrations approximately
25% to 50% higher than the tablets, when tested in normal Adult volunteers.
Two hundred milligram and 400 mg doses of oral suspension produce average
peak concentrations of 3 mcg/mL (range 1 to 4.5 mcg/mL) and 4.6 mcg/mL
(range 1.9 to 7.7 mcg/mL), respectively, when tested in normal Adult volunteers.
The area under the time versus concentration curve is greater by approximately
10% to 25% with the oral suspension than with the tablet after doses of
100 to 400 mg, when tested in normal Adult volunteers. This increased absorption
should be taken into consideration if the oral suspension is to be substituted
for the tablet. Because of the lack of bioequivalence, tablets should not
be substituted for oral suspension in the treatment of otitis media. (See
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION.) Cross-over studies of tablet versus suspension
have not been performed in children. </p>

<p>Peak serum concentrations occur between 2 and 6 hours following oral
administration of a single 200 mg tablet, a single 400 mg tablet, or 400
mg of suspension of Cefixime. Peak serum concentrations occur between 2
and 5 hours following a single administration of 200 mg of suspension.

<p>Approximately 50% of the absorbed dose is excreted unchanged in the
urine in 24 hours. In animal studies, it was noted that cefixime is also
excreted in the bile in excess of 10% of the administered dose. Serum protein
binding is concentration independent with a bound fraction of approximately
65%. In a multiple dose study conducted with a research formulation which
is less bioavailable than the tablet or suspension, there was little accumulation
of drug in serum or urine after dosing for 14 days. </p>

<p>The serum half-life of cefixime in healthy subjects is independent of
dosage form and averages 3.0 to 4.0 hours but may range up to 9 hours in
some normal volunteers. Average AUCs at steady state in elderly patients
are approximately 40% higher than average AUCs in other healthy adults.
</p>

<p>In subjects with moderate impairment of renal function (20 to 40 mL/min
creatinine clearance), the average serum half-life of cefixime is prolonged
to 6.4 hours. In severe renal impairment (5 to 20 mL/min creatinine clearance),
the half-life increased to an average of 11.5 hours. The drug is not cleared
significantly from the blood by hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. However,
a study indicated that with doses of 400 mg, patients undergoing hemodialysis
have similar blood profiles as subjects with creatinine clearances of 21
to 60 mL/min. There is no evidence of metabolism of cefixime In Vivo. </p>

<p>Adequate data on CSF levels of cefixime are not available. </p>

<p>MICROBIOLOGY: As with other cephalosporins, bactericidal action of Cefixime
Cefixime results from inhibition of cell-wall synthesis. Cefixime is highly
stable in the presence of beta-lactamase enzymes. As a result, many organisms
resistant to penicillins and some cephalosporins due to the presence of
beta lactamases, may be susceptible to cefixime. Cefixime has been shown
to be active against most strains of the following organisms both In Vitro
and in clinical infections (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE): </p>

<p>GRAM-POSITIVE ORGANISMS </p>

<p>Streptococcus Pneumoniae </p>

<p>Streptococcus Pyogenes </p>

<p>GRAM-NEGATIVE ORGANISMS </p>

<p>Haemophilus Influenzae (beta-lactamase positive and negative strains)
</p>

<p>Moraxella (Branhamella) Catarrhalis (most of which are beta-lactamase
positive) </p>

<p>Escherichia Coli </p>

<p>Proteus Mirabilis </p>

<p>Neisseria Gonorrhoeae (including penicillinase- and non-penicillinase-producing
strains) </p>

<p>Cefixime has been shown to be active In Vitro against most strains of
the following organisms; however, clinical efficacy has not been established.
</p>

<p>GRAM-POSITIVE ORGANISMS </p>

<p>Streptococcus Agalactiae </p>

<p>GRAM-NEGATIVE ORGANISMS </p>

<p>Haemophilus Parainfluenzae (beta-lactamase positive and negative strains)
</p>

<p>Proteus Vulgaris </p>

<p>Klebsiella Pneumoniae </p>

<p>Klebsiella Oxytoca </p>

<p>Pasteurella Multocida </p>

<p>Providencia species </p>

<p>Salmonella species </p>

<p>Shigella species </p>

<p>Citrobacter Amalonaticus </p>

<p>Citrobacter Diversus </p>

<p>Serratia Marcescens </p>

<p>NOTE: Pseudomonas species, strains of group D streptococci (including
enterococci), Listeria Monocytogenes, most strains of staphylococci (including
methicillin-resistant strains) and most strains of Enterobacter are resistant
to Cefixime Cefixime. In addition, most strains of Bacteroides Fragilis
and Clostridia are resistant to Cefixime. </p>

<p>SUSCEPTIBILITY TESTING </p>

<p>SUSCEPTIBILITY TESTS: Diffusion Techniques: Quantitative methods that
require measurement of zone diameters give an estimate of antibiotic susceptibility.
One such procedure (REF. 1-3) has been recommended for use with disks to
test susceptibility to cefixime. Interpretation involves correlation of
the diameters obtained in the disk test with minimum inhibitory concentration
(MIC) for cefixime. </p>

<p>Reports from the laboratory giving results of the standard single-disk
susceptibility test with a 5-mcg cefixime disk should be interpreted according
to the following criteria: </p>

(a) Using GC Agar Base with a defined 1% supplement without cysteine.\          
A report of &quot;Susceptible&quot; indicates that the pathogen is likely to be inhibited 
by generally achievable blood levels. A report of &quot;Moderately Susceptible&quot;
indicates that inhibitory concentrations of the antibiotic may well be achieved 
if high dosage is used or if the infection is confined to tissues and fluids
(eg, urine) in which high antibiotic levels are attained. A report of
&quot;Resistant&quot; indicates that achievable concentrations of the antibiotic are
unlikely to be inhibitory and other therapy should be selected.  
 
Standardized procedures require the use of laboratory control organisms. The 5
mcg disk should give the following zone diameter:

The class disk for cephalosporin susceptibility testing (the cephalothin disk)
is not appropriate because of spectrum differences with cefixime. The 5-mcg
cefixime disk should be used for all In Vitro testing of isolates.  
 
Dilution Techniques: Broth or agar dilution methods can be used to determine
the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) value for susceptibility of
bacterial isolates to cefixime. The recommended susceptibility breakpoints are
as follows:

<p><a name="INDICATIONS AND USAGE"></a><b>INDICATIONS AND USAGE </b></p>

<p>Cefixime Cefixime is indicated in the treatment of the following infections
when caused by susceptible strains of the designated microorganisms: </p>

<p>UNCOMPLICATED URINARY TRACT INFECTIONS caused by Escherichia Coli and
Proteus Mirabilis. </p>

<p>OTITIS MEDIA caused by Haemophilus Influenzae (beta-lactamase positive
and negative strains), Moraxella (Branhamella) Catarrhalis, (most of which
are beta lactamase positive), and S Pyogenes.* </p>

<p>---------- 
<br>*Efficacy for this organism in this organ system was studied in fewer
than 10 infections. 
<br>---------- </p>

<p>NOTE: For information on otitis media caused by Streptococcus Pneumoniae,
see CLINICAL STUDIES section. </p>

<p>PHARYNGITIS AND TONSILLITIS, caused by S Pyogenes. </p>

<p>NOTE: Penicillin is the usual drug of choice in the treatment of S Pyogenes
infections, including the prophylaxis of rheumatic fever. Cefixime is generally
effective in the eradication of S Pyogenes from the nasopharynx; however,
data establishing the efficacy of Cefixime in the subsequent prevention
of rheumatic fever are not available. </p>

<p>ACUTE BRONCHITIS AND ACUTE EXACERBATIONS OF CHRONIC BRONCHITIS, caused
by Streptococcus Pneumoniae and Haemophilus Influenzae (beta-lactamase
positive and negative strains). </p>

<p>UNCOMPLICATED GONORRHEA (CERVICAL/URETHRAL), caused by Neisseria Gonorrhoeae
(penicillinase- and non-penicillinase-producing strains). </p>

<p>Appropriate cultures and susceptibility studies should be performed
to determine the causative organism and its susceptibility to Cefixime;
however, therapy may be started while awaiting the results of these studies.
Therapy should be adjusted, if necessary, once these results are known.
</p>

<p><a name="CONTRAINDICATIONS"></a><b>CONTRAINDICATIONS </b></p>

<p>Cefixime is contraindicated in patients with known allergy to the cephalosporin
group of antibiotics. </p>

<p><a name="WARNINGS"></a><b>WARNINGS </b></p>

<p>BEFORE THERAPY WITH Cefixime IS INSTITUTED, CAREFUL INQUIRY SHOULD BE
MADE TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE PATIENT HAS HAD PREVIOUS HYPERSENSITIVITY
REACTIONS TO CEPHALOSPORINS, PENICILLINS, OR OTHER DRUGS. IF THIS PRODUCT
IS TO BE GIVEN TO PENICILLIN-SENSITIVE PATIENTS, CAUTION SHOULD BE EXERCISED
BECAUSE CROSS HYPERSENSITIVITY AMONG BETA-LACTAM ANTIBIOTICS HAS BEEN CLEARLY
DOCUMENTED AND MAY OCCUR IN UP TO 10% OF PATIENTS WITH A HISTORY OF PENICILLIN
ALLERGY. IF AN ALLERGIC REACTION TO Cefixime OCCURS, DISCONTINUE THE DRUG.
SERIOUS ACUTE HYPERSENSITIVITY REACTIONS MAY REQUIRE TREATMENT WITH EPINEPHRINE
AND OTHER EMERGENCY MEASURES, INCLUDING OXYGEN, INTRAVENOUS FLUIDS, INTRAVENOUS
ANTIHISTAMINES, CORTICOSTEROIDS, PRESSOR AMINES AND AIRWAY MANAGEMENT,
AS CLINICALLY INDICATED. </p>

<p>Antibiotics, including Cefixime, should be administered cautiously to
any patient who has demonstrated some form of allergy, particularly to
drugs. </p>

<p>Treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics, including Cefixime, alters
the normal flora of the colon and may permit overgrowth of clostridia.
Studies indicate that a toxin produced by Clostridium Difficile is a primary
cause of severe antibiotic-associated diarrhea including pseudomembranous
colitis. </p>

<p>Pseudomembranous colitis has been reported with the use of Cefixime
Cefixime and other broad-spectrum antibiotics (including macrolides, semisynthetic
penicillins, and cephalosporins); therefore, it is important to consider
this diagnosis in patients who develop diarrhea in association with the
use of antibiotics. Symptoms of pseudomembranous colitis may occur during
or after antibiotic treatment and may range in severity from mild to life
threatening. Mild cases of pseudomembranous colitis usually respond to
drug discontinuation alone. In moderate to severe cases, management should
include fluids, electrolytes, and protein supplementation. If the colitis
does not improve after the drug has been discontinued, or if the symptoms
are severe, oral vancomycin is the drug of choice for antibiotic-associated
pseudomembranous colitis produced by C Difficile. Other causes of colitis
should be excluded. </p>

<p><a name="PRECAUTIONS"></a><b>PRECAUTIONS </b></p>

<p>GENERAL: The possibility of the emergence of resistant organisms, which
might result in overgrowth should be kept in mind, particularly during
prolonged treatment. In such use, careful observation of the patient is
essential. If superinfection occurs during therapy, appropriate measures
should be taken. </p>

<p>The dose of Cefixime should be adjusted in patients with renal impairment
as well as those undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD)
and hemodialysis (HD). Patients on dialysis should be monitored carefully.
(See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION.) </p>

<p>Cefixime should be prescribed with caution in individuals with a history
of gastrointestinal disease, particularly colitis. </p>

<p>DRUG INTERACTIONS: No significant drug interactions have been reported
to date. </p>

<p>DRUG/LABORATORY TEST INTERACTIONS: A false-positive reaction for ketones
in the urine may occur with tests using nitroprusside but not with those
using nitroferricyanide. </p>

<p>The administration of Cefixime may result in a false-positive reaction
for glucose in the urine using Clinitest(R),** Benedict's solution, or
Fehling's solution. It is recommended that glucose tests based on enzymatic
glucose oxidase reactions (such as Clinistix(R)** or Tes-Tape(R)**) be
used. </p>

<p>A false-positive direct Coombs test has been reported during treatment
with other cephalosporin antibiotics; therefore, it should be recognized
that a positive Coombs test may be due to the drug. </p>

and Company. 
<br>---------- </p>

<p>CARCINOGENESIS, MUTAGENESIS, IMPAIRMENT OF FERTILITY: Lifetime studies
in animals to evaluate carcinogenic potential have not been conducted.
Cefixime did not cause point mutations in bacteria or mammalian cells,
DNA damage, or chromosome damage In Vitro and did not exhibit clastogenic
potential In Vivo in the mouse micronucleus test. In rats, fertility and
reproductive performance were not affected by cefixime at doses up to 125
times the adult therapeutic dose. </p>

<p>USAGE IN PREGNANCY: Pregnancy Category B: Reproduction studies have
been performed in mice and rats at doses up to 400 times the human dose
and have revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to Cefixime. There
are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because
animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response,
this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. </p>

<p>LABOR AND DELIVERY: Cefixime Cefixime has not been studied for use during
labor and delivery. Treatment should only be given if clearly needed. </p>

<p>NURSING MOTHERS: It is not known whether Cefixime is excreted in human
milk. Consideration should be given to discontinuing nursing temporarily
during treatment with this drug. </p>

<p>PEDIATRIC USE: Safety and effectiveness of Cefixime in children aged
less than 6 months old have not been established. </p>

<p>The incidence of gastrointestinal adverse reactions, including diarrhea
and loose stools, in the pediatric patients receiving the suspension, was
comparable to the incidence seen in adult patients receiving tablets. </p>

<p><a name="DRUG INTERACTIONS"></a><b>DRUG INTERACTIONS </b></p>

<p>No significant drug interactions have been reported to date. </p>

<p>(See Also PRECAUTIONS) </p>

<p><a name="ADVERSE REACTIONS"></a><b>ADVERSE REACTIONS </b></p>

<p>Most of the adverse reactions observed in clinical trials were of a
mild and transient nature. Five percent (5%) of patients in the US trials
discontinued therapy because of drug-related adverse reactions. The most
commonly seen adverse reactions in US trials of the tablet formulation
were gastrointestinal events, which were reported in 30% of adult patients
on either the bid or the qd regimen. Clinically mild gastrointestinal side
effects occurred in 20% of all patients, moderate events occurred in 9%
of all patients, and severe adverse reactions occurred in 2% of all patients.
Individual event rates included diarrhea 16%, loose or frequent stools
6%, abdominal pain 3%, nausea 7%, dyspepsia 3%, and flatulence 4%. The
incidence of gastrointestinal adverse reactions, including diarrhea and
loose stools in pediatric patients receiving the suspension was comparable
to the incidence seen in adult patients receiving tablets. </p>

<p>These symptoms usually responded to symptomatic therapy or ceased when
Cefixime was discontinued. </p>

<p>Several patients developed severe diarrhea and/or documented pseudomembranous
colitis, and a few required hospitalization. </p>

<p>The following adverse reactions have been reported following the use
of Cefixime. Incidence rates were less than 1 in 50 (less than 2%), except
as noted above for gastrointestinal events. </p>

<p>GASTROINTESTINAL: (SEE ABOVE): Diarrhea, loose stools, abdominal pain,
dyspepsia, nausea, and vomiting. Several cases of documented pseudomembranous
colitis were identified during the studies. The onset of pseudomembranous
colitis symptoms may occur during or after therapy. </p>

<p>HYPERSENSITIVITY REACTIONS: Skin rashes, urticaria, drug fever, and
pruritus. </p>

<p>Erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and serum sickness-like
reactions have been reported. </p>

<p>HEPATIC: Transient elevations in SGPT, SGOT, and alkaline phosphatase.
</p>

<p>RENAL: Transient elevations in BUN or creatinine. </p>

<p>CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM: Headaches or dizziness. </p>

<p>HEMIC AND LYMPHATIC SYSTEMS: Transient thrombocytopenia, leukopenia,
and eosinophilia. Prolongation in prothrombin time was seen rarely. </p>

<p>OTHER: Genital pruritus, vaginitis, candidiasis. </p>

<p>In addition to the adverse reactions listed above, which have been observed
in patients treated with Cefixime, the following adverse reactions and
altered laboratory tests have been reported for cephalosporin-class antibiotics:
</p>

<p>Adverse Reactions: Allergic reactions including anaphylaxis, toxic epidermal
necrolysis, superinfection, renal dysfunction, toxic nephropathy, hepatic
dysfunction including cholestasis, aplastic anemia, hemolytic anemia, hemorrhage,
and colitis. </p>

<p>Several cephalosporins have been implicated in triggering seizures,
particularly in patients with renal impairment when the dosage was not
reduced (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION and OVERDOSAGE). If seizures associated
with drug therapy occur, the drug should be discontinued. Anticonvulsant
therapy can be given if clinically indicated. </p>

<p>Abnormal Laboratory Tests: Positive direct Coombs test, elevated bilirubin,
elevated LDH, pancytopenia, neutropenia, agranulocytosis. </p>

<p><a name="OVERDOSAGE"></a><b>OVERDOSAGE </b></p>

<p>Gastric lavage may be indicated; otherwise, no specific antidote exists.
Cefixime is not removed in significant quantities from the circulation
by hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. Adverse reactions in small numbers
of healthy adult volunteers receiving single doses up to 2 g of Cefixime
did not differ from the profile seen in patients treated at the recommended
doses. </p>

<p><a name="DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION"></a>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION </p>

<p>ADULTS: The recommended dose of Cefixime is 400 mg daily. This may be
given as a 400 mg tablet daily or as a 200 mg tablet every 12 hours. For
the treatment of uncomplicated cervical/urethral gonococcal infections,
a single oral dose of 400 mg is recommended. </p>

<p>CHILDREN: The recommended dose is 8 mg/kg/day of the suspension. This
may be administered as a single daily dose or may be given in two divided
doses, as 4 mg/kg every 12 hours. </p>

<p>Children weighing more than 50 kg or older than 12 years should be treated

<p>Otitis media should be treated with the suspension. Clinical studies
of otitis media were conducted with the suspension, and the suspension
results in higher peak blood levels than the tablet when administered at
the same dose. Therefore the tablet should not be substituted for the suspension
in the treatment of otitis media (see ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY). </p>

<p>Efficacy and safety in infants aged less than 6 months have not been
established. </p>

<p>In the treatment of infections due to S Pyogenes, a therapeutic dosage
of Cefixime Cefixime should be administered for at least 10 days. </p>

<p>RENAL IMPAIRMENT: Cefixime may be administered in the presence of impaired
renal function. Normal dose and schedule may be employed in patients with
creatinine clearances of 60 mL/min or greater. Patients whose clearance
is between 21 and 60 mL/min or patients who are on renal hemodialysis may
be given 75% of the standard dosage at the standard dosing interval (ie,
300 mg daily). Patients whose clearance is &lt;20 mL/min, or patients who
are on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis may be given half the
standard dosage at the standard dosing interval (ie, 200 mg daily). Neither
hemodialysis nor peritoneal dialysis removes significant amounts of drug
from the body. </p>

<p>CLINICAL STUDIES </p>

<p>In clinical trials of otitis media in nearly 400 children between the
ages of 6 months to 10 years, Streptococcus Pneumoniae was isolated from
47% of the patients, Haemophilus Influenzae from 34%, Moraxella (Branhamella)
Catarrhalis from 15%, and Streptococcus Pyogenes from 4%. </p>

<p>The overall response rate of Streptococcus Pneumoniae to cefixime was
approximately 10% lower and that of Haemophilus Influenzae or Moraxella
(Branhamella) Catarrhalis approximately 7% higher (12% when beta-lactamase
positive strains of H Influenzae are included) than the response rates
of these organisms to the active control drugs. </p>

<p>In these studies, patients were randomized and treated with either cefixime
at dose regimens of 4 mg/kg bid or 8 mg/kg qd, or with a standard antibiotic
regimen. Sixty-nine percent to 70% of the patients in each group had resolution
of signs and symptoms of otitis media when evaluated 2 to 4 weeks posttreatment
but persistent effusion was found in 15% of the patients. When evaluated
at the completion of therapy, 17% of patients receiving cefixime and 14%
of patients receiving effective comparative drugs (18% including those
patients who had Haemophilus Influenzae resistant to the control drug and
who received the control antibiotic) were considered to be treatment failures.
By the 2- to 4- week follow-up, a total of 30% to 31% of patients had evidence
of either treatment failure or recurrent disease. </p>

<p><a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><b>DESCRIPTION </b></p>

<p>Glipizide is an oral blood-glucose-lowering drug of the sulfonylurea
class. </p>

<p>The Chemical Abstracts name of glipizide is 1-cyclohexyl-3-((p-(2-(5-
methylpyrazinecarboxamido)ethyl)phenyl)sulfonyl)urea. The molecular formula
is C21H27N5O4S; the molecular weight is 445.55. </p>

<p>Glipizide is a whitish, odorless powder with a pKa of 5.9. It is insoluble
in water and alcohols, but soluble in 0.1 N NaOH; it is freely soluble
in dimethylformamide.</p>

<p><a name="ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY"></a><b>ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
</b></p>

<p>MECHANISM OF ACTION: The primary mode of action of Glipizide in experimental
animals appears to be the stimulation of insulin secretion from the beta
cells of pancreatic islet tissue and is thus dependent on functioning beta
cells in the pancreatic islets. In humans Glipizide appears to lower the
blood glucose acutely by stimulating the release of insulin from the pancreas,
an effect dependent upon functioning beta cells in the pancreatic islets.
The mechanism by which Glipizide lowers blood glucose during long-term
administration has not been clearly established. In man, stimulation of
insulin secretion by Glipizide in response to a meal is undoubtedly of
major importance. Fasting insulin levels are not elevated even on long-term
Glipizide administration, but the postprandial insulin response continues
to be enhanced after at least 6 months of treatment. The insulinotropic
response to a meal occurs within 30 minutes after an oral dose of Glipizide
in diabetic patients, but elevated insulin levels do not persist beyond
the time of the meal challenge. Extrapancreatic effects may play a part
in the mechanism of action of oral sulfonylurea hypoglycemic drugs. </p>

<p>Blood sugar control persists in some patients for up to 24 hours after
a single dose of Glipizide, even though plasma levels have declined to
a small fraction of peak levels by that time (see Pharmacokinetics below).
</p>

<p>Some patients fail to respond initially, or gradually lose their responsiveness
to sulfonylurea drugs, including Glipizide. Alternatively, Glipizide may
be effective in some patients who have not responded or have ceased to
respond to other sulfonylureas. </p>

<p>OTHER EFFECTS: It has been shown that Glipizide therapy was effective
in controlling blood sugar without deleterious changes in the plasma lipoprotein
profiles of patients treated for NIDDM. </p>

<p>In a placebo-controlled, crossover study in normal volunteers, Glipizide
had no antidiuretic activity, and, in fact, led to a slight increase in
free water clearance. </p>

<p>PHARMACOKINETICS: Gastrointestinal absorption of Glipizide in man is
uniform, rapid, and essentially complete. Peak plasma concentrations occur
1-3 hours after a single oral dose. The half-life of elimination ranges
from 2-4 hours in normal subjects, whether given intravenously or orally.
The metabolic and excretory patterns are similar with the two routes of
administration, indicating that first-pass metabolism is not significant.
Glipizide does not accumulate in plasma on repeated oral administration.
Total absorption and disposition of an oral dose was unaffected by food
in normal volunteers, but absorption was delayed by about 40 minutes. Thus
Glipizide was more effective when administered about 30 minutes before,
rather than with, a test meal in diabetic patients. Protein binding was
studied in serum from volunteers who received either oral or intravenous
Glipizide and found to be 98-99% one hour after either route of administration.
The apparent volume of distribution of Glipizide after intravenous administration
was 11 liters, indicative of localization within the extracellular fluid
compartment. In mice no Glipizide or metabolites were detectable autoradiographically
in the brain or spinal cord of males or females, nor in the fetuses of
pregnant females. In another study, however, very small amounts of radioactivity
were detected in the fetuses of rats given labelled drug. </p>

<p>The metabolism of Glipizide is extensive and occurs mainly in the liver.
The primary metabolites are inactive hydroxylation products and polar conjugates
and are excreted mainly in the urine. Less than 10% unchanged Glipizide
is found in the urine. </p>

<p><a name="INDICATIONS AND USAGE"></a><b>INDICATIONS AND USAGE </b></p>

<p>Glipizide is indicated as an adjunct to diet for the control of hyperglycemia
and its associated symptomatology in patients with non-insulin-dependent
diabetes mellitus (NIDDM; type II), formerly known as maturity-onset diabetes,
after an adequate trial of dietary therapy has proved unsatisfactory. </p>

<p>In initiating treatment for non-insulin-dependent diabetes, diet should
be emphasized as the primary form of treatment. Caloric restriction and
weight loss are essential in the obese diabetic patient. Proper dietary
management alone may be effective in controlling the blood glucose and
symptoms of hyperglycemia. The importance of regular physical activity
should also be stressed, and cardiovascular risk factors should be identified,
and corrective measures taken where possible. </p>

<p>If this treatment program fails to reduce symptoms and/or blood glucose,
the use of an oral sulfonylurea or insulin should be considered. Use of
Glipizide must be viewed by both the physician and patient as a treatment
in addition to diet, and not as a substitute for diet or as a convenient
mechanism for avoiding dietary restraint. Furthermore, loss of blood glucose
control on diet alone also may be transient, thus requiring only short-term
administration of Glipizide. </p>

<p>During maintenance programs, Glipizide should be discontinued if satisfactory
lowering of blood glucose is no longer achieved. Judgments should be based
on regular clinical and laboratory evaluations. </p>

<p>In considering the use of Glipizide in asymptomatic patients, it should
be recognized that controlling blood glucose in non-insulin-dependent diabetes
has not been definitely established to be effective in preventing the long-term
cardiovascular or neural complications of diabetes. </p>

<p><a name="CONTRAINDICATIONS"></a><b>CONTRAINDICATIONS </b></p>

<p>Glipizide is contraindicated in patients with: </p>

<p>1. Known hypersensitivity to the drug. </p>

<p>2. Diabetic ketoacidosis, with or without coma. This condition should
be treated with insulin. </p>

<p><a name="WARNINGS"></a><b>WARNINGS </b></p>

<p>SPECIAL WARNING ON INCREASED RISK OF CARDIOVASCULAR MORTALITY: THE ADMINISTRATION
OF ORAL HYPOGLYCEMIC DRUGS HAS BEEN REPORTED TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASED
CARDIOVASCULAR MORTALITY AS COMPARED TO TREATMENT WITH DIET ALONE OR DIET
PLUS INSULIN. THIS WARNING IS BASED ON THE STUDY CONDUCTED BY THE UNIVERSITY
GROUP DIABETES PROGRAM (UGDP), A LONG-TERM PROSPECTIVE CLINICAL TRIAL DESIGNED
TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF GLUCOSE-LOWERING DRUGS IN PREVENTING OR
DELAYING VASCULAR COMPLICATIONS IN PATIENTS WITH NON-INSULIN DEPENDENT
DIABETES. THE STUDY INVOLVED 823 PATIENTS WHO WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO
ONE OF FOUR TREATMENT GROUPS (Diabetes, 19, SUPP. 2: 747-830, 1970). UGDP
REPORTED THAT PATIENTS TREATED FOR 5 TO 8 YEARS WITH DIET PLUS A FIXED
DOSE OF TOLBUTAMIDE (1.5 GRAMS PER DAY) HAD A RATE OF CARDIOVASCULAR MORTALITY
APPROXIMATELY 2 1/2 TIMES THAT OF PATIENTS TREATED WITH DIET ALONE. A SIGNIFICANT
INCREASE IN TOTAL MORTALITY WAS NOT OBSERVED, BUT THE USE OF TOLBUTAMIDE
WAS DISCONTINUED BASED ON THE INCREASE IN CARDIOVASCULAR MORTALITY, THUS
LIMITING THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THE STUDY TO SHOW AN INCREASE IN OVERALL MORTALITY.
DESPITE CONTROVERSY REGARDING THE INTERPRETATION OF THESE RESULTS, THE
FINDINGS OF THE UGDP STUDY PROVIDE AN ADEQUATE BASIS FOR THIS WARNING.
THE PATIENT SHOULD BE INFORMED OF THE POTENTIAL RISKS AND ADVANTAGES OF
Glipizide AND OF ALTERNATIVE MODES OF THERAPY. </p>

<p>ALTHOUGH ONLY ONE DRUG IN THE SULFONYLUREA CLASS (TOLBUTAMIDE) WAS INCLUDED
IN THIS STUDY, IT IS PRUDENT FROM A SAFETY STANDPOINT TO CONSIDER THAT
THIS WARNING MAY ALSO APPLY TO OTHER ORAL HYPOGLYCEMIC DRUGS IN THIS CLASS,
IN VIEW OF THEIR CLOSE SIMILARITIES IN MODE OF ACTION AND CHEMICAL STRUCTURE.
</p>

<p><a name="PRECAUTIONS"></a><b>PRECAUTIONS </b></p>

<p>GENERAL </p>

<p>RENAL AND HEPATIC DISEASE: The metabolism and excretion of Glipizide
may be slowed in patients with impaired renal and/or hepatic function.
If hypoglycemia should occur in such patients, it may be prolonged and
appropriate management should be instituted. </p>

<p>HYPOGLYCEMIA: All sulfonylurea drugs are capable of producing severe
hypoglycemia. Proper patient selection, dosage, and instructions are important
to avoid hypoglycemic episodes. Renal or hepatic insufficiency may cause
elevated blood levels of Glipizide and the latter may also diminish gluconeogenic
capacity, both of which increase the risk of serious hypoglycemic reactions.
Elderly, debilitated or malnourished patients, and those with adrenal or
pituitary insufficiency are particularly susceptible to the hypoglycemic
action of glucose-lowering drugs. Hypoglycemia may be difficult to recognize
in the elderly, and in people who are taking beta adrenergic blocking drugs.
Hypoglycemia is more likely to occur when caloric intake is deficient,
after severe or prolonged exercise, when alcohol is ingested, or when more
than one glucose-lowering drug is used. </p>

<p>LOSS OF CONTROL OF BLOOD GLUCOSE: When a patient stabilized on any diabetic
regimen is exposed to stress such as fever, trauma, infection, or surgery,
a loss of control may occur. At such times, it may be necessary to discontinue
Glipizide and administer insulin. </p>

<p>The effectiveness of any oral hypoglycemic drug, including Glipizide,
in lowering blood glucose to a desired level decreases in many patients
over a period of time, which may be due to progression of the severity
of the diabetes or to diminished responsiveness to the drug. This phenomenon
is known as secondary failure, to distinguish it from primary failure in
which the drug is ineffective in an individual patient when first given.
</p>

<p>LABORATORY TESTS: Blood and urine glucose should be monitored periodically.
Measurement of glycosylated hemoglobin may be useful. </p>

<p>INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS: Patients should be informed of the potential
risks and advantages of Glipizide and of alternative modes of therapy.
They should also be informed about the importance of adhering to dietary
instructions, of a regular exercise program, and of regular testing of
urine and/or blood glucose. </p>

<p>The risks of hypoglycemia, its symptoms and treatment, and conditions
that predispose to its development should be explained to patients and
responsible family members. Primary and secondary failure should also be
explained. </p>

<p>DRUG INTERACTIONS: The hypoglycemic action of sulfonylureas may be potentiated
by certain drugs including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, some
azoles, and other drugs that are highly protein bound, salicylates, sulfonamides,
chloramphenicol, probenecid, coumarins, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, and
beta- adrenergic blocking agents. When such drugs are administered to a
patient receiving Glipizide, the patient should be observed closely for
hypoglycemia. When such drugs are withdrawn from a patient receiving Glipizide,
the patient should be observed closely for loss of control. In Vitro binding
studies with human serum proteins indicate that Glipizide binds differently
than tolbutamide and does not interact with salicylate or dicumarol. However,
caution must be exercised in extrapolating these findings to the clinical
situation and in the use of Glipizide with these drugs. </p>

<p>Certain drugs tend to produce hyperglycemia and may lead to loss of
control. These drugs include the thiazides and other diuretics, corticosteroids,
phenothiazines, thyroid products, estrogens, oral contraceptives, phenytoin,
nicotinic acid, sympathomimetics, calcium channel blocking drugs, and isoniazid.
When such drugs are administered to a patient receiving Glipizide, the
patient should be closely observed for loss of control. When such drugs
are withdrawn from a patient receiving Glipizide, the patient should be
observed closely for hypoglycemia. </p>

<p>A potential interaction between oral miconazole and oral hypoglycemic
agents leading to severe hypoglycemia has been reported. Whether this interaction
also occurs with the intravenous, topical, or vaginal preparations of miconazole
is not known. The effect of concomitant administration of DIFLUCAN (fluconazole)
and Glipizide has been demonstrated in a placebo-controlled crossover study
in normal volunteers. All subjects received Glipizide alone and following
treatment of 100 mg of DIFLUCAN as a single daily oral dose for 7 days.
The mean percentage increase in the Glipizide AUC after fluconazole administration
was 56.9% (range: 35 to 81). </p>

<p>CARCINOGENESIS, MUTAGENESIS, IMPAIRMENT OF FERTILITY: A twenty month
study in rats and an eighteen month study in mice at doses up to 75 times
the maximum human dose revealed no evidence of drug-related carcinogenicity.
Bacterial and In Vivo mutagenicity tests were uniformly negative. Studies
in rats of both sexes at doses up to 75 times the human dose showed no
effects on fertility. </p>

<p>PREGNANCY: Pregnancy Category C: Glipizide was found to be mildly fetotoxic
in rat reproductive studies at all dose levels (5-50 mg/kg). This fetotoxicity
has been similarly noted with other sulfonylureas, such as tolbutamide
and tolazamide. The effect is perinatal and believed to be directly related
to the pharmacologic (hypoglycemic) action of Glipizide. In studies in
rats and rabbits no teratogenic effects were found. There are no adequate
and well controlled studies in pregnant women. Glipizide should be used
during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential
risk to the fetus. </p>

<p>Because recent information suggests that abnormal blood glucose levels
during pregnancy are associated with a higher incidence of congenital abnormalities,
many experts recommend that insulin be used during pregnancy to maintain
blood glucose levels as close to normal as possible. </p>

<p>NONTERATOGENIC EFFECTS: Prolonged severe hypoglycemia (4 to 10 days)
has been reported in neonates born to mothers who were receiving a sulfonylurea
drug at the time of delivery. This has been reported more frequently with
the use of agents with prolonged half-lives. If Glipizide is used during
pregnancy, it should be discontinued at least one month before the expected
delivery date. </p>

<p>NURSING MOTHERS: Although it is not known whether Glipizide is excreted
in human milk, some sulfonylurea drugs are known to be excreted in human
milk. </p>

<p>Because the potential for hypoglycemia in nursing infants may exist,
a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue
the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.
If the drug is discontinued and if diet alone is inadequate for controlling
blood glucose, insulin therapy should be considered. </p>

<p>PEDIATRIC USE: Safety and effectiveness in children have not been established.

The mean percentage increase in the Glipizide AUC after fluconazole administration
was 56.9% (range: 35 to 81). </p>

<p>(See Also PRECAUTIONS) </p>

<p><a name="ADVERSE REACTIONS"></a><b>ADVERSE REACTIONS </b></p>

<p>In U.S. and foreign controlled studies, the frequency of serious adverse
reactions reported was very low. Of 702 patients, 11.8% reported adverse
reactions and in only 1.5% was Glipizide discontinued. </p>

<p>HYPOGLYCEMIA: See PRECAUTIONS and OVERDOSAGE sections. </p>

<p>GASTROINTESTINAL: Gastrointestinal disturbances are the most common
reactions. Gastrointestinal complaints were reported with the following
approximate incidence: nausea and diarrhea, one in seventy; constipation
and gastralgia, one in one hundred. They appear to be dose-related and
may disappear on division or reduction of dosage. Cholestatic jaundice
may occur rarely with sulfonylureas: Glipizide should be discontinued if
this occurs. </p>

<p>DERMATOLOGIC: Allergic skin reactions including erythema, morbilliform
or maculopapular eruptions, urticaria, pruritus, and eczema have been reported
in about one in seventy patients. These may be transient and may disappear
despite continued use of Glipizide; if skin reactions persist, the drug
should be discontinued. Porphyria cutanea tarda and photosensitivity reactions
have been reported with sulfonylureas. </p>

<p>HEMATOLOGIC: Leukopenia, agranulocytosis, thrombocytopenia, hemolytic
anemia, aplastic anemia, and pancytopenia have been reported with sulfonylureas.
</p>

<p>METABOLIC: Hepatic porphyria and disulfiram-like reactions have been
reported with sulfonylureas. In the mouse, Glipizide pretreatment did not
cause an accumulation of acetaldehyde after ethanol administration. Clinical
experience to date has shown that Glipizide has an extremely low incidence
of disulfiram- like alcohol reactions. </p>

<p>ENDOCRINE REACTIONS: Cases of hyponatremia and the syndrome of inappropriate
antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) secretion have been reported with this and
other sulfonylureas. </p>

<p>MISCELLANEOUS: Dizziness, drowsiness, and headache have each been reported
in about one in fifty patients treated with Glipizide. They are usually
transient and seldom require discontinuance of therapy. </p>

<p>LABORATORY TESTS: The pattern of laboratory test abnormalities observed
with Glipizide was similar to that for other sulfonylureas. Occasional
mild to moderate elevations of SGOT, LDH, alkaline phosphatase, BUN and
creatinine were noted. One case of jaundice was reported. The relationship
of these abnormalities to Glipizide is uncertain, and they have rarely
been associated with clinical symptoms. </p>

<p><a name="OVERDOSAGE"></a><b>OVERDOSAGE </b></p>

<p>There is no well documented experience with Glipizide overdosage. The
acute oral toxicity was extremely low in all species tested (LD50 greater
than 4 g/kg). </p>

<p>Overdosage of sulfonylureas including Glipizide can produce hypoglycemia.
Mild hypoglycemic symptoms without loss of consciousness or neurologic
findings should be treated aggressively with oral glucose and adjustments
in drug dosage and/or meal patterns. Close monitoring should continue until
the physician is assured that the patient is out of danger. Severe hypoglycemic
reactions with coma, seizure, or other neurological impairment occur infrequently,
but constitute medical emergencies requiring immediate hospitalization.
If hypoglycemic coma is diagnosed or suspected, the patient should be given
a rapid intravenous injection of concentrated (50%) glucose solution. This
should be followed by a continuous infusion of a more dilute (10%) glucose
solution at a rate that will maintain the blood glucose at a level above
100 mg/dL. Patients should be closely monitored for a minimum of 24 to
48 hours since hypoglycemia may recur after apparent clinical recovery.
Clearance of Glipizide from plasma would be prolonged in persons with liver
disease. Because of the extensive protein binding of Glipizide, dialysis
is unlikely to be of benefit. </p>

<p><a name="DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION"></a><b>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
</b></p>

<p>There is no fixed dosage regimen for the management of diabetes mellitus
with Glipizide or any other hypoglycemic agent. In addition to the usual
monitoring of urinary glucose, the patient's blood glucose must also be
monitored periodically to determine the minimum effective dose for the
patient; to detect primary failure, i.e., inadequate lowering of blood
glucose at the maximum recommended dose of medication; and to detect secondary
failure, i.e., loss of an adequate blood-glucose-lowering response after
an initial period of effectiveness. Glycosylated hemoglobin levels may
also be of value in monitoring the patient's response to therapy. </p>

<p>Short-term administration of Glipizide may be sufficient during periods
of transient loss of control in patients usually controlled well on diet.
</p>

<p>In general, Glipizide should be given approximately 30 minutes before
a meal to achieve the greatest reduction in postprandial hyperglycemia.
</p>

<p>INITIAL DOSE: The recommended starting dose is 5 mg, given before breakfast.
Geriatric patients or those with liver disease may be started on 2.5 mg.
</p>

<p>TITRATION: Dosage adjustments should ordinarily be in increments of
2.5-5 mg, as determined by blood glucose response. At least several days
should elapse between titration steps. If response to a single dose is
not satisfactory, dividing that dose may prove effective. The maximum recommended
once daily dose is 15 mg. Doses above 15 mg should ordinarily be divided
and given before meals of adequate caloric content. The maximum recommended
total daily dose is 40 mg. </p>

<p>MAINTENANCE: Some patients may be effectively controlled on a once-a-day
regimen, while others show better response with divided dosing. Total daily
doses above 15 mg should ordinarily be divided. Total daily doses above
30 mg have been safely given on a b.i.d. basis to long-term patients. </p>

<p>In elderly patients, debilitated or malnourished patients, and patients
with impaired renal or hepatic function, the initial and maintenance dosing
should be conservative to avoid hypoglycemic reactions (see PRECAUTIONS
section). </p>

<p>PATIENTS RECEIVING INSULIN: As with other sulfonylurea-class hypoglycemics,
many stable non-insulin-dependent diabetic patients receiving insulin may
be safely placed on Glipizide. When transferring patients from insulin
to Glipizide, the following general guidelines should be considered: </p>

<p>For patients whose daily insulin requirement is 20 units or less, insulin
may be discontinued and Glipizide therapy may begin at usual dosages. Several
days should elapse between Glipizide titration steps. </p>

<p>For patients whose daily insulin requirement is greater than 20 units,
the insulin dose should be reduced by 50% and Glipizide therapy may begin
at usual dosages. Subsequent reductions in insulin dosage should depend
on individual patient response. Several days should elapse between Glipizide
titration steps. </p>

<p>During the insulin withdrawal period, the patient should test urine
samples for sugar and ketone bodies at least three times daily. Patients
should be instructed to contact the prescriber immediately if these tests
are abnormal. In some cases, especially when patient has been receiving
greater than 40 units of insulin daily, it may be advisable to consider
hospitalization during the transition period. </p>

<p>PATIENTS RECEIVING OTHER ORAL HYPOGLYCEMIC AGENTS: As with other sulfonylurea-
class hypoglycemics, no transition period is necessary when transferring
patients to Glipizide. Patients should be observed carefully (1-2 weeks)
for hypoglycemia when being transferred from longer half-life sulfonylureas
(e.g., chlorpropamide) to Glipizide due to potential overlapping of drug
effect. </p>

<p><a name="ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY"></a><b>ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
</b></p>

<p>Butalbital compound with Codeine is a combination drug product intended
as a treatment for tension headache. </p>

<p>Butalbital compound consists of a fixed combination of caffeine 40 mg,
butalbital 50 mg and aspirin 325 mg. The role each component plays in the
relief of the complex of symptoms known as tension headache is incompletely
understood. </p>

<p>PHARMACOKINETICS </p>

<p>Bioavailability: The bioavailability of the components of the fixed
combination of Butalbital compound with Codeine is identical to their bioavailability
when Butalbital compound and Codeine are administered separately in equivalent
molar doses. The behavior of the individual components is described below.
</p>

<p>ASPIRIN </p>

<p>The systemic availability of aspirin after an oral dose is highly dependent
on the dosage form, the presence of food, the gastric emptying time, gastric
pH, antacids, buffering agents, and particle size. These factors affect
not necessarily the extent of absorption of total salicylates but more
the stability of aspirin prior to absorption. </p>

<p>During the absorption process and after absorption, aspirin is mainly
hydrolyzed to salicylic acid and distributed to all body tissues and fluids,
including fetal tissues, breast milk, and the central nervous system (CNS).
Highest concentrations are found in plasma, liver, renal cortex, heart,
and lung. In plasma, about 50%-80% of the salicylic acid and its metabolites
are loosely bound to plasma proteins. </p>

<p>The clearance of total salicylates is subject to saturable kinetics;
however, first-order elimination kinetics are still a good approximation
for doses up to 650 mg. The plasma half-life for aspirin is about 12 minutes
and for salicylic acid and/or total salicylates is about 3.0 hours. </p>

<p>The elimination of therapeutic doses is through the kidneys either as
salicylic acid or other biotransformation products. The renal clearance
is greatly augmented by an alkaline urine as is produced by concurrent
administration of sodium bicarbonate or potassium citrate. </p>

<p>The biotransformation of aspirin occurs primarily in the hepatocytes.
The major metabolites are salicyluric acid (75%), the phenolic and acyl
glucuronides of salicylate (15%), and gentisic and gentisuric acid (1%).
The bioavailability of the aspirin component of Butalbital compound with
Codeine capsules is equivalent to that of a solution except for a slower
rate of absorption. A peak concentration of 8.80 mcgm/mL was obtained at
40 minutes after a 650 mg dose. </p>

<p>See OVERDOSAGE for toxicity information. </p>

<p>CODEINE </p>

<p>Codeine is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. It is rapidly
distributed from the intravascular spaces to the various body tissues,
with preferential uptake by parenchymatous organs such as the liver, spleen,
and kidney. Codeine crosses the blood-brain barrier, and is found in fetal
tissue and breast milk. Codeine is not bound to plasma proteins and does
not accumulate in body tissues. </p>

<p>The plasma half-life is about 2.9 hours. The elimination of codeine
is primarily via the kidneys, and about 90% of an oral dose is excreted
by the kidneys within 24 hours of dosing. The urinary secretion products
consist of free and glucuronide-conjugated codeine (about 70%), free and
conjugated norcodeine (about 10%), free and conjugated morphine (about
10%), normorphine (4%), and hydrocodone (1%). The remainder of the dose
is excreted in the feces. </p>

<p>At therapeutic doses, the analgesic effect reaches a peak within 2 hours
and persists between 4 and 6 hours. </p>

<p>The bioavailability of the codeine component of Butalbital compound
with Codeine capsules is equivalent to that of a solution. Peak concentrations
of 198 ng/mL were obtained at 1 hour after a 60 mg dose. </p>

<p>See OVERDOSAGE for toxicity information. </p>

<p>BUTALBITAL </p>

<p>Butalbital is well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and is expected
to distribute to most of the tissues in the body. Barbiturates, in general,
may appear in milk and readily cross the placental barrier. They are bound
to plasma and tissue proteins to a varying degree and binding increases
directly as a function of lipid solubility. </p>

<p>Elimination of butalbital is primarily via the kidney (59%-88% of the
dose) as unchanged drug or metabolites. The plasma half-life is about 35
hours. Urinary excretion products included parent drug (about 3.6% of the
dose), 5-isobutyl-5- (2,3-dihydroxypropyl) barbituric acid (about 24% of
the dose), 5-allyl-5(3- hydroxy-2-methyl-1-propyl) barbituric acid (about
4.8% of the dose), products with the barbituric acid ring hydrolyzed with
excretion of urea (about 14% of the dose), as well as unidentified materials.
Of the material excreted in the urine, 32% was conjugated. </p>

<p>The bioavailability of the butalbital component of Butalbital compound
with Codeine capsules is equivalent to that of a solution except for a
decrease in the rate of absorption. A peak concentration of 2020 ng/mL
is obtained at about 1.5 hours after a 100 mg dose. </p>

<p>See OVERDOSAGE for toxicity information. </p>

<p>CAFFEINE </p>

<p>Like most xanthines, caffeine is rapidly absorbed and distributed in
all body tissues and fluids, including the CNS, fetal tissues, and breast
milk. </p>

<p>Caffeine is cleared rapidly through metabolism and excretion in the
urine. The plasma half-life is about 3 hours. Hepatic biotransformation
prior to excretion results in about equal amounts of 1-methyl-xanthine
and 1-methyluric acid. Of the 70% of the dose that has been recovered in
the urine, only 3% was unchanged drug. </p>

<p>The bioavailability of the caffeine component for Butalbital compound
with Codeine capsules is equivalent to that of a solution except for a
slightly longer time to peak. A peak concentration of 1660 ng/mL was obtained
in less than an hour for an 80 mg dose. </p>

<p>See OVERDOSAGE for toxicity information. </p>

<p><a name="INDICATIONS AND USAGE"></a><b>INDICATIONS AND USAGE </b></p>

<p>Butalbital compound with Codeine is indicated for the relief of the
symptom complex of tension (or muscle contraction) headache. </p>

<p>Evidence supporting the efficacy of Butalbital compound with Codeine
is derived from 2 multi-clinic trials that compared patients with tension
headache randomly assigned to 4 parallel treatments: Butalbital compound
with Codeine, codeine, Butalbital compound, and placebo. Response was assessed
over the course of the first 4 hours of each of 2 distinct headaches, separated
by at least 24 hours. Butalbital compound with Codeine proved statistically
significantly superior to each of its components (Butalbital compound,
codeine) and to placebo on measures of pain relief. </p>

<p>Evidence supporting the efficacy and safety of Butalbital compound with
Codeine in the treatment of multiple recurrent headaches is unavailable.
Caution in this regard is required because codeine and butalbital are habit-forming
and potentially abusable. </p>

<p><a name="CONTRAINDICATIONS"></a><b>CONTRAINDICATIONS </b></p>

<p>Butalbital compound with Codeine is contraindicated under the following
conditions: </p>

<p>1. Hypersensitivity or intolerance to aspirin, caffeine, butalbital
or codeine. </p>

<p>2. Patients with a hemorrhagic diathesis (e.g., hemophilia, hypoprothrombinemia
von Willebrand's disease, the thrombocytopenias, thrombasthenia and other
ill- defined hereditary platelet dysfunctions, severe vitamin K deficiency
and severe liver damage.) </p>

<p>3. Patients with the syndrome of nasal polyps, angioedema and bronchospastic
reactivity to aspirin or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Anaphylactoid
reactions have occurred in such patients. </p>

<p>4. Peptic ulcer or other serious gastrointestinal lesions. </p>

<p>5. Patients with porphyria. </p>

<p><a name="WARNINGS"></a><b>WARNINGS </b></p>

<p>Therapeutic doses of aspirin can cause anaphylactic shock and other
severe allergic reactions. It should be ascertained if the patient is allergic
to aspirin, although a specific history of allergy may be lacking. </p>

<p>Significant bleeding can result from aspirin therapy in patients with
peptic ulcer or other gastrointestinal lesions, and in patients with bleeding
disorders. </p>

<p>Aspirin administered pre-operatively may prolong the bleeding time.
</p>

<p>In the presence of head injury or other intracranial lesions, the respiratory
depressant effects of codeine and other narcotics may be markedly enhanced,
as well as their capacity for elevating cerebrospinal fluid pressure. Narcotics
also produce other CNS depressant effects, such as drowsiness, that may
further obscure the clinical course of patients with head injuries. </p>

<p>Codeine or other narcotics may obscure signs on which to judge the diagnosis
or clinical course of patients with acute abdominal conditions. </p>

<p>Butalbital and codeine are both habit-forming and potentially abusable.
Consequently, the extended use of Butalbital compound with Codeine is not
recommended. </p>

<p>Results from epidemiologic studies indicate an association between aspirin
and Reye Syndrome. Caution should be used in administering this product
to children including teenagers, with chicken pox or flu. </p>

<p><a name="PRECAUTIONS"></a><b>PRECAUTIONS </b></p>

<p>GENERAL </p>

<p>Butalbital compound with Codeine should be prescribed with caution for
certain special- risk patients such as the elderly or debilitated, and
those with severe impairment of renal or hepatic function, coagulation
disorders, or head injuries. </p>

<p>Aspirin should be used with caution in patients on anticoagulant therapy
and in patients with underlying hemostatic defects. </p>

<p>Precautions should be taken when administering salicylates to persons
with known allergies. Hypersensitivity to aspirin is particularly likely
in patients with nasal polyps, and relatively common in those with asthma.
</p>

<p>INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS </p>

<p>Patients should be informed that Butalbital compound with Codeine contains
aspirin and should not be taken by patients with an aspirin allergy. </p>

<p>Butalbital compound with Codeine may impair the mental and/or physical
abilities required for performance of potentially hazardous tasks such
as driving a car or operating machinery. Such tasks should be avoided while
taking Butalbital compound with Codeine. </p>

<p>Alcohol and other CNS depressants may produce an additive CNS depression
when taken with Butalbital compound with Codeine, and should be avoided.
</p>

<p>Codeine and butalbital may be habit-forming. Patients should take the
drug only for as long as it is prescribed, in the amounts prescribed, and
no more frequently than prescribed. </p>

<p>LABORATORY TESTS </p>

<p>In patients with severe hepatic or renal disease, effects of therapy
should be monitored with serial liver and/or renal function tests. </p>

<p>DRUG INTERACTIONS </p>

<p>The CNS effects of butalbital may be enhanced by monoamine oxidase (MAO)
inhibitors. </p>

<p>In patients receiving concomitant corticosteroids and chronic use of
aspirin, withdrawal of corticosteroids may result in salicylism because
corticosteroids enhance renal clearance of salicylates and their withdrawal
is followed by return to normal rates of renal clearance. </p>

<p>Butalbital compound with Codeine may enhance the effects of: </p>

<p>1. Oral anticoagulants, causing bleeding by inhibiting prothrombin formation
in the liver and displacing anticoagulants from plasma protein binding
sites. </p>

<p>2. Oral antidiabetic agents and insulin, causing hypoglycemia by contributing
an additive effect, if dosage of Butalbital compound with Codeine exceeds
maximum recommended daily dosage. </p>

<p>3. 6-mercaptopurine and methotrexate, causing bone marrow toxicity and
blood dyscrasias by displacing these drugs from secondary binding sites,
and, in the case of methotrexate, also reducing its excretion. </p>

<p>4. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, increasing the risk of peptic
ulceration and bleeding by contributing additive effects. </p>

<p>5. Other narcotic analgesics, alcohol, general anesthetics, tranquilizers
such as chlordiazepoxide, sedative-hypnotics, or other CNS depressants,
causing increased CNS depression. </p>

<p>Butalbital compound with Codeine may diminish the effects of: </p>

<p>Uricosuric agents such as probenecid and sulfinpyrazone, reducing their
effectiveness in the treatment of gout. Aspirin competes with these agents
for protein binding sites. </p>

<p>DRUG/LABORATORY TEST INTERACTIONS </p>

<p>Aspirin: Aspirin may interfere with the following laboratory determinations
in blood: serum amylase, fasting blood glucose, cholesterol, protein, serum
glutamic-oxalacetic transaminase (SGOT), uric acid, prothrombin time and
bleeding time. Aspirin may interfere with the following laboratory determinations
in urine: glucose, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid, Gerhardt ketone, vanillylmandelic
acid (VMA), uric acid, diacetic acid, and spectrophotometric detection
of barbiturates. </p>

<p>Codeine: Codeine may increase serum amylase levels. </p>

<p>CARCINOGENESIS, MUTAGENESIS, IMPAIRMENT OF FERTILITY </p>

<p>Adequate long-term studies have been conducted in mice and rats with
aspirin, alone or in combination with other drugs, in which no evidence
of carcinogenesis was seen. No adequate studies have been conducted in
animals to determine whether aspirin has a potential for mutagenesis or
impairment of fertility. No adequate studies have been conducted in animals
to determine whether butalbital has a potential for carcinogenesis, mutagenesis,
or impairment of fertility. </p>

<p>USAGE IN PREGNANCY </p>

<p>Teratogenic Effects: </p>

<p>Pregnancy Category C. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted
with Butalbital compound with Codeine. It is also not known whether Butalbital
compound with Codeine can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant
woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Butalbital compound with Codeine
should be given to a pregnant woman only when clearly needed. </p>

<p>Nonteratogenic Effects: </p>

<p>Although Butalbital compound with Codeine was not implicated in the
birth defect, a female infant was born with lissencephaly, pachygyria and
heterotopic gray matter. The infant was born 8 weeks prematurely to a woman
who had taken an average of 90 Butalbital compound with Codeine capsules
each month from the first few days of pregnancy. The child's development
was mildly delayed and from one year of age she had partial simple motor
seizures. </p>

<p>Withdrawal seizures were reported in a two-day-old male infant whose
mother had taken a butalbital-containing drug during the last 2 months
of pregnancy. Butalbital was found in the infant's serum. The infant was
given phenobarbital 5mg/kg, which was tapered without further seizure or
other withdrawal symptoms. </p>

<p>Studies of aspirin use in pregnant women have not shown that aspirin
increases the risk of abnormalities when administered during the first
trimester of pregnancy. In controlled studies involving 41,337 pregnant
women and their offspring, there was no evidence that aspirin taken during
pregnancy caused stillbirth, neonatal death or reduced birth weight. In
controlled studies of 50 282 pregnant women and their offspring, aspirin
administration in moderate and heavy doses during the first four lunar
months of pregnancy showed no teratogenic effect. </p>

<p>Reproduction studies have been performed in rabbits and rats at doses
up to 150 times the human dose and have revealed no evidence of impaired
fertility or harm to the fetus due to codeine. </p>

<p>Therapeutic doses of aspirin in pregnant women close to term may cause
bleeding in mother, fetus, or neonate. During the last 6 months of pregnancy,
regular use of aspirin in high doses may prolong pregnancy and delivery.
</p>

<p>LABOR AND DELIVERY </p>

<p>Ingestion of aspirin prior to delivery may prolong delivery or lead
to bleeding in the mother or neonate. Use of codeine during labor may lead
to respiratory depression in the neonate. </p>

<p>NURSING MOTHERS </p>

<p>Aspirin, caffeine, barbiturates and codeine are excreted in breast milk
in small amounts, but the significance of their effects on nursing infants
is not known. Because of potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing
infants from Butalbital compound with Codeine, a decision should be made
whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into
account the importance of the drug to the mother. </p>

<p>PEDIATRIC USE </p>

<p>Safety and effectiveness in children below the age of 12 have not been
established. </p>

<p><a name="DRUG INTERACTIONS"></a><b>DRUG INTERACTIONS </b></p>

<p>The CNS effects of butalbital may be enhanced by monoamine oxidase (MAO)

<p>DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE </p>

<p>Butalbital compound with Codeine is controlled by the Drug Enforcement
Administration and is classified under Schedule III. </p>

<p>CODEINE </p>

<p>Codeine can produce drug dependence of the morphine type and, therefore,
has the potential for being abused. Psychological dependence, physical
dependence, and tolerance may develop upon repeated administration and
it should be prescribed and administered with the same degree of caution
appropriate to the use of other oral narcotic medications. </p>

<p>BUTALBITAL </p>

<p>Barbiturates May Be Habit Forming: Tolerance, psychological dependence,
and physical dependence may occur especially following prolonged use of
high doses of barbiturates. The average daily dose for the barbiturate
addict is usually about 1,500 mg. As tolerance to barbiturates develops,
the amount needed to maintain the same level of intoxication increases;
tolerance to a fatal dosage, however, does not increase more than two-fold.
As this occurs, the margin between an intoxication dosage and fatal dosage
becomes smaller. The lethal dose of a barbiturate is far less if alcohol
is also ingested. Major withdrawal symptoms (convulsions and delirium)
may occur within 16 hours and last up to 5 days after abrupt cessation
of these drugs. Intensity of withdrawal symptoms gradually declines over
a period of approximately 15 days. Treatment of barbiturate dependence
consists of cautious and gradual withdrawal of the drug. Barbiturate-dependent
patients can be withdrawn by using a number of different withdrawal regimens.
One method involves initiating treatment at the patient's regular dosage
level and gradually decreasing the daily dosage as tolerated by the patient.

<p><a name="OVERDOSAGE"></a><b>OVERDOSAGE </b></p>

<p>The toxic effects of acute overdosage of Butalbital compound with Codeine
capsules are attributable mainly to the barbiturate and codeine components,
and, to a lesser extent, aspirin. Because toxic effects of caffeine occur
in very high dosages only, the possibility of significant caffeine toxicity
from Butalbital compound with Codeine overdosage is unlikely. </p>

<p>SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS </p>

<p>Symptoms attributable to Acute Barbiturate Poisoning include drowsiness,
confusion, and coma; respiratory depression; hypotension; shock. Symptoms
attributable to Acute Aspirin Poisoning include hyperpnea; acid-base disturbances
with development of metabolic acidosis; vomiting and abdominal pain; tinnitus,
hyperthermia; hypoprothrombinemia; restlessness; delirium; convulsions.
Acute Caffeine Poisoning may cause insomnia, restlessness, tremor, and
delirium; tachycardia and extrasystoles. Symptoms of Acute Codeine Poisoning
include the triad of: pinpoint pupils, marked depression of respiration,
and loss of consciousness. Convulsions may occur. </p>

<p>TREATMENT </p>

<p>The following paragraphs describe one approach to the treatment of overdose
with Butalbital compound with Codeine. However, because strategies for
the management of an overdose continually evolve, consultation with a regional
poison control center is strongly encouraged. </p>

<p>Treatment consists primarily of management of barbiturate intoxication,
reversal of the effects of codeine, and the correction of the acid-base
imbalance due to salicylism. Vomiting should be induced mechanically or
with emetics in the conscious patient. Gastric lavage may be used if the
pharyngeal and laryngeal reflexes are present and if less than 4 hours
have elapsed since ingestion. A cuffed endotracheal tube should be inserted
before gastric lavage of the unconscious patient and when necessary to
provide assisted respiration. Diuresis, alkalinization of the urine, and
correction of electrolyte disturbances should be accomplished through administration
of intravenous fluids such as 1% sodium bicarbonate and 5% dextrose in
water. </p>

<p>Meticulous attention should be given to maintaining adequate pulmonary
ventilation. Correction of hypotension may require the administration of
levarterenol bitartrate or phenylephrine hydrochloride by intravenous infusion.
In severe cases of intoxication, peritoneal dialysis, hemodialysis, or
exchange transfusion may be lifesaving. Hypoprothrombinemia should be treated
with vitamin K, intravenously. </p>

<p>Methemoglobinemia over 30% should be treated with methylene blue by
slow intravenous administration. </p>

<p>Naloxone, a narcotic antagonist, can reverse respiratory depression
and coma associated with opioid overdose. Typically, a dose of 0.4 mg to
2 mg is given parenterally and may be repeated if an adequate response
is not achieved. Since the duration of action of codeine may exceed that
of the antagonist, the patient should be kept under continued surveillance
and repeated doses of the antagonist should be administered as needed to
maintain adequate respiration. A narcotic antagonist should not be administered
in the absence of clinically significant respiratory or cardiovascular
depression. </p>

 <a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><b>DESCRIPTION 
</b> <p>
WARNING
 <p>
ESTROGENS HAVE BEEN REPORTED TO INCREASE THE RISK OF ENDOMETRIAL CARCINOMA.  
 <p>
Three independent case control studies have reported an increased risk of
endometrial cancer in postmenopausal women exposed to exogenous estrogens for
more than 1 year. This risk was independent of the other known risk factors for 
endometrial cancer. These studies are further supported by the finding that
incidence rates of endometrial cancer have increased sharply since 1969 in
eight different areas of the United States with population-based cancer
reporting systems, an increase which may be related to the rapidly expanding
use of estrogens during the last decade.  
 <p>
The three case control studies reported that the risk of endometrial cancer in
estrogen users was about 4.5-13.9 times greater than in nonusers. The risk
appears to depend both on duration of treatment and on estrogen dose. In view
of these findings, when estrogens are used for the treatment of menopausal
symptoms, the lowest dose that will control symptoms should be utilized and
medication should be discontinued as soon as possible. When prolonged treatment 
is medically indicated, the patient should be reassessed on at least a
semiannual basis to determine the need for continued therapy. Although the
evidence must be considered preliminary, one study suggests that cyclic
administration of low doses of estrogen may carry less risk than continuous
administration; it therefore appears prudent to utilize such a regimen.  
 <p>
Close clinical surveillance of all women taking estrogens is important. In all
cases of undiagnosed persistent or recurring abnormal vaginal bleeding,
adequate diagnostic measures should be undertaken to rule out malignancy.  
 <p>
There is no evidence at present that &quot;natural&quot; estrogens are more or less
hazardous than &quot;synthetic&quot; estrogens at equiestrogenic doses.  
 <p>
ESTROGENS SHOULD NOT BE USED DURING PREGNANCY.  
 <p>
The use of female sex hormones, both estrogens and progestogens, during early
pregnancy may seriously damage the offspring. It has been shown that women who
had been exposed In Utero to diethylstilbestrol, a nonsteroidal estrogen, have
an increased risk of developing in later life a form of vaginal or cervical
cancer that is ordinarily extremely rare. This risk has been estimated as not
greater than 4 per 1000 exposures. Furthermore, a high percentage of such
exposed women (30-90%) have been found to have vaginal adenosis, epithelial
changes of the vagina and cervix. Although these changes are histologically
benign, it is not known whether they are precursors of malignancy. Although
similar data on the use of other estrogens are not available, it cannot be
presumed they would not induce similar changes.  
 <p>
Several reports suggest an association between intrauterine exposure to female
sex hormones and congenital anomalies, including congenital heart defects and
limb-reduction defects. One case control study estimated a 4.7-fold increased
risk of limb-reduction defects in infants who had been exposed In Utero to sex
hormones (oral contraceptives, hormone withdrawal tests for pregnancy, or
attempted treatment for threatened abortion). Some of these exposures were very 
short and involved only a few days of treatment. The data suggest that the risk 
of limb-reduction defects in exposed fetuses is somewhat less than 1 per 1000.  
 <p>
In the past, female sex hormones have been used during pregnancy in an attempt
to treat threatened or habitual abortion. There is considerable evidence that
estrogens are ineffective for these indications, and there is no evidence from
well-controlled studies that progestogens are effective for these uses.  
 <p>
If estradiol (transdermal) is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while 
taking this drug, she should be apprised of the potential risks to the fetus
and of the advisability of continuation of the pregnancy.  
 
 <p>
Estradiol (transdermal) is designed to release 17beta
estradiol through a rate-limiting membrane continuously upon application to
intact skin.  
 <p>
Estradiol USP (17beta-estradiol) is a white, crystalline powder, chemically
described as estra-1,3,5(10)-triene-3, 17beta-diol.  
 <p>
<a name="ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY"></a><b>ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 
</b> <p>
The Estradiol (transdermal) system releases estradiol, the major estrogenic hormone secreted
by the human ovary. Estradiol (transdermal) provides systemic estrogen replacement therapy. 
Among numerous effects, estradiol is largely responsible for the development
and maintenance of the female reproductive system and of secondary sexual
characteristics. It promotes growth and development of the vagina, uterus,
fallopian tubes, and breasts. Indirectly, estradiol contributes to the shaping
of the skeleton, to the maintenance of tone and elasticity of urogenital
structures, to changes in the epiphyses of the long bones that allow for the
pubertal growth spurt and its termination, to the growth of axillary and pubic
hair, and to the pigmentation of the nipples and genitals.  
 <p>
In the anovulatory cycle estrogen is the primary determinant in the onset of
menstruation. Estradiol also affects the release of pituitary gonadotropins.  
 <p>
Loss of ovarian estradiol secretion after menopause can result in instability
of thermoregulation, causing hot flushes associated with sleep disturbance and
excessive sweating, and urogenital atrophy, causing dyspareunia and urinary
incontinence. Estradiol replacement therapy alleviates many of these symptoms
of estradiol deficiency in the menopausal woman.  
 <p>
Orally administered estradiol is rapidly metabolized by the liver to estrone
and its conjugates, giving rise to higher circulating levels of estrone than
estradiol. In contrast, the skin metabolizes estradiol only to a small extent.  
Therefore, transdermal administration produces therapeutic serum levels of
estradiol with lower circulating levels of estrone and estrone conjugates, and
requires smaller total doses than does oral therapy. Because estradiol has a
short half-life (approximately 1 hour), transdermal administration of estradiol 
allows a rapid decline in blood levels after an Estradiol (transdermal) system is removed,
e.g., in a cycling regimen.  
 <p>
In a study using transdermally administered estradiol, 0.1 mg daily, plasma
levels increased by 66 pg/ml resulting in an average plasma level of 73 pg/ml.  
There were no significant increases in the concentration of renin substrate or
other hepatic proteins (sex-hormone-binding globulin, thyroxine-binding
globulin and corticosteroid-binding globulin).  
 <p>
PHARMACOKINETICS 
 <p>
Administration of Estradiol (transdermal) produces mean serum concentrations of estradiol
comparable to those produced by a daily oral administration of estradiol at
about 20 times the daily transdermal dose. In single-application studies in 14
postmenopausal women using Estradiol (transdermal) systems that provided 0.05 and 0.1 mg of
exogenous estradiol per day, these systems produced increased blood levels
within 4 hours and maintained respective mean serum estradiol concentrations of 
32 and 67 pg/ml above baseline over the application period. At the same time,
increases in estrone serum concentration averaged only 9 and 27 pg/ml above
baseline, respectively. Serum concentrations of estradiol and estrone returned
to preapplication levels within 24 hours after removal of the system. The
estimated daily urinary output of estradiol conjugates increased 5 to 10 times
the baseline values and returned to near baseline within 2 days after removal
of the system.  
 <p>
By comparison, estradiol (2 mg per day) administered orally to postmenopausal
women resulted in increases in mean serum concentration of 59 pg/ml of
estradiol and 302 pg/ml of estrone above baseline on the third consecutive day
of dosing.  Urinary output of estradiol conjugates after oral administration
increased to about 100 times the baseline values and did not approach baseline
until 7-8 days after the last dose.  
 <p>
In a 3-week multiple-application study of 14 postmenopausal women in which
Estradiol (transdermal) 0.05 was applied twice weekly, the mean increments in steady-state
serum concentration were 30 pg/ml for estradiol and 12 pg/ml for estrone. 
Urinary output of estradiol conjugates returned to baseline within 3 days after 
removal of the last (6th) system, indicating little or no estrogen accumulation 
in the body.  
 <p>
<a name="INDICATIONS AND USAGE"></a><b>INDICATIONS AND USAGE 
</b> <p>
Estradiol (transdermal) is indicated for the treatment of the following: moderate-to-severe
vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause; female hypogonadism; female
castration; primary ovarian failure; and atrophic conditions caused by
deficient endogenous estrogen production, such as atrophic vaginitis and
kraurosis vulvae; and prevention of osteoporosis (loss of bone mass).  
 <p>
Estrogen replacement therapy is the most effective single modality for the
prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis in women. Case-controlled studies
have shown a reduction of approximately 60% in the incidence of hip and wrist
fractures in women who began estrogen replacement therapy within a few years of 
menopause. A recent, well-controlled, double-blind, prospective trial conducted 
at the Mayo Clinic has demonstrated that treatment with Estradiol (transdermal) prevents bone 
loss in postmenopausal women at dosage of 0.05 mg per day.  
 <p>
Treatment with Estradiol (transdermal) 0.05 mg showed full maintenance of bone density with a 
slight (0.8%), but not significant, increase. Placebo treatment resulted in a
significant loss of more than 6% below baseline vertebral bone mass. Patients
using either Estradiol (transdermal) 0.1 mg, or 0.05 mg, had significantly greater bone
densities than those using placebo.  
 <p>
Other studies suggest that estrogen replacement therapy reduces the rate of
vertebral fractures.  
 <p>
Peak bone mass is reached at age 30 to 35 and can best be maximized by adequate 
calcium intake and exercise during the adolescent and early adult years. Early
menopause is one of the best predictors for the development of osteoporosis. 
White women are at a higher risk for osteoporosis than white men, black women
are at higher risk than black men, and thin women are at higher risk than obese 
women. Cigarette smoking may be an additional risk factor. Calcium deficiency
has been implicated in the pathogenesis of this disease. Therefore, when not
contraindicated, a calcium intake of 1000-1500 mg/day either by diet or
supplements is recommended for postmenopausal women.  
 <p>
Immobilization and prolonged bedrest produce rapid bone loss, while weight-
bearing exercise has been shown to both reduce bone loss and to increase bone
mass. The optimal type and amount of physical activity that might lower the
risk for osteoporosis have not been established.  
 <p>
<a name="CONTRAINDICATIONS"></a><b>CONTRAINDICATIONS 
</b>                           <p>
Patients with known hypersensitivity to any of the components of the
therapeutic system should not use Estradiol (transdermal).  
 <p>
Estrogens should not be used in women or men with any of the following
conditions:  
 <p>
1. known or suspected cancer of the breast; 
 <p>
2. known or suspected estrogen-dependent neoplasia; 
 <p>
3. known or suspected pregnancy (see Boxed Warning); 
 <p>
4. undiagnosed abnormal genital bleeding; 
 <p>
5. active thrombophlebitis or thromboembolic disorders; 
 <p>
6. history of thrombophlebitis, thrombosis, or thromboembolic disorders
associated with previous estrogen use.

There is no evidence at present that &quot;natural&quot; estrogens are more or less
hazardous than &quot;synthetic&quot; estrogens at equiestrogenic doses.
<p>
ESTROGENS SHOULD NOT BE USED DURING PREGNANCY.  
 <p>
The use of female sex hormones, both estrogens and progestogens, during early
pregnancy may seriously damage the offspring. It has been shown that women who
had been exposed In Utero to diethylstilbestrol, a nonsteroidal estrogen, have
an increased risk of developing in later life a form of vaginal or cervical
cancer that is ordinarily extremely rare. This risk has been estimated as not
greater than 4 per 1000 exposures. Furthermore, a high percentage of such

risk of limb-reduction defects in infants who had been exposed In Utero to sex

short and involved only a few days of treatment. The data suggest that the risk 
of limb-reduction defects in exposed fetuses is somewhat less than 1 per 1000.

to treat threatened or habitual abortion. There is considerable evidence that
estrogens are ineffective for these indications, and there is no evidence from
well-controlled studies that progestogens are effective for these uses.  
 <p>
If Estradiol (transdermal) is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while 
taking this drug, she should be apprised of the potential risks to the fetus
and of the advisability of continuation of the pregnancy.  
 
 <p>
1. Induction Of Malignant Neoplasms. Long-term continuous administration of
natural and synthetic estrogens in certain animal species increases the
frequency of carcinomas of the breast, cervix, vagina, and liver. There are now 
reports that estrogens increase the risk of carcinoma of the endometrium in
humans. (See Boxed Warning.) 
 <p>
At the present time, there is no satisfactory evidence that estrogens given to
postmenopausal women increase the risk of breast cancer, although a recent long 
term followup study has raised this possibility. Because of the animal data,
there is a need for caution in prescribing estrogens for women with a strong
family history of breast cancer or who have breast nodules, fibrocystic disease 
or abnormal mammograms.  
 <p>
2. Gallbladder Disease. A recent study has reported a two- to threefold
increase in the risk of surgically confirmed gallbladder disease in
postmenopausal women receiving oral estrogens, similar to the twofold increase
previously noted in users of oral contraceptives.  
 <p>
3. Effects Similar To Those Caused By Estrogen-Progestogen Oral Contraceptives. 
There are several serious adverse effects of oral contraceptives and other
high- dose oral estrogen treatments, most of which have not, up to now, been
documented as consequences of postmenopausal estrogen replacement therapy. This 
may reflect the comparatively low doses of estrogen used in postmenopausal
women.  <p>
 
a.  Thromboembolic Disease. It is now well established that users of oral
contraceptives have an increased risk of various thromboembolic and thrombotic
vascular diseases, such as thrombophlebitis, pulmonary embolism, stroke, and
myocardial infarction. Cases of retinal thrombosis, mesenteric thrombosis, and
optic neuritis have been reported in oral contraceptive users. There is
evidence that the risk of several of these adverse reactions is related to the
dose of the drug. An increased risk of postsurgery thromboembolic complications 
has also been reported in users of oral contraceptives. If feasible, estrogen
should be discontinued at least 4 weeks before surgery of the type associated
with an increased risk of thromboembolism, or during periods of prolonged
immobilization.  
 <p>
While an increased rate of thromboembolic and thrombotic disease in
postmenopausal users of estrogens has not been found, this does not rule out
the possibility that such an increase may be present or that subgroups of women 
who have underlying risk factors or who are receiving relatively large doses of 
estrogens may have increased risk. Therefore, estrogens should not be used in
persons with active thrombophlebitis or thromboembolic disorders, and they
should not be used in persons with a history of such disorders in association
with estrogen use. They should be used with caution in patients with cerebral
vascular or coronary artery disease and only for those in whom estrogens are
clearly needed.  
 <p>
Large doses of estrogen (5 mg conjugated estrogens per day), comparable to
those used to treat cancer of the prostate and breast, have been shown in a
large prospective clinical trial in men to increase the risk of nonfatal
myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism, and thrombophlebitis. When estrogen
doses of this size are used, any of the thromboembolic and thrombotic adverse
effects associated with oral contraceptive use should be considered a clear
risk.  
 <p>
b.  Hepatic Adenoma. Benign hepatic adenomas have been associated with the use
of oral contraceptives. Although benign and rare, these tumors may rupture and
cause death from intra-abdominal hemorrhage. Such lesions have not yet been
reported in association with other estrogen or progestogen preparations, but
they should be considered if abdominal pain and tenderness, abdominal mass, or
hypovolemic shock occurs in patients receiving estrogen. Hepatocellular
carcinoma has also been reported in women taking estrogen-containing oral
contraceptives. The causal relationship of this malignancy to these drugs is
not known.  
 <p>
c.  Elevated Blood Pressure. Women using oral contraceptives sometimes
experience increased blood pressure which, in most cases, returns to normal
upon discontinuing the drug. There is now a report that this may occur with use 
of oral estrogens in the menopause and blood pressure should be monitored with
estrogen use, especially if high doses are used. Ethinyl estradiol and
conjugated estrogens have been shown to increase renin substrate. In contrast
to these oral estrogens, transdermally administered estradiol does not affect
renin substrate.  
 <p>
d.  Glucose Tolerance. A worsening of glucose tolerance has been observed in a
significant percentage of patients on estrogen-containing oral contraceptives.  
For this reason, diabetic patients should be carefully observed while receiving 
estrogen.  
 <p>
4. Hypercalcemia. Administration of high doses of estrogens may lead to severe
hypercalcemia in patients with breast cancer and bone metastases. If
hypercalcemia occurs, use of the drug should be stopped and appropriate
measures should be taken to reduce the serum calcium level.  
 <p>
<a name="PRECAUTIONS"></a><b>PRECAUTIONS 
</b> <p>
GENERAL 
 <p>
1. A complete medical and family history should be taken before initiation of
any estrogen therapy. The pretreatment and periodic physical examinations
should include special reference to blood pressure, breasts, abdomen, and
pelvic organs, as well as a cervical Papanicolaou test. As a general rule,
estrogen should not be prescribed for longer than 1 year without another
physical examination being performed.  
 <p>
2. Because estrogens may cause some degree of fluid retention, careful
observation is required when conditions that might be influenced by this factor 
are present (e.g., asthma, epilepsy, migraine, and cardiac or renal
dysfunction).  
 <p>
3. Certain patients may develop undesirable manifestations of excessive
estrogenic stimulation, such as uterine bleeding, mastodynia, etc.  
 <p>
4. Prolonged administration of unopposed estrogen therapy has been reported to
increase the risk of endometrial hyperplasia in some patients. Estrogens should 
be used with caution in patients who have or have had endometriosis.  
 <p>
5. Studies of the addition of a progestin for 7 or more days of a cycle of
estrogen administration have reported a lowered incidence of endometrial
hyperplasia. Morphological and biochemical studies of endometrium suggest that
12 to 13 days of progestin are needed to provide maximal maturation of the
endometrium and to eliminate any hyperplastic changes. Whether this will
provide protection from endometrial carcinoma has not been clearly established. 
There are possible additional risks that may be associated with the inclusion
of progestin in estrogen replacement regimens. The potential risks include
adverse effects on carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. The choice of progestin
and dosage may be important in minimizing these adverse effects.  
                           <p>
6. Oral contraceptives appear to be associated with an increased incidence of
mental depression. Although it is not clear whether this is due to the
estrogenic or progestogenic component of the contraceptive, patients with a
history of depression should be carefully observed.  
 <p>
7. Preexisting uterine leiomyomata may increase in size during prolonged
estrogen use. If this occurs, estrogen therapy should be discontinued while the 
cause is investigated.  
 <p>
8. In patients with a history of jaundice during pregnancy, there is an
increased risk that jaundice will recur with the use of estrogen-containing
oral contraceptives. If jaundice develops in any patient receiving estrogen,
the medication should be discontinued while the cause is investigated.  
 <p>
9. Estrogens may be poorly metabolized in patients with impaired liver function 
and should be administered with caution in such patients.  <p>
 
10. Because the prolonged use of estrogens influences the metabolism of calcium 
and phosphorus, estrogens should be used with caution in patients with
metabolic bone diseases associated with hypercalcemia and in patients with
renal insufficiency.  
 <p>
INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS 
 <p>
See Patient Package Insert printed below.  
 <p>
<a name="DRUG/LABORATORY"></a>DRUG/LABORATORY TEST INTERACTIONS 
 <p>
The results of certain endocrine and liver function tests may be affected by
estrogen-containing oral contraceptives. The following changes have been
observed with large doses of oral estrogen:  
 <p>
1. increased sulfobromophthalein retention; 
 <p>
2. increased prothrombin time; increased factors VII, VIII, IX, and X;
decreased antithrombin 3; increased norepinephrine-induced platelet
aggregability; <p>
 
3. increased thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG), leading to increased circulating 
total thyroid hormone (T4) as measured by column or radioimmunoassay; free T3
resin uptake is decreased, reflecting the elevated TBG; free T4 concentration
is unaltered; TBG was not affected in clinical trials of Estradiol (transdermal); 
 <p>
4. reduced response to the metyrapone test; 
 <p>
5. reduced serum folate concentration; 
 <p>
6. increased serum triglyceride and phospholipid concentration, and decreased
pregnanediol excretion.  
 <p>
The pathologist should be informed that the patient is receiving estrogen
therapy when relevant specimens are submitted.  
 <p>
CARCINOGENESIS, MUTAGENESIS, IMPAIRMENT OF FERTILITY 
 <p>
See WARNINGS.  
 <p>
Long-term continuous administration of natural and synthetic estrogens in
certain animal species increases the frequency of carcinomas of the breast,
cervix, vagina, and liver.  <p>
PREGNANCY CATEGORY X 
 <p>
See CONTRAINDICATIONS and Boxed Warning.  
 <p>
Estrogens should not be used during pregnancy.  
 <p>
NURSING MOTHERS 
 <p>
As a general principle, the administration of any drug to nursing mothers
should be done only when clearly necessary since many drugs are excreted in
human milk.  <p>
 
<a name="ADVERSE REACTIONS"></a><b>ADVERSE REACTIONS 
</b> <p>
See WARNINGS and Boxed Warning regarding potential adverse effects on the fetus 
induction of malignant neoplasms, increased incidence of gallbladder disease,
and adverse effects similar to those of oral contraceptives, including
thromboembolism.  
 <p>
The most commonly reported adverse reaction to Estradiol (transdermal) in clinical trials was 
redness and irritation at the application site. This occurred in about 17% of
the women treated and caused approximately 2% to discontinue therapy. Reports
of rash have been rare. There have also been rare reports of severe systemic
allergic reactions.  
 <p>
The following additional adverse reactions have been reported with estrogenic
therapy, including oral contraceptives:  
 <p>
Genitourinary System:  Breakthrough bleeding, spotting, change in menstrual
flow; increase in size of uterine fibromyomata; change in cervical erosion and
amount of cervical secretion.  
 <p>
Endocrine:  Breast tenderness, breast enlargement.  
 <p>
Gastrointestinal:  Nausea, vomiting; abdominal cramps, bloating; cholestatic
jaundice have been observed with oral estrogen therapy.  
 <p>
Eyes:  Steepening of corneal curvature; intolerance to contact lenses.  
 <p>
Central Nervous System:  Headache, migraine, dizziness.  
                           <p>
Miscellaneous:  Change in weight, edema, change in libido.  
 <p>
<a name="OVERDOSAGE"></a><b>OVERDOSAGE 
</b> <p>
Numerous reports of ingestion of large doses of estrogen-containing oral
contraceptives by young children indicate that acute serious ill effects do not 
occur. Overdosage with estrogen may cause nausea, and withdrawal bleeding may
occur in females.  <p>
 
<a name="DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION"></a><b>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION 
</b> <p>
The adhesive side of the Estradiol (transdermal) system should be placed on a clean, dry area 
of the skin on the trunk of the body (including the buttocks and abdomen.) The
site selected should be one that is not exposed to sunlight. Estradiol (transdermal) Should
Not Be Applied To The Breasts. The sites of application must be rotated, with
an interval of at least 1 week allowed between applications to a particular
site.  The area selected should not be oily, damaged, or irritated. The
waistline should be avoided, since tight clothing may rub the system off. The
system should be applied immediately after opening the pouch and removing the
protective liner. The system should be pressed firmly in place with the palm of 
the hand for about 10 seconds, making sure there is good contact, especially
around the edges. In the unlikely event that a system should fall off, the same 
system may be reapplied. If necessary, a new system may be applied. In either
case, the original treatment schedule should be continued.  
 <p>
INITIATION OF THERAPY 
 <p>
Treatment of menopausal symptoms is usually initiated with Estradiol (transdermal) 0.05 mg
applied to the skin twice weekly. The dosage should be adjusted as necessary to 
control symptoms. The lowest dosage necessary for the control of symptoms
should be used, especially in women with an intact uterus. Attempts to taper or 
discontinue the medication should be made at 3- to 6-month intervals.  
 <p>
Prophylactic therapy with Estradiol (transdermal) to prevent postmenopausal bone loss should
be initiated with the 0.05 mg/day dosage as soon as possible after menopause. 
The dosage may be adjusted if necessary to control concurrent menopausal
symptoms. Discontinuation of estrogen replacement therapy may reestablish the
natural rate of bone loss.  <p>
 
In women not currently taking oral estrogens, treatment with Estradiol (transdermal) can be
initiated at once. In women who are currently taking oral estrogen, treatment
with Estradiol (transdermal) can be initiated 1 week after withdrawal of oral hormone
replacement therapy, or sooner if menopausal symptoms reappear in less than 1
week.  
 <p>
THERAPEUTIC REGIMEN 
 <p>
Estradiol (transdermal) therapy may be given continuously in patients who do not have an
intact uterus. In those patients with an intact uterus, Estradiol (transdermal) may be given
on a cyclic schedule (e.g., 3 weeks on drug followed by 1 week off drug).

INFORMATION FOR THE PATIENT

Estradiol (transdermal) 
 <p>
GENERIC NAME:  
 <p>
PRONOUNCED ESS-TRA-DYE-ALL 
 <p>
INTRODUCTION <p>
 
Your doctor has prescribed Estradiol (transdermal) for the treatment of your menopausal
symptoms, and/or to prevent osteoporosis, which is a thinning of your bones. 
During menopause, production of estrogen hormones by your body decreases well
below the amounts normally produced during your fertile years. In many women
this decrease in estrogen production causes uncomfortable symptoms, most
noticeably hot flushes and sleep disturbance. Estrogens can be given to reduce
or eliminate these symptoms.  
 <p>
The Estradiol (transdermal) system that your doctor has prescribed for you releases small
amounts of estradiol through the skin in a continuous way. Estradiol is the
same hormone that your ovaries produce abundantly before menopause. The dose of 
estradiol you require will depend upon your individual response. The dose is
adjusted by the size of the Estradiol (transdermal) system used; the systems are available in 
two sizes.  
 <p>
This leaflet will provide you with general information about estrogens and with 
specific information about the Estradiol (transdermal) system. Please read it carefully. If
you want to know more, you should ask your doctor for more information.  
 <p>
INFORMATION ABOUT Estradiol (transdermal) 
 <p>
HOW Estradiol (transdermal) WORKS <p>
 
Estradiol (transdermal) contains estradiol. When applied to the skin as directed below, the
Estradiol (transdermal) system releases estradiol, which flows through the skin into the
bloodstream.  
 <p>
HOW AND WHERE TO APPLY Estradiol (transdermal) 
 <p>
Each Estradiol (transdermal) system is individually sealed in a protective pouch. Tear open
this pouch at the indentation (do not use scissors) and remove the system. 
Bubbles in the system are normal.  
 <p>
A stiff protective liner covers the adhesive side of the system--the side that
will be placed against your skin. This liner must be removed before applying
the system. Slide the protective liner sideways between your thumb and index
finger.  Then hold the system at one edge. Remove the protective liner and
discard it.  Try to avoid touching the adhesive.  
 <p>

Apply the adhesive side of the system to a clean, dry area of the skin on the
trunk of your body, (including the buttocks and abdomen). The site selected
should be one that is not exposed to sunlight. Some women may find that it is
more comfortable to wear Estradiol (transdermal) on the buttocks. Do Not Apply Estradiol
(transdermal) To
Your Breasts. The sites of application must be rotated, with an interval of at
least 1 week allowed between applications to a particular site. The area
selected should not be oily, damaged, or irritated. Avoid the waistline, since
tight clothing may rub the system off. Apply the system immediately after
opening the pouch and removing the protective liner. Press the system firmly in 
place with the palm of your hand for about 10 seconds, making sure there is
good contact, especially around the edges.  
 <p>
The Estradiol (transdermal) system should be worn continuously until it is time to replace it 
with a new system. You may wish to experiment with different locations when
applying a new system, to find ones that are most comfortable for you and where 
clothing will not rub on the system.  
 <p>
WHEN TO APPLY Estradiol (transdermal) 
 <p>
The Estradiol (transdermal) system should be changed twice weekly. Your Estradiol (transdermal)
package contains a calendar check list on the back to help you remember a schedule.
Mark the two-day schedule you plan to follow. Always change the system on the
two days of the week you have marked.  
 <p>
When changing the system, remove the used Estradiol (transdermal) and discard it. Any
adhesive that might remain on your skin can be easily rubbed off. Then place
the new Estradiol (transdermal) on a different skin site. (The same skin site should not be
used again for at least 1 week after removal of the system.) <p>
 
Please note:  Contact with water when you are bathing, swimming, or showering
will not affect the system. In the unlikely event that a system should fall off 
put this same system back on and continue to follow your original treatment
schedule. If necessary, you may apply a new system but continue to follow your
original schedule.  <p>
 
BENEFITS OF TREATMENT WITH Estradiol (transdermal) 
 <p>
Regular use of Estradiol (transdermal) twice weekly offers relief of the symptoms of
menopause and has been shown to help prevent osteoporosis, which is a thinning
of the bones that makes them more fragile. In the years following the menopause 
unless estrogen therapy is taken regularly, your bones can rapidly lose
strength, possibly leading to osteoporosis and bone fractures. Estradiol (transdermal) may
prevent this bone loss and the development of osteoporosis, and may help you to 
avoid fractures of your spine (&quot;dowager's hump&quot;), wrist, and hip later in life. 
 <p>
Small quantities of the naturally occurring hormone estradiol are absorbed
through the skin from the Estradiol (transdermal) system, ensuring a continuous supply of
circulating hormone in the body.  
 <p>
When estradiol is administered through your skin, the drug does not undergo the 
rapid chemical changes in the liver and stomach that would occur if you were
taking it by mouth.  
 <p>
There is no medical evidence that the use of any estrogen during menopause will 
keep you feeling young, keep your skin soft, or relieve nervousness.  
 <p>
PRECAUTIONS 
 <p>
The use of estrogens has benefits, but it has risks as well.  
 <p>
Before using Estradiol (transdermal), be sure to tell your doctor if you are pregnant. 
                           <p>
ESTROGENS SHOULD NOT BE USED DURING PREGNANCY. Also tell your doctor if you
have ever had any of the following: cancer of the breast or uterus, unusual
vaginal bleeding, endometriosis, or abnormal blood clotting. Your doctor may
decide that Estradiol (transdermal) should not be used under these conditions.  
 <p>
Also tell your doctor if you have or have ever had high blood pressure, heart
or kidney disease, asthma, skin allergy, epilepsy, migraine, diabetes, or
depression. This information will help your doctor decide whether you should
use Estradiol (transdermal).  <p>
 
You should tell your doctor if any of the following occur while using
Estradiol (transdermal); any irregular bleeding; breast tenderness, enlargement, or lumps;
pain or heaviness in the legs or chest; severe headache, dizziness, or changes
in vision; or skin irritation, redness, or rash.  
 <p>
INFORMATION ABOUT ESTROGENS 
 <p>
ESTROGENS IN THE MENOPAUSE 
 <p>
Menopause occurs either naturally in the course of a woman's life or sooner if
the ovaries are removed by surgery. During menopause--which usually occurs
between the ages of 45 and 55--there is a decrease in estrogen production by
the ovaries. In many women this decrease causes unpleasant symptoms such as a
feeling of warmth in the face, neck, and chest, or sudden intense episodes of
heat and sweating throughout the body (called &quot;hot flashes&quot; or &quot;hot flushes&quot;).  
Some women may also develop other changes: impaired bladder control and
alterations in the vagina (such as dryness) that cause discomfort during and
after intercourse.  
 <p>
Estrogens can be prescribed to treat menopausal symptoms. Some women have no
symptoms or only mild ones and do not need estrogens; others may need estrogens 
for a few months; and others will need treatment for longer periods. Usually
treatment is cyclical and includes days when no estrogen is given. Other drugs
called progestins, are sometimes given to offset the effects of estrogens on
the lining of the uterus. You may wish to discuss the risks and benefits of
such treatment with your doctor.  
 <p>
ESTROGENS IN OSTEOPOROSIS <p>
 
After age 40, and especially after menopause, some women develop osteoporosis.  
This is a thinning of the bones that makes them weaker and more likely to break 
and often leads to fractures of spine, hip and wrist bones. Taking estrogens
after the menopause slows down bone loss and may prevent bones from breaking. 
Eating foods that are high in calcium (such as milk products) or taking calcium 
supplements (1000-1500 milligrams per day), and certain types of exercise, may
also help prevent osteoporosis.  <p>
 
Since estrogen use is associated with some risk, its use in the prevention of
osteoporosis should be confined to women who appear to be susceptible to this
condition. The following characteristics are often present in women who are
likely to develop postmenopausal osteoporosis: underweight, sedentary, nicotine 
and alcohol abusers, Caucasian and Oriental women, surgical and spontaneous
menopause at a young age.  
 <p>
If you will be taking calcium supplements as part of the treatment to help
prevent osteoporosis, check with your doctor about the amounts recommended.  
 <p>
POSSIBLE RISKS AND DISCOMFORTS FROM TREATMENT WITH ESTROGENS 
 <p>
The risk of endometrial cancer (cancer of the lining of the uterus) is greater
in estrogen users than in nonusers. (If you have had your uterus removed by a
total hysterectomy, this would not be a risk for you.) Recent studies have
shown that this increased risk depends on estrogen dose, duration of treatment, 
and treatment regimen.  
 <p>
Despite numerous studies, there has been no definite link established between
estrogen use and breast cancer. Nevertheless, women with a family history of
breast cancer, or with breast nodules, fibrocystic breast disease (lumps), or
abnormal mammograms should consult with their doctor before taking estrogens. 
 
In certain animals treated with estrogen, cancer of the cervix, vagina, and
liver occurred more frequently.  
 <p>
The following effects have also been reported in women taking estrogens: nausea 
(the most common side effect), retention of fluid, gallbladder disease,
abnormal blood clotting, migraine, elevated serum calcium, growth of benign
fibroid tumors in the uterus, jaundice, darkening of the skin, defects in the
fetus, and liver tumors. Redness, irritation, or rash may occur at the site of
Estradiol (transdermal) application.  
 <p>
Breast tenderness and excessive vaginal secretions may occur when the dose of
estrogen administered is too high.  
 <p>
Based on a review of your medical needs, your doctor has prescribed Estradiol (transdermal)
for you. Use it only as directed and do not give it to anyone else. Your doctor 
should reexamine you at least annually.  
 <p>
Do not store above 86 deg F (30 deg C).  
 <p>
Do not store unpouched. Apply immediately upon removal from the protective
pouch.

<p><a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><b>DESCRIPTION </b></p>

<p>USE IN PREGNANCY </p>

<p>WHEN USED IN PREGNANCY DURING THE SECOND AND THIRD TRIMESTERS, ACE INHIBITORS
CAN CAUSE INJURY AND EVEN DEATH TO THE DEVELOPING FETUS. When pregnancy
is detected, Quinapril should be discontinued as soon as possible. See
WARNINGS, Fetal/Neonatal Morbidity and Mortality. </p>

<p>Quinapril is the hydrochloride salt of quinapril, the ethyl ester of
a nonsulfhydryl, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, quinaprilat.
</p>

<p>Quinapril hydrochloride is chemically described as (3S-(2(R*(R*)), 3R*))-2-(2-
((1-(ethoxycarbonyl)-3-phenylpropyl)amino)-1-oxopropyl)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-3-
isoquinolinecarboxylic acid, monohydrochloride. Its empirical formula is
C25H30N2O5.HCl. </p>

<p>Quinapril hydrochloride is a white to off-white amorphous powder that
is freely soluble in aqueous solvents. </p>

<p><a name="ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY"></a><b>ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
</b></p>

<p>MECHANISM OF ACTION: Quinapril is deesterified to the principal metabolite,
quinaprilat, which is an inhibitor of ACE activity in human subjects and
animals. ACE is a peptidyl dipeptidase that catalyzes the conversion of
angiotensin I to the vasoconstrictor, angiotensin II. The effect of quinapril
in hypertension and in congestive heart failure (CHF) appears to result
primarily from the inhibition of circulating and tissue ACE activity, thereby
reducing angiotensin II formation. Quinapril inhibits the elevation in
blood pressure caused by intravenously administered angiotensin I, but
has no effect on the pressor response to angiotensin II, norepinephrine
or epinephrine. Angiotensin II also stimulates the secretion of aldosterone
from the adrenal cortex, thereby facilitating renal sodium and fluid reabsorption.
Reduced aldosterone secretion by quinapril may result in a small increase
in serum potassium. In controlled hypertension trials, treatment with Quinapril
alone resulted in mean increases in potassium of 0.07 mmol/L (see PRECAUTIONS).
Removal of angiotensin II negative feedback on renin secretion leads to
increased plasma renin activity (PRA). </p>

<p>While the principal mechanism of antihypertensive effect is thought
to be through the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, quinapril exerts
antihypertensive actions even in patients with low renin hypertension.
Quinapril was an effective antihypertensive in all races studied, although
it was somewhat less effective in blacks (usually a predominantly low renin
group) than in nonblacks. ACE is identical to kininase II, an enzyme that
degrades bradykinin, a potent peptide vasodilator; whether increased levels
of bradykinin play a role in the therapeutic effect of quinapril remains
to be elucidated. </p>

<p>PHARMACOKINETICS AND METABOLISM: Following oral administration, peak
plasma quinapril concentrations are observed within one hour. Based on
recovery of quinapril and its metabolites in urine, the extent of absorption
is at least 60%. The rate and extent of quinapril absorption are diminished
moderately (approximately 25-30%) when Quinapril tablets are administered
during a high-fat meal. Following absorption, quinapril is deesterified
to its major active metabolite, quinaprilat (about 38% of oral dose), and
to other minor inactive metabolites. Following multiple oral dosing of
Quinapril, there is an effective accumulation half-life of quinaprilat
of approximately 3 hours, and peak plasma quinaprilat concentrations are
observed approximately 2 hours post-dose. Quinaprilat is eliminated primarily
by renal excretion, up to 96% of an IV dose and has an elimination half-life
in plasma of approximately 2 hours and a prolonged terminal phase with
a half-life of 25 hours. The pharmacokinetics of quinapril and quinaprilat
are linear over a single-dose range of 5-80 mg doses and 40-160 mg in multiple
daily doses. Approximately 97% of either quinapril or quinaprilat circulating
in plasma is bound to proteins. </p>

<p>In patients with renal insufficiency, the elimination half-life of quinaprilat
increases as creatinine clearance decreases. There is a linear correlation
between plasma quinaprilat clearance and creatinine clearance. In patients
with end-stage renal disease, chronic hemodialysis or continuous ambulatory
peritoneal dialysis has little effect on the elimination of quinapril and
quinaprilat. Elimination of quinaprilat may be reduced in elderly patients
(&gt;/=65 years) and in those with heart failure; this reduction is attributable
to decrease in renal function (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Quinaprilat
concentrations are reduced in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis due to
impaired deesterification of quinapril. Studies in rats indicate that quinapril
and its metabolites do not cross the blood-brain barrier. </p>

<p>PHARMACODYNAMICS AND CLINICAL EFFECTS </p>

<p>HYPERTENSION: Single doses of 20 mg of Quinapril provide over 80% inhibition
of plasma ACE for 24 hours. Inhibition of the pressor response to angiotensin
I is shorter-lived, with a 20 mg dose giving 75% inhibition for about 4
hours, 50% inhibition for about 8 hours, and 20% inhibition at 24 hours.
With chronic dosing, however, there is substantial inhibition of angiotensin
II levels at 24 hours by doses of 20-80 mg. </p>

<p>Administration of 10 to 80 mg of Quinapril to patients with mild to
severe hypertension results in a reduction of sitting and standing blood
pressure to about the same extent with minimal effect on heart rate. Symptomatic
postural hypotension is infrequent although it can occur in patients who
are salt- and/or volume-depleted (see WARNINGS). Antihypertensive activity
commences within 1 hour with peak effects usually achieved by 2 to 4 hours
after dosing. During chronic therapy, most of the blood pressure lowering
effect of a given dose is obtained in 1-2 weeks. In multiple-dose studies,
10-80 mg per day in single or divided doses lowered systolic and diastolic
blood pressure throughout the dosing interval, with a trough effect of
about 5-11/3-7 mm Hg. The trough effect represents about 50% of the peak
effect. While the dose response relationship is relatively flat, doses
of 40-80 mg were somewhat more effective at trough than 10-20 mg, and twice
daily dosing tended to give a somewhat lower trough blood pressure than
once daily dosing with the same total dose. The antihypertensive effect
of Quinapril continues during long-term therapy, with no evidence of loss
of effectiveness. </p>

<p>Hemodynamic assessments in patients with hypertension indicate that
blood pressure reduction produced by quinapril is accompanied by a reduction
in total peripheral resistance and renal vascular resistance with little
or no change in heart rate, cardiac index, renal blood flow, glomerular
filtration rate, or filtration fraction. </p>

<p>Use of Quinapril with a thiazide diuretic gives a blood-pressure lowering
effect greater than that seen with either agent alone. </p>

<p>In patients with hypertension, Quinapril 10-40 mg was similar in effectiveness
to captopril, enalapril, propranolol, and thiazide diuretics. </p>

<p>Therapeutic effects appear to be the same for elderly (&gt;/=65 years
of age) and younger adult patients given the same daily dosages, with no
increase in adverse events in elderly patients. </p>

<p>HEART FAILURE: In baseline-controlled trials involving patients with
congestive heart failure treated with digitalis and diuretics, parenteral
quinaprilat, the active metabolite of quinapril, reduced pulmonary capillary
wedge pressure, and systemic vascular resistance and increased cardiac
output/index. Similar favorable hemodynamic effects were seen with oral
quinapril, and such effects appeared to be maintained during chronic oral
quinapril therapy. Quinapril reduced renal hepatic vascular resistance
and increased renal and hepatic blood flow with glomerular filtration rate
remaining unchanged. </p>

<p>A significant dose response relationship for improvement in maximal
exercise tolerance has been observed with Quinapril therapy. Beneficial
effects on the severity of heart failure as measured by New York Heart
Association (NYHA) classification and Quality of Life and on symptoms of
dyspnea, fatigue, and edema were evident after 6 months in a double blind,
placebo controlled study. Favorable effects were maintained for up to two
years of open label therapy. The effects of quinapril on long-term mortality
in heart failure have not been evaluated. </p>

<p><a name="INDICATIONS AND USAGE"></a><b>INDICATIONS AND USAGE </b></p>

<p>HYPERTENSION </p>

<p>Quinapril is indicated for the treatment of hypertension. It may be
used alone or in combination with thiazide diuretics. </p>

<p>HEART FAILURE </p>

<p>Quinapril is indicated in the management of heart failure as adjunctive
therapy when added to conventional therapy including diuretics and/or digitalis.
</p>

<p>In using Quinapril, consideration should be given to the fact that another
angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, has caused agranulocytosis,
particularly in patients with renal impairment or collagen vascular disease.
Available data are insufficient to show that Quinapril does not have a
similar risk (see WARNINGS). </p>

<p><a name="CONTRAINDICATIONS"></a><b>CONTRAINDICATIONS </b></p>

<p>Quinapril is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to this
product and in patients with a history of angioedema related to previous
treatment with an ACE inhibitor. </p>

<p><a name="WARNINGS"></a><b>WARNINGS </b></p>

<p>USE IN PREGNANCY </p>

<p>WHEN USED IN PREGNANCY DURING THE SECOND AND THIRD TRIMESTERS, ACE INHIBITORS
CAN CAUSE INJURY AND EVEN DEATH TO THE DEVELOPING FETUS. When pregnancy
is detected, Quinapril should be discontinued as soon as possible. See
WARNINGS, Fetal/Neonatal Morbidity and Mortality. </p>

<p>ANGIOEDEMA: Angioedema of the face, extremities, lips, tongue, glottis,
and larynx has been reported in patients treated with ACE inhibitors and
has been seen in 0.1% of patients receiving Quinapril. Angioedema associated
with laryngeal edema can be fatal. If laryngeal stridor or angioedema of
the face, tongue, or glottis occurs, treatment with Quinapril should be
discontinued immediately, the patient treated in accordance with accepted
medical care, and carefully observed until the swelling disappears. In
instances where swelling is confined to the face and lips, the condition
generally resolves without treatment; antihistamines may be useful in relieving
symptoms. WHERE THERE IS INVOLVEMENT OF THE TONGUE, GLOTTIS, OR LARYNX
LIKELY TO CAUSE AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION, EMERGENCY THERAPY INCLUDING, BUT NOT
LIMITED TO, SUBCUTANEOUS EPINEPHRINE SOLUTION 1:1000 (0.3 TO 0.5 ML) SHOULD
BE PROMPTLY ADMINISTERED (see ADVERSE REACTIONS). </p>

<p>HYPOTENSION: Excessive hypotension is rare in patients with uncomplicated
hypertension treated with Quinapril alone. Patients with heart failure
given Quinapril commonly have some reduction in blood pressure, but discontinuation
of therapy because of continuing symptomatic hypotension usually is not
necessary when dosing instructions are followed. Caution should be observed
when initiating therapy in patients with heart failure (see DOSAGE AND
ADMINISTRATION). In controlled studies, syncope was observed in 0.4% of
patients (N=3203); this incidence was similar to that observed for captopril
(1%) and enalapril (0.8%). </p>

<p>Patients at risk of excessive hypotension, sometimes associated with
oliguria and/or progressive azotemia, and rarely with acute renal failure
and/or death, include patients with the following conditions or characteristics:
heart failure, hyponatremia, high dose diuretic therapy, recent intensive
diuresis or increase in diuretic dose, renal dialysis, or severe volume
and/or salt depletion of any etiology. It may be advisable to eliminate
the diuretic (except in patients with heart failure), reduce the diuretic
dose or cautiously increase salt intake (except in patients with heart
failure) before initiating therapy with Quinapril in patients at risk for
excessive hypotension who are able to tolerate such adjustments. </p>

<p>In patients at risk of excessive hypotension, therapy with Quinapril
should be started under close medical supervision. Such patients should
be followed closely for the first two weeks of treatment and whenever the
dose of Quinapril and/or diuretic is increased. Similar considerations
may apply to patients with ischemic heart or cerebrovascular disease in
whom an excessive fall in blood pressure could result in a myocardial infarction
or a cerebrovascular accident. </p>

<p>If excessive hypotension occurs, the patient should be placed in the
supine position and, if necessary, receive an intravenous infusion of normal
saline. A transient hypotensive response is not a contraindication to further
doses of Quinapril, which usually can be given without difficulty once
the blood pressure has stabilized. If symptomatic hypotension develops,
a dose reduction or discontinuation of Quinapril or concomitant diuretic
may be necessary. </p>

<p>NEUTROPENIA/AGRANULOCYTOSIS: Another ACE inhibitor, captopril, has been
shown to cause agranulocytosis and bone marrow depression rarely in patients
with uncomplicated hypertension, but more frequently in patients with renal
impairment, especially if they also have a collagen vascular disease, such
as systemic lupus erythematosus or scleroderma. Agranulocytosis did occur
during Quinapril treatment in one patient with a history of neutropenia
during previous captopril therapy. Available data from clinical trials
of Quinapril are insufficient to show that, in patients without prior reactions
to other ACE inhibitors, Quinapril does not cause agranulocytosis at similar
rates. As with other ACE inhibitors, periodic monitoring of white blood
cell counts in patients with collagen vascular disease and/or renal disease
should be considered. </p>

<p>FETAL/NEONATAL MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY: ACE inhibitors can cause fetal
and neonatal morbidity and death when administered to pregnant women. Several
dozen cases have been reported in the world literature. When pregnancy
is detected, ACE inhibitors should be discontinued as soon as possible.
</p>

<p>The use of ACE inhibitors during the second and third trimesters of
pregnancy has been associated with fetal and neonatal injury, including
hypotension, neonatal skull hypoplasia, anuria, reversible or irreversible
renal failure, and death. Oligohydramnios has also been reported, presumably
resulting from decreased fetal renal function; oligohydramnios in this
setting has been associated with fetal limb contractures, craniofacial
deformation, and hypoplastic lung development. Prematurity, intrauterine
growth retardation, and patent ductus arteriosus have also been reported,
although it is not clear whether these occurrences were due to the ACE
inhibitor exposure. </p>

<p>These adverse effects do not appear to have resulted from intrauterine
ACE inhibitor exposure that has been limited to the first trimester. Mothers
whose embryos and fetuses are exposed to ACE inhibitors only during the
first trimester should be so informed. Nonetheless, when patients become
pregnant, physicians should make every effort to discontinue the use of
Quinapril as soon as possible. </p>

<p>Rarely (probably less often than once in every thousand pregnancies),
no alternative to ACE inhibitors will be found. In these rare cases, the
mothers should be apprised of the potential hazards to their fetuses, and
serial ultrasound examinations should be performed to assess the intraamniotic
environment. </p>

<p>If oligohydramnios is observed, Quinapril should be discontinued unless
it is considered life-saving for the mother. Contraction stress testing
(CST), a non- stress test (NST), or biophysical profiling (BPP) may be
appropriate, depending upon the week of pregnancy. Patients and physicians
should be aware, however, that oligohydramnios may not appear until after
the fetus has sustained irreversible injury. </p>

<p>Infants with histories of In Utero exposure to ACE inhibitors should
be closely observed for hypotension, oliguria, and hyperkalemia. If oliguria
occurs, attention should be directed toward support of blood pressure and
renal perfusion. Exchange transfusion or dialysis may be required as a
means of reversing hypotension and/or substituting for disordered renal
function. Removal of Quinapril, which crosses the placenta, from the neonatal
circulation is not significantly accelerated by these means. </p>

<p>No teratogenic effects of Quinapril were seen in studies of pregnant
rats and rabbits. On a mg/kg basis, the doses used were up to 180 times
(in rats) and one time (in rabbits) the maximum recommended human dose.
</p>

<p><a name="PRECAUTIONS"></a><b>PRECAUTIONS </b></p>

<p>GENERAL </p>

<p>IMPAIRED RENAL FUNCTION: As a consequence of inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-
aldosterone system, changes in renal function may be anticipated in susceptible
individuals. In patients with severe heart failure whose renal function
may depend on the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system,
treatment with ACE inhibitors, including Quinapril, may be associated with
oliguria and/or progressive azotemia and rarely acute renal failure and/or
death. </p>

<p>In clinical studies in hypertensive patients with unilateral or bilateral
renal artery stenosis, increases in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine
have been observed in some patients following ACE inhibitor therapy. These
increases were almost always reversible upon discontinuation of the ACE
inhibitor and/or diuretic therapy. In such patients, renal function should
be monitored during the first few weeks of therapy. </p>

<p>Some patients with hypertension or heart failure with no apparent preexisting
renal vascular disease have developed increases in blood urea and serum
creatinine, usually minor and transient, especially when Quinapril has
been given concomitantly with a diuretic. This is more likely to occur
in patients with preexisting renal impairment. Dosage reduction and/or
discontinuation of any diuretic and/or Quinapril may be required. </p>

<p>EVALUATION OF PATIENTS WITH HYPERTENSION OR HEART FAILURE SHOULD ALWAYS
INCLUDE ASSESSMENT OF RENAL FUNCTION (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). </p>

<p>HYPERKALEMIA AND POTASSIUM-SPARING DIURETICS: In clinical trials, hyperkalemia
(serum potassium &gt;/=5.8 mmol/L) occurred in approximately 2% of patients
receiving Quinapril. In most cases, elevated serum potassium levels were
isolated values which resolved despite continued therapy. Less than 0.1%
of patients discontinued therapy due to hyperkalemia. Risk factors for
the development of hyperkalemia include renal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus,
and the concomitant use of potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements,
and/or potassium- containing salt substitutes, which should be used cautiously,
if at all, with Quinapril (see PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions). </p>

<p>COUGH: Cough has been reported with the use of ACE inhibitors. Characteristically,
the cough is nonproductive, persistent, and resolves after discontinuation
of therapy. ACE inhibitor-induced cough should be considered as part of
the differential diagnosis of cough. </p>

<p>SURGERY/ANESTHESIA: In patients undergoing major surgery or during anesthesia
with agents that produce hypotension, Quinapril will block angiotensin
II formation secondary to compensatory renin release. If hypotension occurs
and is considered to be due to this mechanism, it can be corrected by volume
expansion. </p>

<p>INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS </p>

<p>PREGNANCY: Female patients of childbearing age should be told about
the consequences of second- and third-trimester exposure to ACE inhibitors,
and they should also be told that these consequences do not appear to have
resulted from intrauterine ACE-inhibitor exposure that has been limited
to the first trimester. These patients should be asked to report pregnancies
to their physicians as soon as possible. </p>

<p>ANGIOEDEMA: Angioedema, including laryngeal edema, can occur with treatment
with ACE inhibitors, especially following the first dose. Patients should
be so advised and told to report immediately any signs or symptoms suggesting
angioedema (swelling of face, extremities, eyes, lips, tongue, difficulty
in swallowing or breathing) and to stop taking the drug until they have
consulted with their physician (see WARNINGS). </p>

<p>SYMPTOMATIC HYPOTENSION: Patients should be cautioned that lightheadedness
can occur, especially during the first few days of Quinapril therapy, and
that it should be reported to a physician. If actual syncope occurs, patients
should be told to not take the drug until they have consulted with their
physician (see WARNINGS). </p>

<p>All patients should be cautioned that inadequate fluid intake or excessive
perspiration, diarrhea, or vomiting can lead to an excessive fall in blood
pressure because of reduction in fluid volume, with the same consequences
of lightheadedness and possible syncope. </p>

<p>Patients planning to undergo any surgery and/or anesthesia should be
told to inform their physician that they are taking an ACE inhibitor. </p>

<p>HYPERKALEMIA: Patients should be told not to use potassium supplements
or salt substitutes containing potassium without consulting their physician
(see PRECAUTIONS). </p>

<p>NEUTROPENIA: Patients should be told to report promptly any indication
of infection (eg, sore throat, fever) which could be a sign of neutropenia.
</p>

<p>NOTE: As with many other drugs, certain advice to patients being treated
with Quinapril is warranted. This information is intended to aid in the
safe and effective use of this medication. It is not a disclosure of all
possible adverse or intended effects. </p>

<p>DRUG INTERACTIONS </p>

<p>CONCOMITANT DIURETIC THERAPY: As with other ACE inhibitors, patients
on diuretics, especially those on recently instituted diuretic therapy,
may occasionally experience an excessive reduction of blood pressure after
initiation of therapy with Quinapril. The possibility of hypotensive effects
with Quinapril may be minimized by either discontinuing the diuretic or
cautiously increasing salt intake prior to initiation of treatment with
Quinapril. If it is not possible to discontinue the diuretic, the starting
dose of quinapril should be reduced (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). </p>

<p>AGENTS INCREASING SERUM POTASSIUM: Quinapril can attenuate potassium
loss caused by thiazide diuretics and increase serum potassium when used
alone. If concomitant therapy of Quinapril with potassium-sparing diuretics
(eg, spironolactone, triamterene, or amiloride), potassium supplements,
or potassium containing salt substitutes is indicated, they should be used
with caution along with appropriate monitoring of serum potassium (see
PRECAUTIONS). </p>

<p>TETRACYCLINE AND OTHER DRUGS THAT INTERACT WITH MAGNESIUM: Simultaneous
administration of tetracycline with Quinapril reduced the absorption of
tetracycline by approximately 28% to 37%, possibly due to the high magnesium
content in Quinapril tablets. This interaction should be considered if
coprescribing Quinapril and tetracycline or other drugs that interact with
magnesium. </p>

<p>LITHIUM: Increased serum lithium levels and symptoms of lithium toxicity
have been reported in patients receiving concomitant lithium and ACE inhibitor
therapy. These drugs should be coadministered with caution and frequent
monitoring of serum lithium levels is recommended. If a diuretic is also
used, it may increase the risk of lithium toxicity. </p>

<p>OTHER AGENTS: Drug interaction studies of Quinapril with other agents
showed: </p>

<p>-- Multiple dose therapy with propranolol or cimetidine has no effect
on the pharmacokinetics of single doses of Quinapril. </p>

<p>-- The anticoagulant effect of a single dose of warfarin (measured by
prothrombin time) was not significantly changed by quinapril coadministration
twice-daily. </p>

<p>-- Quinapril treatment did not affect the pharmacokinetics of digoxin.
</p>

<p>-- No pharmacokinetic interaction was observed when single doses of
Quinapril and hydrochlorothiazide were administered concomitantly. </p>

<p>CARCINOGENESIS, MUTAGENESIS, IMPAIRMENT OF FERTILITY </p>

<p>Quinapril hydrochloride was not carcinogenic in mice or rats when given
in doses up to 75 or 100 mg/kg/day (50 to 60 times the maximum human daily
dose, respectively, on an mg/kg basis and 3.8 to 10 times the maximum human
daily dose when based on an mg/M(square) basis) for 104 weeks. Female rats
given the highest dose level had an increased incidence of mesenteric lymph
node hemangiomas and skin/subcutaneous lipomas. Neither quinapril nor quinaprilat
were mutagenic in the Ames bacterial assay with or without metabolic activation.
Quinapril was also negative in the following genetic toxicology studies:
In Vitro mammalian cell point mutation, sister chromatid exchange in cultured
mammalian cells, micronucleus test with mice, In Vitro chromosome aberration
with V79 cultured lung cells, and in an In Vivo cytogenetic study with
rat bone marrow. There were no adverse effects on fertility or reproduction
in rats at doses up to 100 mg/kg/day (60 and 10 times the maximum daily
human dose when based on mg/kg and mg/M(square), respectively). </p>

<p>PREGNANCY </p>

<p>PREGNANCY CATEGORIES C (FIRST TRIMESTER) AND D (SECOND AND THIRD TRIMESTERS):
SEE WARNINGS, FETAL/NEONATAL MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY. </p>

<p>NURSING MOTHERS </p>

<p>It is not known if quinapril or its metabolites are secreted in human
milk. Quinapril is secreted to a limited extent, however, in milk of lactating
rats (5% or less of the plasma drug concentration was found in rat milk).
Because many drugs are secreted in human milk, caution should be exercised
when Quinapril is given to a nursing mother. </p>

<p>GERIATRIC USE </p>

<p>Elderly patients exhibited increased area under the plasma concentration
time curve (AUC) and peak levels for quinaprilat compared to values observed
in younger patients; this appeared to relate to decreased renal function
rather than to age itself. In controlled and uncontrolled studies of Quinapril
where 918 (21%) patients were 65 years and older, no overall differences
in effectiveness or safety were observed between older and younger patients.
However, greater sensitivity of some older individual patients cannot be
ruled out. </p>

<p>PEDIATRIC USE </p>

<p>The safety and effectiveness of Quinapril in children have not been
established. </p>

<p>ANGIOEDEMA </p>

<p>Angioedema has been reported in patients receiving Quinapril (0.1%).
Angioedema associated with laryngeal edema may be fatal. If angioedema
of the face, extremities, lips, tongue, glottis, and/or larynx occurs,
treatment with Quinapril should be discontinued and appropriate therapy
instituted immediately. (See WARNINGS.) </p>

<p>CLINICAL LABORATORY TEST FINDINGS </p>

<p>HEMATOLOGY: (See WARNINGS) </p>

<p>HYPERKALEMIA: (See PRECAUTIONS) </p>

<p>CREATININE AND BLOOD UREA NITROGEN: Increases (&gt;1.25 times the upper
limit of normal) in serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen were observed
in 2% and 2%, respectively, of all patients treated with Quinapril alone.
Increases are more likely to occur in patients receiving concomitant diuretic
therapy than in those on Quinapril alone. These increases often remit on
continued therapy. In controlled studies of heart failure, increases in
blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine were observed in 11% and 8%, respectively,
of patients treated with Quinapril; most often these patients were receiving
diuretics with or without digitalis. </p>

<p><a name="OVERDOSAGE"></a><b>OVERDOSAGE </b></p>

<p>No data are available with respect to overdosage in humans. Doses of
1440 to 4280 mg/kg of quinapril cause significant lethality in mice and
rats. </p>

<p>The most likely clinical manifestation would be symptoms attributable
to severe hypotension. </p>

<p>Laboratory determinations of serum levels of quinapril and its metabolites
are not widely available, and such determinations have, in any event, no
established role in the management of quinapril overdose. </p>

<p>No data are available to suggest physiological maneuvers (eg, maneuvers
to change pH of the urine) that might accelerate elimination of quinapril
and its metabolites. </p>

<p>Hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis have little effect on the elimination
of quinapril and quinaprilat. Angiotensin II could presumably serve as
a specific antagonist-antidote in the setting of quinapril overdose, but
angiotensin II is essentially unavailable outside of scattered research
facilities. Because the hypotensive effect of quinapril is achieved through
vasodilation and effective hypovolemia, it is reasonable to treat quinapril
overdose by infusion of normal saline solution. </p>

<p><a name="DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION"></a><b>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
</b></p>

<p>HYPERTENSION </p>

<p>MONOTHERAPY: The recommended initial dosage of Quinapril in patients
not on diuretics is 10 mg once daily. Dosage should be adjusted according
to blood pressure response measured at peak (2-6 hours after dosing) and
trough (predosing). Generally, dosage adjustments should be made at intervals
of at least 2 weeks. Most patients have required dosages of 20, 40, or
80 mg/day, given as a single dose or in two equally divided doses. In some
patients treated once daily, the antihypertensive effect may diminish toward
the end of the dosing interval. In such patients an increase in dosage
or twice daily administration may be warranted. In general, doses of 40-80
mg and divided doses give a somewhat greater effect at the end of the dosing
interval. </p>

<p>CONCOMITANT DIURETICS: If blood pressure is not adequately controlled
with Quinapril monotherapy, a diuretic may be added. In patients who are
currently being treated with a diuretic, symptomatic hypotension occasionally
can occur following the initial dose of Quinapril. To reduce the likelihood
of hypotension the diuretic should, if possible, be discontinued 2 to 3
days prior to beginning therapy with Quinapril (see WARNINGS). Then, if
blood pressure is not controlled with Quinapril alone, diuretic therapy
should be resumed. </p>

<p>If the diuretic cannot be discontinued, an initial dose of 5 mg Quinapril
should be used with careful medical supervision for several hours and until
blood pressure has stabilized. </p>

<p>The dosage should subsequently be titrated (as described above) to the
optimal response (see WARNINGS, PRECAUTIONS, and Drug Interactions). </p>

<p>RENAL IMPAIRMENT: Kinetic data indicate that the apparent elimination
half life of quinaprilat increases as creatinine clearance decreases. Recommended
starting doses, based on clinical and pharmacokinetic data from patients
with renal impairment, are as follows: </p>

<pre>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------   
                                                             Maximum            
Creatinine                                                 Recommended          
Clearance                                                 Initial Dose          
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------   
&gt;60 mL/min                                                   10 mg              
30-60 mL/min                                                  5 mg              
10-30 mL/min                                                 2.5 mg             
&lt;10 mL/min                                             Insufficient data        
                                                           for dosage           
                                                         recommendation         
----------------------------------------------------------------------------- </pre>

<p>Patients should subsequently have their dosage titrated (as described
above) to the optimal response. </p>

<p>ELDERLY (&gt;/=65 YEARS): The recommended initial dosage of Quinapril
in elderly patients is 10 mg given once daily followed by titration (as
described above) to the optimal response. </p>

<p>HEART FAILURE </p>

<p>Quinapril is indicated as adjunctive therapy when added to conventional
therapy including diuretics and/or digitalis. The recommended starting
dose is 5 mg twice daily. This dose may improve symptoms of heart failure,
but increases in exercise duration have generally required higher doses.
Therefore, if the initial dosage of Quinapril is well tolerated, patients
should then be titrated at weekly intervals until an effective dose, usually
20 to 40 mg daily given in two equally divided doses, is reached or undesirable
hypotension, orthostatis, or azotemia (see WARNINGS) prohibit reaching
this dose. </p>

<p>Following the initial dose of Quinapril, the patient should be observed
under medical supervision for at least two hours for the presence of hypotension
or orthostatis and, if present, until blood pressure stabilizes. The appearance
of hypotension, orthostasis, or azotemia early in dose titration should
not preclude further careful dose titration. Consideration should be given
to reducing the dose of concomitant diuretics. </p>

<p>DOSE ADJUSTMENTS IN PATIENTS WITH HEART FAILURE AND RENAL IMPAIRMENT
OR HYPONATREMIA </p>

<p>Pharmacokinetic data indicate that quinapril elimination is dependent
on level of renal function. In patients with heart failure and renal impairment,
the recommended initial dose of Quinapril is 5 mg in patients with a creatinine
clearance above 30 mL/min and 2.5 mg in patients with a creatinine clearance
of 10 to 30 mL/min. There is insufficient data for dosage recommendation
in patients with a creatinine clearance less than 10 mL/min. (See DOSAGE
AND ADMINISTRATION, Heart Failure, WARNINGS, and PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions.)
</p>

<p>If the initial dose is well tolerated, Quinapril may be administered
the following day as a twice daily regimen. In the absence of excessive
hypotension or significant deterioration of renal function, the dose may
be increased at weekly intervals based on clinical and hemodynamic response.</p>

<p><a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><b>DESCRIPTION </b></p>

<p>FOR INTRANASAL USE ONLY.</p>

<p> SHAKE GENTLY BEFORE USE.</p>

<p> Fluticasone propionate, the active ingredient of Fluticasone Nasal
Spray, is a glucocorticoid with the chemical name of S-fluoromethyl 6alpha,9alpha-difluoro-
11beta-hydroxy-16alpha- methyl-3-oxo-17alpha-propionyloxyandrosta- 1,4-diene-
17beta-carbothioate.</p>

<p> Fluticasone propionate is a white to off-white powder with a molecular
weight of 500.6. It is practically insoluble in water, freely soluble in
dimethyl sulfoxide and dimethylformamide, and slightly soluble in methanol
and 95% ethanol.</p>

<p><a name="ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY"></a><b> ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
</b></p>

<p>Fluticasone propionate is a synthetic, trifluorinated glucocorticoid
with anti- inflammatory activity. In Vitro dose response studies on a cloned
human glucocorticoid receptor system involving binding and gene expression
afforded 50% responses at 1.25 and 0.17 nM concentrations, respectively.
Fluticasone propionate was three- to five-fold more potent than dexamethasone
in these assays. Data from the McKenzie vasoconstrictor assay in man also
support its potent glucocorticoid activity.</p>

<p> In preclinical studies, fluticasone propionate revealed progesterone-like
activity similar to the natural hormone. However, the clinical significance
of these findings in relation to the low plasma levels (see Pharmacokinetics)
is not known.</p>

<p> The precise mechanism through which glucocorticoids affect allergic
rhinitis symptoms is not known. Glucocorticoids have been shown to have
a wide range of effects on multiple cell types (e.g., mast cells, eosinophils,
neutrophils, macrophages, and lymphocytes) and mediators (e.g., histamine,
eicosanoids, leukotrienes, and cytokines) involved in inflammation. In
seven trials, Fluticasone Nasal Spray has decreased nasal mucosal eosinophils
in 66% (35% for placebo) of patients and basophils in 39% (28% for placebo)
of patients. The direct relationship of these findings to long-term symptom
relief is not known.</p>

<p> Fluticasone Nasal Spray, like other glucocorticoids, is an agent that
does not have an immediate effect on allergic symptoms. A decrease in nasal
symptoms has been noted in some patients 12 hours after initial treatment
with Fluticasone Nasal Spray. Maximum benefit may not be reached for several
days. Similarly, when glucocorticoids are discontinued, symptoms may not
return for several days. </p>

<p>PHARMACOKINETICS: </p>

<p>ABSORPTION: The activity of Fluticasone Nasal Spray is due to the parent
drug, fluticasone propionate. Indirect calculations indicate that fluticasone
propionate delivered by the intranasal route has an absolute bioavailability
averaging less than 2%. After intranasal treatment of patients with allergic
rhinitis for 3 weeks, fluticasone propionate plasma concentrations were
above the level of detection (50 pg/mL) only when recommended doses were
exceeded and then only in occasional samples at low plasma levels. Due
to the low bioavailability by the intranasal route, the majority of the
pharmacokinetic data was obtained via other routes of administration. Studies
using oral dosing of radiolabeled drug have demonstrated that fluticasone
propionate is highly extracted from plasma and absorption is low. Oral
bioavailability is negligible, and the majority of the circulating radioactivity
is due to an inactive metabolite. </p>

<p>DISTRIBUTION: Following intravenous administration, the distribution
of fluticasone propionate follows a three-compartment open model with an
apparent volume of distribution of approximately 3.7 L/kg. The percentage
of fluticasone propionate bound to human plasma proteins averaged 91% with
no obvious concentration relationship. Fluticasone propionate is weakly
and reversibly bound to erythrocytes and freely equilibrates between erythrocytes
and plasma. Fluticasone propionate is not significantly bound to human
transcortin. </p>

<p>METABOLISM: The total blood clearance of fluticasone propionate approximates
that of liver blood flow, with renal clearance accounting for less than
1% of total. The only circulating metabolite detected in man is the 17beta-
carboxylic acid derivative of fluticasone propionate. This metabolite has
been shown to have negligible pharmacological activity in animal studies.
Other metabolites detected In Vitro using cultured human hepatoma cells
have not been detected in man. </p>

<p>EXCRETION: Following intravenous dosing, fluticasone propionate had
an elimination half- life of approximately 3 hours. Less than 5% of a radiolabeled
oral dose was excreted in the urine as metabolites, with the remainder
excreted in the feces as parent drug and metabolites. </p>

<p>SPECIAL POPULATIONS: Fluticasone propionate was not studied in any special
populations, and no gender-specific pharmacokinetic data have been obtained.
</p>

<p>PHARMACODYNAMICS: In a trial to evaluate the potential systemic and
topical effects of Fluticasone Nasal Spray on allergic rhinitis symptoms,
the benefits of comparable drug blood levels produced by Fluticasone Nasal
Spray and oral fluticasone propionate were compared. The doses used were
200 mcg of Fluticasone Nasal Spray, the nasal spray vehicle (plus oral
placebo), and 5 and 10 mg of oral fluticasone propionate (plus nasal spray
vehicle) per day for 14 days. Plasma levels were undetectable in the majority
of patients after intranasal dosing, but present at low levels in the majority
after oral dosing. Fluticasone Nasal Spray was significantly more effective
in reducing symptoms of allergic rhinitis than either the oral fluticasone
propionate or the nasal vehicle. This trial demonstrated that the therapeutic
effect of Fluticasone Nasal Spray can be attributed to the topical effects
of fluticasone propionate. In another trial, the potential systemic effects
of Fluticasone Nasal Spray on the hypothalamic- pituitary-adrenal (HPA)
axis were also studied in allergic patients. Fluticasone Nasal Spray given
as 200 mcg once daily or 400 mcg twice daily was compared with placebo
or oral prednisone 7.5 or 15 mg given in the morning. Fluticasone Nasal
Spray at either dose for 4 weeks did not affect the adrenal response to
6-hour cosyntropin stimulation, while both doses of oral prednisone significantly
reduced the response to cosyntropin. CLINICAL TRIALS: A total of 11 pivotal,
randomized, double-blind, parallel, multicenter, vehicle-controlled clinical
trials were conducted in adults and adolescents (children over 12 years
of age) with seasonal or perennial allergic rhinitis. The trials included
2,633 adults (1,439 men and 1,194 women) with mean age of 37 years (range,
18 to 79). A total of 440 adolescents (405 boys and 35 girls), mean age
of 14 (range, 12 to 17), were also studied. The overall racial distribution
was 88% white, 4% black, and 8% other. These trials evaluated the total
nasal symptoms scores (TNSS) that included rhinorrhea, nasal obstruction,
sneezing, and nasal itching in known allergic patients who were treated
for 2 to 24 weeks. Subjects treated with Fluticasone Nasal Spray noted
relief of these symptoms and exhibited significant decrease in TNSS. Nasal
mucosal basophils and eosinophils were also reduced at the end of treatment;
however, the clinical significance of this decrease is not known. </p>

<p>There were no significant differences between fluticasone propionate
regimens whether administered as a single daily dose of 200 mcg (two 50-mcg
sprays in each nostril) or as 100 mcg (one 50-mcg spray in each nostril)
twice daily in six clinical trials. A clear dose response could not be
identified in clinical trials. In one trial, 200 mcg per day was slightly
more effective than 50 mcg per day during the first few days of treatment;
thereafter, no difference was seen. Doses higher than 200 mcg per day were
not more effective. </p>

<p>INDIVIDUALIZATION OF DOSAGE: Patients may be started on a 200-mcg once-a-day
regimen (two 50-mcg sprays in each nostril once a day). An alternative
200-mcg per day dosage regimen can be given as 100 mcg twice daily (one
50-mcg spray in each nostril twice a day). Individual patients will experience
a variable time to onset and different degree of symptom relief. A decrease
in nasal symptoms may occur as soon as 12 hours after treatment onset.
Maximum effect may take several days. Patients who have responded may be
able to be maintained (after 4 to 7 days) on 100 mcg per day (one spray
in each nostril once daily). Most adolescents (12 years of age and older)
should be started with 100 mcg (one spray in each nostril). Treatment with
200 mcg (two sprays in each nostril once daily or one spray in each nostril
twice daily) should be reserved for adolescents not adequately responding
to 100 mcg daily or as a starting dosage for adolescents with more severe
symptoms. In the latter case, depending upon the patient's response, dosage
may be decreased to 100 mcg (one spray in each nostril) daily. Maximum
total daily doses should not exceed two sprays in each nostril (total dose,
200 mcg per day). There is no evidence that exceeding the recommended dose
is more effective.</p>

<p><a name="INDICATIONS AND USAGE"></a><b> INDICATIONS AND USAGE </b></p>

<p>Fluticasone Nasal Spray is indicated for the management of seasonal
and perennial allergic rhinitis in adults and adolescents 12 years of age
and older.</p>

<p> It is not indicated for the treatment of nonallergic rhinitis since
efficacy has not been adequately demonstrated in patients with this condition.</p>

<p> CHILDREN: It is not recommended for treatment of children below the
age of 12 years with either seasonal rhinitis or allergic or nonallergic
perennial rhinitis. Safety and effectiveness of Fluticasone Nasal Spray
in children below 12 years of age have not been adequately established.</p>

<p><a name="CONTRAINDICATIONS"></a><b> CONTRAINDICATIONS </b></p>

<p>Fluticasone Nasal Spray is contraindicated in patients with a hypersensitivity
to any of its ingredients.</p>

<p><a name="WARNINGS"></a><b> WARNINGS </b></p>

<p>The replacement of a systemic glucocorticoid with a topical glucocorticoid
can be accompanied by signs of adrenal insufficiency, and in addition some
patients may experience symptoms of withdrawal, e.g., joint and/or muscular
pain, lassitude, and depression. Patients previously treated for prolonged
periods with systemic glucocorticoids and transferred to topical glucocorticoids
should be carefully monitored for acute adrenal insufficiency in response
to stress. In those patients who have asthma or other clinical conditions
requiring long-term systemic glucocorticoid treatment, too rapid a decrease
in systemic glucocorticoids may cause a severe exacerbation of their symptoms.
</p>

<p>The use of Fluticasone Nasal Spray with alternate-day systemic prednisone
could increase the likelihood of HPA suppression compared with a therapeutic
dose of either one alone. Therefore, Fluticasone Nasal Spray should be
used with caution in patients already receiving alternate-day prednisone
treatment for any disease. In addition, the concomitant use of </p>

<p>Fluticasone Nasal Spray with other inhaled glucocorticoids could increase
the risk of signs or symptoms of hypercorticism and/or suppression of the
HPA axis. Patients who are on immunosuppressant drugs are more susceptible
to infections than healthy individuals. Chickenpox and measles, for example,
can have a more serious or even fatal course in patients on immunosuppressant
doses of corticosteroids. In such patients who have not had these diseases,
particular care should be taken to avoid exposure. How the dose, route,
and duration of corticosteroid administration affects the risk of developing
a disseminated infection is not known. The contribution of the underlying
disease and/or prior corticosteroid treatment to the risk is also not known.
If exposed to chickenpox, prophylaxis with varicella zoster immune globulin
(VZIG) may be indicated. If exposed to measles, prophylaxis with pooled
intramuscular immunoglobulin (IG) may be indicated. (See the respective
package inserts for complete VZIG and IG prescribing information). If chickenpox
develops, treatment with antiviral agents may be considered.</p>

<p><a name="PRECAUTIONS"></a><b> PRECAUTIONS </b></p>

<p>GENERAL: Rarely, immediate hypersensitivity reactions or contact dermatitis
may occur after the intranasal administration of fluticasone propionate.
Rare instances of wheezing, nasal septum perforation, cataracts, glaucoma,
and increased intraocular pressure have been reported following the intranasal
application of glucocorticoids. </p>

<p>Use of excessive doses of glucocorticoids may lead to signs or symptoms
of hypercorticism, suppression of HPA function, and/or suppression of growth
in children or teenagers. Knemometry studies in asthmatic children on orally
inhaled glucocorticoids showed inhibitory effects on short-term growth
rate. The relationship between short-term changes in lower leg growth and
long- term effects on growth is unclear at this time. Physicians should
closely follow the growth of adolescents taking glucocorticoids, by any
route, and weigh the benefits of glucocorticoid therapy against the possibility
of growth suppression if an adolescent's growth appears slowed. </p>

<p>Although systemic effects have been minimal with recommended doses of
Fluticasone Nasal Spray, potential risk increases with larger doses. Therefore,
larger than recommended doses of Fluticasone Nasal Spray should be avoided.
</p>

<p>When used at larger doses, systemic glucocorticoid effects such as hypercorticism
and adrenal suppression may appear. If such changes occur, the dosage of
Fluticasone Nasal Spray should be discontinued slowly consistent with accepted
procedures for discontinuing oral glucocorticoid therapy. </p>

<p>In clinical studies with fluticasone propionate administered intranasally,
the development of localized infections of the nose and pharynx with Candida
Albicans has occurred only rarely. When such an infection develops, it
may require treatment with appropriate local therapy and discontinuation
of treatment with Fluticasone Nasal Spray. Patients using Fluticasone Nasal
Spray over several months or longer should be examined periodically for
evidence of Candida infection or other signs of adverse effects on the
nasal mucosa. </p>

<p>Fluticasone Nasal Spray should be used with caution, if at all, in patients
with active or quiescent tuberculous infections; untreated fungal, bacterial,
or systemic viral infections; or ocular herpes simplex. </p>

<p>Because of the inhibitory effect of glucocorticoids on wound healing,
patients who have experienced recent nasal septal ulcers, nasal surgery,
or nasal trauma should not use a nasal glucocorticoid until healing has
occurred. </p>

<p>INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS: Patients being treated with Fluticasone Nasal
Spray should receive the following information and instructions. This information
is intended to aid them in the safe and effective use of this medication.
It is not a disclosure of all possible adverse or intended effects. Patients
should be warned to avoid exposure to chickenpox or measles and, if exposed,
to consult their physician without delay. Patients should use Fluticasone
Nasal Spray at regular intervals as directed since its effectiveness depends
on its regular use. A decrease in nasal symptoms may occur as soon as 12
hours after starting therapy with Fluticasone Nasal Spray. Results in several
clinical trials indicate statistically significant improvement within the
first day or two of treatment; however, the full benefit of Fluticasone
Nasal Spray may not be achieved until treatment has been administered for
several days. The patient should not increase the prescribed dosage but
should contact the physician if symptoms do not improve or if the condition
worsens. For the proper use of the nasal spray and to attain maximum improvement,
the patient should read and follow carefully the accompanying patient's
instructions. </p>

<p>CARCINOGENESIS, MUTAGENESIS, IMPAIRMENT OF FERTILITY: Fluticasone propionate
demonstrated no tumorigenic potential in studies of oral doses up to 1.0
mg/kg (3 mg/M(squared) as calculated on a surface area basis) for 78 weeks
in the mouse or inhalation of up to 57 mcg/kg (336 mcg/M(squared)) for
104 weeks in the rat. </p>

<p>Fluticasone propionate did not induce gene mutation in prokaryotic or
eukaryotic cells In Vitro. No significant clastogenic effect was seen in
cultured human peripheral lymphocytes In Vitro or in the mouse micronucleus
test when administered at high doses by the oral or subcutaneous routes.
Furthermore, the compound did not delay erythroblast division in bone marrow.
</p>

<p>No evidence of impairment of fertility was observed in reproductive
studies conducted in rats dosed subcutaneously with doses up to 50 mcg/kg
(295 mcg/M(squared)) in males and females. However, prostate weight was
significantly reduced in rats. </p>

<p>PREGNANCY: TERATOGENIC EFFECTS: PREGNANCY CATEGORY C: Subcutaneous studies
in the mouse and rat at 45 and 100 mcg/kg, respectively (135 and 590 mcg/M(squared),
respectively, as calculated on a surface area basis), revealed fetal toxicity
characteristic of potent glucocorticoid compounds, including embryonic
growth retardation, omphalocele, cleft palate, and retarded cranial ossification.
</p>

<p>In the rabbit, fetal weight reduction and cleft palate were observed
following subcutaneous doses of 4 mcg/kg (48 mcg/M(squared)). However,
following oral administration of up to 300 mcg/kg (3.6 mg/M(squared)) of
fluticasone propionate to the rabbit, there were no maternal effects nor
increased incidence of external, visceral, or skeletal fetal defects. No
fluticasone propionate was detected in the plasma in this study, consistent
with the established low bioavailability following oral administration
(see ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY). Less than 0.008% of the dose crosses
the placenta following oral administration to rats (100 mcg/kg, 590 mcg/M(squared))
or rabbits (300 mcg/kg, 3.6 mg/M(squared)). </p>

<p>There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women.
Fluticasone propionate should be used during pregnancy only if the potential
benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Experience with oral
glucocorticoids since their introduction in pharmacologic, as opposed to
physiologic, doses suggests that rodents are more prone to teratogenic
effects from glucocorticoids than humans. In addition, because there is
a natural increase in glucocorticoid production during pregnancy, most
women will require a lower exogenous glucocorticoid dose and many will
not need glucocorticoid treatment during pregnancy.</p>

<p> NURSING MOTHERS: It is not known whether fluticasone propionate is
excreted in human breast milk. Subcutaneous administration of tritiated
drug to lactating rats (10 mcg/kg, 59 mcg/M(squared)) resulted in measurable
radioactivity in both plasma and milk. Because other glucocorticoids are
excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Fluticasone Nasal
Spray is administered to a nursing woman.</p>

<p> PEDIATRIC USE: The safety and effectiveness of Fluticasone Nasal Spray
in children below 12 years of age have not been established. Oral glucocorticoids
have been shown to cause growth suppression in children and teenagers with
extended use. If a child or teenager on any glucocorticoid appears to have
growth suppression, the possibility that they are particularly sensitive
to this effect of glucocorticoids should be considered (see PRECAUTIONS).</p>

<p> GERIATRIC USE: A limited number of patients above 60 years of age (n=132)
have been treated with Fluticasone Nasal Spray in US and non-US clinical
trials. While the number of patients is too small to permit separate analysis
of efficacy and safety, the adverse reactions reported in this population
were similar to those reported by younger patients.</p>

<p><a name="ADVERSE REACTIONS"></a><b> ADVERSE REACTIONS </b></p>

<p>In controlled US studies, 2,427 patients received treatment with intranasal
fluticasone propionate. In general, adverse reactions in clinical studies
have been primarily associated with irritation of the nasal mucous membranes,
and the adverse reactions were reported with approximately the same frequency
by patients treated with the vehicle itself. The complaints did not usually
interfere with treatment. Less than 2% of patients in clinical trials discontinued
because of adverse events; this rate was similar for vehicle and active
comparators.</p>

<p> Systemic glucocorticoid side effects were not reported during controlled
clinical studies up to 6 months' duration with Fluticasone  Nasal Spray.
If recommended doses are exceeded, however, or if individuals are particularly
sensitive or if in conjunction with systemically administered glucocorticoids,
symptoms of hypercorticism, e.g., Cushing's syndrome, could occur.</p>

<p> The following incidence of common adverse reactions is based upon seven
controlled clinical trials in which 536 patients (57 girls and 108 boys
aged 4 to 11 years, 137 female and 234 male adolescents and adults) were
treated with Fluticasone Nasal Spray 200 mcg once daily over 2 to 4 weeks
and two controlled clinical trials in which 246 patients (119 female and
127 male adolescents and adults) were treated with Fluticasone Nasal Spray
200 mcg once daily over 6 months. </p>

<p>INCIDENCE GREATER THAN 1% (CAUSAL RELATIONSHIP POSSIBLE): RESPIRATORY:
Epistaxis, nasal burning (incidence 3% to 6%); blood in nasal mucus, pharyngitis,
nasal irritation (incidence 1% to 3%). </p>

<p>NEUROLOGICAL: Headache (incidence 1% to 3%). </p>

<p>INCIDENCE LESS THAN 1% (CAUSAL RELATIONSHIP POSSIBLE): RESPIRATORY:
Sneezing, runny nose, nasal dryness, sinusitis, nasal congestion, bronchitis,
nasal ulcer, nasal septum excoriation. </p>

<p>NEUROLOGICAL: Dizziness.</p>

<p> SPECIAL SENSES: Eye disorder, unpleasant taste.</p>

<p> DIGESTIVE: Nausea and vomiting, xerostomia.</p>

<p> SKIN AND APPENDAGES: Urticaria.</p>

<p> POSTMARKETING EXPERIENCE: In addition to the events from clinical trials,
the following have been reported during postmarketing experience.</p>

<p> Hypersensitivity reactions, including skin rash, edema of the face
and tongue, and rarely bronchospasm, have been reported.</p>

<p><a name="OVERDOSAGE"></a><b> OVERDOSAGE </b></p>

<p>There are no data available on the effects of acute or chronic overdosage
with Fluticasone Nasal Spray. Intranasal administration of 2 mg (10 times
the recommended dose) of fluticasone propionate twice daily for 7 days
to healthy human volunteers was well tolerated. Single oral doses up to
16 mg have been studied in human volunteers with no acute toxic effects
reported. Repeat oral doses up to 80 mg daily for 10 days in volunteers
and repeat oral doses up to 10 mg daily for 14 days in patients were well
tolerated. Adverse reactions were of mild or moderate severity, and incidences
were similar in active and placebo treatment groups. Acute overdosage with
this dosage form is unlikely since one bottle of Fluticasone Nasal Spray
contains approximately 8 mg of fluticasone propionate. Chronic overdosage
may result in signs/symptoms of hypercorticism (see PRECAUTIONS).</p>

<p><a name="DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION"></a><b> DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
</b></p>

<p>Patients should use Fluticasone Nasal Spray at regular intervals as
directed since its effectiveness depends on its regular use. </p>

<p>ADULTS AND ADOLESCENTS 12 YEARS OF AGE AND OLDER: The recommended starting
dosage in ADULTS is two sprays (50 mcg of fluticasone propionate each)
in each nostril once a day (total daily dose, 200 mcg). The same dosage
divided into 100 mcg given twice a day (e.g., 8 a.m. and 8 p.m.) is also
effective. After the first few days, patients may be able to reduce their
dosage to 100 mcg (one spray in each nostril) once daily for maintenance
therapy. </p>

<p>Most ADOLESCENTS should be started with 100 mcg (one spray in each nostril).
Adolescents not adequately responding to 100 mcg or adolescents with more
severe symptoms may use 200 mcg (two sprays in each nostril). Depending
upon the patient's response, dosage may be decreased to 100 mcg (one spray
in each nostril) daily. </p>

<p>The maximum total daily dosage should not exceed two sprays in each
nostril (200 mcg per day). (See Individualization of Dosage and Clinical
Trials Sections.) Fluticasone Nasal Spray is not recommended for children
under 12 years of age or for patients with nonallergic rhinitis.

<p><a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><b>DESCRIPTION </b></p>

<p>Timolol Ophthalmic Solution is a non-selective beta- adrenergic receptor
blocking agent. Its chemical name is (S)-1-((1,1- dimethylethyl)amino)-3-((4-(4-morpholinyl)-1,2,5-thiadiazol-3-yl)oxy)-2-
propanol (Z)-2-butenedioate (1:1) salt. Timolol maleate possesses an asymmetric
carbon atom in its structure and is provided as the levo isomer. Its empirical
formula is C13H24N4O3S.C4H4O4. </p>

<p>Timolol maleate has a molecular weight of 432.49. It is a white, odorless,
crystalline powder which is soluble in water, methanol, and alcohol. Timolol
is stable at room temperature. </p>

<p><a name="ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY"></a><b>ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
</b></p>

<p>Timolol maleate is a beta1 and beta2 (non-selective) adrenergic receptor
blocking agent that does not have significant intrinsic sympathomimetic,
direct myocardial depressant, or local anesthetic (membrane-stabilizing)
activity. </p>

<p>Beta-adrenergic receptor blockade reduces cardiac output in both healthy
subjects and patients with heart disease. In patients with severe impairment
of myocardial function beta-adrenergic receptor blockade may inhibit the
stimulatory effect of the sympathetic nervous system necessary to maintain
adequate cardiac function. </p>

<p>Beta-adrenergic receptor blockade in the bronchi and bronchioles results
in increased airway resistance from unopposed para-sympathetic activity.
Such an effect in patients with asthma or other bronchospastic conditions
is potentially dangerous. </p>

<p>Timolol Ophthalmic Solution, when applied topically in the eye, has
the action of reducing elevated as well as normal intraocular pressure,
whether or not accompanied by glaucoma. Elevated intraocular pressure is
a major risk factor in the pathogenesis of glaucomatous visual field loss.
The higher the level of intraocular pressure, the greater the likelihood
of glaucomatous visual field loss and optic nerve damage. </p>

<p>The onset of reduction in intraocular pressure following administration
of Timolol can usually be detected within one-half hour after a single
dose. The maximum effect usually occurs in one to two hours and significant
lowering of intraocular pressure can be maintained for periods as long
as 24 hours with a single dose. Repeated observations over a period of
one year indicate that the intraocular pressure-lowering effect of Timolol
is well maintained. </p>

<p>The precise mechanism of the ocular hypotensive action of Timolol is
not clearly established at this time. Tonography and fluorophotometry studies
in man suggest that its predominant action may be related to reduced aqueous
formation. However, in some studies a slight increase in outflow facility
was also observed. Unlike miotics, Timolol reduces intraocular pressure
with little or no effect on accommodation or pupil size. Thus, changes
in visual acuity due to increased accommodation are uncommon, and dim or
blurred vision and night blindness produced by miotics are not evident.
In addition, in patients with cataracts the inability to see around lenticular
opacities when the pupil is constricted is avoided. </p>

<p>In the clinical studies which are reported below, ocular pressure reductions
to less than 22 mmHg were used as a reasonable reference point to allow
comparisons between treatments. Reduction of ocular pressure to just below
22 mmHg may not be optimal for all patients; therapy should be individualized.
</p>

<p>In controlled multiclinic studies in patients with untreated intraocular
pressures of 22 mmHg or greater, Timolol 0.25 percent or 0.5 percent administered
twice a day produced a greater reduction in intraocular pressure than 1,
2, 3, or 4 percent pilocarpine solution administered four times a day or
0.5, 1, or 2 percent epinephrine hydrochloride solution administered twice
a day. </p>

<p>In the multiclinic studies comparing Timolol with pilocarpine, 61 percent
of patients treated with Timolol had intraocular pressure reduced to less
than 22 mmHg compared to 32 percent of patients treated with pilocarpine.
For patients completing these studies, the mean reduction in pressure at
the end of the study from pretreatment was 30.7 percent for patients treated
with Timolol and 21.7 percent for patients treated with pilocarpine. </p>

<p>In the multiclinic studies comparing Timolol with epinephrine, 69 percent
of patients treated with Timolol had intraocular pressure reduced to less
than 22 mmHg compared to 42 percent of patients treated with epinephrine.
For patients completing these studies, the mean reduction in pressure at
the end of the study from pretreatment was 33.2 percent for patients treated
with Timolol and 28.1 percent for patients treated with epinephrine. </p>

<p>In these studies, Timolol was generally well tolerated and produced
fewer and less severe side effects than either pilocarpine or epinephrine.
A slight reduction of resting heart rate in some patients receiving Timolol
(mean reduction 2.9 beats/minute standard deviation 10.2) was observed.
</p>

<p>Timolol has also been used in patients with glaucoma wearing conventional
(PMMA) hard contact lenses, and has generally been well tolerated. Timolol
has not been studied in patients wearing lenses made with materials other
than PMMA. (See PRECAUTIONS, Information For Patients.) </p>

<p><a name="INDICATIONS AND USAGE"></a><b>INDICATIONS AND USAGE </b></p>

<p>Timolol Ophthalmic Solution is indicated in the treatment of elevated
intraocular pressure in patients with ocular hypertension or open-angle
glaucoma. </p>

<p>Clinical trials have also shown that in patients who respond inadequately
to multiple antiglaucoma drug therapy the addition of Timolol may produce
a further reduction of intraocular pressure. </p>

<p><a name="CONTRAINDICATIONS"></a><b>CONTRAINDICATIONS </b></p>

<p>Timolol is contraindicated in patients with bronchial asthma or with
a history of bronchial asthma, or severe chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease (see WARNINGS); sinus bradycardia; second and third degree atrioventricular
block; overt cardiac failure (see WARNINGS); cardiogenic shock; hypersensitivity
to any component of this product. </p>

<p><a name="WARNINGS"></a><b>WARNINGS </b></p>

<p>As with other topically applied ophthalmic drugs, this drug may be absorbed
systemically. </p>

<p>THE SAME ADVERSE REACTIONS FOUND WITH SYSTEMIC ADMINISTRATION OF BETA
ADRENERGIC BLOCKING AGENTS MAY OCCUR WITH TOPICAL ADMINISTRATION. FOR EXAMPLE,
SEVERE RESPIRATORY REACTIONS AND CARDIAC REACTIONS, INCLUDING DEATH DUE
TO BRONCHOSPASM IN PATIENTS WITH ASTHMA, AND RARELY DEATH IN ASSOCIATION
WITH CARDIAC FAILURE, HAVE BEEN REPORTED FOLLOWING ADMINISTRATION OF Timolol
(SEE CONTRAINDICATIONS). </p>

<p>Cardiac Failure </p>

<p>Sympathetic stimulation may be essential for support of the circulation
in individuals with diminished myocardial contractility, and its inhibition
by beta-adrenergic receptor blockade may precipitate more severe failure.
</p>

<p>In Patients Without A History Of Cardiac Failure continued depression
of the myocardium with beta-blocking agents over a period of time can,
in some cases, lead to cardiac failure. At the first sign or symptom of
cardiac failure Timolol should be discontinued. </p>

<p>Obstructive Pulmonary Disease </p>

<p>PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (e.g., CHRONIC BRONCHITIS,
EMPHYSEMA) OF MILD OR MODERATE SEVERITY, BRONCHOSPASTIC DISEASE OR A HISTORY
OF BRONCHOSPASTIC DISEASE (OTHER THAN BRONCHIAL ASTHMA OR A HISTORY OF
BRONCHIAL ASTHMA, IN WHICH &quot;Timolol&quot; IS CONTRAINDICATED, see
CONTRAINDICATIONS), SHOULD IN GENERAL NOT RECEIVE BETA BLOCKERS, INCLUDING
&quot;Timolol&quot;. However, if Timolol is necessary in such patients,
then the drug should be administered with caution since it may block bronchodilation
produced by endogenous and exogenous catecholamine stimulation of beta2
receptors. </p>

<p>Major Surgery </p>

<p>The necessity or desirability of withdrawal of beta-adrenergic blocking
agents prior to major surgery is controversial. Beta-adrenergic receptor
blockade impairs the ability of the heart to respond to beta-adrenergically
mediated reflex stimuli. This may augment the risk of general anesthesia
in surgical procedures. Some patients receiving beta-adrenergic receptor
blocking agents have been subject to protracted severe hypotension during
anesthesia. Difficulty in restarting and maintaining the heartbeat has
also been reported. For these reasons, in patients undergoing elective
surgery, some authorities recommend gradual withdrawal of beta-adrenergic
receptor blocking agents. </p>

<p>If necessary during surgery, the effects of beta-adrenergic blocking
agents may be reversed by sufficient doses of such agonists as isoproterenol,
dopamine, dobutamine or levarterenol (see OVERDOSAGE). </p>

<p>Diabetes Mellitus </p>

<p>Beta-adrenergic blocking agents should be administered with caution
in patients subject to spontaneous hypoglycemia or to diabetic patients
(especially those with labile diabetes) who are receiving insulin or oral
hypoglycemic agents. Beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agents may mask
the signs and symptoms of acute hypoglycemia. </p>

<p>Thyrotoxicosis </p>

<p>Beta-adrenergic blocking agents may mask certain clinical signs (e.g.,
tachycardia) of hyperthyroidism. Patients suspected of developing thyrotoxicosis
should be managed carefully to avoid abrupt withdrawal of beta adrenergic
blocking agents which might precipitate a thyroid storm. </p>

<p><a name="PRECAUTIONS"></a><b>PRECAUTIONS </b></p>

<p>General </p>

<p>Patients who are receiving a beta-adrenergic blocking agent orally and
Timolol should be observed for a potential additive effect either on the
intraocular pressure or on the known systemic effects of beta blockade.
</p>

<p>Patients should not receive two topical ophthalmic beta-adrenergic blocking
agents concurrently (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). </p>

<p>Because of potential effects of beta-adrenergic blocking agents relative
to blood pressure and pulse, these agents should be used with caution in
patients with cerebrovascular insufficiency. If signs or symptoms suggesting
reduced cerebral blood flow develop following initiation of therapy with
Timolol, alternative therapy should be considered. </p>

<p>There have been reports of bacterial keratitis associated with the use
of multiple dose containers of topical ophthalmic products. These containers
had been inadvertently contaminated by patients who, in most cases, had
a concurrent corneal disease or a disruption of the ocular epithelial surface.
(See PRECAUTIONS, Information for Patients.) </p>

<p>In patients with angle-closure glaucoma, the immediate objective of
treatment is to reopen the angle. This requires constricting the pupil
with a miotic. Timolol has little or no effect on the pupil. When Timolol
is used to reduce elevated intraocular pressure in angle-closure glaucoma,
it should be used with a miotic and not alone. </p>

<p>As with the use of other antiglaucoma drugs, diminished responsiveness
to Timolol after prolonged therapy has been reported in some patients.
However, in one long-term study in which 96 patients have been followed
for at least 3 years, no significant difference in mean intraocular pressure
has been observed after initial stabilization. </p>

<p>Muscle Weakness: Beta-adrenergic blockade has been reported to potentiate
muscle weakness consistent with certain myasthenic symptoms (e.g., diplopia,
ptosis, and generalized weakness). Timolol has been reported rarely to
increase muscle weakness in some patients with myasthenia gravis or myasthenic
symptoms. </p>

<p>Information For Patients </p>

<p>Patients should be instructed to avoid allowing the tip of the dispensing
container to contact the eye or surrounding structures. </p>

<p>Patients should also be instructed that ocular solutions, if handled
improperly can become contaminated by common bacteria known to cause ocular
infections. Serious damage to the eye and subsequent loss of vision may
result from using contaminated solutions. (See PRECAUTIONS, General.) </p>

<p>Patients should also be advised that if they develop an intercurrent
ocular condition (e.g., trauma, ocular surgery or infection), they should
immediately seek their physician's advice concerning the continued use
of the present multidose container. </p>

<p>The preservative in Timolol, benzalkonium chloride, may be absorbed
by soft contact lenses. Patients wearing soft contact lenses should be
instructed to wait at least 15 minutes after instilling Timolol before
they insert their lenses. </p>

<p>Drug Interactions </p>

<p>Although Timolol used alone has little or no effect on pupil size, mydriasis
resulting from concomitant therapy with Timolol and epinephrine has been
reported occasionally. </p>

<p>Close observation of the patient is recommended when a beta blocker
is administered to patients receiving catecholamine-depleting drugs such
as reserpine, because of possible additive effects and the production of
hypotension and/or marked bradycardia, which may produce vertigo, syncope,
or postural hypotension. </p>

<p>Caution should be used in the coadministration of beta-adrenergic blocking
agents, such as Timolol, and oral or intravenous calcium antagonists, because
of possible atrioventricular conduction disturbances, left ventricular
failure, and hypotension. In patients with impaired cardiac function, coadministration
should be avoided. </p>

<p>The concomitant use of beta-adrenergic blocking agents with digitalis
and calcium antagonists may have additive effects in prolonging atrioventricular
conduction time. </p>

<p>Risk From Anaphylactic Reaction: While taking beta-blockers, patients
with a history of atopy or a history of severe anaphylactic reaction to
a variety of allergens may be more reactive to repeated accidental, diagnostic,
or therapeutic challenge with such allergens. Such patients may be unresponsive
to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat anaphylactic reactions.
</p>

<p>Animal Studies No adverse ocular effects were observed in rabbits and
dogs administered Timolol topically in studies lasting one and two years
respectively. </p>

<p>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment Of Fertility </p>

<p>In a two-year oral study of timolol maleate in rats, there was a statistically
significant increase in the incidence of adrenal pheochromocytomas in male
rats administered 300 mg/kg/day (250 times* the maximum recommended daily
human oral dose**). Similar differences were not observed in rats administered
oral doses equivalent to approximately 20 or 80 times* the maximum recommended
daily human oral dose. </p>

<p>In a lifetime oral study in mice, there were statistically significant
increases in the incidence of benign and malignant pulmonary tumors, benign
uterine polyps and mammary adenocarcinoma in female mice at 500 mg/kg/day,
(approximately 400 times* the maximum recommended daily human oral dose**),
but not at 5 or 50 mg/kg/day. In a subsequent study in female mice, in
which post mortem examinations were limited to uterus and lungs, a statistically
significant increase in the incidence of pulmonary tumors was again observed
at 500 mg/kg/day. The increased occurrence of mammary adenocarcinoma was
associated with elevations in serum prolactin which occurred in female
mice administered timolol at 500 mg/kg, but not at doses of 5 or 50 mg/kg/day.
An increased incidence of mammary adenocarcinomas in rodents has been associated
with administration of several other therapeutic agents which elevate serum
prolactin, but no correlation between serum prolactin levels and mammary
tumors has been established in man. Furthermore, in adult female human
subjects who received oral dosages of up to 60 mg of timolol maleate, the
maximum recommended daily human oral dosage, there were no clinically meaningful
changes in serum prolactin. </p>

<p>Timolol maleate was devoid of mutagenic potential when evaluated In
Vivo (mouse) in the micronucleus test and cytogenetic assay (doses up to
800 mg/kg) and In Vitro in a neoplastic cell transformation assay (up to
100 mcgm/mL). In Ames tests the highest concentrations of timolol employed,
5000 or 10,000 mcgm/plate, were associated with statistically significant
elevations of revertants observed with tester strain TA100 (in seven replicate
assays), but not in the remaining three strains. In the assays with tester
strain TA100, no consistent dose response relationship was observed, nor
did the ratio of test to control revertants reach 2. A ratio of 2 is usually
considered the criterion for a positive Ames test. </p>

<p>Reproduction and fertility studies in rats showed no adverse effect
on male or female fertility at doses up to 125 times* the maximum recommended
daily human oral dose. </p>

<p>---------- </p>

<p>*Based on patient weight of 50 kg </p>

<p>**The maximum recommended daily oral dose is 60 mg of timolol. One drop
of Timolol 0.5% contains about 1/300 of this dose which is about 0.2 mg.
</p>

<p>---------- </p>

<p>Pregnancy </p>

<p>Pregnancy Category C. Teratogenicity studies with timolol in mice and
rabbits at doses up to 50 mg/kg/day (approximately 40 times* the maximum
recommended daily human oral dose**) showed no evidence of fetal malformations.
Although delayed fetal ossification was observed at this dose in rats,
there were no adverse effects on postnatal development of offspring. Doses
of 1000 mg/kg/day (approximately 830 times* the maximum recommended daily
human oral dose**) were maternotoxic in mice and resulted in an increased
number of fetal resorptions. Increased fetal resorptions were also seen
in rabbits at doses of approximately 40 times* the maximum recommended
daily human oral dose, in this case without apparent maternotoxicity. There
are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Timolol
should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies
the potential risk to the fetus. </p>

<p>Nursing Mothers </p>

<p>Timolol maleate has been detected in human milk following oral and ophthalmic
drug administration. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions
from Timolol in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue
nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance
of the drug to the mother. </p>

<p>Pediatric Use </p>

<p>Safety and effectiveness in children have not been established by adequate
and well-controlled studies. </p>

<p><a name="DRUG INTERACTIONS"></a><b>DRUG INTERACTIONS </b></p>

<p>Although Timolol used alone has little or no effect on pupil size, mydriasis
resulting from concomitant therapy with Timolol and epinephrine has been
reported occasionally. </p>

<p>Close observation of the patient is recommended when a beta blocker
is administered to patients receiving catecholamine-depleting drugs such
as reserpine, because of possible additive effects and the production of
hypotension and/or marked bradycardia, which may produce vertigo, syncope,
or postural hypotension. </p>

<p>Caution should be used in the coadministration of beta-adrenergic blocking
agents, such as Timolol, and oral or intravenous calcium antagonists, because
of possible atrioventricular conduction disturbances, left ventricular
failure, and hypotension. In patients with impaired cardiac function, coadministration
should be avoided. </p>

<p>The concomitant use of beta-adrenergic blocking agents with digitalis
and calcium antagonists may have additive effects in prolonging atrioventricular
conduction time. </p>

<p>Causal Relationship Unknown: The following adverse effects have been
reported, and a causal relationship to therapy with Timolol has not been
established: Cardiovascular: Hypertension, pulmonary edema, worsening of
angina pectoris; Digestive: Dyspepsia, anorexia, dry mouth; Nervous System/Psychiatric:
Behavioral changes including confusion, hallucinations, anxiety, disorientation
nervousness, somnolence, and other psychic disturbances; Special Senses:
Aphakic cystoid macular edema; Urogenital: Retroperitoneal fibrosis, impotence.
</p>

<p>The following additional adverse effects have been reported in clinical
experience with oral timolol maleate, and may be considered potential effects
of ophthalmic timolol maleate: Body As A Whole: Extremity pain, decreased
exercise tolerance, weight loss; Cardiovascular: Edema, worsening of arterial

Allergic: Erythematous rash, fever combined with aching and sore throat,
laryngospasm with respiratory distress; Urogenital: Peyronie's disease.
</p>

<p>There have been reports of a syndrome comprising psoriasiform skin rash,
conjunctivitis sicca, otitis and sclerosing serositis attributed to the
beta- adrenergic receptor blocking agent, practolol. This syndrome has
not been reported with timolol maleate. </p>

<p><a name="OVERDOSAGE"></a><b>OVERDOSAGE </b></p>

<p>There have been reports of inadvertent overdosage with Timolol Ophthalmic
Solution resulting in systemic effects such as dizziness, headache, shortness
of breath, bradycardia, bronchospasm, and cardiac arrest. </p>

<p>Overdosage has been reported with oral timolol tablets. A 30 year old
female ingested 650 mg of Timolol (maximum recommended oral daily dose
is 60 mg) and experienced second and third degree heart block. She recovered
without treatment but approximately two months later developed irregular
heartbeat, hypertension, dizziness, tinnitus, faintness, increased pulse
rate, and borderline first degree heart block. </p>

<p>The oral LD50 of the drug is 1190 and 900 mg/kg in female mice and female
rats, respectively. </p>

<p>An In Vitro hemodialysis study, using 14C timolol added to human plasma
or whole blood, showed that timolol was readily dialyzed from these fluids;
however, a study of patients with renal failure showed that timolol did
not dialyze readily. </p>

<p>The most common signs and symptoms to be expected with overdosage with
administration of a systemic beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agent are
symptomatic bradycardia, hypotension, bronchospasm, and acute cardiac failure.
The following therapeutic measures should be considered: </p>

<p>(1) Gastric Lavage: If ingested. </p>

<p>(2) Symptomatic Bradycardia: Use atropine sulfate intravenously in a
dosage of 0.25 mg to 2 mg to induce vagal blockade. If bradycardia persists,
intravenous isoproterenol hydrochloride should be administered cautiously.
In refractory cases the use of a transvenous cardiac pacemaker may be considered.
</p>

<p>(3) Hypotension: Use sympathomimetic pressor drug therapy, such as dopamine,
dobutamine or levarterenol. In refractory cases the use of glucagon hydrochloride
has been reported to be useful. </p>

<p>(4) Bronchospasm: Use isoproterenol hydrochloride. Additional therapy
with aminophylline may be considered. </p>

<p>(5) Acute Cardiac Failure: Conventional therapy with digitalis, diuretics,
and oxygen should be instituted immediately. In refractory cases the use
of intravenous aminophylline is suggested. This may be followed if necessary
by glucagon hydrochloride which has been reported to be useful. </p>

<p>(6) Heart Block (Second Or Third Degree): Use isoproterenol hydrochloride
or a transvenous cardiac pacemaker. </p>

<p><a name="DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION"></a><b>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
</b></p>

<p>Timolol Ophthalmic Solution is available in concentrations of 0.25 and
0.5 percent. The usual starting dose is one drop of 0.25 percent Timolol
in the affected eye(s) twice a day. If the clinical response is not adequate,
the dosage may be changed to one drop of 0.5 percent solution in the affected
eye(s) twice a day. </p>

<p>Since in some patients the pressure-lowering response to Timolol may
require a few weeks to stabilize, evaluation should include a determination
of intraocular pressure after approximately 4 weeks of treatment with Timolol.
</p>

<p>If the intraocular pressure is maintained at satisfactory levels, the
dosage schedule may be changed to one drop once a day in the affected eye(s).
Because of diurnal variations in intraocular pressure, satisfactory response
to the once-a-day dose is best determined by measuring the intraocular
pressure at different times during the day. </p>

<p>Dosages above one drop of 0.5 percent Timolol twice a day generally
have not been shown to produce further reduction in intraocular pressure.
If the patient's intraocular pressure is still not at a satisfactory level
on this regimen, concomitant therapy with pilocarpine and other miotics,
and/or epinephrine, and/or systemically administered carbonic anhydrase
inhibitors, such as acetazolamide, can be instituted. </p>

<p>WHEN A PATIENT IS TRANSFERRED FROM ANOTHER TOPICAL OPHTHALMIC BETA-ADRENERGIC
BLOCKING AGENT, that agent should be discontinued after proper dosing on
one day and treatment with Timolol started on the following day with 1
drop of 0.25 percent Timolol in the affected eye(s) twice a day. The dose
may be increased to one drop of 0.5 percent Timolol twice a day if the
clinical response is not adequate. </p>

<p>WHEN A PATIENT IS TRANSFERRED FROM A SINGLE ANTIGLAUCOMA AGENT, other
than a topical ophthalmic beta-adrenergic blocking agent, continue the
agent already being used and add one drop of 0.25 percent Timolol in the
affected eye(s) twice a day. On the following day, discontinue the previously
used antiglaucoma agent completely and continue with Timolol. If a higher
dosage of Timolol is required, substitute one drop of 0.5 percent solution
in the affected eye(s) twice a day. </p>

<p>WHEN A PATIENT IS TRANSFERRED FROM SEVERAL CONCOMITANTLY ADMINISTERED
ANTIGLAUCOMA AGENTS, individualization is required. If any of the agents
is an ophthalmic beta-adrenergic blocker, it should be discontinued before
starting Timolol. Additional adjustments should involve one agent at a
time and usually should be made at intervals of not less than one week.
A recommended approach is to continue the agents being used and to add
one drop of 0.25 percent Timolol in the affected eye(s) twice a day. On
the following day, discontinue one of the other antiglaucoma agents. The
remaining antiglaucoma agents may be decreased or discontinued according
to the patient's response to treatment. If a higher dosage of Timolol is
required, substitute one drop of 0.5 percent solution in the affected eye(s)
twice a day. The physician may be able to discontinue some or all of the
other antiglaucoma agents. </p>

 <a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><b>DESCRIPTION 

</b> <p>

INFORMATION FOR THE PATIENT 

 <p>

WARNINGS 

 <p>

ANY CHANGE OF INSULIN SHOULD BE MADE CAUTIOUSLY AND ONLY UNDER MEDICAL

SUPERVISION. CHANGES IN PURITY, STRENGTH, BRAND (MANUFACTURER), TYPE (REGULAR,

NPH, LENTE(R), ETC), SPECIES (BEEF, PORK, BEEF-PORK, HUMAN), AND/OR METHOD OF

MANUFACTURE (RECOMBINANT DNA VERSUS ANIMAL-SOURCE INSULIN) MAY RESULT IN THE

NEED FOR A CHANGE IN DOSAGE.  

 <p>

SOME PATIENTS TAKING HUMAN INSULIN (RECOMBINANT DNA ORIGIN) MAY

REQUIRE A CHANGE IN DOSAGE FROM THAT USED WITH ANIMAL-SOURCE INSULINS. IF AN

ADJUSTMENT IS NEEDED, IT MAY OCCUR WITH THE FIRST DOSE OR DURING THE FIRST

SEVERAL WEEKS OR MONTHS.  

 <p>

DIABETES 

 <p>

Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas, a large gland that lies near the 

stomach. This hormone is necessary for the body's correct use of food,

especially sugar. Diabetes occurs when the pancreas does not make enough

insulin to meet your body's needs.  

 <p>

To control your diabetes, your doctor has prescribed injections of insulin to

keep your blood glucose at a nearly normal level. Proper control of your

diabetes requires close and constant cooperation with your doctor. In spite of

diabetes, you can lead an active, healthy, and useful life if you eat a

balanced diet daily, exercise regularly, and take your insulin injections as

prescribed.  

 <p>

You have been instructed to test your blood and/or your urine regularly for

glucose. If your blood tests consistently show above- or below-normal glucose

levels or your urine tests consistently show the presence of glucose, your

diabetes is not properly controlled and you must let your doctor know.  

 
<p>
Always keep an extra supply of insulin as well as a spare syringe and needle on 

hand. Always wear diabetic identification so that appropriate treatment can be

given if complications occur away from home.  

 <p>

NPH HUMAN INSULIN 
<p>
 

Human Insulin is synthesized in a special non-disease-producing laboratory strain of

Escherichia Coli bacteria that has been genetically altered by the addition of

the gene for human insulin production. Human Insulin NPH is a crystalline suspension of 

human insulin with protamine and zinc providing an intermediate-acting insulin

with a slower onset of action and a longer duration of activity (up to 24

hours) than that of regular insulin. The time course of action of any insulin

may vary considerably in different individuals or at different times in the

same individual. As with all insulin preparations, the duration of action of

Human Insulin NPH is dependent on dose, site of injection, blood supply, temperature,

and physical activity. Human Insulin NPH is a sterile suspension and is for

subcutaneous injection only. It should not be used intravenously or

intramuscularly. The concentration of Human Insulin NPH is 100 units/mL (U-100).  

 <p>

<b>IDENTIFICATION 

</b> <p>

Your doctor has prescribed the type of insulin that he/she believes is best for 

you. DO NOT USE ANY OTHER INSULIN EXCEPT ON HIS/HER ADVICE AND DIRECTION.  

 <p>

Always check the carton and the bottle label for the name and letter

designation of the insulin you receive from your pharmacy to make sure it is

the same as that your doctor has prescribed.<p>

 

Always examine the appearance of your bottle of insulin before withdrawing each 

dose. A bottle of Human Insulin NPH must be carefully shaken or rotated before each

injection so that the contents are uniformly mixed. Human Insulin NPH should look

uniformly cloudy or milky after mixing. Do not use it if the insulin substance

(the white material) remains at the bottom of the bottle after mixing. Do not

use a bottle of Human Insulin NPH if there are clumps in the insulin after mixing

Do not use a bottle of Human Insulin NPH if solid white particles stick to

the bottom or wall of the bottle, giving it a frosted appearance. 

Always check the appearance of your bottle of insulin before using, and if you

note anything unusual in the appearance of your insulin or notice your insulin

requirements changing markedly, consult your doctor.  
<p>
 

<b>STORAGE 

</b> <p>

Insulin should be stored in a refrigerator but not in the freezer. If

refrigeration is not possible, the bottle of insulin that you are currently

using can be kept unrefrigerated as long as it is kept as cool as possible

(below 86 degF (30 degC)) and away from heat and light. Do not use insulin if

it has been frozen. Do not use a bottle of insulin after the expiration date

stamped on the label.  

 
<p>
<a name="DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION"></a><b>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION 

</b> <p>

INJECTION PROCEDURES 

 <p>

CORRECT SYRINGE 

 
<p>
Doses of insulin are measured in UNITS. U-100 insulin contains 100 units/mL (1

mL = 1 cc). With Human Insulin NPH, it is important to use a syringe that is marked for 

U-100 insulin preparations. Failure to use the proper syringe can lead to a

mistake in dosage, causing serious problems for you, such as a blood glucose

level that is too low or too high.  

 <p>

SYRINGE USE 

<p>

To help avoid contamination and possible infection, follow these instructions

exactly.  <p>

 

Disposable syringes and needles should be used only once and then discarded. 

NEEDLES AND SYRINGES MUST NOT BE SHARED.  

 <p>

Reusable syringes and needles must be sterilized before each injection. FOLLOW

THE PACKAGE DIRECTIONS SUPPLIED WITH YOUR SYRINGE. Described below are 2

methods of sterilizing.  
<p>
 

BOILING 

 <p>

1. Put syringe, plunger, and needle in strainer, place in saucepan, and cover

with water. Boil for 5 minutes.  

 
<p>
2. Remove articles from water. When they have cooled, insert plunger into

barrel, and fasten needle to syringe with a slight twist.  

 <p>

3. Push plunger in and out several times until water is completely removed.  

 <p>

ISOPROPYL ALCOHOL 

 <p>

If the syringe, plunger, and needle cannot be boiled, as when you are traveling 

they may be sterilized by immersion for at least 5 minutes in Isopropyl

Alcohol, 91%. Do not use bathing, rubbing, or medicated alcohol for this

sterilization.  If the syringe is sterilized with alcohol, it must be

absolutely dry before use.  <p>

 

PREPARING THE DOSE 

 <p>

1. Wash your hands.  
<p>
 

2. Carefully shake or rotate the insulin bottle several times to completely mix 

the insulin.  

 <p>

3. Inspect the insulin. Human Insulin NPH should look uniformly cloudy or milky. Do not 

use it if you notice anything unusual in the appearance.  

 
<p>
4. If using a new bottle, flip off the plastic protective cap, but DO NOT

remove the stopper. When using a new bottle, wipe the top of the bottle with an 

alcohol swab.  

 <p>

5. If you are mixing insulins, refer to the instructions for mixing that

follow.  

 
<p>
6. Draw air into the syringe equal to your insulin dose. Put the needle through 

rubber top of the insulin bottle and inject the air into the bottle.  

 <p>

7. Turn the bottle and syringe upside down. Hold the bottle and syringe firmly

in 1 hand and shake gently.  

 
<p>
8. Making sure the tip of the needle is in the insulin, withdraw the correct

dose of insulin into the syringe.  

 <p>

9. Before removing the needle from the bottle, check your syringe for air

bubbles which reduce the amount of insulin in it. If bubbles are present, hold

the syringe straight up and tap its side until the bubbles float to the top. 

Push them out with the plunger and withdraw the correct dose.  

 
<p>
10. Remove the needle from the bottle and lay the syringe down so that the

needle does not touch anything.  
<p>
 

MIXING Human Insulin NPH AND REGULAR HUMAN INSULIN 

 
<p>
1. NPH human insulin should be mixed only with regular human insulin.  

 <p>

2. Draw air into your syringe equal to the amount of Human Insulin NPH you are taking.  

Insert the needle into the Human Insulin NPH bottle and inject the air. Withdraw the

needle.  
<p>
 

3. Now inject air into your regular human insulin bottle in the same manner,

but DO NOT withdraw the needle.  

 
<p>
4. Turn the bottle and syringe upside down.  

 <p>

5. Making sure the tip of the needle is in the insulin, withdraw the correct

dose of regular insulin into the syringe.  

 <p>

6. Before removing the needle from the bottle, check your syringe for air

bubbles which reduce the amount of insulin in it. If bubbles are present, hold

the syringe straight up and tap its side until the bubbles float to the top. 

Push them out with the plunger and withdraw the correct dose.  

 
<p>
7. Remove the needle from the bottle of regular insulin and insert it into the

bottle of Human Insulin NPH. Turn the bottle and syringe upside down. Hold the bottle

and syringe firmly in 1 hand and shake gently. Making sure the tip of the

needle is in the insulin, withdraw your dose of Human Insulin NPH.  

 <p>

8. Remove the needle and lay the syringe down so that the needle does not touch 

anything.  

 <p>

Follow your doctor's instructions on whether to mix your insulins ahead of time 

or just before giving your injection. It is important to be consistent in your

method.  

 <p>

Syringes from different manufacturers may vary in the amount of space between

the bottom line and the needle. Because of this, do not change:  

 <p>

--the sequence of mixing, or 

 <p>

--the model and brand of syringe or needle that the doctor has prescribed.  

 <p>

INJECTION 

 <p>

Cleanse the skin with alcohol where the injection is to be made. Stabilize the

skin by spreading it or pinching up a large area. Insert the needle as

instructed by your doctor. Push the plunger in as far as it will go. Pull the

needle out and apply gentle pressure over the injection site for several

seconds. DO NOT RUB THE AREA. To avoid tissue damage, give the next injection

at a site at least 1/2&quot; from the previous site.  
<p>
 

<b>DOSAGE 

<p>

</b>Your doctor has told you which insulin to use, how much, and when and how often 

to inject it. Because each patient's case of diabetes is different, this

schedule has been individualized for you.  

 <p>

Your usual insulin dose may be affected by changes in your food, activity, or

work schedule. Carefully follow your doctor's instructions to allow for these

changes. Other things that may affect your insulin dose are:  

 <p>

<b>ILLNESS 

</b> 
<p>
Illness, especially with nausea and vomiting, may cause your insulin

requirements to change. Even if you are not eating, you will still require

insulin. You and your doctor should establish a sick day plan for you to use in 

case of illness. When you are sick, test your blood/urine frequently and call

your doctor as instructed.  

 <p>

<b>PREGNANCY 

</b> <p>

Good control of diabetes is especially important for you and your unborn baby.  

Pregnancy may make managing your diabetes more difficult. If you are planning

to have a baby, are pregnant, or are nursing a baby, consult your doctor.  

 <p>

<b>MEDICATION 

</b> <p>

Insulin requirements may be increased if you are taking other drugs with

hyperglycemic activity, such as oral contraceptives, corticosteroids, or

thyroid replacement therapy. Insulin requirements may be reduced in the

presence of drugs with hypoglycemic activity, such as oral hypoglycemics,

salicylates (for example, aspirin), sulfa antibiotics, and certain

antidepressants. Always discuss any medications you are taking with your

doctor.  

 <p>

<b>EXERCISE 

</b> <p>

Exercise may lower your body's need for insulin during and for some time after

the activity. Exercise may also speed up the effect of an insulin dose,

especially if the exercise involves the area of injection site (for example,

the leg should not be used for injection just prior to running). Discuss with

your doctor how you should adjust your regimen to accomodate exercise.  

 v

<b>TRAVEL 

</b> <p>

Persons traveling across more than 2 time zones should consult their doctor

concerning adjustments in their insulin schedule.  
<p>
 

<b>COMMON PROBLEMS OF DIABETES 

</b> 
<p>
HYPOGLYCEMIA (INSULIN REACTION) 

 <p>

Hypoglycemia (too little glucose in the blood) is one of the most frequent

adverse events experienced by insulin users. It can be brought about by:  
<p>
 

1. Taking too much insulin 

 <p>

2. Missing or delaying meals 

 <p>

3. Exercising or working more than usual 

 <p>

4. An infection or illness (especially with diarrhea or vomiting) 
<p>
 

5. A change in the body's need for insulin 

 
<p>
6. Diseases of the adrenal, pituitary, or thyroid gland, or progression of

kidney or liver disease 

 <p>

7. Interactions with other drugs that lower blood glucose, such as oral

hypoglycemics, salicylates (for example, aspirin), sulfa antibiotics, and

certain antidepressants 

 <p>

8. Consumption of alcoholic beverages 

 <p>

Symptoms of mild to moderate hypoglycemia may occur suddenly and can include: 

 <p>

--sweating 

 <p>

--dizziness 

 <p>

--palpitation 
<p>
 

--tremor

Signs of severe hypoglycemia can include:  

<p>

--disorientation 

 
<p>
--unconsciousness 

 <p>

--seizures 

 
<p>

Therefore, it is important that assistance be obtained immediately.  

 <p>

Early warning symptoms of hypoglycemia may be different or less pronounced

under certain conditions, such as long duration of diabetes, diabetic nerve

disease, medications such as beta-blockers, change in insulin preparations, or

intensified control (3 or more insulin injections per day) of diabetes.  

 
<p>
A FEW PATIENTS WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED HYPOGLYCEMIC REACTIONS AFTER TRANSFER FROM

ANIMAL-SOURCE INSULIN TO HUMAN INSULIN HAVE REPORTED THAT THE EARLY WARNING

SYMPTOMS OF HYPOGLYCEMIA WERE LESS PRONOUNCED OR DIFFERENT FROM THOSE

EXPERIENCED WITH THEIR PREVIOUS INSULIN.  

 <p>

Without recognition of early warning symptoms, you may not be able to take

steps to avoid more serious hypoglycemia. Be alert for all of the various types 

of symptoms that may indicate hypoglycemia. Patients who experience

hypoglycemia without early warning symptoms should monitor their blood glucose

frequently, especially prior to activities such as driving. If the blood

glucose is below your normal fasting glucose, you should consider eating or

drinking sugar- containing foods to treat your hypoglycemia.  

 <p>

Mild to moderate hypoglycemia may be treated by eating foods or drinks that

contain sugar. Patients should always carry a quick source of sugar, such as

candy mints or glucose tablets. More severe hypoglycemia may require the

assistance of another person. Patients who are unable to take sugar orally or

who are unconscious require an injection of glucagon or should be treated with

intravenous administration of glucose at a medical facility.  
<p>
 

You should learn to recognize your own symptoms of hypoglycemia. If you are

uncertain about these symptoms, you should monitor your blood glucose

frequently to help you learn to recognize the symptoms that you experience with 

hypoglycemia.  

 
<p>
If you have frequent episodes of hypoglycemia or experience difficulty in

recognizing the symptoms, you should consult your doctor to discuss possible

changes in therapy, meal plans, and/or exercise programs to help you avoid

hypoglycemia.  

 <p>

HYPERGLYCEMIA AND DIABETIC ACIDOSIS 

 <p>

Hyperglycemia (too much glucose in the blood) may develop if your body has too

little insulin. Hyperglycemia can be brought about by:  
<p>
 

1. Omitting your insulin or taking less than the doctor has prescribed 
<p>
 

2. Eating significantly more than your meal plan suggests 

 <p>

3. Developing a fever or infection 

<p>

In patients with insulin-dependent diabetes, prolonged hyperglycemia can result 

in diabetic acidosis. The first symptoms of diabetic acidosis usually come on

gradually, over a period of hours or days, and include a drowsy feeling,

flushed face, thirst, loss of appetite, and fruity odor on the breath. With

acidosis, urine tests show large amounts of glucose and acetone. Heavy

breathing and a rapid pulse are more severe symptoms. If uncorrected, prolonged 

hyperglycemia or diabetic acidosis can result in loss of consciousness or

death. Therefore, it is important that you obtain medical assistance

immediately.  

 <p>

LIPODYSTROPHY 
<p>
 

Rarely, administration of insulin subcutaneously can result in lipoatrophy

(depression in the skin) or lipohypertrophy (enlargement or thickening of

tissue). If you notice either of these conditions, consult your doctor. A

change in your injection technique may help alleviate the problem.  

 <p>

ALLERGY TO INSULIN 
<p>
 

Local Allergy--Patients occasionally experience redness, swelling, and itching

at the site of injection of insulin. This condition, called local allergy,

usually clears up in a few days to a few weeks. In some instances, this

condition may be related to factors other than insulin, such as irritants in

the skin cleansing agent or poor injection technique. If you have local

reactions, contact your doctor.  

 <p>

Systemic Allergy--Less common, but potentially more serious, is generalized

allergy to insulin, which may cause rash over the whole body, shortness of

breath, wheezing, reduction in blood pressure, fast pulse, or sweating. Severe

cases of generalized allergy may be life threatening. If you think you are

having a generalized allergic reaction to insulin, notify a doctor immediately.

<p><a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>DESCRIPTION </p>

<p>Loracarbef is a synthetic beta-lactam antibiotic of the carbacephem
class for oral administration. Chemically, carbacephems differ from cephalosporin-class
antibiotics in the dihydrothiazine ring where a methylene group has been
substituted for a sulfur atom. </p>

<p>The chemical name for loracarbef is (6R, 7S)-7-((R)-2-amino-2-phenylacetamido)-
3-chloro-8-oxo-1-azabicyclo(4.2.0) oct-2-ene-2-carboxylic acid, monohydrate.
It is a white crystalline compound with a molecular weight of 367.8. The
empirical formula is C16O4N3H16Cl.H2O. </p>

<p><a name="ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY"></a>ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
</p>

<p>Loracarbef, after oral administration, was approximately 90% absorbed
from the gastrointestinal tract. When capsules were taken with food, peak
plasma concentrations were 50% to 60% of those achieved when the drug was
administered to fasting subjects and occurred from 30 to 60 minutes later.
Total absorption, as measured by urinary recovery and area under the plasma
concentration versus time curve (AUC), was unchanged. The effect of food
on the rate and extent of absorption of the suspension formulation has
not been studied to date. </p>

<p>The pharmacokinetics of loracarbef were linear over the recommended
dosage range of 200 to 400 mg, with no accumulation of the drug noted when
it was given twice daily. </p>

<p>Average peak plasma concentrations after administration of 200-mg or
400-mg single doses of loracarbef as capsules to fasting subjects were
approximately 8 and 14 mcgm/mL, respectively, and were obtained within
1.2 hours after dosing. The average peak plasma concentration in adults
following a 400-mg single dose of suspension was 17 mcgm/mL and was obtained
within 0.8 hour after dosing (See Table). </p>

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------   </font></pre>

<p>Following administration of 7.5 and 15 mg/kg single doses of oral suspension
to children, average peak plasma concentrations were 13 and 19 mcgm/mL,
respectively, and were obtained within 40 to 60 minutes. </p>

<p>This increased rate of absorption (suspension &gt; capsule) should be
taken into consideration if the oral suspension is to be substituted for
the capsule, and capsules should not be substituted for the oral suspension
in the treatment of otitis media (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). </p>

<p>The elimination half-life was an average of 1.0 h in patients with normal
renal function. Concomitant administration of probenecid decreased the
rate of urinary excretion and increased the half-life to 1.5 hours. </p>

<p>In subjects with moderate impairment of renal function (creatinine clearance
10 to 50 mL/min/1.73 M(square)), following a single 400-mg dose, the plasma
half life was prolonged to approximately 5.6 hours. In subjects with severe
renal impairment (creatinine clearance &lt;10 mL/min/1.73 M(square)), the
half-life was increased to approximately 32 hours. During hemodialysis
the half-life was approximately 4 hours. In patients with severe renal
impairment, the Cmax increased from 15.4 mcgm/mL to 23 mcgm/mL (See PRECAUTIONS
And DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). </p>

<p>In single-dose studies, plasma half-life and AUC were not significantly
altered in healthy elderly subjects with normal renal function. </p>

<p>There is no evidence of metabolism of loracarbef in humans. </p>

<p>Approximately 25% of circulating loracarbef is bound to plasma proteins.
</p>

<p>Middle-ear fluid concentrations of loracarbef were approximately 48%
of the plasma concentration 2 hours after drug administration in children.
The peak concentration of loracarbef in blister fluid was approximately
half that obtained in plasma. Adequate data on CSF levels of loracarbef
are not available. </p>

<p>Microbiology--Loracarbef exerts its bactericidal action by binding to
essential target proteins of the bacterial cell wall, leading to inhibition
of cell-wall synthesis. It is stable in the presence of some bacterial
beta-lactamases. Loracarbef has been shown to be active against most strains
of the following organisms both In Vitro and in clinical infections (See
INDICATIONS AND USAGE): </p>

<p>GRAM-POSITIVE AEROBES: </p>

<p>Staphylococcus Aureus (including penicillinase-producing strains) </p>

<p>NOTE: Loracarbef (like most beta-lactam antimicrobials) is inactive
against methicillin-resistant staphylococci. </p>

<p>Staphylococcus Saprophyticus </p>

<p>Streptococcus Pneumoniae </p>

<p>Streptococcus Pyogenes </p>

<p>GRAM-NEGATIVE AEROBES: </p>

<p>Escherichia Coli </p>

<p>Haemophilus Influenzae (including beta-lactamase-producing strains)
</p>

<p>Moraxella (Branhamella) Catarrhalis (including beta-lactamase-producing
strains) </p>

<p>The following In Vitro data are available: HOWEVER, THEIR CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE
IS UNKNOWN. </p>

<p>Loracarbef exhibits In Vitro minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC)
of 8 mcgm/mL or less against most strains of the following organisms; however,
the safety and efficacy of loracarbef in treating clinical infections due
to these organisms have not been established in adequate and well-controlled
trials. </p>

<p>GRAM-POSITIVE AEROBES: </p>

<p>Staphylococcus Epidermidis </p>

<p>Streptococcus Agalactiae (group B streptococci) </p>

<p>Streptococcus Bovis </p>

<p>Streptococci, groups C, F, and G </p>

<p>viridans group streptococci </p>

<p>GRAM-NEGATIVE AEROBES: </p>

<p>Citrobacter Diversus </p>

<p>Haemophilus Parainfluenzae </p>

<p>Klebsiella Pneumoniae </p>

<p>Neisseria Gonorrhoeae (including penicillinase-producing strains) </p>

<p>Pasteurella Multocida </p>

<p>Proteus Mirabilis </p>

<p>Salmonella species </p>

<p>Shigella species </p>

<p>Yersinia Enterocolitica </p>

<p>NOTE: Loracarbef is inactive against most strains of Acinetobacter,
Enterobacter, Morganella Morganii, Proteus Vulgaris, Providencia, Pseudomonas,
and Serratia. </p>

<p>ANAEROBIC ORGANISMS: </p>

<p>Clostridium Perfringens </p>

<p>Fusobacterium Necrophorum </p>

<p>Peptococcus Niger </p>

<p>Peptostreptococcus Intermedius </p>

<p>Propionibacterium Acnes </p>

<p>Susceptibility Testing </p>

<p>DIFFUSION TECHNIQUES--Quantitative methods that require measurement
of zone diameters give the most precise estimate of the susceptibility
of bacteria to antimicrobial agents. One such standardized method (REF.
1) has been recommended for use with the 30-mcgm loracarbef disk. Interpretation
involves the correlation of the diameter obtained in the disk test with
MIC for loracarbef. </p>

<p>Reports from the laboratory giving results of the standard single-disk
susceptibility test with a 30-mcgm loracarbef disk should be interpreted
according to the following criteria: </p>

<pre>       Zone Diameter (mm)                      Interpretation                   
       -----------------                       --------------                   
             &gt;/= 18                           (S) Susceptible                   
             15-17                      (MS) Moderately Susceptible             
             &lt; or = 14                             Resistant                    </pre>

<p>A report of &quot;susceptible&quot; implies that the pathogen is likely
to be inhibited by generally achievable blood concentrations. A report
of &quot;moderately susceptible&quot; indicates that inhibitory concentrations
of the antibiotic may be achieved if high dosage is used or if the infection
is confined to tissues and fluids (eg, urine) in which high antibiotic
concentrations are attained. A report of &quot;resistant&quot; indicates
that achievable concentrations of the antibiotic are unlikely to be inhibitory
and other therapy should be selected. </p>

<p>Standardized procedures require the use of laboratory control organisms.
The 30 mcgm loracarbef disk should give the following zone diameters with
the NCCLS approved procedure: </p>

<pre>     Organism                                    Zone Diameter (mm)            
      --------                                    -----------------             
      E. Coli ATCC 25922                               23-29                    
      S. Aureus ATCC 25923                             23-31                    </pre>

<p>DILUTION TECHNIQUES--Use a standardized dilution method (REF. 2) (broth,
agar, or microdilution) or equivalent with loracarbef powder. The MIC values
obtained should be interpreted according to the following criteria: </p>

<pre>     MIC (mcgm/mL)                                 Interpretation               
     ------------                                  --------------               
         &lt; or =8                                     (S) Susceptible               
          16                                (MS) Moderately Susceptible         
        &gt;/=32                                       Resistant                </pre>

<p>As with standard diffusion methods, dilution procedures require the
use of laboratory control organisms. Standard loracarbef powder should
give the following MIC values with the NCCLS approved procedure: </p>

<pre> 
      Organism                                   MIC Range (mcgm/mL)            
      --------                                   ------------------             
      E. Coli ATCC 25922                               0.5-2                    
      S. Aureus ATCC 29213                             0.5-2                    </pre>

<p><a name="INDICATIONS AND USAGE"></a><b>INDICATIONS AND USAGE </b></p>

<p>Loracarbef is indicated in the treatment of patients with mild to moderate
infections caused by susceptible strains of the designated microorganisms
in the conditions listed below. (As recommended dosages, durations of therapy,
and applicable patient populations vary among these infections, please
see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION for specific recommendations.) </p>

<p>LOWER RESPIRATORY TRACT </p>

<p>SECONDARY BACTERIAL INFECTION OF ACUTE BRONCHITIS caused by S. Pneumoniae,
H. Influenzae (including beta-lactamase-producing strains), or M. Catarrhalis
(including beta-lactamase-producing strains). </p>

<p>ACUTE BACTERIAL EXACERBATIONS OF CHRONIC BRONCHITIS caused by S. Pneumoniae,
H. Influenzae (including beta-lactamase-producing strains), or M. Catarrhalis
(including beta-lactamase-producing strains). </p>

<p>PNEUMONIA caused by S. Pneumoniae Or H. Influenzae (non-beta-lactamase
producing strains only). Data are insufficient at this time to establish
efficacy in patients with pneumonia caused by beta-lactamase-producing
strains of H. Influenzae. </p>

<p>UPPER RESPIRATORY TRACT </p>

<p>OTITIS MEDIA* caused by S. Pneumoniae, H. Influenzae (including beta-lactamase-
producing strains), M. Catarrhalis (including beta-lactamase-producing
strains) or S. Pyogenes. </p>

<p>ACUTE MAXILLARY SINUSITIS* caused by S. Pneumoniae, H. Influenzae (non-beta-
lactamase-producing strains only), or M. Catarrhalis (including beta-lactamase-
producing strains). Data are insufficient at this time to establish efficacy
in patients with acute maxillary sinusitis caused by beta-lactamase-producing
strains of H. Influenzae. </p>

<p>---------- </p>

<p>* NOTE: In a patient population with significant numbers of beta-lactamase-
producing organisms, loracarbef's clinical cure and bacteriological eradication
rates were somewhat less than those observed with a product containing
a beta- lactamase inhibitor. Loracarbef's decreased potential for toxicity
compared to products containing beta-lactamase inhibitors along with the
susceptibility patterns of the common microbes in a given geographic area
should be taken into account when considering the use of an antimicrobial
(See CLINICAL STUDIES section). </p>

<p>---------- </p>

<p>PHARYNGITIS AND TONSILLITIS caused by S. Pyogenes. (The usual drug of
choice in the treatment and prevention of streptococcal infections, including
the prophylaxis of rheumatic fever, is penicillin administered by the intramuscular
route. Loracarbef is generally effective in the eradication of S. Pyogenes
from the nasopharynx; however, data establishing the efficacy of Loracarbef
in the subsequent prevention of rheumatic fever are not available at present.)
</p>

<p>SKIN AND SKIN STRUCTURE </p>

<p>UNCOMPLICATED SKIN AND SKIN STRUCTURE INFECTIONS caused by S. Aureus
(including penicillinase-producing strains) or S. Pyogenes. Abscesses should
be surgically drained as clinically indicated. </p>

<p>URINARY TRACT </p>

<p>UNCOMPLICATED URINARY TRACT INFECTIONS (cystitis) caused by E. Coli
or S. Saprophyticus*. </p>

<p>NOTE: In considering the use of Loracarbef in the treatment of cystitis,
Loracarbef's lower bacterial eradication rates and lower potential for
toxicity should be weighed against the increased eradication rates and
increased potential for toxicity demonstrated by some other classes of
approved agents (See CLINICAL STUDIES section). </p>

<p>UNCOMPLICATED PYELONEPHRITIS caused by E. Coli. </p>

<p>---------- </p>

<p>* Although treatment of infections due to this organism in this organ
system demonstrated a clinically acceptable overall outcome, efficacy was
studied in fewer than 10 infections. </p>

<p>---------- </p>

<p>Culture and susceptibility testing should be performed when appropriate
to determine the causative organism and its susceptibility to loracarbef.
Therapy may be started while awaiting the results of these studies. Once
these results become available, antimicrobial therapy should be adjusted
accordingly. </p>

<p><a name="CONTRAINDICATIONS"></a><b>CONTRAINDICATIONS </b></p>

<p>Loracarbef is contraindicated in patients with known allergy to loracarbef
or cephalosporin-class antibiotics. </p>

<p><a name="WARNINGS"></a><b>WARNINGS </b></p>

<p>BEFORE THERAPY WITH Loracarbef IS INSTITUTED, CAREFUL INQUIRY SHOULD
BE MADE TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE PATIENT HAS HAD PREVIOUS HYPERSENSITIVITY
REACTIONS TO LORACARBEF, CEPHALOSPORINS, PENICILLINS, OR OTHER DRUGS. IF
THIS PRODUCT IS TO BE GIVEN TO PENICILLIN-SENSITIVE PATIENTS, CAUTION SHOULD
BE EXERCISED BECAUSE CROSS-HYPERSENSITIVITY AMONG beta-LACTAM ANTIBIOTICS
HAS BEEN CLEARLY DOCUMENTED AND MAY OCCUR IN UP TO 10% OF PATIENTS WITH
A HISTORY OF PENICILLIN ALLERGY. IF AN ALLERGIC REACTION TO Loracarbef
OCCURS, DISCONTINUE THE DRUG. SERIOUS ACUTE HYPERSENSITIVITY REACTIONS
MAY REQUIRE THE USE OF EPINEPHRINE AND OTHER EMERGENCY MEASURES, INCLUDING
OXYGEN, INTRAVENOUS FLUIDS, INTRAVENOUS ANTIHISTAMINES, CORTICOSTEROIDS,
PRESSOR AMINES, AND AIRWAY MANAGEMENT, AS CLINICALLY INDICATED. </p>

<p>Pseudomembranous colitis has been reported with nearly all antibacterial
agents and may range from mild to life-threatening. Therefore, it is important
to consider this diagnosis in patients who present with diarrhea subsequent
to the administration of antibacterial agents. </p>

<p>Treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics alters the normal flora of
the colon and may permit overgrowth of clostridia. Studies indicate that
a toxin produced by Clostridium Difficile is a primary cause of &quot;antibiotic-associated
colitis.&quot; </p>

<p>After the diagnosis of pseudomembranous colitis has been established,
therapeutic measures should be initiated. Mild cases of pseudomembranous
colitis usually respond to discontinuation of drug alone. In moderate to
severe cases, consideration should be given to management with fluids and
electrolytes protein supplementation, and treatment with an antibacterial
drug effective against C. Difficile-associated colitis. </p>

<p><a name="PRECAUTIONS"></a><b>PRECAUTIONS </b></p>

<p>General--In patients with known or suspected renal impairment (See DOSAGE
AND ADMINISTRATION), careful clinical observation and appropriate laboratory
studies should be performed prior to and during therapy. The total daily
dose of loracarbef should be reduced in these patients because high and/or
prolonged plasma antibiotic concentrations can occur in such individuals
administered the usual doses. Loracarbef, like cephalosporins, should be
given with caution to patients receiving concurrent treatment with potent
diuretics because these diuretics are suspected of adversely affecting
renal function. </p>

<p>As with other broad-spectrum antimicrobials, prolonged use of loracarbef
may result in the overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms. Careful observation
of the patient is essential. If superinfection occurs during therapy, appropriate
measures should be taken. </p>

<p>Loracarbef, as with other broad-spectrum antimicrobials, should be prescribed
with caution in individuals with a history of colitis. </p>

<p>Information For Patients--Loracarbef should be taken either at least
1 hour prior to eating or at least 2 hours after eating a meal. </p>

<p>Drug Interactions-- </p>

<p>Probenecid: As with other beta-lactam antibiotics, renal excretion of
loracarbef is inhibited by probenecid and resulted in an approximate 80%
increase in the AUC for loracarbef (See ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY).
</p>

<p>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment Of Fertility--Although lifetime
studies in animals have not been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential,
no mutagenic potential was found for loracarbef in standard tests of genotoxicity,
which included bacterial mutation tests and In Vitro and In Vivo mammalian
systems. In rats, fertility and reproductive performance were not affected
by loracarbef at doses up to 33 times the maximum human exposure in mg/kg
(10 times the exposure based on mg/M(square)). </p>

<p>Usage In Pregnancy--Pregnancy Category B--Reproduction studies have
been performed in mice, rats, and rabbits at doses up to 33 times the maximum
human exposure in mg/kg (4, 10, and 4 times the exposure, respectively,
based on mg/M(square)) and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility
or harm to the fetus due to loracarbef. There are, however, no adequate
and well controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction
studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be
used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. </p>

<p>Labor And Delivery--Loracarbef has not been studied for use during labor
and delivery. Treatment should be given only if clearly needed. </p>

<p>Nursing Mothers--It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human
milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be
exercised when Loracarbef is administered to a nursing woman. </p>

<p>Pediatric Use--Efficacy and safety in infants less than 6 months of
age have not been established. </p>

<p>Geriatric Use--Healthy geriatric volunteers (&gt;/=65 years old) with
normal renal function who received a single 400-mg dose of loracarbef had
no significant differences in AUC or clearance when compared to healthy
adult volunteers 20 to 40 years of age. In clinical studies, when geriatric
patients received the usual recommended adult doses, clinical efficacy
and safety were comparable to results in nongeriatric adult patients. Because
significant numbers of elderly patients have decreased renal function,
evaluation of renal function in this population is recommended (See DOSAGE
AND ADMINISTRATION). </p>

<p><a name="ADVERSE REACTIONS"></a><b>ADVERSE REACTIONS </b></p>

<p>The nature of adverse reactions to loracarbef are similar to those observed
with orally administered beta-lactam antimicrobials. The majority of adverse
reactions observed in clinical trials were of a mild and transient nature;
1.5% of patients discontinued therapy because of drug-related adverse reactions.
No one reaction requiring discontinuation accounted for &gt;0.03% of the
total patient population; however, of those reactions resulting in discontinuation,
gastrointestinal events (diarrhea and abdominal pain) and skin rashes predominated.
</p>

<p>ALL PATIENTS </p>

<p>The following adverse events, irrespective of relationship to drug,
have been reported following the use of Loracarbef in clinical trials.
Incidence rates (combined for all dosing regimens and dosage forms) were
less than 1% for the total patient population, except as otherwise noted:
</p>

<p>GASTROINTESTINAL: The most commonly observed adverse reactions were
related to the gastrointestinal system. The incidence of gastrointestinal
adverse reactions increased in patients treated with higher doses. Individual
event rates included diarrhea, 4.1%; nausea, 1.9%; vomiting, 1.4%; abdominal
pain, 1.4%; and anorexia. </p>

<p>HYPERSENSITIVITY: Hypersensitivity reactions including, skin rashes
(1.2%), urticaria, pruritus, and erythema multiforme. </p>

<p>CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM: Headache (2.9%), somnolence, nervousness, insomnia,
and dizziness. </p>

<p>HEMIC AND LYMPHATIC SYSTEMS: Transient thrombocytopenia, leukopenia,
and eosinophilia. </p>

<p>HEPATIC: Transient elevations in AST (SGOT), ALT (SGPT), and alkaline
phosphatase. </p>

<p>RENAL: Transient elevations in BUN and creatinine. </p>

<p>CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: Vasodilatation. </p>

<p>GENITOURINARY: Vaginitis (1.3%), vaginal moniliasis (1.1%). </p>

<p>PEDIATRIC PATIENTS </p>

<p>The incidences of several adverse events, irrespective of relationship

<p>BETA-LACTAM ANTIMICROBIAL CLASS LABELING: </p>

<p>Although not observed in patients treated with Loracarbef in clinical
trials, the following adverse reactions and altered laboratory test results
have been reported in patients treated with beta-lactam antibiotics: </p>

<p>Adverse Reactions--Allergic reactions including anaphylaxis, Stevens-Johnson
syndrome, serum sickness-like reactions, aplastic anemia, hemolytic anemia,
hemorrhage, agranulocytosis, toxic epidermal necrolysis, renal dysfunction,
toxic nephropathy, and hepatic dysfunction including cholestasis. </p>

<p>Several beta-lactam antibiotics have been implicated in triggering seizures,
particularly in patients with renal impairment when the dosage was not
reduced. If seizures associated with drug therapy should occur, the drug
should be discontinued. Anticonvulsant therapy can be given if clinically
indicated. </p>

<p>Altered Laboratory Tests--Increased prothrombin time, positive direct
Coombs' test, elevated LDH, pancytopenia, and neutropenia. </p>

<p><a name="OVERDOSAGE"></a><b>OVERDOSAGE </b></p>

<p>Signs And Symptoms--The toxic symptoms following an overdose of beta-lactams
may include nausea, vomiting, epigastric distress, and diarrhea. </p>

<p>Loracarbef is eliminated primarily by the kidneys. Forced diuresis,
peritoneal dialysis, hemodialysis, or hemoperfusion have not been established
as beneficial for an overdose of loracarbef. Hemodialysis has been shown
to be effective in hastening the elimination of loracarbef from plasma
in patients with chronic renal failure. </p>

<p><a name="DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION"></a><b>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

<p>* In the treatment of infections due to S. Pyogenes, Loracarbef should
be administered for at least 10 days. ** Otitis media should be treated
with the suspension. Clinical studies of otitis media were conducted with
the suspension formulation only. The suspension is more rapidly absorbed
than the capsules, resulting in higher peak plasma concentrations when
administered at the same dose. Therefore, the capsule should not be substituted
for the suspension in the treatment of otitis media (See ACTIONS/CLINICAL
PHARMACOLOGY). </p>

with creatinine clearance levels of 50 mL/min or greater. Patients with
creatinine clearance between 10 and 49 mL/min may be given half of the
recommended dose at the usual dosage interval, or the normal recommended
dose at twice the usual dosage interval. Patients with creatinine clearance
levels less than 10 mL/min may be treated with the recommended dose given
every 3 to 5 days; patients on hemodialysis should receive another dose
following dialysis. </p>

<p><a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><b>DESCRIPTION </b></p>

<p>Ipratropium bromide is an anticholinergic bronchodilator chemically
described as 8-azoniabicyclo(3.2.1)-octane, 3-(3-hydroxy-1-oxo-2-phenylpropoxy)
-8-methyl-8-(1-methylethyl)-,bromide, monohydrate (Endo, Syn)-, (+/-);
a synthetic quaternary ammonium compound, chemically related to atropine.
</p>

<p>C20H30BrNo3.H20 : Mol. Wt. 430.4 </p>

<p>Ipratropium bromide is a white crystalline substance, freely soluble
in water and lower alcohols but insoluble in lipophilic solvents such as
ether, chloroform, and fluorocarbons. </p>

<p><a name="ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY"></a>ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
</p>

<p>Ipratropium is an anticholinergic (parasympatholytic) agent which, based
on animal studies, appears to inhibit vagally mediated reflexes by antagonizing
the action of acetylcholine, the transmitter agent released from the vagus
nerve. Anticholinergics prevent the increases in intracellular concentration
of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cyclic GMP) which are caused by interaction
of acetylcholine with the muscarinic receptor on bronchial smooth muscle.
</p>

<p>The bronchodilation following inhalation of Ipratropium is primarily
a local, site specific effect, not a systemic one. Much of an inhaled dose
is swallowed as shown by fecal excretion studies. Ipratropium is not readily
absorbed into the systemic circulation either from the surface of the lung
or from the gastrointestinal tract as confirmed by blood level and renal
excretion studies. </p>

<p>The half-life of elimination is about 2 hours after inhalation or intravenous
administration. Autoradiographic studies in rats have shown that Ipratropium
does not penetrate the blood-brain barrier. </p>

<p>In controlled 90-day studies in patients with bronchospasm associated
with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (chronic bronchitis and emphysema)
significant improvements in pulmonary function (FEV1 and FEF25-75% increases
of 15% or more) occurred within 15 minutes, reached a peak in 1-2 hours,
and persisted for periods of 3 to 4 hours in the majority of patients and
up to 6 hours in some patients. In addition, significant increases in Forced
Vital Capacity (FVC) have been demonstrated. </p>

<p>Controlled clinical studies have demonstrated that Ipratropium (ipratropium
bromide) does not alter either mucociliary clearance or the volume or viscosity
of respiratory secretions. In studies without a positive control Ipratropium
did not alter pupil size, accommodation or visual acuity (See ADVERSE REACTIONS).
</p>

<p>Ventilation/perfusion studies have shown no clinically significant effects
on pulmonary gas exchange or arterial oxygen tension. Ipratropium does
not produce clinically significant changes in pulse rate or blood pressure.
</p>

<p><a name="INDICATIONS AND USAGE"></a><b>INDICATIONS AND USAGE </b></p>

<p>Ipratropium is indicated as a bronchodilator for maintenance treatment
of bronchospasm associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
including chronic bronchitis and emphysema. </p>

<p><a name="CONTRAINDICATIONS"></a><b>CONTRAINDICATIONS </b></p>

<p>Hypersensitivity to atropine or its derivatives. </p>

<p><a name="WARNINGS"></a><b>WARNINGS </b></p>

<p>Ipratropium is not indicated for the initial treatment of acute episodes
of bronchospasm where rapid response is required. </p>

<p><a name="PRECAUTIONS"></a><b>PRECAUTIONS </b></p>

<p>GENERAL: Ipratropium should be used with caution in patients with narrow-angle
glaucoma, prostatic hypertrophy or bladder-neck obstruction. INFORMATION
FOR PATIENTS: Patients should be advised that temporary blurring of vision
may result if the aerosol is sprayed into the eyes. </p>

<p>Patients should be reminded that Ipratropium is not intended for occasional
use, but rather, in order to be maximally effective, must be used consistently
as prescribed throughout the course of therapy. </p>

<p>DRUG INTERACTIONS: Ipratropium has been used concomitantly with other
drugs, including sympathomimetic bronchodilators, methylxanthines, steroids
and cromolyn sodium, commonly used in the treatment of chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, without adverse drug reactions. There are no formal
studies fully evaluating the interactive effects of Ipratropium and these
drugs with respect to effectiveness. </p>

<p>CARCINOGENESIS, MUTAGENESIS, IMPAIRMENT OF FERTILITY: Two-year oral
carcinogenicity studies in rats and mice have revealed no carcinogenic
potential at doses up to 1,250 times the maximum recommended human daily
dose for Ipratropium. </p>

<p>Results of various mutagenicity studies were negative. </p>

<p>Fertility of male or female rats at oral doses up to approximately 10,000
times the maximum recommended human daily dose was unaffected by Ipratropium
administration. At doses above 18,000 times the maximum recommended human
daily dose, increased resorption and decreased conception rates were observed.
</p>

<p>PREGNANCY/TERATOGENIC EFFECTS Pregnancy Category B. Oral reproduction
studies performed in mice, rats and rabbits (at doses approximately 2,000,
200,000 and 26,000 times the maximum recommended human daily dose, respectively)
and inhalation reproduction studies in rats and rabbits (at doses approximately
312 </p>

<p>and 375 times the maximum recommended human daily dose, respectively)
have demonstrated no evidence of teratogenic effects as a result of Ipratropium.
However, no adequate or well controlled studies have been conducted in
pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive
of human response, Ipratropium should be used during pregnancy only if
clearly needed. </p>

<p>NURSING MOTHERS: It is not known whether Ipratropium is excreted in
human milk. Although lipid-insoluble quaternary bases pass into breast
milk, it is unlikely that Ipratropium would reach the infant to an important
extent, especially when taken by aerosol. However, because many drugs are
excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Ipratropium is
administered to a nursing woman. </p>

<p>PEDIATRIC USE: Safety and effectiveness in children below the age of
12 have not been established. </p>

<p><a name="DRUG INTERACTIONS"></a><b>DRUG INTERACTIONS </b></p>

<p>Ipratropium has been used concomitantly with other drugs, including

sodium, commonly used in the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease, without adverse drug reactions. There are no formal studies fully
evaluating the interactive effects of Ipratropium and these drugs with
respect to effectiveness. </p>

<p>The large uncontrolled, open-label study included seriously ill patients.
About 7% of patients treated discontinued the program because of adverse
events. </p>

<p>Of the 2301 patients treated in the large uncontrolled study and in
clinical trials other than the 90-day studies, the most common adverse
reactions reported were: dryness of the oropharynx, about 5 in 100; cough,
exacerbation of symptoms and irritation from aerosol, each about 3 in 100;
headache, about 2 in 100; nausea, dizziness, blurred vision/difficulty
in accommodation, and drying of secretions, each about 1 in 100. Less frequently
reported adverse reactions that were possibly due to Ipratropium include
tachycardia, paresthesias, drowsiness, coordination difficulty, itching,
hives, flushing, alopecia, constipation, tremor, mucosal ulcers. </p>

<p>Cases of precipitation or worsening of narrow-angle glaucoma, acute
eye pain and hypotension have been reported. </p>

<p>A case of giant urticaria with positive rechallenge has been reported
from the foreign marketing experience. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS). </p>

<p><a name="OVERDOSAGE"></a><b>OVERDOSAGE </b></p>

<p>Acute overdosage by inhalation is unlikely since Ipratropium (ipratropium
bromide) is not well absorbed systemically after aerosol or oral administration.
The oral LD50 of Ipratropium ranged between 1001 and 2010 mg/kg in mice;
between 1667 and more than 4000 mg/kg in rats; and between 400 and 1300
mg/kg in dogs. </p>

<p><a name="DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION"></a><b>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
</b></p>

<p>The usual starting dose of Ipratropium is two inhalations (36 mcg) four
times a day. Patients may take additional inhalations as required; however,
the total number of inhalations should not exceed 12 in 24 hours. </p>

<p>CAUTION </p>

<p>Federal law prohibits dispensing without prescription. </p>

<p><a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><b>DESCRIPTION </b></p>

<p>Nitroglycerin, an organic nitrate, is a vasodilating agent. The chemical
name for nitroglycerin is 1,2,3-propanetriol trinitrate. </p>

<p><a name="ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY"></a><b>ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
</b></p>

<p>Relaxation of vascular smooth muscle is the principal pharmacologic
action of nitroglycerin. The mechanism by which nitroglycerin produces
relaxation of smooth muscle is unknown. Although venous effects predominate,
nitroglycerin produces, in a dose-related manner, dilation of both arterial
and venous beds. Dilation of the postcapillary vessels, including large
veins, promotes peripheral pooling of blood and decreases venous return
to the heart, reducing left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (preload).
Arteriolar relaxation reduces systemic vascular resistance and arterial
pressure (afterload). Myocardial oxygen consumption or demand (as measured
by the pressure-rate product, tension- time index and stroke-work index)
is decreased by both the arterial and venous effects of nitroglycerin,
and a more favorable supply demand ratio can be achieved. </p>

<p>Therapeutic doses of nitroglycerin may reduce systolic, diastolic and
mean arterial blood pressure. Effective coronary perfusion pressure is
usually maintained, but can be compromised if blood pressure falls excessively
or increased heart rate decreases diastolic filling time. </p>

<p>Elevated central venous and pulmonary capillary wedge pressures, pulmonary
vascular resistance and systemic vascular resistance are also reduced by
nitroglycerin therapy. Heart rate is usually slightly increased, presumably
a reflex response to the fall in blood pressure. Cardiac index may be increased,
decreased, or unchanged. Patients with elevated left ventricular filling
pressure and systemic vascular resistance values in conjunction with a
depressed cardiac index are likely to experience an improvement in cardiac
index. On the other hand, when filling pressures and cardiac index are
normal, cardiac index may be slightly reduced by intravenous nitroglycerin.
</p>

<p>Nitroglycerin is rapidly absorbed following sublingual administration.
Its onset of action is approximately one to three minutes. Significant
pharmacologic effects are present for 30 to 60 minutes following administration
by the above route. </p>

<p>Nitroglycerin is rapidly metabolized to dinitrates and mononitrates,
with a short half-life, estimated at 1 to 4 minutes. At plasma concentrations
of between 50 and 500 ng/ml, the binding of nitroglycerin to plasma proteins
is approximately 60%, while that of 1,2 dinitroglycerin and 1,3 dinitroglycerin
is 60% and 30% respectively. The activity and half-life of 1,2 dinitroglycerin
and 1,3 dinitroglycerin are not well characterized. The mononitrate is
not active. </p>

<p><a name="INDICATIONS AND USAGE"></a><b>INDICATIONS AND USAGE </b></p>

<p>Nitroglycerin is indicated for the prophylaxis, treatment and management
of patients with angina pectoris. </p>

<p><a name="CONTRAINDICATIONS"></a><b>CONTRAINDICATIONS </b></p>

<p>Sublingual nitroglycerin therapy is contraindicated in patients with
early myocardial infarction, severe anemia, increased intracranial pressure,
and those with a known hypersensitivity to nitroglycerin. </p>

<p><a name="PRECAUTIONS"></a><b>PRECAUTIONS </b></p>

<p>GENERAL: Only the smallest dose required for effective relief of the
acute anginal attack should be used. Excessive use may lead to the development
of tolerance. Nitroglycerin tablets are intended for sublingual or buccal
administration and should not be swallowed. The drug should be discontinued
if blurring of vision or drying of the mouth occurs. Excessive dosage of
nitroglycerin may produce severe headaches. </p>

<p>INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS: If possible, patients should sit down when
taking Nitroglycerin tablets. This eliminates the possibility of falling
due to lightheadedness or dizziness. </p>

<p>DRUG INTERACTIONS: Concomitant use of nitrates and alcohol may cause
hypotension. Patients receiving antihypertensive drugs, beta-adrenergic
blockers, or phenothiazines and nitrates should be observed for possible
additive hypotensive effects. </p>

<p>DRUG/LABORATORY TEST INTERACTIONS: Nitrates may interfere with the Zlatkis-Zak
color reaction causing a false report of decreased serum cholesterol. </p>

<p>CARCINOGENESIS, MUTAGENESIS, IMPAIRMENT OF FERTILITY: No long-term studies
in animals were performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of nitroglycerin.
</p>

<p>PREGNANCY CATEGORY C: Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted
with nitroglycerin. It is also not known whether nitroglycerin can cause
fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction
capacity. Nitroglycerin should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly
needed. </p>

<p>NURSING MOTHER: It is not known whether nitroglycerin is excreted in
human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should
be exercised when intravenous nitroglycerin is administered to a nursing
woman. </p>

<p>PEDIATRIC USE: The safety and effectiveness of nitroglycerin in children
have not been established. </p>

<p><a name="DRUG INTERACTIONS"></a><b>DRUG INTERACTIONS </b></p>

<p>Concomitant use of nitrates and alcohol may cause hypotension. Patients
receiving antihypertensive drugs, beta-adrenergic blockers, or phenothiazines
and nitrates should be observed for possible additive hypotensive effects.
</p>

<p>(See Also PRECAUTIONS) </p>

<p><a name="ADVERSE REACTIONS"></a><b>ADVERSE REACTIONS </b></p>

<p>Transient headache may occur immediately after use. Vertigo, weakness,
palpitation, and other manifestations of postural hypotension may develop
occasionally, particularly in erect, immobile patients. Syncope due to
nitrate vasodilation has been reported. </p>

<p><a name="DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION"></a><b>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
</b></p>

<p>One tablet should be dissolved under the tongue or in the buccal pouch
at the first sign of an acute anginal attack. The dose may be repeated
approximately every five minutes until relief is obtained. If the pain
persists after a total of 3 tablets in a 15-minute period, the physician
should be notified. Nitroglycerin may be used prophylactically five to
ten minutes prior to engaging in activities which might precipitate an
acute attack. </p>

<p><a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><b>DESCRIPTION </b></p>

<p>Fluvastatin, is a water soluble cholesterol lowering agent which acts
through the inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG CoA)
reductase. </p>

<p>Fluvastatin sodium is (R* ,S*-(E))-(+/-)-7-(3-(4-fluorophenyl)-1-(1-
methylethyl)-1H-indol-2-yl)-3,5-dihydroxy-6-heptenoic acid, monosodium
salt. C24H25FNO4.Na : Mol. wt. 433.46 </p>

<p>This molecular entity is the first entirely synthetic HMG-CoA reductase
inhibitor, and is in part structurally distinct from the fungal derivatives
of this therapeutic class. </p>

<p>Fluvastatin sodium is a white to pale yellow, hygroscopic powder soluble
in water, ethanol and methanol. </p>

<p><a name="ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY"></a><b>ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
</b></p>

<p>A variety of clinical studies have demonstrated that elevated levels
of total cholesterol (Total-C), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C),
and apolipoprotein B (a membrane transport complex for LDL-C) promote human
atherosclerosis. Similarly, decreased levels of HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C)
and its transport complex, apolipoprotein A, are associated with the development
of atherosclerosis. Epidemiologic investigations have established that
cardiovascular morbidity and mortality vary directly with the level of
Total-C and LDL-C and inversely with the level of HDL-C. The Lipid Research
Clinics Coronary Primary Prevention Trial (LRC-CPPT) was a multicenter,
randomized, double-blind study involving 3,806 asymptomatic middle-aged
men in the United States with Type II hyperlipoproteinemia treated with
diet and cholestyramine. Results of this trial demonstrated that a statistically
significant reduction of 19% in the incidence of definite myocardial infarction
and/or coronary heart disease death was associated with an 8% decrease
in blood cholesterol and 11% decrease in LDL-C levels. In other multicenter
clinical trials, those pharmacologic and/or nonpharmacologic interventions
that simultaneously lowered LDL-C and increased HDL-C also have reduced
the rate of cardiovascular events (both fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarctions).
</p>

<p>In patients with hypercholesterolemia, treatment with Fluvastatin (fluvastatin
sodium) reduced Total-C, LDL-C, and apolipoprotein B. Fluvastatin (fluvastatin
sodium) also moderately reduced triglycerides (TG) while producing an increase
in HDL-C of variable magnitude. The agent had no consistent effect on either
Lp(a) or fibrinogen. The effect of fluvastatin sodium-induced changes in
lipoprotein levels on the evolution of atherosclerosis has not been established.
</p>

<p><a name="MECHANISM OF ACTION"></a><b>MECHANISM OF ACTION </b></p>

<p>Fluvastatin is a competitive inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, which is
responsible for the conversion of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme
A (HMG-CoA) to mevalonate, a precursor of sterols, including cholesterol.
The inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis reduces the cholesterol in hepatic
cells which stimulates the synthesis of LDL receptors and thereby increases
the uptake of LDL particles. The end result of these biochemical processes
is a reduction of the plasma cholesterol concentration. </p>

<p><a name="PHARMACOKINETICS/METABOLISM"></a><b>PHARMACOKINETICS/METABOLISM
</b></p>

<p>Fluvastatin is administered orally in the active form. Fluvastatin is
absorbed rapidly and completely (98%) following oral administration to
fasted volunteers. In a fed state, even up to 4 hours post prandial, the
drug is also completely absorbed, but at a reduced rate (Cmax is reduced
by 40%-70%). The action of HMGR inhibitors occurs within the liver. The
absolute systemic bioavailability for this drug class is low. The absolute
bioavailability of fluvastatin following a 10 mg oral dose was 24% (range
9%- 50%). At doses above 20 mg, fluvastatin exhibits nonlinear kinetics,
at least in the fasting state, resulting in dose normalized AUC values
20%-40% higher than expected for the 40 mg dose. The volume of distribution
(VDss) for the drug is calculated to be 34.4 liters. More than 98% of the
circulating drug is bound to plasma proteins, and this binding is unaffected
by drug concentration. </p>

<p>Biotransformation pathways for fluvastatin include: a) hydroxylation
of the indole ring at the 5- and 6-positions; b) N-dealkylation; and c)
beta oxidation. The major circulating blood components are fluvastatin
and the pharmacologically inactive N-desisopropyl-propionic acid metabolite.
The hydroxylated metabolites have pharmacological activity but do not circulate
systemically. Both enantiomers of fluvastatin are metabolized in a similar
manner resulting in only minor differences in systemic exposure. </p>

<p>Following administration of 3H-fluvastatin sodium to healthy volunteers,
excretion of radioactivity was about 5% in the urine and 90% in the feces,
with the parent, fluvastatin, accounting for less than 2% of the total
radioactivity excreted. The plasma clearance for fluvastatin in man is
calculated to be 39.2 +/- 4.4 liters per hour. Steady-state plasma concentrations
show no evidence of fluvastatin accumulation following administration of
40 mg daily; however, after 6 days of dosing with 40 mg 3H-fluvastatin
sodium solution, total radioactivity --which includes parent compound and
pharmacologically inactive metabolites-- accumulated by a factor of 2 based
on Cmin values. Following oral administration of 20 mg of fluvastatin sodium,
the beta elimination half-life for fluvastatin is 1.2 hours (range of 0.53-3.1
hours). </p>

<p>The bioavailability of Fluvastatin 20 mg capsules is equivalent to a
solution of fluvastatin sodium except that the time to peak under fasted
conditions is about 0.7 hours following administration of the capsule compared
to about 0.4 hours for the solution. Following ingestion of a single 20
mg Fluvastatin capsule under fasted conditions, measurable plasma concentrations
of fluvastatin appear systemically within 10 minutes after dosing and reach
a peak of 147 +/- 86 ng/mL at 0.66 +/- 0.3 hours. Fluvastatin , like the
other HMGR inhibitors, has variable systemic bioavailability. The coefficient
of variation (based on the inter- subject variability) was 47%-57% for
AUC, and 58%-69% for Cmax. </p>

<p>Results from an overnight pharmacokinetic evaluation following steady-state
administration of Fluvastatin with the evening meal or 4 hours after the
evening meal for 15 weeks showed that administration of fluvastatin sodium
with the evening meal results in a two-fold decrease in Cmax and more than
a two-fold increase in tmax as compared to patients receiving the drug
4 hours after the evening meal. No significant difference in AUC was observed
between the 2 treatment groups, and there were no differences in the lipid-lowering
effects of fluvastatin sodium administered with the evening meal or 4 hours
after the evening meal. </p>

<p>The effects of gender and age on the pharmacokinetics of fluvastatin
sodium were evaluated in 4 patient subgroups; young and elderly males and
females. All patients were administered 20 mg fluvastatin daily, at least
2 hours after the evening meal, for 21 days. Results from an overnight
pharmacokinetic evaluation indicate that for the general patient population
plasma concentrations of fluvastatin do not vary either as a function of
age or gender. Due to their generally smaller body weight, young female
patients show higher fluvastatin plasma concentrations after administration
of 10-40 mg of fluvastatin compared to young males. </p>

<p>Since fluvastatin is eliminated primarily via the biliary route and
is subject to significant presystemic metabolism, the potential exists
for drug accumulation in patients with hepatic insufficiency. In a single-dose
study the kinetics of fluvastatin sodium in subjects with cirrhosis (n=11)
and in healthy age- and sex-matched subjects (n=11) were compared. The
mean AUC and Cmax parameters were about 2.5 times higher in the subjects
with hepatic insufficiency. There was a 28% decrease in plasma clearance
and a 31% smaller volume of distribution. No apparent difference was observed
in the plasma elimination half-lives for the 2 groups. Caution should be
exercised when fluvastatin sodium is administered to patients with a history
of liver disease or heavy alcohol ingestion (See WARNINGS). </p>

<p>CLINICAL STUDIES </p>

<p>Fluvastatin has been studied in 4 controlled Phase 3 trials. </p>

<p>These studies involved 1605 North American patients with Type IIa or
IIb hyperlipoproteinemia. Fluvastatin was administered to 946 patients
in these trials of 24-54 weeks duration. In the largest single randomized
study with Fluvastatin (n=292), treatment at a dose of 20 mg QPM resulted
in a highly significant decrease in LDL-C of 22.2% after 9 weeks of study.
In the largest single study (n=210) of patients randomized to 40 mg daily
and limited to FH patients, a mean LDL-C reduction of 24.0% was observed.
Reductions in Apo B were also seen as a result of treatment with Fluvastatin
. Small but statistically significant increases in HDL-C and corresponding
decreases in TG were also noted. No consistent effect on Lp(a) was found.
</p>

<p><a name="INDICATIONS AND USAGE"></a><b>INDICATIONS AND USAGE </b></p>

<p>Fluvastatin is indicated as an adjunct to diet in the treatment of elevated
total cholesterol (total-C) and LDL-C levels in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia
(Type IIa and IIb) whose response to dietary restriction of saturated fat
and cholesterol and other nonpharmacological measures has not been adequate.
</p>

<p>Therapy with lipid-altering agents should be considered only after secondary
causes for hyperlipidemia such as poorly controlled diabetes mellitus,
hypothyroidism, nephrotic syndrome, dysproteinemias, obstructive liver
disease, other medication, or alcoholism, have been excluded. Prior to
initiation of fluvastatin sodium, a lipid profile should be performed to
measure Total-C, HDL C and TG. For patients with TG &lt;400mg/dL (&lt;4.5
mmol/L), LDL-C can be estimated using the following equation: </p>

<p>LDL-C = Total-C - HDL-C - 1/5 TG </p>

<p>For TG levels &gt;400 mg/dL (&gt;4.5 mmol/L), this equation is less
accurate and LDL C concentrations should be determined by ultracentrifugation.
In many hypertriglyceridemic patients LDL-C may be low or normal despite
elevated Total C. In such cases, Fluvastatin is not indicated. </p>

<p>Lipid determinations should be performed at intervals of no less than
4 weeks and dosage adjusted according to the patient's response to therapy.
</p>

<p>The effect of fluvastatin sodium-induced changes in lipoprotein levels
on cardiovascular morbidity or mortality has not been established. </p>

<p><a name="CONTRAINDICATIONS"></a><b>CONTRAINDICATIONS </b></p>

<p>Hypersensitivity to any component of this medication. Fluvastatin (fluvastatin
sodium) is contraindicated in patients with active liver disease or unexplained
persistent elevations in serum transaminases (see WARNINGS). </p>

<p><a name="PREGNANCY AND LACTATION"></a><b>PREGNANCY AND LACTATION </b></p>

<p>Atherosclerosis is a chronic process and discontinuation of lipid-lowering
drugs during pregnancy should have little impact on the outcome of long-term
therapy of primary hypercholesterolemia. Cholesterol and other products
of cholesterol biosynthesis are essential components for fetal development
(including synthesis of steroids and cell membranes). Since HMG-CoA reductase
inhibitors decrease cholesterol synthesis and possibly the synthesis of
other biologically active substances derived from cholesterol, they may
cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women. Therefore, HMG-CoA
reductase inhibitors are contraindicated during pregnancy and in nursing
mothers. FLUVASTATIN SODIUM SHOULD BE ADMINISTERED TO WOMEN OF CHILDBEARING
AGE ONLY WHEN SUCH PATIENTS ARE HIGHLY UNLIKELY TO CONCEIVE AND HAVE BEEN
INFORMED OF THE POTENTIAL HAZARDS. If the patient becomes pregnant while
taking this class of drug, therapy should be discontinued and the patient
apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. </p>

<p><a name="WARNINGS"></a><b>WARNINGS </b></p>

<p>LIVER ENZYMES </p>

<p>Biochemical abnormalities of liver function have been associated with
HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors and other lipid-lowering agents. A small number
of patients treated with Fluvastatin in United States controlled trials
(N=17, 1.1%) developed persistent elevations of transaminase levels to
more than 3 times the upper limit of normal. Ten of these patients (0.7%)
were discontinued from therapy. Most of these (10/17) abnormalities occurred
within the first 6 weeks of treatment and resolved rapidly to pretreatment
values. In a long-term open-label extension study, 5 of 824 (0.6%) patients
exposed to Fluvastatin at a dose of 40 mg developed persistent transaminase
elevations. Only 2 of these patients were discontinued from the study.
The majority of these abnormal biochemical findings were asymptomatic.
</p>

<p>IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT LIVER FUNCTION TESTS BE PERFORMED BEFORE THE
INITIATION OF TREATMENT, AT 6 AND 12 WEEKS AFTER INITIATION OF THERAPY
OR ELEVATION IN DOSE, AND PERIODICALLY THEREAFTER (E.G., SEMIANNUALLY).
Liver enzyme changes generally occur in the first 3 months of treatment
with Fluvastatin (fluvastatin sodium). Patients who develop increased transaminase
levels should be monitored with a second liver function evaluation to confirm
the finding and be followed thereafter with frequent liver function tests
until the abnormality(ies) return to normal. Should an increase in AST
or ALT of three times the upper limit of normal or greater persist, withdrawal
of fluvastatin sodium therapy is recommended. </p>

<p>Active liver disease or unexplained transaminase elevations are contraindications
to the use of Fluvastatin (See CONTRAINDICATIONS). Caution should be exercised
when fluvastatin sodium is administered to patients with a history of liver
disease or heavy alcohol ingestion (See ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY:
Pharmacokinetics/Metabolism). Such patients should be closely monitored.
</p>

<p>SKELETAL MUSCLE </p>

<p>RHABDOMYOLYSIS WITH RENAL DYSFUNCTION SECONDARY TO MYOGLOBINURIA HAS
BEEN REPORTED WITH OTHER DRUGS IN THIS CLASS. To date, this has not occurred
with fluvastatin sodium. Myopathy, defined as muscle aching or muscle weakness
in conjunction with increases in creatine phosphokinase (CPK) values to
greater than 10 times the upper limit of normal, has been reported in 1
fluvastatin sodium patient to date and was related to physical exertion.
An additional case was reported in a patient receiving placebo. </p>

<p>MYOPATHY SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IN ANY PATIENTS WITH DIFFUSE MYALGIAS,
MUSCLE TENDERNESS OR WEAKNESS, AND/OR MARKED ELEVATION OF CPK. PATIENTS
SHOULD BE ADVISED TO REPORT PROMPTLY UNEXPLAINED MUSCLE PAIN, TENDERNESS
OR WEAKNESS, PARTICULARLY IF ACCOMPANIED BY MALAISE OR FEVER. FLUVASTATIN
SODIUM THERAPY SHOULD BE DISCONTINUED IF MARKEDLY ELEVATED CPK LEVELS OCCUR
OR MYOPATHY IS DIAGNOSED OR SUSPECTED. FLUVASTATIN SODIUM THERAPY SHOULD
ALSO BE TEMPORARILY WITHHELD IN ANY PATIENT EXPERIENCING AN ACUTE OR SERIOUS
CONDITION PREDISPOSING TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF RENAL FAILURE SECONDARY TO
RHABDOMYOLYSIS, E.G., SEPSIS; HYPOTENSION; MAJOR SURGERY; TRAUMA; SEVERE
METABOLIC, ENDOCRINE, OR ELECTROLYTE DISORDERS; OR UNCONTROLLED EPILEPSY.
</p>

<p>The risk of myopathy during treatment with another HMG-CoA reductase
inhibitor was found to be increased if therapy with either cyclosporine,
gemfibrozil, erythromycin, or niacin is administered concurrently. Myopathy
was not observed in a clinical trial in 74 patients involving patients
who were treated with fluvastatin sodium together with niacin. </p>

<p>Uncomplicated myalgia has been observed infrequently in patients treated
with Fluvastatin at rates indistinguishable from placebo. </p>

<p>The use of fibrates alone may occasionally be associated with myopathy.
The combined use of HMG-CoA inhibitors and fibrates should generally be
avoided. </p>

<p><a name="PRECAUTIONS"></a><b>PRECAUTIONS </b></p>

<p>GENERAL </p>

<p>Before instituting therapy with Fluvastatin , an attempt should be made
to control hypercholesterolemia with appropriate diet, exercise, and weight
reduction in obese patients, and to treat other underlying medical problems
(See INDICATIONS AND USAGE). </p>

<p>The HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors may cause elevation of creatine phosphokinase
and transaminase levels (See WARNINGS And ADVERSE REACTIONS). This should
be considered in the differential diagnosis of chest pain in a patient
on therapy with fluvastatin sodium. </p>

<p>HOMOZYGOUS FAMILIAL HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA </p>

<p>HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors are reported to be less effective in patients
with rare homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, possibly because these
patients have few functional LDL receptors. </p>

<p>INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS </p>

<p>Patients should be advised to report promptly unexplained muscle pain,
tenderness or weakness, particularly if accompanied by malaise or fever.
</p>

<p>DRUG INTERACTIONS </p>

<p>IMMUNOSUPPRESSIVE DRUGS, GEMFIBROZIL, NIACIN (NICOTINIC ACID), ERYTHROMYCIN:
See WARNINGS: Skeletal Muscle. </p>

<p>ANTIPYRINE: Administration of fluvastatin sodium does not influence
the metabolism and excretion of antipyrine, either by induction or inhibition.
Antipyrine is a model for drugs metabolized by the microsomal hepatic enzyme
system; therefore, interactions with other drugs metabolized by this mechanism
are not expected. </p>

<p>NIACIN/PROPRANOLOL: Concomitant administration of fluvastatin sodium
with niacin or propranolol has no effect on the bioavailability of fluvastatin
sodium. </p>

<p>CHOLESTYRAMINE: Administration of fluvastatin sodium concomitantly with,
or up to 4 hours after cholestyramine, results in fluvastatin decreases
of more than 50% for AUC and 50%-80% for Cmax. However, administration
of fluvastatin sodium 4 hours after cholestyramine resulted in a clinically
significant additive effect compared with that achieved with either component
drug. </p>

<p>DIGOXIN: In a crossover study involving 18 patients chronically receiving
digoxin, a single 40 mg dose of fluvastatin had no effect on digoxin AUC,
but had an 11% increase in digoxin Cmax and small increase in digoxin urinary
clearance. Patients taking digoxin should be monitored appropriately when
fluvastatin therapy is initiated. </p>

<p>CIMETIDINE/RANITIDINE/OMEPRAZOLE: Concomitant administration of fluvastatin
sodium with cimetidine, ranitidine and omeprazole results in a significant
increase in the fluvastatin Cmax (43%, 70% and 50%, respectively) and AUC
(24%- 33%), with an 18%-23% decrease in plasma clearance. </p>

<p>RIFAMPICIN: Administration of fluvastatin sodium to subjects pretreated
with rifampicin results in significant reduction in Cmax (59%) and AUC
(51%), with a large increase (95%) in plasma clearance. </p>

<p>WARFARIN: In Vitro protein binding studies demonstrated no interaction
at therapeutic concentrations. </p>

<p>OTHER CONCOMITANT THERAPY: Although specific interaction studies were
not performed, in clinical studies, fluvastatin sodium was used concomitantly
with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, beta blockers, calcium-channel
blockers, diuretics and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) without
evidence of clinically significant adverse interactions. </p>

<p>ENDOCRINE FUNCTION </p>

<p>HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors interfere with cholesterol synthesis and
lower circulating cholesterol levels and, as such, might theoretically
blunt adrenal or gonadal steroid hormone production. </p>

<p>Fluvastatin exhibited no effect upon non-stimulated cortisol levels
and demonstrated no effect upon thyroid metabolism as assessed by TSH.
Small declines in total testosterone have been noted in treated groups,
but no commensurate elevation in LH occurred, suggesting that the observation
was not due to a direct effect upon testosterone production. No effect
upon FSH in males was noted. Due to the limited number of premenopausal
females studied to date, no conclusions regarding the effect of fluvastatin
upon female sex hormones may be made. </p>

<p>Two investigational clinical studies in patients receiving fluvastatin
at doses up to 80 mg daily (twice the recommended dose) for periods of
24-28 weeks demonstrated no effect of treatment upon the adrenal response
to ACTH stimulation. A clinical study evaluated the effect of fluvastatin
at doses up to 80 mg daily for 28 weeks upon the gonadal response to HCG
stimulation. Although the mean total testosterone response was significantly
reduced (p&lt;0.05) relative to baseline in the 80 mg group, it was not
significant in comparison to the changes noted in groups receiving either
40 mg of fluvastatin or placebo. </p>

<p>Patients treated with fluvastatin sodium who develop clinical evidence
of endocrine dysfunction should be evaluated appropriately. Caution should
be exercised if an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor or other agent used to lower
cholesterol levels is administered to patients receiving other drugs (e.g.
ketoconazole, spironolactone, or cimetidine) that may decrease the levels
of endogenous steroid hormones. </p>

<p>CNS TOXICITY </p>

<p>CNS effects, as evidenced by decreased activity, ataxia, loss of righting
reflex, and ptosis were seen in the following animal studies: the 18-month
mouse carcinogenicity study at 50 mg/kg/day, the 6-month dog study at 36
mg/kg/day, the 6-month hamster study at 40 mg/kg/day, and in acute, high-dose
studies in rats and hamsters (50 mg/kg), rabbits (300 mg/kg) and mice (1500
mg/kg). CNS toxicity in the acute high-dose studies was characterized (in
mice) by conspicuous vacuolation in the ventral white columns of the spinal
cord at a dose of 5000 mg/kg and (in rat) by edema with separation of myelinated
fibers of the ventral spinal tracts and sciatic nerve at a dose of 1500
mg/kg. CNS toxicity, characterized by periaxonal vacuolization, was observed
in the medulla of dogs that died after treatment for 5 weeks with 48 mg/kg/day;
this finding was not observed in the remaining dogs when the dose level
was lowered to 36 mg/kg/day. CNS vascular lesions, characterized by perivascular
hemorrhages, edema, and mononuclear cell infiltration of perivascular spaces,
have been observed in dogs treated with other members of this class. No
CNS lesions have been observed after chronic treatment for up to 2 years
with fluvastatin in the mouse (at doses up to 350 mg/kg/day), rat (up to
24 mg/kg/day), or dog (up to 16 mg/kg/day). </p>

<p>CARCINOGENESIS, MUTAGENESIS, IMPAIRMENT OF FERTILITY </p>

<p>A 2-year study was performed in rats at dose levels of 6, 9, and 18-24
(escalated after 1 year) mg/kg/day. These treatment levels represented
plasma drug levels of approximately 9, 13, and 26-35 times the mean human
plasma drug concentration after a 40 mg oral dose. A low incidence of forestomach
squamous papillomas and 1 carcinoma of the forestomach at the 24 mg/kg/day
dose level was considered to reflect the prolonged hyperplasia induced
by direct contact exposure to fluvastatin sodium rather than to a systemic
effect of the drug. In addition, an increased incidence of thyroid follicular
cell adenomas and carcinomas was recorded for males treated with 18-24
mg/kg/day. The increased incidence of thyroid follicular cell neoplasm
in male rats with fluvastatin sodium appears to be consistent with species
specific findings from other HMG- CoA reductase inhibitors. In contrast
to other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, no hepatic adenomas or carcinomas
were observed. </p>

<p>The carcinogenicity study conducted in mice at dose levels of 0.3, 15
and 30 mg/kg/day revealed, as in rats, a statistically significant increase
in forestomach squamous cell papillomas in males and females at 30 mg/kg/day
and in females at 15 mg/kg/day. These treatment levels represented plasma
drug levels of approximately, 0.05, 2, and 7 times the mean human plasma
drug concentration after a 40 mg oral dose. </p>

<p>No evidence of mutagenicity was observed In Vitro, with or without rat-liver
metabolic activation, in the following studies: microbial mutagen tests
using mutant strains of Salmonella Typhimurium or Escherichia Coli; malignant
transformation assay in BALB/3T3 cells; unscheduled DNA synthesis in rat
primary hepatocytes; chromosomal aberrations in V79 Chinese Hamster cells;
HGPRT V79 Chinese Hamster cells. In addition, there was no evidence of
mutagenicity In Vivo in either a rat or mouse micronucleus test. </p>

<p>In a study in rats at dose levels for females of 0.6, 2 and 6 mg/kg/day
and for males at 2, 10 and 20 mg/kg/day fluvastatin sodium had no adverse
effects on the fertility or reproductive performance at any of the dose
levels studied. A study in which female rats were dosed during the third
trimester at 12 and 24 mg/kg/day resulted in maternal mortality at or near
term and postpartum. In addition, fetal and neonatal lethality were apparent.
No effects on the dam or fetus occurred at the low dose level of 2 mg/kg/day.
A second study at levels of 2, 6, 12 and 24 mg/kg/day confirmed the findings
in the first study. A modified Segment III study was performed at dose
levels of 12 or 24 mg/kg/day with or without the presence of concurrent
supplementation with mevalonic acid, a product of HMG-CoA reductase which
is essential for cholesterol biosynthesis. The concurrent administration
of mevalonic acid completely prevented the maternal and neonatal mortality.
Therefore, the maternal and neonatal lethality observed with fluvastatin
sodium reflect its exaggerated pharmacologic effect during pregnancy. </p>

<p>PREGNANCY </p>

<p>PREGNANCY CATEGORY X </p>

<p>See CONTRAINDICATIONS. </p>

<p>Fluvastatin sodium was not teratogenic rats at doses up to 36 mg/kg
daily or in rabbits at doses of up to 10 mg/kg/day. There are no data in
pregnant women. </p>

<p>NURSING MOTHERS </p>

<p>Based on preclinical data, drug is present in breast milk in a 2:1 ratio
(milk:plasma). Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in
nursing infants, nursing women should not take Fluvastatin (See CONTRAINDICATIONS).
</p>

<p>PEDIATRIC USE </p>

<p>Safety and effectiveness in individuals less than 18 years old have
not been established. Treatment in patients less than 18 years of age is
not recommended at this time. </p>

<p>GERIATRIC USE </p>

<p>The effect of age on the pharmacokinetics of fluvastatin sodium was
evaluated. Results indicate that for the general patient population plasma
concentrations of fluvastatin sodium do not vary either as a function of
age or gender. (See Also ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Pharmacokinetics/Metabolism.)
Elderly patients (&gt;/=65 years of age) demonstrated a greater treatment
response in respect to LDL-C, Total-C and LDL/HDL ratio than patients &lt;65
years of age. </p>

<p>In the controlled clinical studies and their open extensions, Fluvastatin
was discontinued in 1.0% of 1881 patients due to adverse experiences (mean
exposure approximately 14 months ranging in duration from 1- &gt;24 months).
This results in an exposure adjusted rate of 0.9% per patient-year in fluvastatin

<p>LABORATORY ABNORMALITIES: elevated transaminases, alkaline phosphatase,
and bilirubin; thyroid function abnormalities. </p>

<p>CONCOMITANT THERAPY </p>

<p>Fluvastatin sodium has been administered concurrently with cholestyramine
and nicotinic acid. No adverse reactions unique to the combination or in
addition to those previously reported for this class of drugs alone have
been reported. Myopathy and rhabdomyolysis (with or without acute renal
failure) have been reported when another HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor was
used in combination with immunosuppressive drugs, gemfibrozil, erythromycin,
or lipid-lowering doses of nicotinic acid. Concomitant therapy with HMG-CoA
reductase inhibitors and these agents is generally not recommended. (See
WARNINGS: Skeletal Muscle.) </p>

<p><a name="OVERDOSAGE"></a><b>OVERDOSAGE </b></p>

<p>The approximate oral LD50 is greater than 2 g/kg in mice and greater
than 0.7 g/kg in rats. </p>

<p>The maximum single oral dose received by healthy volunteers was 60 mg.
No clinically significant adverse experiences were seen at this dose. There
has been a single report of 2 children, one 2 years old and the other 3
years of age, either of whom may have possibly ingested fluvastatin sodium.
The maximum amount of fluvastatin sodium that could have been ingested
was 80 mg (4 X 20 mg capsules). Vomiting was induced by ipecac in both
children and no capsules were noted in their emesis. Neither child experienced
any adverse symptoms and both recovered from the incident without problems.
</p>

<p>No specific information on the treatment of overdosage can be recommended.
Should an accidental overdose occur, treat symptomatically and institute
supportive measures as required. The dialyzability of fluvastatin sodium
and of its metabolites in humans is not known at present. </p>

<p><a name="DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION"></a><b>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
</b></p>

<p>The patient should be placed on a standard cholesterol-lowering diet
before receiving Fluvastatin and should continue on this diet during treatment
with Fluvastatin . (See NCEP Treatment Guidelines for details on dietary
therapy.) </p>

<p>The recommended starting dose for the majority of patients is 20 mg
once daily at bedtime. The recommended dosing range is 20-40 mg/day as
a single dose in the evening. Splitting the 40 mg QPM dose into a BID regimen
provides a modest improvement in LDL-C response. Fluvastatin may be taken
without regard to meals, since there are no apparent differences in the
lipid- lowering effects of fluvastatin sodium administered with the evening
meal or 4 hours after the evening meal. Since the maximal reductions in
LDL-C of a given dose are seen within 4 weeks, periodic lipid determinations
should be performed during this time with dosage adjusted according to
the patient's response to therapy and established treatment guidelines.
The therapeutic effect of Fluvastatin is maintained with prolonged administration.
</p>

<p>CONCOMITANT THERAPY </p>

<p>Lipid-lowering effects on total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol are
additive when Fluvastatin is combined with a bile-acid binding resin or
niacin. When administering a bile-acid resin (e.g., cholestyramine) and
fluvastatin sodium, Fluvastatin should be administered at bedtime, at least
2 hours following the resin to avoid a significant interaction due to drug
binding to resin. (See Also ADVERSE REACTIONS: Concomitant Therapy.) </p>

<p>DOSAGE IN PATIENTS WITH RENAL INSUFFICIENCY </p>

<p>Since fluvastatin sodium is cleared hepatically with less than 5% of
the administered dose excreted into the urine, dose adjustments for mild
to moderate renal impairment are not necessary. Caution should be exercised
with severe impairment. </p>

<p><a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><b>DESCRIPTION </b></p>

<p>Ticlopidine is a platelet aggregation inhibitor. Chemically it is 5-((2-chlorophenyl)methyl)-4,5,6,7-tetrahydrothie
no(3,2-c) pyridine hydrochloride. Ticlopidine hydrochloride is a white
crystalline solid. It is freely soluble in water and self buffers to a
pH of 3.6. It also dissolves freely in methanol, is sparingly soluble in
methylene chloride and ethanol, slightly soluble in acetone, and insoluble
in a buffer solution of pH 6.3. It has a molecular weight of 300.25. </p>

<p><a name="ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY"></a><b>ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
</b></p>

<p>MECHANISM OF ACTION </p>

<p>When taken orally, ticlopidine hydrochloride causes a time and dose-dependent
inhibition of both platelet aggregation and release of platelet granule
constituents, as well as a prolongation of bleeding time. The intact drug
has no significant In Vitro activity at the concentrations attained In
Vivo, and, although analysis of urine and plasma indicates at least twenty
metabolites, no metabolite which accounts for the activity of ticlopidine
has been isolated. </p>

<p>Ticlopidine hydrochloride, after oral ingestion, interferes with platelet
membrane function by inhibiting ADP-induced platelet-fibrinogen binding
and subsequent platelet-platelet interactions. The effect on platelet function
is irreversible for the life of the platelet, as shown both by persistent
inhibition of fibrinogen binding after washing platelets Ex Vivo and by
inhibition of platelet aggregation after resuspension of platelets in buffered
medium. </p>

<p>PHARMACOKINETICS AND METABOLISM </p>

<p>After oral administration of a single 250 mg dose, ticlopidine hydrochloride
is rapidly absorbed, with peak plasma levels occurring at approximately
2 hours after dosing, and is extensively metabolized. Absorption is greater
than 80%. Administration after meals results in a 20% increase in the AUC
of ticlopidine. Ticlopidine hydrochloride displays non-linear pharmacokinetics
and clearance decreases markedly on repeated dosing. In older volunteers
the apparent half- life of ticlopidine after a single 250 mg dose is about
12.6 hours, with repeat dosing at 250 mg BID, the terminal elimination
half-life rises to 4-5 days and steady state levels of ticlopidine hydrochloride
in plasma are obtained after approximately 14-21 days. </p>

<p>Ticlopidine hydrochloride binds reversibly (98%) to plasma proteins,
mainly to serum albumin and lipoproteins. The binding to albumin and lipoproteins
is nonsaturable over a wide concentration range. Ticlopidine also binds
to alpha-1 acid glycoprotein. At concentrations attained with the recommended
dose, only 15% or less ticlopidine in plasma is bound to this protein.
</p>

<p>Ticlopidine hydrochloride is metabolized extensively by the liver; only
trace amounts of intact drug are detected in the urine. Following an oral
dose of radioactive ticlopidine hydrochloride administered in solution,
60% of the radioactivity is recovered in the urine and 23% in the feces.
Approximately, 1/3 of the dose excreted in the feces is intact ticlopidine
hydrochloride, possibly excreted in the bile. Ticlopidine hydrochloride
is a minor component in plasma (5%) after a single dose, but at steady
state is the major component (15%). Approximately 40-50% of the radioactive
metabolites circulating in plasma are covalently bound to plasma proteins,
probably by acylation. </p>

<p>Clearance of ticlopidine decreases with age. Steady state trough values
in elderly patients (mean age 70 years) are about twice those in young
volunteer populations. </p>

<p>HEPATICALLY IMPAIRED PATIENTS: The effect of decreased hepatic function
on the pharmacokinetics of Ticlopidine was studied in 17 patients with
advanced cirrhosis. The average plasma concentration of ticlopidine in
these subjects was slightly higher than that seen in older subjects in
a separate trial. (See Contraindications) </p>

<p>RENALLY IMPAIRED PATIENTS: Patients with mildly (Ccr 50-80 mL/min) or
moderately (Ccr 20-50 mL/min) impaired renal function were compared to
normal subjects (Ccr 80-150 mL/min) in a study of the pharmacokinetic and
platelet pharmacodynamic effects of Ticlopidine (250 mg BID) for 11 days.
Concentrations of unchanged Ticlopidine were measured after a single 250
mg dose and after the final 250 mg dose on Day 11. </p>

<p>AUC values of ticlopidine increased by 28 and 60% in mild and moderately
impaired patients respectively and plasma clearance decreased by 37 and
52% respectively, but there were no statistically significant differences
in ADP- induced platelet aggregation. In this small study (26 patients)
bleeding times showed significant prolongation only in the moderately impaired
patients. </p>

<p>PHARMACODYNAMICS </p>

<p>In healthy volunteers over the age of 50 substantial inhibition (over
50%) of ADP-induced platelet aggregation is detected within 4 days after
administration of ticlopidine hydrochloride 250 mg BID and maximum platelet
aggregation inhibition (60-70%) is achieved after 8 to 11 days. Lower doses
cause less, and more delayed, platelet aggregation inhibition, while doses
above 250 mg BID give little additional effect on platelet aggregation,
but an increased rate of adverse effects. The dose of 250 mg BID is the
only dose that has been evaluated in controlled clinical trials. </p>

<p>After discontinuation of ticlopidine hydrochloride, bleeding time and
other platelet function tests return to normal within two weeks in the
majority of patients. </p>

<p>At the recommended therapeutic dose (250 mg BID), ticlopidine hydrochloride
has no known significant pharmacological actions in man other than inhibition
of platelet function and prolongation of the bleeding time. </p>

<p>CLINICAL STUDIES: </p>

<p>CLINICAL TRIALS </p>

<p>The effect of ticlopidine on the risk of stroke and cardiovascular events
was studied in two multi-center randomized double-blind trials. </p>

<p>1. STUDY IN PATIENTS EXPERIENCING STROKE PRECURSORS: In a trial comparing
ticlopidine and aspirin (The Ticlopidine Aspirin Stroke Study or TASS),
3069 patients (1987 men, 1082 women) who had experienced such stroke precursors
as transient ischemic attack (TIA), transient monocular blindness (amaurosis
fugax), reversible ischemic neurological deficit, or minor stroke were
randomized to ticlopidine 250 mg BID or aspirin 650 mg BID. The study was
designed to follow patients for at least 2 and up to 5 years. </p>

<p>Over the duration of the study, Ticlopidine significantly reduced the
risk of fatal and nonfatal stroke by 24% (p=.011) from 18.1 to 13.8 per
100 patients followed for five years, compared to aspirin. During the first
year, when the risk of stroke is greatest, the reduction in risk of stroke
(fatal and nonfatal) compared to aspirin was 48%, the reduction was similar
in men and women. </p>

<p>2. STUDY IN PATIENTS WHO HAD A COMPLETED ATHEROTHROMBOTIC STROKE: </p>

<p>In a trial comparing ticlopidine with placebo (The Canadian American
Ticlopidine Study, or CATS) 1073 patients who had experienced a previous
atherothrombotic stroke were treated with Ticlopidine 250 mg BID or placebo
for up to 3 years. </p>

<p>Ticlopidine significantly reduced the overall risk of stroke by 24%
(p=.017) from 24.6 to 18.6 per 100 patients followed for three years, compared
to placebo. During the first year the reduction in risk of fatal and nonfatal
stroke over placebo was 33%. </p>

<p><a name="INDICATIONS AND USAGE"></a><b>INDICATIONS AND USAGE </b></p>

<p>Ticlopidine is indicated to reduce the risk of thrombotic stroke (fatal
or nonfatal) in patients who have experienced stroke precursors, and in
patients who have had a completed thrombotic stroke. </p>

<p>Because Ticlopidine is associated with a risk of neutropenia/agranulocytosis,
which may be life- threatening (See Warnings), Ticlopidine should be reserved
for patients who are intolerant to aspirin therapy where indicated to prevent
stroke. </p>

<p><a name="CONTRAINDICATIONS"></a><b>CONTRAINDICATIONS </b></p>

<p>The use of Ticlopidine is contraindicated in the following conditions:
</p>

<p>-- Hypersensitivity to the drug. </p>

<p>-- Presence of hematopoietic disorders such as neutropenia and thrombocytopenia.
</p>

<p>-- Presence of a hemostatic disorder or active pathological bleeding
(such as bleeding peptic ulcer or intracranial bleeding). </p>

<p>-- Patients with severe liver impairment. </p>

<p>THROMBOCYTOPENIA </p>

<p>RARELY, THROMBOCYTOPENIA MAY OCCUR IN ISOLATION OR TOGETHER WITH NEUTROPENIA.
IF CLINICAL EVALUATION AND REPEAT LABORATORY TESTING CONFIRM THE PRESENCE
OF THROMBOCYTOPENIA (&lt;80,000 CELLS/MM(CUBED)), THE DRUG SHOULD BE DISCONTINUED.
RARELY, IMMUNE THROMBOCYTOPENIA (ITP) AND THROMBOTIC THROMBOCYTOPENIC PURPURA
(TTP) HAVE BEEN REPORTED AND SOME OF THESE RARE CASES HAVE BEEN FATAL.
THEREFORE, CAREFUL ATTENTION TO DIAGNOSIS SHOULD BE MADE TO GUIDE TREATMENT.
OTHER HEMATOLOGICAL EFFECTS </p>

<p>Rare cases of agranulocytosis, pancytopenia or aplastic anemia have
been reported in post- marketing experience, some of which have been fatal.
All forms of hematological adverse reactions are potentially fatal. </p>

<p>CHOLESTEROL ELEVATION </p>

<p>Ticlopidine therapy causes increased serum cholesterol and triglycerides.
Serum total cholesterol levels are increased 8-10% within one month of
therapy and persist at that level. The ratios of the lipoprotein subfractions
are unchanged. </p>

<p>ANTICOAGULANT DRUGS </p>

<p>The tolerance and safety of coadministration of Ticlopidine with heparin,
oral anticoagulants, or fibrinolytic agents has not been established. If
a patient is switched from an anticoagulant or fibrinolytic drug to Ticlopidine,
the former drug should be discontinued prior to Ticlopidine administration.
</p>

<p><a name="PRECAUTIONS"></a><b>PRECAUTIONS </b></p>

<p>GENERAL </p>

<p>Ticlopidine should be used with caution in patients who may be at risk
of increased bleeding from trauma, surgery, or pathological conditions.
If it is desired to eliminate the antiplatelet effects of Ticlopidine prior
to elective surgery, the drug should be discontinued 10-14 days prior to
surgery. Several controlled clinical studies have found increased surgical
blood loss in patients undergoing surgery during treatment with ticlopidine.
In TASS and CATS it was recommended that patients have ticlopidine discontinued
prior to elective surgery. Several hundred patients underwent surgery during
the trials, and no excessive surgical bleeding was reported. </p>

<p>Prolonged bleeding time is normalized within two hours after administration
of 20 mg methylprednisolone i.v. Platelet transfusions may also be used
to reverse the effect of Ticlopidine on bleeding. Platelet transfusions
are usually not indicated in patients with TTP on ticlopidine. </p>

<p>GI BLEEDING </p>

<p>Ticlopidine prolongs template bleeding time. The drug should be used
with caution in patients who have lesions with a propensity to bleed (such
as ulcers). Drugs that might induce such lesions should be used with caution
in patients on Ticlopidine. (See Contraindications.) </p>

<p>USE IN HEPATICALLY IMPAIRED PATIENTS </p>

<p>Since ticlopidine is metabolized by the liver, dosing of Ticlopidine
or other drugs metabolized in the liver may require adjustment upon starting
or stopping concomitant therapy. Because of limited experience in patients
with severe hepatic disease, who may have bleeding diatheses, the use of
Ticlopidine is not recommended in this population. (See Actions/Clinical
Pharmacology and Contraindications.) </p>

<p>USE IN RENALLY IMPAIRED PATIENTS </p>

<p>There is limited experience in patients with renal impairment. Decreased
plasma clearance, increased AUC values, and prolonged bleeding times can
occur in renally impaired patients. In controlled clinical trials, no unexpected
problems have been encountered in patients having mild renal impairment
and there is no experience with dosage adjustment in patients with greater
degrees of renal impairment. Nevertheless, for renally impaired patients
it may be necessary to reduce the dosage of ticlopidine or discontinue
it altogether, if hemorrhagic or hematopoietic problems are encountered.
(See Actions/Clinical Pharmacology.) </p>

<p>INFORMATION FOR THE PATIENT </p>

<p>Patients should be told that a decrease in the number of white blood
cells (neutropenia) can occur with Ticlopidine, especially during the first
three months of treatment, and that if neutropenia is severe, it could
result in an increased risk of infection. They should be told it is critically
important to obtain the scheduled blood tests to detect neutropenia. Patients
should also be reminded to contact their physicians if they experience
any indication of infection such as fever, chills, and sore throat, all
of which may be consequences of neutropenia. All patients should be told
that it may take them longer than usual to stop bleeding when they take
Ticlopidine and that they should report any unusual bleeding to their physician.
Patients should tell physicians and dentists that they are taking Ticlopidine
before any surgery is scheduled and before any new drug is prescribed.
</p>

<p>Patients should be told to report promptly side effects of Ticlopidine
such as severe or persistent diarrhea, skin rashes, or subcutaneous bleeding,
or any signs of cholestasis, such as yellow skin or sclera, dark urine,
or light colored stools. Patients should be told to take Ticlopidine with
food or just after eating in order to minimize gastrointestinal discomfort.
</p>

<p>LABORATORY TESTS </p>

<p>Liver Function: Ticlopidine therapy has been associated with elevations
of alkaline phosphatase and transaminases which generally occurred within
1-4 months of therapy initiation. In controlled clinical trials, the incidence
of elevated alkaline phosphatase (greater than 2 times upper limit of normal)
was 7.6% in ticlopidine patients, 6.0% in placebo patients and 2.5% in
aspirin patients. The incidence of elevated AST (SGOT) (greater than 2
times upper limit of normal) was 3.1% in ticlopidine patients, 4.0% in
placebo patients and 2.1% in aspirin patients. No progressive increases
were observed in closely monitored clinical trials (e.g. no transaminase
greater than 10 times the upper limit of normal was seen), but most patients
with these abnormalities had therapy discontinued. Occasionally patients
had developed minor elevations in bilirubin. Based on post-marketing and
clinical trials experiences, liver function testing, including SGPT and
GGTP, should be considered whenever liver dysfunction is suspected, particularly
during the first four months of treatment. </p>

<p>DRUG INTERACTIONS </p>

<p>Therapeutic doses of Ticlopidine caused a 30% increase in the plasma
half-life of antipyrine and may cause analogous effects on similarly metabolized
drugs. Therefore the dose of drugs metabolized by hepatic microsomal enzymes
with low therapeutic ratios, or being given to patients with hepatic impairment,
may require adjustment to maintain optimal therapeutic blood levels when
starting or stopping concomitant therapy with ticlopidine. Studies of specific
drug interactions yielded the following results: </p>

<p>ASPIRIN AND OTHER NSAIDS: Ticlopidine potentiates the effect of aspirin
or other NSAIDS on platelet aggregation. The safety of concomitant use
of ticlopidine with aspirin or other NSAIDS has not been established. Aspirin
did not modify the ticlopidine-mediated inhibition of ADP induced platelet
aggregation, but ticlopidine potentiated the effect of aspirin on collagen-induced
platelet aggregation. Concomitant use of aspirin and ticlopidine is not
recommended. (See Precautions--GI Bleeding.) </p>

<p>ANTACIDS: Administration of Ticlopidine after antacids resulted in an
18% decrease in plasma levels of ticlopidine. </p>

<p>CIMETIDINE: Chronic administration of cimetidine reduced the clearance
of a single dose of Ticlopidine by 50%. </p>

<p>DIGOXIN: Co-administration of Ticlopidine with digoxin resulted in a
slight decrease (approximately 15%) in digoxin plasma levels. Little or
no change in therapeutic efficacy of digoxin would be expected. </p>

<p>THEOPHYLLINE: In normal volunteers, concomitant administration of Ticlopidine
resulted in a significant increase in the theophylline elimination half-life
from 8.6 to 12.2 hr and a comparable reduction in total plasma clearance
of theophylline. </p>

<p>PHENOBARBITAL: In six normal volunteers, the inhibitory effects of Ticlopidine
on platelet aggregation were not altered by chronic administration of phenobarbital.
</p>

<p>PHENYTOIN: In Vitro studies demonstrated that ticlopidine does not alter
the plasma protein binding of phenytoin. However, the protein binding interactions
of ticlopidine and its metabolites have not been studied In Vivo. Several
cases of elevated phenytoin plasma levels with associated somnolence and
lethargy have been reported following co-administration with Ticlopidine.
Caution should be exercised in coadministering this drug with Ticlopidine
and it may be useful to remeasure phenytoin blood concentrations. </p>

<p>PROPRANOLOL: In Vitro studies demonstrated that ticlopidine does not
alter the plasma protein binding of propranolol. However, the protein binding
interactions of ticlopidine and its metabolites have not been studied In
Vivo. Caution should be exercised in coadministering this drug with Ticlopidine.
</p>

<p>OTHER CONCOMITANT THERAPY: Although specific interaction studies were
not performed, in clinical studies, Ticlopidine was used concomitantly
with beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, and diuretics without evidence
of clinically significant adverse interactions. (See Precautions.) </p>

<p>FOOD INTERACTION: The oral bioavailability of ticlopidine is increased
by 20% when taken after a meal. Administration of Ticlopidine with food
is recommended to maximize gastrointestinal tolerance. In controlled trials,
Ticlopidine was taken with meals. </p>

<p>CARCINOGENESIS, MUTAGENESIS, IMPAIRMENT OF FERTILITY In a two-year oral
carcinogenicity study in rats, ticlopidine at daily doses of up to 100
mg/kg (610 mg/M(squared)) was not tumorigenic. For a 70kg person (1.73M(squared)
body surface area), the dose represents 14 times the recommended clinical
dose on a mg/kg basis and 2 times the clinical dose on body surface area
basis. In a 78 week oral carcinogenicity study in mice ticlopidine at daily
doses up to 275 mg/kg (1180 mg/M(squared)) was not tumorigenic. The dose
represents 40 times the recommended clinical dose on a mg/kg basis and
4 times the clinical dose on body surface area basis. </p>

<p>Ticlopidine was not mutagenic in In Vitro Ames test, rat hepatocyte
DNA-repair assay, and Chinese hamster fibroblast chromosomal aberration
test and In Vivo mouse spermatozoid morphology test, Chinese hamster micronucleus
test and Chinese hamster bone marrow cell sister chromatid exchange test.
Ticlopidine was found to have no effect on fertility of male and female
rats at oral doses up to 400 mg/kg/day. </p>

<p>PREGNANCY: TERATOGENIC EFFECTS </p>

<p>Pregnancy Category B. Teratology studies have been conducted in mice
(doses up to 200 mg/kg/day), rats (doses up to 400 mg/kg/day) and rabbits
(doses up to 200 mg/kg/day). Doses of 400 mg/kg in rats, 200 mg/kg/day
in mice, and 100mg/kg in rabbits produced maternal toxicity as well as
fetal toxicity, but there was no evidence of a teratogenic potential of
ticlopidine. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies
in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive
of a human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if
clearly needed. </p>

<p>NURSING MOTHERS </p>

<p>Studies in rats have shown ticlopidine is excreted in the milk. It is
not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs
are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse
reactions in nursing infants from ticlopidine, a decision should be made
whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into
account the importance of the drug to the mother. </p>

<p>PEDIATRIC USE </p>

<p>Safety and efficacy in patients under the age of 18 have not been established.
</p>

<p>GERIATRIC USE </p>

<p>Clearance of ticlopidine is somewhat lower in elderly patients and trough
levels are increased. The major clinical trials with Ticlopidine were conducted
in an elderly population with an average age of 64 years. Of the total
number of patients in the therapeutic trials, 45% of patients were over
65 years old and 12% were over 75 years old. No overall differences in
effectiveness or safety were observed between these patients and younger
patients, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences
in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity
of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. </p>

<p><a name="ADVERSE REACTIONS"></a><b>ADVERSE REACTIONS </b></p>

<p>Adverse reactions were relatively frequent, with over 50% of patients
reporting at least one. Most (30 to 40%) involved the gastrointestinal
tract. Most adverse effects are mild, but 21% of patients discontinued
therapy because of an adverse event, principally diarrhea, rash, nausea,
vomiting, GI pain, and neutropenia. Most adverse effects occur early in
the course of treatment, but a new onset of adverse effects can occur after
several months. </p>

<p>The incidence rates of adverse events listed in the following table
were derived from multicenter, controlled clinical trials described above
comparing Ticlopidine, placebo, and aspirin over study periods of up to
5.8 years. Adverse events considered by the investigator to be probably

<p>HEMATOLOGICAL </p>

<p>Neutropenia/thrombocytopenia (See Warnings), agranulocytosis, eosinophilia,
pancytopenia, thrombocytosis, and bone marrow depression have been reported.
</p>

<p>GASTROINTESTINAL </p>

<p>Ticlopidine therapy has been associated with a variety of gastrointestinal
complaints including diarrhea and nausea. The majority of cases are mild,
but about 13% of patients discontinued therapy because of these. They usually
occur within 3 months of initiation of therapy and typically are resolved
within 1-2 weeks without discontinuation of therapy. If the effect is severe
or persistent, therapy should be discontinued. In some cases of severe
or bloody diarrhea, colitis was later diagnosed. </p>

<p>HEMORRHAGIC </p>

<p>Ticlopidine has been associated with increased bleeding, spontaneous
post-traumatic bleeding, and perioperative bleeding including, but not
limited to, gastrointestinal bleeding. It has also been associated with
a number of bleeding complications such as ecchymosis, epistaxis, hematuria,
and conjunctival hemorrhage. </p>

<p>Intracerebral bleeding was rare in clinical trials with Ticlopidine,
with an incidence no greater than that seen with comparator agents (ticlopidine
0.5%, aspirin 0.6%, placebo 0.75%). It has also been reported post-marketing.
</p>

<p>RASH </p>

<p>Ticlopidine has been associated with a maculopapular or urticarial rash
(often with pruritus). Rash usually occurs within 3 months of initiation
of therapy, with a mean onset time of 11 days. If drug is discontinued,
recovery occurs within several days. Many rashes do not recur on drug rechallenge.
There have been rare reports of severe rashes, including Stevens Johnson
syndrome, erythema multiforme, and exfoliative dermatitis. </p>

<p><a name="OVERDOSAGE"></a><b>OVERDOSAGE </b></p>

<p>One case of deliberate overdosage with Ticlopidine has been reported
by foreign postmarketing surveillance program. A 38 year old male took
a single 6000 mg dose of Ticlopidine (equivalent to 24 standard 250 mg
tablets). The only abnormalities reported were increased bleeding time
and increased SGPT. No special therapy was instituted and the patient recovered
without sequelae. Single oral doses of ticlopidine at 1600 mg/kg and 500
mg/kg were lethal to rats and mice, respectively. Symptoms of acute toxicity
were GI hemorrhage, convulsions, hypothermia, dyspnea, loss of equilibrium
and abnormal gait. </p>

<p><a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><b>DESCRIPTION </b></p>

<p>Cefadroxil is a semisynthetic cephalosporin antibiotic intended for
oral administration. It is a white to yellowish-white crystalline powder.
It is soluble in water and it is acid-stable. It is chemically designated
as 5-Thia-1-azabicyclo(4.2.0)oct-2-ene-2-carboxylic acid, 7-((amino(4-hydroxyphenyl)acetyl)amino)-3-methyl-8-oxo,
monohydrate, (6R- (6alpha,7beta(R*)))-. It has the formula C16H17N3O5S.H2O
and the molecular weight of 381.40. </p>

<p><a name="ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY"></a><b>ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
</b></p>

<p>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY--Cefadroxil is rapidly absorbed after oral administration.
Following single doses of 500 and 1000 mg, average peak serum concentrations
were approximately 16 and 28 mcgm/mL, respectively. Measurable levels were
present 12 hours after administration. Over 90% of the drug is excreted
unchanged in the urine within 24 hours. Peak urine concentrations are approximately
1800 mcgm/mL during the period following a single 500-mg oral dose. Increases
in dosage generally produce a proportionate increase in Cefadroxil urinary
concentration. The urine antibiotic concentration, following a 1-g dose
was maintained well above the MIC of susceptible urinary pathogens for
20 to 22 hours. </p>

<p>MICROBIOLOGY: In Vitro tests demonstrate that the cephalosporins are
bactericidal because of their inhibition of cell-wall synthesis. Cefadroxil
has been shown to be active against the following organisms both In Vitro
and in clinical infections (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE): </p>

<p>Beta-hemolytic streptococci </p>

<p>Staphylococci, including </p>

<p>penicillinase-producing strains </p>

<p>Streptococcus (Diplococcus) Pneumoniae </p>

<p>Escherichia Coli </p>

<p>Proteus Mirabilis </p>

<p>Klebsiella species </p>

<p>Moraxella (Branhamella) Catarrhalis </p>

<p>NOTE: Most strains of Enterococci Faecalis (formerly Streptococcus Faecalis)
and Enterococcus Faecium (formerly Streptococcus Faecium) are resistant
to Cefadroxil. It is not active against most strains of Enterobacter species,
Morganella Morganii (formerly Proteus Morganii), and P. Vulgaris. It has
no activity against Pseudomonas species and Acinetobacter Calcoaceticus
(formerly Mima and Herellea species.) </p>

<p>SUSCEPTIBILITY TESTS: DIFFUSION TECHNIQUES </p>

<p>The use of antibiotic disk susceptibility test methods which measure
zone diameter give an accurate estimation of antibiotic susceptibility.
One such standard procedure (REF. 1) which has been recommended for use
with disks to test susceptibility of organisms to cefadroxil uses the cephalosporin
class (cephalothin) disk. Interpretation involves the correlation of the
diameters obtained in the disk test with the minimum inhibitory concentration
(MIC) for cefadroxil. </p>

<p>Reports from the laboratory giving results of the standard single-disk
susceptibility test with a 30 mcgm cephalothin disk should be interpreted
according to the following criteria: </p>

<p>ZONE DIAMETER (MM) INTERPRETATION &gt;/=18 (S) Susceptible 15-17 (I)
Intermediate &lt; or =14 Resistant A report of &quot;Susceptible&quot;
indicates that the pathogen is likely to be inhibited by generally achievable
blood levels. A report of &quot;Intermediate susceptibility&quot; suggests
that the organism would be susceptible if high dosage is used or if the
infection is confined to tissue and fluid (eg, urine) in which high antibiotic
levels are attained. A report of &quot;Resistant&quot; indicates that achievable
concentrations of the antibiotic are unlikely to be inhibitory and other
therapy should be selected. </p>

<p>Standardized procedures require the use of laboratory control organisms.
The 30 mcgm cephalothin disk should give the following zone diameters:

Coli ATCC 25922 17-22 </p>

<p>When using the NCCLS agar dilution or broth dilution (including microdilution)
method (REF. 2) or equivalent, a bacterial isolate may be considered susceptible
if the MIC (minimum inhibitory concentration) value for cephalothin is
8 mcgm/mL or less. Organisms are considered resistant if the MIC is 32
mcgm/mL or greater. Organisms with an MIC value of less than 32 mcgm/mL
but greater than 8 mcgm/mL are intermediate. </p>

<p>As with standard diffusion methods, dilution procedures require the
use of laboratory control organisms. Standard cephalothin powder should
give MIC values in the range of 0.12 mcgm/mL and 0.5 mcgm/mL for Staphylococcus
Aureus ATCC 29213. For Escherichia Coli ATCC 25922, the MIC range should
be between 4.0 mcgm/mL and 16.0 mcgm/mL. For Streptococcus Faecalis ATCC
29212, the MIC range should be between 8.0 and 32.0 mcgm/mL. </p>

<p><a name="INDICATIONS AND USAGE"></a><b>INDICATIONS AND USAGE </b></p>

<p>Cefadroxil is indicated for the treatment of patients with infection
caused by susceptible strains of the designated organisms in the following
diseases: </p>

<p>Urinary tract infections caused by E. Coli, P. Mirabilis, and Klebsiella
species. </p>

<p>Skin and skin structure infections caused by staphylococci and/or streptococci.
</p>

<p>Pharyngitis and tonsillitis caused by group A beta-hemolytic streptococci.
(Penicillin is the usual drug of choice in the treatment and prevention
of streptococcal infections, including the prophylaxis of rheumatic fever.
Cefadroxil is generally effective in the eradication of streptococci from
the nasopharynx; however, substantial data establishing the efficacy of
Cefadroxil in the subsequent prevention of rheumatic fever are not available
at present.) </p>

<p>NOTE: Culture and susceptibility tests should be initiated prior to
and during therapy. Renal function studies should be performed when indicated.
</p>

<p><a name="CONTRAINDICATIONS"></a><b>CONTRAINDICATIONS </b></p>

<p>Cefadroxil is contraindicated in patients with known allergy to the
cephalosporin group of antibiotics. </p>

<p><a name="WARNINGS"></a><b>WARNINGS </b></p>

<p>BEFORE THERAPY WITH CEFADROXIL IS INSTITUTED, CAREFUL INQUIRY SHOULD
BE MADE TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE PATIENT HAS HAD PREVIOUS HYPERSENSITIVITY
REACTIONS TO CEFADROXIL, CEPHALOSPORINS, PENICILLINS OR OTHER DRUGS. IF
THIS PRODUCT IS TO BE GIVEN TO PENICILLIN-SENSITIVE PATIENTS, CAUTION SHOULD
BE EXERCISED BECAUSE CROSS-SENSITIVITY AMONG BETA-LACTAM ANTIBIOTICS HAS
BEEN CLEARLY DOCUMENTED AND MAY OCCUR IN UP TO 10% OF PATIENTS WITH A HISTORY
OF PENICILLIN ALLERGY. </p>

<p>IF AN ALLERGIC REACTION TO CEFADROXIL OCCURS, DISCONTINUE THE DRUG.
SERIOUS ACUTE HYPERSENSITIVITY REACTIONS MAY REQUIRE TREATMENT WITH EPINEPHRINE
AND OTHER EMERGENCY MEASURES, INCLUDING OXYGEN, INTRAVENOUS FLUIDS, INTRAVENOUS
ANTIHISTAMINES, CORTICOSTEROIDS, PRESSOR AMINES, AND AIRWAY MANAGEMENT,
AS CLINICALLY INDICATED. </p>

<p>PSEUDOMEMBRANOUS COLITIS HAS BEEN REPORTED WITH NEARLY ALL ANTIBACTERIAL
AGENTS INCLUDING CEFADROXIL, AND MAY RANGE FROM MILD TO LIFE-THREATENING.
THEREFORE, IT IS IMPORTANT TO CONSIDER THIS DIAGNOSIS IN PATIENTS WHO PRESENT
WITH DIARRHEA SUBSEQUENT TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF ANTIBACTERIAL AGENTS.
</p>

<p>Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon
and may permit overgrowth of clostridia. Studies indicate that a toxin
produced by Clostridium Difficile is a primary cause of &quot;antibiotic-associated
colitis&quot;. </p>

<p>After the diagnosis of pseudomembranous colitis has been established,
therapeutic measures should be initiated. Mild cases of pseudomembranous
colitis usually respond to discontinuation of the drug alone. In moderate
to severe cases, consideration should be given to management with fluids
and electrolytes, protein supplementation and treatment with an antibacterial
drug effective against Clostridium Difficile. </p>

<p><a name="PRECAUTIONS"></a><b>PRECAUTIONS </b></p>

<p>GENERAL: Cefadroxil should be used with caution in the presence of markedly
impaired renal function (creatinine clearance rate of less than 50 mL/min/
1.73M(square)) (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION.) In patients with known
or suspected renal impairment, careful clinical observation and appropriate
laboratory studies should be made prior to and during therapy.</p>

<p>Prolonged use of Cefadroxil may result in the overgrowth of nonsusceptible
organisms. Careful observation of the patient is essential. If superinfection
occurs during therapy, appropriate measures should be taken. </p>

<p>Cefadroxil should be prescribed with caution in individuals with history
of gastrointestinal disease, particularly colitis. </p>

<p><a name="DRUG INTERACTIONS"></a>DRUG/LABORATORY TEST INTERACTIONS </p>

<p>Positive direct Coombs' tests have been reported during treatment with
the cephalosporin antibiotics. In hematologic studies or in transfusion
cross- matching procedures when antiglobulin tests are performed on the
minor side or in Coombs' testing of newborns whose mothers have received
cephalosporin antibiotics before parturition, it should be recognized that
a positive Coombs' test may be due to the drug. </p>

<p>CARCINOGENESIS, MUTAGENESIS, AND IMPAIRMENT OF FERTILITY: No long-term
studies have been performed to determine carcinogenic potential. No genetic
toxicity tests have been performed. </p>

<p>PREGNANCY: Pregnancy Category B: Reproduction studies have been performed
in mice and rats at doses up to 11 times the human dose and have revealed
no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to cefadroxil
monohydrate. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies
in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive
of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly
needed. </p>

<p>LABOR AND DELIVERY: Cefadroxil has not been studied for use during labor
and delivery. Treatment should only be given if clearly needed. </p>

<p>NURSING MOTHERS: Caution should be exercised when cefadroxil monohydrate
is administered to a nursing mother. </p>

<p>PEDIATRIC USE: (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). </p>

<p><a name="ADVERSE REACTIONS"></a><b>ADVERSE REACTIONS </b></p>

<p>GASTROINTESTINAL--Onset of pseudomembranous colitis symptoms may occur
during or after antibiotic treatment (See WARNINGS). Nausea and vomiting
have been reported rarely. Diarrhea has also occurred. </p>

<p>HYPERSENSITIVITY--Allergies (in the form of rash, urticaria, and angioedema)
have been observed. These reactions usually subsided upon discontinuation
of the drug. </p>

<p>Other reactions have included genital pruritus, genital moniliasis,
vaginitis, moderate transient neutropenia, and minor elevations in serum
transaminase. Stevens-Johnson syndrome has been rarely reported. </p>

<p>In addition to the adverse reactions listed above which have been observed
in patients treated with cefadroxil, the following adverse reactions and
altered laboratory tests have been reported for cephalosporin-class antibiotics:
</p>

<p>Anaphylaxis, erythema multiforme, toxic epidermal necrolysis, fever,
abdominal pain, superinfection, renal dysfunction, toxic nephropathy, hepatic
dysfunction including cholestasis, aplastic anemia, hemolytic anemia, hemorrhage,
prolonged prothrombin time, positive Coombs' test, increased BUN, increased
creatinine, elevated alkaline phosphatase, elevated aspartate aminotransferase
(AST), elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT), elevated bilirubin, elevated
LDH, eosinophilia, pancytopenia, neutropenia, agranulocytosis, thrombocytopenia.
</p>

<p>Several cephalosporins have been implicated in triggering seizures,
particularly in patients with renal impairment, when the dosage was not
reduced (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION and OVERDOSAGE). If seizures associated
with drug therapy occur, the drug should be discontinued. Anticonvulsant
therapy can be given if clinically indicated. </p>

<p><a name="OVERDOSAGE"></a><b>OVERDOSAGE </b></p>

<p>A study of children under six years of age suggested that ingestion
of less than 250 mg/kg of cephalosporins is not associated with significant
outcomes. No action is required other than general support and observation.
For amounts greater than 250 mg/kg, induce gastric emptying. </p>

<p>In five anuric patients. it was demonstrated that an average of 63%
of a 1 g oral dose is extracted from the body during a 6-8 hour hemodialysis
session. </p>

<p><a name="DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION"></a><b>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
</b></p>

<p>Cefadroxil is acid-stable and may be administered orally without regard
to meals. Administration with food may be helpful in diminishing potential
gastrointestinal complaints occasionally associated with oral cephalosporin
therapy. </p>

<p>ADULTS </p>

<p>URINARY TRACT INFECTIONS: For uncomplicated lower urinary tract infections
(ie, cystitis) the usual dosage is 1 or 2 g per day in single (q.d.) or
divided doses (b.i.d.). </p>

<p>For all other urinary tract infections the usual dosage is 2 g per day
in divided doses (b.i.d.). </p>

<p>SKIN AND SKIN STRUCTURE INFECTIONS: For skin and skin structure infections
the usual dosage is 1 g per day in single (q.d.) or divided doses (b.i.d.).
</p>

<p>PHARYNGITIS AND TONSILLITIS: Treatment of group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal
pharyngitis and tonsillitis--1 g per day in single (q.d.) or divided doses
(b.i.d.) for 10 days. </p>

<p>CHILDREN </p>

<p>For urinary tract infections, the recommended daily dosage for children
is 30 mg/kg/day in divided doses every 12 hours. For pharyngitis, tonsillitis,
and impetigo, the recommended daily dosage for children is 30 mg/kg/day
in a single dose or in equally divided doses every 12 hours. For other
skin and skin structure infections, the recommended daily dosage is 30
mg/kg/day in equally divided doses every 12 hours. In the treatment of
beta-hemolytic streptococcal infections, a therapeutic dosage of Cefadroxil
should be administered for at least 10 days. See chart for total daily
dosage for children.</p>

<p>above In patients with renal impairment, the dosage of cefadroxil monohydrate
should be adjusted according to creatinine clearance rates to prevent drug
accumulation. The following schedule is suggested. In adults, the initial
dose is 1000 mg of Cefadroxil and the maintenance dose (based on the creatinine
clearance rate ((mL/min/1.73 M(square))) is 500 mg at the time intervals
listed below. </p>

<p><a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><b>DESCRIPTION </b></p>

<p>Glyburide (micronized) Tablets contain micronized (smaller particle
size) glyburide, which is an oral blood-glucose-lowering drug of the sulfonylurea
class. Glyburide is a white, crystalline compound, formulated as Glyburide
(micronized) Tablets. The chemical name for glyburide is 1-((p-(2-(5-chloro-o-anisamido)ethyl)phenyl)-sulfonyl)-3-cyclohexylurea
and the molecular weight is 493.99. </p>

<p><a name="ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY"></a><b>ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
</b></p>

<p>ACTIONS </p>

<p>Glyburide appears to lower the blood glucose acutely by stimulating
the release of insulin from the pancreas, an effect dependent upon functioning
beta cells in the pancreatic islets. The mechanism by which glyburide lowers
blood glucose during long-term administration has not been clearly established.
With chronic administration in Type II diabetic patients, the blood glucose
lowering effect persists despite a gradual decline in the insulin secretory
response to the drug. Extrapancreatic effects may be involved in the mechanism
of action of oral sulfonylurea hypoglycemic drugs. </p>

<p>Some patients who are initially responsive to oral hypoglycemic drugs,
including glyburide, may become unresponsive or poorly responsive over
time. Alternatively, glyburide may be effective in some patients who have
become unresponsive to one or more other sulfonylurea drugs. </p>

<p>In addition to its blood glucose lowering actions, glyburide produces
a mild diuresis by enhancement of renal free water clearance. Disulfiram-like
reactions have very rarely been reported in patients treated with glyburide.
</p>

<p>PHARMACOKINETICS </p>

<p>Single dose studies with Glyburide (micronized) Tablets in normal subjects
demonstrate significant absorption of glyburide within one hour, peak drug
levels at about two to three hours, and low but detectable levels at twenty-four
hours. </p>

<p>Bioavailability studies have demonstrated that Glyburide (micronized)
Tablets 3 mg provide serum glyburide concentrations that are not bioequivalent
to those from MICRONASE Tablets 5 mg. Therefore, the patient should be
retitrated. </p>

<p>In a single-dose bioavailability study (see Figure A) in which subjects
received Glyburide (micronized) Tablets 3 mg and MICRONASE Tablets 5 mg
with breakfast the peak of the mean serum glyburide concentration-time
curve was 97.2 ng/mL for Glyburide (micronized) Tablets 3 mg and 87.5 ng/mL
for MICRONASE Tablets 5 mg. The mean of the individual maximum serum concentration
values of glyburide (Cmax) from Glyburide (micronized) Tablets 3 mg was
106 ng/mL and that from MICRONASE Tablets 5 mg was 104 ng/mL. The mean
glyburide area under the serum concentration-time curve (AUC) for this
study was 568 ng X hr/mL for Glyburide (micronized) Tablets 3 mg and 746
ng X hr/mL for MICRONASE Tablets 5 mg. </p>

<p>In a single-dose study, IN FASTING HEALTHY SUBJECTS, two Glyburide (micronized)
Tablets 1.5 mg were shown to be bioequivalent to one Glyburide (micronized)
Tablet 3 mg. </p>

<p>Mean serum levels of glyburide, as reflected by areas under the serum
concentration-time curve, increase in proportion to corresponding increases
in dose. Multiple dose studies with glyburide in diabetic patients demonstrate
drug level concentration-time curves similar to single dose studies, indicating
no buildup of drug in tissue depots. </p>

<p>The serum concentration of glyburide in normal subjects decreased with
a half- life of about four hours. </p>

<p>In single dose studies in fasting normal subjects, the degree and duration
of blood glucose lowering is proportional to the dose administered and
to the area under the drug level concentration-time curve. The blood glucose
lowering effect persists for 24 hours following single morning doses in
nonfasting diabetic patients. Under conditions of repeated administration
in diabetic patients, however, there is no reliable correlation between
blood drug levels and fasting blood glucose levels. A one year study of
diabetic patients treated with glyburide showed no reliable correlation
between administered dose and serum drug level. </p>

<p>The major metabolite of glyburide is the 4-trans-hydroxy derivative.
A second metabolite, the 3-cis-hydroxy derivative, also occurs. These metabolites
probably contribute no significant hypoglycemic action in humans since
they are only weakly active (1/400th and 1/40th as active, respectively,
as glyburide) in rabbits. </p>

<p>Glyburide is excreted as metabolites in the bile and urine, approximately
50% by each route. This dual excretory pathway is qualitatively different
from that of other sulfonylureas, which are excreted primarily in the urine.
</p>

<p>Sulfonylurea drugs are extensively bound to serum proteins. Displacement
from protein binding sites by other drugs may lead to enhanced hypoglycemic
action. In Vitro, the protein binding exhibited by glyburide is predominantly
non-ionic whereas that of other sulfonylureas (chlorpropamide, tolbutamide,
tolazamide) is predominantly ionic. Acidic drugs such as phenylbutazone,
warfarin, and salicylates displace the ionic-binding sulfonylureas from
serum proteins to a far greater extent than the non-ionic binding glyburide.
It has not been shown that this difference in protein binding will result
in fewer drug-drug interactions with glyburide in clinical use. </p>

<p><a name="INDICATIONS AND USAGE"></a><b>INDICATIONS AND USAGE </b></p>

<p>Glyburide (micronized) tablets are indicated as an adjunct to diet to
lower the blood glucose in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes
mellitus (Type II) whose hyperglycemia cannot be satisfactorily controlled
by diet alone. </p>

<p>In initiating treatment for non-insulin-dependent diabetes, diet should
be emphasized as the primary form of treatment. Caloric restriction and
weight loss are essential in the obese diabetic patient. Proper dietary
management alone may be effective in controlling the blood glucose and
symptoms of hyperglycemia. The importance of regular physical activity
should also be stressed, and cardiovascular risk factors should be identified
and corrective measures taken where possible. If this treatment program
fails to reduce symptoms and/or blood glucose, the use of an oral sulfonylurea
or insulin should be considered. Use of Glyburide (micronized) must be
viewed by both the physician and patient as a treatment in addition to
diet and not as a substitution or as a convenient mechanism for avoiding
dietary restraint. Furthermore, loss of blood glucose control on diet alone
may be transient, thus requiring only short-term administration of Glyburide
(micronized) . </p>

<p>During maintenance programs, Glyburide (micronized) should be discontinued
if satisfactory lowering of blood glucose is no longer achieved. Judgment
should be based on regular clinical and laboratory evaluations. </p>

<p>In considering the use of Glyburide (micronized) in asymptomatic patients,
it should be recognized that controlling blood glucose in non-insulin-dependent
diabetes has not been definitely established to be effective in preventing
the long-term cardiovascular or neural complications of diabetes. </p>

<p><a name="CONTRAINDICATIONS"></a><b>CONTRAINDICATIONS </b></p>

<p>Glyburide (micronized) tablets are contraindicated in patients with:
</p>

<p>1. Known hypersensitivity or allergy to the drug. </p>

<p>2. Diabetic ketoacidosis, with or without coma. This condition should
be treated with insulin. </p>

<p>3. Type I diabetes mellitus, as sole therapy. </p>

<p><a name="WARNINGS"></a><b>WARNINGS </b></p>

<p>SPECIAL WARNING ON INCREASED RISK OF CARDIOVASCULAR MORTALITY </p>

<p>THE ADMINISTRATION OF ORAL HYPOGLYCEMIC DRUGS HAS BEEN REPORTED TO BE
ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASED CARDIOVASCULAR MORTALITY AS COMPARED TO TREATMENT
WITH DIET ALONE OR DIET PLUS INSULIN. THIS WARNING IS BASED ON THE STUDY
CONDUCTED BY THE UNIVERSITY GROUP DIABETES PROGRAM (UGDP), A LONG-TERM
PROSPECTIVE CLINICAL TRIAL DESIGNED TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF GLUCOSE
LOWERING DRUGS IN PREVENTING OR DELAYING VASCULAR COMPLICATIONS IN PATIENTS
WITH NON-INSULIN-DEPENDENT DIABETES. THE STUDY INVOLVED 823 PATIENTS WHO
WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO ONE OF FOUR TREATMENT GROUPS (DIABETES, 19 (SUPPL.
2):747 830, 1970). </p>

<p>UGDP REPORTED THAT PATIENTS TREATED FOR 5 TO 8 YEARS WITH DIET PLUS
A FIXED DOSE OF TOLBUTAMIDE (1.5 GRAMS PER DAY) HAD A RATE OF CARDIOVASCULAR
MORTALITY APPROXIMATELY 2 1/2 TIMES THAT OF PATIENTS TREATED WITH DIET
ALONE. A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN TOTAL MORTALITY WAS NOT OBSERVED, BUT
THE USE OF TOLBUTAMIDE WAS DISCONTINUED BASED ON THE INCREASE IN CARDIOVASCULAR
MORTALITY, THUS LIMITING THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THE STUDY TO SHOW AN INCREASE
IN OVERALL MORTALITY. DESPITE CONTROVERSY REGARDING THE INTERPRETATION
OF THESE RESULTS, THE FINDINGS OF THE UGDP STUDY PROVIDE AN ADEQUATE BASIS
FOR THIS WARNING. THE PATIENT SHOULD BE INFORMED OF THE POTENTIAL RISKS
AND ADVANTAGES OF Glyburide (micronized) AND OF ALTERNATIVE MODES OF THERAPY.
</p>

<p>ALTHOUGH ONLY ONE DRUG IN THE SULFONYLUREA CLASS (TOLBUTAMIDE) WAS INCLUDED
IN THIS STUDY, IT IS PRUDENT FROM A SAFETY STANDPOINT TO CONSIDER THAT
THIS WARNING MAY ALSO APPLY TO OTHER ORAL HYPOGLYCEMIC DRUGS IN THIS CLASS,
IN VIEW OF THEIR CLOSE SIMILARITIES IN MODE OF ACTION AND CHEMICAL STRUCTURE.
</p>

<p><a name="PRECAUTIONS"></a><b>PRECAUTIONS </b></p>

<p>BIOAVAILABILITY STUDIES HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT Glyburide (micronized)
TABLETS 3 MG PROVIDE SERUM GLYBURIDE CONCENTRATIONS THAT ARE NOT BIOEQUIVALENT
TO THOSE FROM MICRONASE TABLETS 5 MG. THEREFORE, PATIENTS SHOULD BE RETITRATED
WHEN TRANSFERRED FROM MICRONASE OR DIABETA OR OTHER ORAL HYPOGLYCEMIC AGENTS.
</p>

<p>GENERAL </p>

<p>HYPOGLYCEMIA: All sulfonylureas are capable of producing severe hypoglycemia.
Proper patient selection and dosage and instructions are important to avoid
hypoglycemic episodes. Renal or hepatic insufficiency may cause elevated
drug levels of glyburide and the latter may also diminish gluconeogenic
capacity, both of which increase the risk of serious hypoglycemic reactions.
Elderly, debilitated or malnourished patients, and those with adrenal or
pituitary insufficiency, are particularly susceptible to the hypoglycemic
action of glucose-lowering drugs. Hypoglycemia may be difficult to recognize
in the elderly and in people who are taking beta-adrenergic blocking drugs.
Hypoglycemia is more likely to occur when caloric intake is deficient,
after severe or prolonged exercise, when alcohol is ingested, or when more
than one glucose lowering drug is used. </p>

<p>LOSS OF CONTROL OF BLOOD GLUCOSE: When a patient stabilized on any diabetic
regimen is exposed to stress such as fever, trauma, infection or surgery,
a loss of control may occur. At such times it may be necessary to discontinue
Glyburide (micronized) and administer insulin. </p>

<p>The effectiveness of any hypoglycemic drug, including Glyburide (micronized)
, in lowering blood glucose to a desired level decreases in many patients
over a period of time which may be due to progression of the severity of
diabetes or to diminished responsiveness to the drug. This phenomenon is
known as secondary failure, to distinguish it from primary failure in which
the drug is ineffective in an individual patient when Glyburide (micronized)
is first given. Adequate adjustment of dose and adherence to diet should
be assessed before classifying a patient as a secondary failure. </p>

<p>INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS: Patients should be informed of the potential
risks and advantages of Glyburide (micronized) and of alternative modes
of therapy. They also should be informed about the importance of adherence
to dietary instructions, of a regular exercise program, and of regular
testing of urine and/or blood glucose. </p>

<p>The risks of hypoglycemia, its symptoms and treatment, and conditions
that predispose to its development should be explained to patients and
responsible family members. Primary and secondary failure also should be
explained. </p>

<p>LABORATORY TESTS </p>

<p>Therapeutic response to Glyburide (micronized) Tablets should be monitored
by frequent urine glucose tests and periodic blood glucose tests. Measurement
of glycosylated hemoglobin levels may be helpful in some patients. </p>

<p>DRUG INTERACTIONS </p>

<p>The hypoglycemic action of sulfonylureas may be potentiated by certain
drugs including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents and other drugs that
are highly protein bound, salicylates, sulfonamides, chloramphenicol, probenecid,
coumarins, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, and beta adrenergic blocking agents.
When such drugs are administered to a patient receiving glyburide, the
patient should be observed closely for hypoglycemia. When such drugs are
withdrawn from a patient receiving glyburide, the patient should be observed
closely for loss of control. </p>

<p>Certain drugs tend to produce hyperglycemia and may lead to loss of
control. These drugs include the thiazides and other diuretics, corticosteroids,
phenothiazines, thyroid products, estrogens, oral contraceptives, phenytoin,
nicotinic acid, sympathomimetics, calcium channel blocking drugs, and isoniazid.
When such drugs are administered to a patient receiving glyburide, the
patient should be closely observed for loss of control. When such drugs
are withdrawn from a patient receiving glyburide, the patient should be
observed closely for hypoglycemia. </p>

<p>A possible interaction between glyburide and ciprofloxacin, a fluoroquinolone
antibiotic, has been reported, resulting in a potentiation of the hypoglycemic
action of glyburide. The mechanism of action for this interaction is not
known. </p>

<p>A potential interaction between oral miconazole and oral hypoglycemic
agents leading to severe hypoglycemia has been reported. Whether this interaction
also occurs with the intravenous, topical or vaginal preparations of miconazole
is not known. </p>

<p>CARCINOGENESIS, MUTAGENESIS, AND IMPAIRMENT OF FERTILITY </p>

<p>Studies in rats at doses up to 300 mg/kg/day for 18 months showed no
carcinogenic effects. Glyburide is nonmutagenic when studied in the Salmonella
microsome test (Ames test) and in the DNA damage/alkaline elution assay.
</p>

<p>No drug-related effects were noted in any of the criteria evaluated
in the two- year oncogenicity study of glyburide in mice. </p>

<p>PREGNANCY </p>

<p>TERATOGENIC EFFECTS: Pregnancy Category B </p>

<p>Reproduction studies have been performed in rats and rabbits at doses
up to 500 times the human dose and have revealed no evidence of impaired
fertility or harm to the fetus due to glyburide. There are, however, no
adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal
reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this
drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. </p>

<p>Because recent information suggests that abnormal blood glucose levels
during pregnancy are associated with a higher incidence of congenital abnormalities,
many experts recommend that insulin be used during pregnancy to maintain
blood glucose as close to normal as possible. </p>

<p>NONTERATOGENIC EFFECTS: Prolonged severe hypoglycemia (4 to 10 days)
has been reported in neonates born to mothers who were receiving a sulfonylurea
drug at the time of delivery. This has been reported more frequently with
the use of agents with prolonged half-lives. If Glyburide (micronized)
is used during pregnancy, it should be discontinued at least two weeks
before the expected delivery date. </p>

<p>NURSING MOTHERS </p>

<p>Although it is not known whether glyburide is excreted in human milk,
some sulfonylurea drugs are known to be excreted in human milk. Because
the potential for hypoglycemia in nursing infants may exist, a decision
should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug,
taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. If the drug
is discontinued, and if diet alone is inadequate for controlling blood
glucose, insulin therapy should be considered. </p>

<p>PEDIATRIC USE </p>

<p>Safety and effectiveness in children have not been established. </p>

<p><a name="ADVERSE REACTIONS"></a><b>ADVERSE REACTIONS </b></p>

<p>HYPOGLYCEMIA: See PRECAUTIONS and OVERDOSAGE Sections. </p>

<p>GASTROINTESTINAL REACTIONS: Cholestatic jaundice and hepatitis may occur
rarely; Glyburide (micronized) Tablets should be discontinued if this occurs.
</p>

<p>Liver function abnormalities, including isolated transaminase elevations,
have been reported. </p>

<p>Gastrointestinal disturbances, eg, nausea, epigastric fullness, and
heartburn are the most common reactions, having occurred in 1.8% of treated
patients during clinical trials. They tend to be dose related and may disappear
when dosage is reduced. </p>

<p>DERMATOLOGIC REACTIONS: Allergic skin reactions, eg, pruritus, erythema,
urticaria, and morbilliform or maculopapular eruptions occurred in 1.5%
of treated patients during clinical trials. These may be transient and
may disappear despite continued use of glyburide. If skin reactions persist,
the drug should be discontinued. </p>

<p>Porphyria cutanea tarda and photosensitivity reactions have been reported
with sulfonylureas. </p>

<p>HEMATOLOGIC REACTIONS: Leukopenia, agranulocytosis, thrombocytopenia,
hemolytic anemia, aplastic anemia, and pancytopenia have been reported
with sulfonylureas. </p>

<p>METABOLIC REACTIONS: Hepatic porphyria and disulfiram-like reactions
have been reported with sulfonylureas; however, hepatic porphyria has not
been reported with glyburide and disulfiram-like reactions have been reported
very rarely. </p>

<p>Cases of hyponatremia have been reported with glyburide and all other
sulfonylureas, most often in patients who are on other medications or have
medical conditions known to cause hyponatremia or increase release of antidiuretic
hormone. The syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) secretion
has been reported with certain other sulfonylureas, and it has been suggested
that these sulfonylureas may augment the peripheral (antidiuretic) action
of ADH and/or increase release of ADH. </p>

<p>OTHER REACTIONS: Changes in accommodation and/or blurred vision have
been reported with glyburide and other sulfonylureas. These are thought
to be related to fluctuation in glucose levels. </p>

<p>In addition to dermatologic reactions, allergic reactions such as angioedema,
arthralgia, myalgia and vasculitis have been reported. </p>

<p><a name="OVERDOSAGE"></a><b>OVERDOSAGE </b></p>

<p>Overdosage of sulfonylureas, including glyburide, can produce hypoglycemia.
Mild hypoglycemic symptoms, without loss of consciousness or neurological
findings, should be treated aggressively with oral glucose and adjustments
in drug dosage and/or meal patterns. Close monitoring should continue until
the physician is assured that the patient is out of danger. Severe hypoglycemic
reactions with coma, seizure, or other neurological impairment occur infrequently
but constitute medical emergencies requiring immediate hospitalization.
If hypoglycemic coma is diagnosed or suspected, the patient should be given
a rapid intravenous injection of concentrated (50%) glucose solution. This
should be followed by a continuous infusion of a more dilute (10%) glucose
solution at a rate which will maintain the blood glucose at a level above
100 mg/dL. Patients should be closely monitored for a minimum of 24 to
48 hours, since hypoglycemia may recur after apparent clinical recovery.
</p>

<p><a name="DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION"></a><b>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
</b></p>

<p>PATIENTS SHOULD BE RETITRATED WHEN TRANSFERRED FROM MICRONASE OR DIABETA
OR OTHER ORAL HYPOGLYCEMIC AGENTS. </p>

<p>There is no fixed dosage regimen for the management of diabetes mellitus
with Glyburide (micronized) Tablets or any other hypoglycemic agent. In
addition to the usual monitoring of urinary glucose, the patient's blood
glucose must also be monitored periodically to determine the minimum effective
dose for the patient; to detect primary failure, Ie, inadequate lowering
of blood glucose at the maximum recommended dose of medication; and to
detect secondary failure, Ie, loss of adequate blood glucose lowering response
after an initial period of effectiveness. Glycosylated hemoglobin levels
may also be of value in monitoring the patient's response to therapy. </p>

<p>Short-term administration of Glyburide (micronized) may be sufficient
during periods of transient loss of control in patients usually controlled
well on diet. </p>

<p>USUAL STARTING DOSE </p>

<p>The suggested starting dose of Glyburide (micronized) is 1.5 to 3 mg
daily, administered with breakfast or the first main meal. Those patients
who may be more sensitive to hypoglycemic drugs should be started at 0.75
mg daily. (See PRECAUTIONS Section for patients at increased risk.) Failure
to follow an appropriate dosage regimen may precipitate hypoglycemia. Patients
who do not adhere to their prescribed dietary and drug regimen are more
prone to exhibit unsatisfactory response to therapy. </p>

<p>TRANSFER FROM OTHER HYPOGLYCEMIC THERAPY; PATIENTS RECEIVING OTHER ORAL
ANTIDIABETIC THERAPY: Patients should be retitrated when transferred from
Micronase or other oral hypoglycemic agents. The initial daily dose should
be 1.5 to 3 mg. When transferring patients from oral hypoglycemic agents
other than chlorpropamide to Glyburide (micronized) , no transition period
and no initial or priming dose are necessary. When transferring patients
from chlorpropamide, particular care should be exercised during the first
two weeks because the prolonged retention of chlorpropamide in the body
and subsequent overlapping drug effects may provoke hypoglycemia. </p>

<p>PATIENTS RECEIVING INSULIN: Some Type II diabetic patients being treated
with insulin may respond satisfactorily to Glyburide (micronized) . If
the insulin dose is less than 20 units daily, substitution of Glyburide
(micronized) 1.5 to 3 mg as a single daily dose may be tried. If the insulin
dose is between 20 and 40 units daily, the patient may be placed directly
on Glyburide (micronized) Tablets 3 mg daily as a single dose. If the insulin
dose is more than 40 units daily, a transition period is required for conversion
to Glyburide (micronized) . In these patients, insulin dosage is decreased
by 50% and Glyburide (micronized) Tablets 3 mg daily is started. Please
refer to Titration to Maintenance Dose for further explanation. </p>

<p>TITRATION TO MAINTENANCE DOSE </p>

<p>The usual maintenance dose is in the range of 0.75 to 12 mg daily, which
may be given as a single dose or in divided doses (See Dosage Interval
Section). Dosage increases should be made in increments of no more than
1.5 mg at weekly intervals based upon the patient's blood glucose response.
</p>

<p>No exact dosage relationship exists between Glyburide (micronized) and
the other oral hypoglycemic agents, including glyburide or Diabeta. Although
patients may be transferred from the maximum dose of other sulfonylureas,
the maximum starting dose of 3 mg of Glyburide (micronized) Tablets should
be observed. A maintenance dose of 3 mg of Glyburide (micronized) Tablets
provides approximately the same degree of blood glucose control as 250
to 375 mg chlorpropamide, 250 to 375 mg tolazamide 5 mg of glyburide (nonmicronized
tablets), 500 to 750 mg acetohexamide, or 1000 to 1500 mg tolbutamide.
</p>

<p>When transferring patients receiving more than 40 units of insulin daily,
they may be started on a daily dose of Glyburide (micronized) Tablets 3
mg concomitantly with a 50% reduction in insulin dose. Progressive withdrawal
of insulin and increase of Glyburide (micronized) in increments of 0.75
to 1.5 mg every 2 to 10 days is then carried out. During this conversion
period when both insulin and Glyburide (micronized) are being used, hypoglycemia
may rarely occur. During insulin withdrawal, patients should test their
urine for glucose and acetone at least three times daily and report results
to their physician. The appearance of persistent acetonuria with glycosuria
indicates that the patient is a Type I diabetic who requires insulin therapy.
</p>

<p>MAXIMUM DOSE </p>

<p>Daily doses of more than 12 mg are not recommended. </p>

<p>DOSAGE INTERVAL </p>

<p>Once-a-day therapy is usually satisfactory. Some patients, particularly
those receiving more than 6 mg daily, may have a more satisfactory response
with twice-a-day dosage. </p>

<p>SPECIFIC PATIENT POPULATIONS </p>

<p>Glyburide (micronized) Tablets are not recommended for use in pregnancy
or for use in children. </p>

<p>In elderly patients, debilitated or malnourished patients, and patients
with impaired renal or hepatic function, the initial and maintenance dosing
should be conservative to avoid hypoglycemic reactions. (See PRECAUTIONS
Section.) </p>

<p><a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><b>DESCRIPTION </b></p>

<p>Hydrochlorthiazide is a diuretic and antihypertensive. It is the 3,4-dihydro
derivative of chlorothiazide. Its chemical name is 6-chloro-3,4 dihydro-2H-
1,2,4-benzothiadiazine-7-sulfonamide 1,1-dioxide. Its empirical formula
is C7H8ClN3O4S2. </p>

<p>It is a white, or practically white, crystalline powder with a molecular
weight of 297.72, which is slightly soluble in water, but freely soluble
in sodium hydroxide solution. </p>

<p><a name="ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY"></a><b>ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
</b></p>

<p>The mechanism of the antihypertensive effect of thiazides is unknown.
Hydrochlorthiazide does not usually affect normal blood pressure.</p>

<p> Hydrochlorthiazide affects the distal renal tubular mechanism of electrolyte
reabsorption. At maximal therapeutic dosage all thiazides are approximately
equal in their diuretic efficacy. </p>

<p>Hydrochlorthiazide increases excretion of sodium and chloride in approximately
equivalent amounts. Natriuresis may be accompanied by some loss of potassium
and bicarbonate. </p>

<p>After oral use diuresis begins within 2 hours, peaks in about 4 hours
and lasts about 6 to 12 hours. </p>

<p>Pharmacokinetics And Metabolism </p>

<p>Hydrochlorthiazide is not metabolized but is eliminated rapidly by the
kidney. When plasma levels have been followed for at least 24 hours, the
plasma half-life has been observed to vary between 5.6 and 14.8 hours.
At least 61 percent of the oral dose is eliminated unchanged within 24
hours. Hydrochlorothiazide crosses the placental but not the blood-brain
barrier and is excreted in breast milk. </p>

<p><a name="INDICATIONS AND USAGE"></a><b>INDICATIONS AND USAGE </b></p>

<p>Hydrochlorthiazide is indicated as adjunctive therapy in edema associated
with congestive heart failure, hepatic cirrhosis, and corticosteroid and
estrogen therapy. </p>

<p>Hydrochlorthiazide has also been found useful in edema due to various
forms of renal dysfunction such as nephrotic syndrome, acute glomerulonephritis,
and chronic renal failure. </p>

<p>Hydrochlorthiazide is indicated in the management of hypertension either
as the sole therapeutic agent or to enhance the effectiveness of other
antihypertensive drugs in the more severe forms of hypertension. </p>

<p>Use In Pregnancy. Routine use of diuretics during normal pregnancy is
inappropriate and exposes mother and fetus to unnecessary hazard. Diuretics
do not prevent development of toxemia of pregnancy and there is no satisfactory
evidence that they are useful in the treatment of toxemia. </p>

<p>Edema during pregnancy may arise from pathologic causes or from the
physiologic and mechanical consequences of pregnancy. Thiazides are indicated
in pregnancy when edema is due to pathologic causes, just as they are in
the absence of pregnancy (see PRECAUTIONS, Pregnancy). Dependent edema
in pregnancy, resulting from restriction of venous return by the gravid
uterus, is properly treated through elevation of the lower extremities
and use of support stockings. Use of diuretics to lower intravascular volume
in this instance is illogical and unnecessary. During normal pregnancy
there is hypervolemia which is not harmful to the fetus or the mother in
the absence of cardiovascular disease. However, it may be associated with
edema, rarely generalized edema. If such edema causes discomfort, increased
recumbency will often provide relief. Rarely this edema may cause extreme
discomfort which is not relieved by rest. In these instances, a short course
of diuretic therapy may provide relief and be appropriate. </p>

<p><a name="CONTRAINDICATIONS"></a><b>CONTRAINDICATIONS </b></p>

<p>Anuria. </p>

<p>Hypersensitivity to this product or to other sulfonamide-derived drugs.</p>

<p><a name="WARNINGS"></a><b> WARNINGS </b></p>

<p>Use with caution in severe renal disease. In patients with renal disease,
thiazides may precipitate azotemia. Cumulative effects of the drug may
develop in patients with impaired renal function. </p>

<p>Thiazides should be used with caution in patients with impaired hepatic
function or progressive liver disease, since minor alterations of fluid
and electrolyte balance may precipitate hepatic coma.</p>

<p> Thiazides may add to or potentiate the action of other antihypertensive
drugs. </p>

<p>Sensitivity reactions may occur in patients with or without a history
of allergy or bronchial asthma. </p>

<p>The possibility of exacerbation or activation of systemic lupus erythematosus
has been reported. </p>

<p>Lithium generally should not be given with diuretics (see PRECAUTIONS,
Drug Interactions). </p>

<p><a name="PRECAUTIONS"></a><b>PRECAUTIONS </b></p>

<p>General </p>

<p>All patients receiving diuretic therapy should be observed for evidence
of fluid or electrolyte imbalance: namely, hyponatremia, hypochloremic
alkalosis, and hypokalemia. Serum and urine electrolyte determinations
are particularly important when the patient is vomiting excessively or
receiving parenteral fluids. Warning signs or symptoms of fluid and electrolyte
imbalance, irrespective of cause, include dryness of mouth, thirst, weakness,
lethargy, drowsiness, restlessness, confusion, seizures, muscle pains or
cramps, muscular fatigue, hypotension, oliguria, tachycardia, and gastrointestinal
disturbances such as nausea and vomiting.</p>

<p> Hypokalemia may develop, especially with brisk diuresis, when severe
cirrhosis is present or after prolonged therapy. </p>

<p>Interference with adequate oral electrolyte intake will also contribute
to hypokalemia. Hypokalemia may cause cardiac arrhythmia and may also sensitize
or exaggerate the response of the heart to the toxic effects of digitalis
(e.g., increased ventricular irritability). Hypokalemia may be avoided
or treated by use of potassium sparing diuretics or potassium supplements
such as foods with a high potassium content. </p>

<p>Although any chloride deficit is generally mild and usually does not
require specific treatment except under extraordinary circumstances (as
in liver disease or renal disease), chloride replacement may be required
in the treatment of metabolic alkalosis. </p>

<p>Dilutional hyponatremia may occur in edematous patients in hot weather;
appropriate therapy is water restriction, rather than administration of
salt, except in rare instances when the hyponatremia is life threatening.
In actual salt depletion, appropriate replacement is the therapy of choice.
</p>

<p>Hyperuricemia may occur or acute gout may be precipitated in certain
patients receiving thiazides. </p>

<p>In diabetic patients dosage adjustments of insulin or oral hypoglycemic
agents may be required. Hyperglycemia may occur with thiazide diuretics.
Thus latent diabetes mellitus may become manifest during thiazide therapy.
</p>

<p>The antihypertensive effects of the drug may be enhanced in the post-
sympathectomy patient. </p>

<p>If progressive renal impairment becomes evident, consider withholding
or discontinuing diuretic therapy. </p>

<p>Thiazides have been shown to increase the urinary excretion of magnesium;
this may result in hypomagnesemia. </p>

<p>Thiazides may decrease urinary calcium excretion. Thiazides may cause
intermittent and slight elevation of serum calcium in the absence of known
disorders of calcium metabolism. Marked hypercalcemia may be evidence of
hidden hyperparathyroidism. Thiazides should be discontinued before carrying
out tests for parathyroid function. </p>

<p>Increases in cholesterol and triglyceride levels may be associated with
thiazide diuretic therapy. </p>

<p>Laboratory Tests </p>

<p>Periodic determination of serum electrolytes to detect possible electrolyte
imbalance should be done at appropriate intervals.</p>

<p> Drug Interactions </p>

<p>When given concurrently the following drugs may interact with thiazide
diuretics. </p>

<p>Alcohol, Barbiturates, Or Narcotics--potentiation of orthostatic hypotension
may occur. </p>

<p>Antidiabetic Drugs--(oral agents and insulin)--dosage adjustment of
the antidiabetic drug may be required. </p>

<p>Other Antihypertensive Drugs--additive effect or potentiation.</p>

<p> Cholestyramine And Colestipol Resins--Absorption of hydrochlorothiazide
is impaired in the presence of anionic exchange resins. Single doses of
either cholestyramine or colestipol resins bind the hydrochlorothiazide
and reduce its absorption from the gastrointestinal tract by up to 85 and
43 percent, repectively. </p>

<p>Corticosteroids, ACTH--intensified electrolyte depletion, particularly
hypokalemia. </p>

<p>Pressor Amines (e.g., Norepinephrine)--possible decreased response to
pressor amines but not sufficient to preclude their use. </p>

<p>Skeletal Muscle Relaxants, Nondepolarizing (e.g., Tubocurarine)--possible
increased responsiveness to the muscle relaxant. </p>

<p>Lithium--generally should not be given with diuretics. Diuretic agents
reduce the renal clearance of lithium and add a high risk of lithium toxicity.
Refer to the package insert for lithium preparations before use of such
preparations with Hydrochlorthiazide. </p>

<p>Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs--In some patients, the administration
of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent can reduce the diuretic, natriuretic,
and antihypertensive effects of loop, potassium-sparing and thiazide diuretics.
Therefore, when Hydrochlorthiazide and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
agents are used concomitantly, the patient should be observed closely to
determine if the desired effect of the diuretic is obtained. </p>

<p>Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions </p>

<p>Thiazides should be discontinued before carrying out tests for parathyroid
function (see PRECAUTIONS, General).</p>

<p> Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment Of Fertility </p>

<p>Two-year feeding studies in mice and rats conducted under the auspices
of the National Toxicology Program (NTP) uncovered no evidence of a carcinogenic
potential of hydrochlorothiazide in female mice (at doses of up to approximately
600 mg/kg/day) or in male and female rats (at doses of up to approximately
100 mg/kg/day). The NTP, however, found equivocal evidence for hepatocarcinogenicity
in male mice. </p>

<p>Hydrochlorothiazide was not genotoxic In Vitro in the Ames mutagenicity
assay of Salmonella Typhimurium strains TA 98, TA 100, TA 1535, TA 1537,
and TA 1538 and in the Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) test for chromosomal
aberrations, or In Vivo in assays using mouse germinal cell chromosomes,
Chinese hamster bone marrow chromosomes, and the Drosophila sex-linked
recessive lethal trait gene. Positive test results were obtained only in
the In Vitro CHO Sister Chromatid Exchange (clastogenicity) and in the
Mouse Lymphoma Cell (mutagenicity) assays, using concentrations of hydrochlorothiazide
from 43 to 1300 mcgm/mL, and in the Aspergillus Nidulans non-disjunction
assay at an unspecified concentration.\. Hydrochlorothiazide had no adverse
effects on the fertility of mice and rats of either sex in studies wherein
these species were exposed, via their diet, to doses of up to 100 and 4
mg/kg, respectively, prior to conception and throughout gestation. </p>

<p>Pregnancy </p>

<p>Teratogenic Effects--Pregnancy Category B: Studies in which hydrochlorothiazide
was orally administered to pregnant mice and rats during their respective
periods of major organogenesis at doses up to 3000 and 1000 mg hydrochlorothiazide/kg,
respectively, provided no evidence of harm to the fetus. </p>

<p>There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant
women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of
human response this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly
needed. </p>

<p>Nonteratogenic Effects: Thiazides cross the placental barrier and appear
in cord blood. There is a risk of fetal or neonatal jaundice, thrombocytopenia,
and possibly other adverse reactions that have occurred in adults.</p>

<p> Nursing Mothers </p>

<p>Thiazides are excreted in breast milk. Because of the potential for
serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made
whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue hydrochlorothiazide, taking
into account the importance of the drug to the mother. </p>

<p>Pediatric Use </p>

<p>Safety and effectiveness in children have not been established.</p>

category, are listed in order of decreasing severity. </p>

<p>Body As A Whole: Weakness. </p>

<p>Cardiovascular: Hypotension including orthostatic hypotension (may be
aggravated by alcohol, barbiturates, narcotics or antihypertensive drugs).</p>

<p> Digestive: Pancreatitis, jaundice (intrahepatic cholestatic jaundice),
diarrhea vomiting, sialadenitis, cramping, constipation, gastric irritation,
nausea, anorexia. </p>

<p>Hematologic: Aplastic anemia, agranulocytosis, leukopenia, hemolytic
anemia, thrombocytopenia. </p>

<p>Hypersensitivity: Anaphylactic reactions, necrotizing angiitis (vasculitis
and cutaneous vasculitis), respiratory distress including pneumonitis and
pulmonary edema, photosensitivity, fever, urticaria, rash, purpura. </p>

<p>Metabolic: Electrolyte imbalance (see PRECAUTIONS), hyperglycemia, glycosuria,
hyperuricemia. </p>

<p>Musculoskeletal: Muscle spasm. </p>

<p>Nervous System/Psychiatric: Vertigo, paresthesias, dizziness, headache,
restlessness. </p>

<p>Renal: Renal failure, renal dysfunction, interstitial nephritis. (See
WARNINGS.) </p>

<p>Skin: Erythema multiforme including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, exfoliative
dermatitis including toxic epidermal necrolysis, alopecia. </p>

<p>Special Senses: Transient blurred vision, xanthopsia. </p>

<p>Urogenital: Impotence. </p>

<p>Whenever adverse reactions are moderate or severe, thiazide dosage should
be reduced or therapy withdrawn. </p>

<p><a name="OVERDOSAGE"></a><b>OVERDOSAGE </b></p>

<p>The most common signs and symptoms observed are those caused by electrolyte
depletion (hypokalemia, hypochloremia, hyponatremia) and dehydration resulting
from excessive diuresis. If digitalis has also been administered, hypokalemia
may accentuate cardiac arrhythmias. </p>

<p>In the event of overdosage, symptomatic and supportive measures should
be employed. Emesis should be induced or gastric lavage performed. Correct
dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, hepatic coma and hypotension by established
procedures. If required, give oxygen or artificial respiration for respiratory
impairment. The degree to which hydrochlorothiazide is removed by hemodialysis
has not been established. </p>

<p>The oral LD50 of hydrochlorothiazide is greater than 10 g/kg in the
mouse and rat. </p>

<p><a name="DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION"></a><b>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
</b></p>

<p>Therapy should be individualized according to patient response. Use
the smallest dosage necessary to achieve the required response. </p>

<p>Adults </p>

<p>For Edema </p>

<p>The usual adult dosage is 25 to 100 mg daily as a single or divided
dose. Many patients with edema respond to intermittent therapy, i.e., administration
on alternate days or on three to five days each week. With an intermittent
schedule, excessive response and the resulting undesirable electrolyte
imbalance are less likely to occur. </p>

<p>For Control Of Hypertension </p>

<p>The usual initial dose in adults is 25 mg daily given as a single dose.
The dose may be increased to 50 mg daily, given as a single or two divided
doses. Doses above 50 mg are often associated with marked reductions in
serum potassium (see also PRECAUTIONS). </p>

<p>Patients usually do not require doses in excess of 50 mg of hydrochlorothiazide
daily when used concomitantly with other antihypertensive agents. </p>

<p>Infants And Children </p>

<p>The usual pediatric dosage is based on 1.0 mg of Hydrochlorthiazide
per pound of body weight per day in two doses. Infants under 6 months of
age may require up to 1.5 mg per pound per day in two doses. </p>

<p>On this basis, infants up to 2 years of age may be given 12.5 to 37.5
mg daily in two doses. Children from 2 to 12 years of age may be given
37.5 to 100 mg daily in two doses. Dosage in both age groups should be
based on body weight. However, pediatric patients with hypertension only
rarely will benefit from doses larger than 50 mg daily.</p>

<p><a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><b>DESCRIPTION </b></p>

<p>tretinoin (retinoic acid, vitamin A acid) is used for the topical treatment
of acne vulgaris. Chemically, tretinoin is All-trans-retinoic acid. </p>

<p><a name="ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY"></a><b>ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
</b></p>

<p>Although the exact mode of action of tretinoin is unknown, current evidence
suggests that topical tretinoin decreases cohesiveness of follicular epithelial
cells with decreased microcomedo formation. Additionally, tretinoin stimulates
mitotic activity and increased turnover of follicular epithelial cells
causing extrusion of the comedones. </p>

<p><a name="INDICATIONS AND USAGE"></a><b>INDICATIONS AND USAGE </b></p>

<p>Tretinoin is indicated for topical application in the treatment of acne
vulgaris. The safety and efficacy of the long-term use of this product
in the treatment of other disorders have not been established. </p>

<p><a name="CONTRAINDICATIONS"></a><b>CONTRAINDICATIONS </b></p>

<p>Use of the product should be discontinued if hypersensitivity to any
of the ingredients is noted. </p>

<p><a name="PRECAUTIONS"></a><b>PRECAUTIONS </b></p>

<p>General: If a reaction suggesting sensitivity or chemical irritation
occurs, use of the medication should be discontinued. Exposure to sunlight,
including sunlamps, should be minimized during the use of Tretinoin, and
patients with sunburn should be advised not to use the product until fully
recovered because of heightened susceptibility to sunlight as a result
of the use of tretinoin. Patients who may be required to have considerable
sun exposure due to occupation and those with inherent sensitivity to the
sun should exercise particular caution. Use of sunscreen products and protective
clothing over treated areas is recommended when exposure cannot be avoided.
Weather extremes, such as wind or cold, also may be irritating to patients
under treatment with tretinoin. </p>

<p>Tretinoin acne treatment should be kept away from the eyes, the mouth
angles of the nose, and mucous membranes. Topical use may induce severe
local erythema and peeling at the site of application. If the degree of
local irritation warrants, patients should be directed to use the medication
less frequently, discontinue use temporarily, or discontinue use altogether.
Tretinoin has been reported to cause severe irritation on eczematous skin
and should be used with utmost caution in patients with this condition.
</p>

<p>Drug Interactions: Concomitant topical medication, medicated or abrasive
soaps and cleansers, soaps and cosmetics that have a strong drying effect,
and products with high concentrations of alcohol, astringents, spices or
lime should be used with caution because of possible interaction with tretinoin.
Particular caution should be exercised in using preparations containing
sulfur, resorcinol, or salicylic acid with Tretinoin. It also is advisable
to &quot;rest&quot; a patient's skin until the effects of such preparations
subside before use of Tretinoin is begun. </p>

<p>Carcinogenesis: Long-term animal studies to determine the carcinogenic
potential of tretinoin have not been performed. Studies in hairless albino
mice suggest that tretinoin may accelerate the tumorigenic potential of
weakly carcinogenic light from a solar simulator. In other studies, when
lightly pigmented hairless mice treated with tretinoin were exposed to
carcinogenic doses of UVB light, the incidence and rate of development
of skin tumors was reduced. Due to significantly different experimental
conditions, no strict comparison of these disparate data is possible. Although
the significance of these studies to man is not clear, patients should
avoid or minimize exposure to sun. </p>

<p>Pregnancy: Teratogenic effects. Pregnancy Category C. Oral tretinoin
has been shown to be teratogenic in rats when given in doses 1000 times
the topical human dose. Oral tretinoin has been shown to be fetotoxic in
rats when given in doses 500 times the topical human dose. Topical tretinoin
has not been shown to be teratogenic in rats and rabbits when given in
doses of 100 and 320 times the topical human dose, respectively (assuming
a 50 kg adult applies 250 mg of 0.1% cream topically). However, at these
topical doses, delayed ossification of a number of bones occurred in both
species. These changes may be considered variants of normal development
and are usually corrected after weaning. There are no adequate and well-controlled
studies in pregnant women. Tretinoin should be used during pregnancy only
if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. </p>

<p>Nursing Mothers: It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human
milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be
exercised when Tretinoin is administered to a nursing woman. </p>

<p>GELS ARE FLAMMABLE. Note: Keep away from heat and flame. Keep tube tightly
closed. </p>

<p><a name="DRUG INTERACTIONS"></a><b>DRUG INTERACTIONS </b></p>

<p>Concomitant topical medication, medicated or abrasive soaps and cleansers,
soaps and cosmetics that have a strong drying effect, and products with
high concentrations of alcohol, astringents, spices or lime should be used
with caution because of possible interaction with tretinoin. Particular
caution should be exercised in using preparations containing sulfur, resorcinol,
or salicylic acid with Tretinoin. It also is advisable to &quot;rest&quot;
a patient's skin until the effects of such preparations subside before
use of Tretinoin is begun. </p>

<p>(See Also PRECAUTIONS) </p>

<p><a name="ADVERSE REACTIONS"></a><b>ADVERSE REACTIONS </b></p>

<p>The skin of certain sensitive individuals may become excessively red,
edematous blistered, or crusted. If these effects occur, the medication
should either be discontinued until the integrity of the skin is restored,
or the medication should be adjusted to a level the patient can tolerate.
True contact allergy to topical tretinoin is rarely encountered. Temporary
hyper- or hypopigmentation has been reported with repeated application
of Tretinoin. Some individuals have been reported to have heightened susceptibility
to sunlight while under treatment with Tretinoin. To date, all adverse
effects of Tretinoin have been reversible upon discontinuance of therapy
(see Dosage and Administration Section). </p>

<p><a name="OVERDOSAGE"></a><b>OVERDOSAGE </b></p>

<p>If medication is applied excessively, no more rapid or better results
will be obtained and marked redness, peeling, or discomfort may occur.
Oral ingestion of the drug may lead to the same side effects as those associated
with excessive oral intake of Vitamin A. </p>

<p><a name="DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION"></a><b>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
</b></p>

<p>Tretinoin Gel, Cream or Liquid should be applied once a day, before
retiring, to the skin where acne lesions appear, using enough to cover
the entire affected area lightly. Liquid: The liquid may be applied using
a fingertip, gauze pad or cotton swab. If gauze or cotton is employed,
care should be taken not to oversaturate it to the extent that the liquid
would run into areas where treatment is not intended. Gel: Excessive application
results in &quot;pilling&quot; of the gel, which minimizes the likelihood
of overapplication by the patient. </p>

<p>Application may cause a transitory feeling of warmth or slight stinging.
In cases where it has been necessary to temporarily discontinue therapy
or to reduce the frequency of application, therapy may be resumed or frequency
of application increased when the patients become able to tolerate the
treatment. </p>

<p>Alterations of vehicle, drug concentration, or dose frequency should
be closely monitored by careful observation of the clinical therapeutic
response and skin tolerance. </p>

<p>During the early weeks of therapy, an Apparent exacerbation of inflammatory
lesions may occur. This is due to the action of the medication on deep,
previously unseen lesions and should not be considered a reason to discontinue
therapy. </p>

<p>Therapeutic results should be noticed after two to three weeks but more
than six weeks of therapy may be required before definite beneficial effects
are seen. </p>

<p>Once the acne lesions have responded satisfactorily, it may be possible
to maintain the improvement with less frequent applications, or other dosage
forms. </p>

<p>Patients treated with Tretinoin acne treatment may use cosmetics, but
the areas to be treated should be cleansed thoroughly before the medication
is applied. (SEE PRECAUTIONS) </p>

<p><a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><b>DESCRIPTION </b></p>

<p>USE IN PREGNANCY </p>

<p>WHEN USED IN PREGNANCY DURING THE SECOND AND THIRD TRIMESTERS, ACE INHIBITORS
CAN CAUSE INJURY AND EVEN DEATH TO THE DEVELOPING FETUS. When pregnancy
is detected, Ramipril should be discontinued as soon as possible. SEE WARNINGS.
FETAL/NEONATAL MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY. </p>

<p>Ramipril is a 2-aza-bicyclo (3.3.0)-octane-3-carboxylic acid derivative.
It is a white, crystalline substance soluble in polar organic solvents
and buffered aqueous solutions. Ramipril melts between 105 deg C and 112
deg C. </p>

<p>Ramipril's chemical name is (2S,3aS,6aS) 1((S)-N-((S)-1-Carboxy-3-phenylpropyl)alanyl)octahydrocyclopenta(b)pyrrole-2-
carboxylic acid, 1-ethyl ester. </p>

<p>Its empiric formula is C23H32N2O5,and its molecular weight is 416.5.
</p>

<p>Ramiprilat, the diacid metabolite of ramipril, is a non-sulfhydryl angiotensin
converting enzyme inhibitor. Ramipril is converted to ramiprilat by hepatic
cleavage of the ester group. </p>

<p><a name="ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY"></a><b>ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
</b></p>

<p>Mechanism Of Action </p>

<p>Ramipril and ramiprilat inhibit angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)
in human subjects and animals. ACE is a peptidyl dipeptidase that catalyzes
the conversion of angiotensin I to the vasoconstrictor substance, angiotensin
II. Angiotensin II also stimulates aldosterone secretion by the adrenal
cortex. Inhibition of ACE results in decreased plasma angiotensin II, which
leads to decreased vasopressor activity and to decreased aldosterone secretion.
The latter decrease may result in a small increase of serum potassium.
In hypertensive patients with normal renal function treated with Ramipril
alone for up to 56 weeks, approximately 4 percent of patients during the
trial had an abnormally high serum potassium and an increase from baseline
greater than 0.75 mEq/L, and none of the patients had an abnormally low
potassium and a decrease from baseline greater than 0.75 mEq/L. In the
same study, approximately 2% of patients treated with Ramipril and hydrochlorothiazide
for up to 56 weeks had abnormally high potassium values and an increase
from baseline of 0.75 mEq/L or greater, and approximately 2% had abnormally
low values and decreases from baseline of 0.75 mEq/L or greater. (See PRECAUTIONS.)
Removal of angiotensin II negative feedback on renin secretion leads to
increased plasma renin activity. </p>

<p>ACE is identical to kininase, an enzyme that degrades bradykinin. Whether
increased levels of bradykinin, a potent vasodepressor peptide, play a
role in the therapeutic effects of Ramipril remains to be elucidated. </p>

<p>While the mechanism through which Ramipril lowers blood pressure is
believed to be primarily suppression of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone
system, Ramipril has an antihypertensive effect even in patients with low-renin
hypertension. Although Ramipril was antihypertensive in all races studied,
black hypertensive patients (usually a low-renin hypertensive population)
had a smaller average response to monotherapy than non-black patients.
</p>

<p>PHARMACOKINETICS AND METABOLISM </p>

<p>Following oral administration of Ramipril, peak plasma concentrations
of ramipril are reached within one hour. The extent of absorption is at
least 50 60% and is not significantly influenced by the presence of food
in the GI tract although the rate of absorption is reduced. </p>

<p>Cleavage of the ester group (primarily in the liver) converts ramipril
to its active diacid metabolite, ramiprilat. Peak plasma concentrations
of ramiprilat are reached 2-4 hours after drug intake. The serum protein
binding of ramipril is about 73% and that of ramiprilat about 56%; In Vitro,
these percentages are independent of concentration over the range of 0.01
to 10mcgm/ml. </p>

<p>Ramipril is almost completely metabolized to ramiprilat, which has about
6 times the ACE inhibitory activity of ramipril, and to the diketopiperazine
ester, the diketopiperazine acid, and the glucuronides of ramipril and
ramiprilat, all of which are inactive. After oral administration of ramipril,
about 60% of the parent drug and its metabolites are eliminated in the
urine, and about 40% is found in the feces. Drug recovered in the feces
may represent both biliary excretion of metabolites and/or unabsorbed drug,
however the proportion of a dose eliminated by the bile has not been determined.
Less than 2% of the administered dose is recovered in urine as unchanged
ramipril. </p>

<p>Blood concentrations of ramipril and ramiprilat increase with increased
dose, but are not strictly dose-proportional. The 24-hour AUC for ramiprilat,
however is dose-proportional over the 2.5-20 mg dose range. The absolute
bioavailabilities of ramipril and ramiprilat were 28% and 44%, respectively,
when 5 mg of oral ramipril was compared with the same dose of ramipril
given intravenously. </p>

<p>Plasma concentrations of ramiprilat decline in a triphasic manner (initial
rapid decline, apparent elimination phase, terminal elimination phase).
The initial rapid decline, which represents distribution of the drug into
a large peripheral compartment and subsequent binding to both plasma and
tissue ACE, has a half- life of 2-4 hours. Because of its potent binding
to ACE and slow dissociation from the enzyme, ramiprilat shows two elimination
phases. The apparent elimination phase corresponds to the clearance of
free ramiprilat and has a half-life of 9-18 hours. The terminal elimination
phase has a prolonged half- life (&gt;50 hours) and probably represents
the binding/dissociation kinetics of the ramiprilat/ACE complex. It does
not contribute to the accumulation of the drug. After multiple daily doses
of ramipril 5-10 mg, the half-life of ramiprilat concentrations within
the therapeutic range was 13-17 hours. </p>

<p>After once-daily dosing, steady-state plasma concentrations of ramiprilat
are reached by the fourth dose. Steady-state concentrations of ramiprilat
are somewhat higher than those seen after the first dose of Ramipril, especially
at low doses (2.5 mg), but the difference is clinically insignificant.
</p>

<p>The urinary excretion of ramipril, ramiprilat, and their metabolites
is reduced in patients with impaired renal function. Compared to normal
subjects, patients with creatinine clearance less than 40 ml/min/1.73M(square)
had higher peak and trough ramiprilat levels and slightly longer times
to peak concentrations. (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION.) </p>

<p>In patients with impaired liver function, the metabolism of ramipril
to ramiprilat appears to be slowed, possibly because of diminished activity
of hepatic esterases, and plasma ramipril levels in these patients are
increased about 3-fold. Peak concentrations of ramiprilat in these patients,
however, are not different from those seen in subjects with normal hepatic
function, and the effect of a given dose on plasma ACE activity does not
vary with hepatic function. </p>

<p>PHARMACODYNAMICS </p>

<p>Single doses of ramipril of 2.5-20 mg produce approximately 60-80% inhibition
of ACE activity 4 hours after dosing with approximately 40-60% inhibition
after 24 hours. Multiple oral doses of ramipril of 2.0 mg or more cause
plasma ACE activity to fall by more than 90% 4 hours after dosing, with
over 80% inhibition of ACE activity remaining 24 hours after dosing. The
more prolonged effect of even small multiple doses presumably reflects
saturation of ACE binding sites by ramiprilat and relatively slow release
from those sites. </p>

<p>Administration of Ramipril to patients with mild to moderate hypertension
results in a reduction of both supine and standing blood pressure to about
the same extent with no compensatory tachycardia. Symptomatic postural
hypotension is infrequent, although it can occur in patients who are salt-
and/or volume- depleted. (See WARNINGS.) Use of Ramipril in combination
with thiazide diuretics gives a blood pressure lowering effect greater
than that seen with either agent alone. </p>

<p>In single-dose studies, doses of 5-20 mg of Ramipril lowered blood pressure
within 1-2 hours, with peak reductions achieved 3-6 hours after dosing.
The antihypertensive effect of a single dose persisted for 24 hours. In
longer term (4-12 weeks) controlled studies, once-daily doses of 2.5-10
mg were similar in their effect, lowering supine or standing systolic and
diastolic blood pressures 24 hours after dosing by about 6/4 mm Hg more
than placebo. In comparisons of peak vs trough effect, the trough effect
represented about 50 60% of the peak response. In a titration study comparing
divided (bid) vs qd treatment, the divided regimen was superior, indicating
that for some patients the antihypertensive effect with once-daily dosing
is not adequately maintained. (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION.) </p>

<p>In most trials, the antihypertensive effect of Ramipril increased during
the first several weeks of repeated measurements. The antihypertensive
effect of Ramipril has been shown to continue during long-term therapy
for at least 2 years. Abrupt withdrawal of Ramipril has not resulted in
a rapid increase in blood pressure. </p>

<p>Ramipril has been compared with other ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers,
and thiazide diuretics. It was approximately as effective as other ACE
inhibitors and as atenolol. In both caucasians and blacks, hydrochlorothiazide
(25 or 50 mg) was significantly more effective than ramipril. </p>

<p>Except for thiazides, no formal interaction studies of ramipril with
other antihypertensive agents have been carried out. Limited experience
in controlled and uncontrolled trials combining ramipril with a calcium
channel blocker, a loop diuretic, or triple therapy (beta-blocker, vasodilator,
and a diuretic) indicate no unusual drug-drug interactions. Other ACE inhibitors
have had less than additive effects with beta adrenergic blockers, presumably
because both drugs lower blood pressure by inhibiting parts of the renin-angiotensin
system. </p>

<p>Ramipril was less effective in blacks than in caucasians. The effectiveness
of Ramipril was not influenced by age, sex, or weight. </p>

<p>In a baseline controlled study of 10 patients with mild essential hypertension,
blood pressure reduction was accompanied by a 15% increase in renal blood
flow. In healthy volunteers, glomerular filtration rate was unchanged.
</p>

<p><a name="INDICATIONS AND USAGE"></a><b>INDICATIONS AND USAGE </b></p>

<p>Ramipril is indicated for the treatment of hypertension. It may be used
alone or in combination with thiazide diuretics. </p>

<p>In using Ramipril, consideration should be given to the fact that another
angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, has caused agranulocytosis,
particularly in patients with renal impairment or collagen-vascular disease.
Available data are insufficient to show that Ramipril does not have a similar
risk. (See WARNINGS.) </p>

<p><a name="CONTRAINDICATIONS"></a><b>CONTRAINDICATIONS </b></p>

<p>Ramipril is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to this
product and in patients with history of angioedema related to previous
treatment with an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor. </p>

<p><a name="WARNINGS"></a><b>WARNINGS </b></p>

<p>USE IN PREGNANCY </p>

<p>WHEN USED IN PREGNANCY DURING THE SECOND AND THIRD TRIMESTERS, ACE INHIBITORS
CAN CAUSE INJURY AND EVEN DEATH TO THE DEVELOPING FETUS. When pregnancy
is detected, Ramipril should be discontinued as soon as possible. SEE WARNINGS.
FETAL/NEONATAL MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY. </p>

<p>Angioedema </p>

<p>Angioedema of the face, extremities, lips, tongue, glottis, and larynx
has been reported in patients treated with angiotensin converting enzyme
inhibitors. Angioedema associated with laryngeal edema can be fatal. If
laryngeal stridor or angioedema of the face, tongue, or glottis occurs,
treatment with Ramipril should be discontinued and appropriate therapy
instituted immediately. WHERE THERE IS INVOLVEMENT OF THE TONGUE, GLOTTIS,
OR LARNYX, LIKELY TO CAUSE AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION, APPROPRIATE THERAPY, E.G.,
SUBCUTANEOUS EPINEPHRINE SOLUTION 1:1 000 (0.3 ML TO 0.5 ML) SHOULD BE
PROMPTLY ADMINISTERED. (See ADVERSE REACTIONS.) </p>

<p>Hypotension </p>

<p>Ramipril can cause symptomatic hypotension, after either the initial
dose or a later dose when the dosage has been increased. Like other ACE
inhibitors, ramipril has been only rarely associated with hypotension in
uncomplicated hypertensive patients. Symptomatic hypotension is most likely
to occur in patients who have been volume- and/or salt- depleted as a result
of prolonged diuretic therapy, dietary salt restriction, dialysis, diarrhea,
or vomiting. Volume and/or salt depletion should be corrected before initiating
therapy with Ramipril. </p>

<p>In patients with congestive heart failure, with or without associated
renal insufficiency, ACE inhibitor therapy may cause excessive hypotension,
which may be associated with oliguria or azotemia and, rarely, with acute
renal failure and death. In such patients, Ramipril therapy should be started
under close medical supervision; they should be followed closely for the
first 2 weeks of treatment and whenever the dose of ramipril or diuretic
is increased. </p>

<p>If hypotension occurs, the patient should be placed in a supine position
and, if necessary, treated with intravenous infusion of physiological saline.
Ramipril treatment usually can be continued following restoration of blood
pressure and volume. </p>

<p>Neutropenia/Agranulocytosis </p>

<p>Another angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, has been
shown to cause agranulocytosis and bone marrow depression, rarely in uncomplicated
patients, but more frequently in patients with renal impairment, especially
if they also have a collagen-vascular disease such as systemic lupus erythematosus
or scleroderma. Available data from clinical trials of ramipril are insufficient
to show that ramipril does not cause agranulocytosis at similar rates.
Monitoring of white blood cell counts should be considered in patients
with collagen-vascular disease, especially if the disease is associated
with impaired renal function. </p>

<p>Fetal/neonatal Morbidity And Mortality </p>

<p>ACE inhibitors can cause fetal and neonatal morbidity and mortality
when administered to pregnant women. Over 100 cases have been reported
in the world literature. When pregnancy is detected, ACE inhibitors should
be discontinued as soon as possible. </p>

<p>The use of ACE inhibitors during the second and third trimesters of
pregnancy has been associated with fetal and neonatal injury, including
hypotension, neonatal skull hypoplasia, anuria, reversible or irreversible
renal failure, and death. Oligohydramnios has also been reported, presumably
resulting from decreased fetal renal function; oligohydramnios in this
setting has been associated with fetal limb contractures, craniofacial
deformations, and hypoplastic lung development. Prematurity, intrauterine
growth retardation, and patent ductus arteriosus have been reported, although
it is not clear whether these occurrences were due to the ACE-inhibitor
exposure. </p>

<p>These adverse effects do not appear to have resulted from intrauterine
ACE- inhibitor exposure that has been limited to the first trimester. Mothers
whose embryos and fetuses are exposed to ACE inhibitors only during the
first trimester should be so informed. Nonetheless, when patients become
pregnant, physicians should make every effort to discontinue the use of
Ramipril as soon as possible. </p>

<p>Rarely (probably less often than once in every thousand pregnancies),
no alternative to ACE inhibitors will be found. In these rare cases, the
mothers should be apprised of the potential hazards to their fetuses, and
serial ultrasound examinations should be performed to assess the intra-amniotic
environment. </p>

<p>If oligohydramnios is observed, Ramipril should be discontinued unless
it is considered life-saving for the mother. Contraction stress testing
(CST), a non- stress test (NST), or biophysical profiling (BPP) may be
appropriate, depending upon the week of pregnancy. Patients and physicians
should be aware, however, that oligohydramnios may not appear until after
the fetus has sustained irreversible injury. </p>

<p>Infants with histories of In Utero exposure to ACE inhibitors should
be closely observed for hypotension, oliguria, and hypokalemia. If oliguria
occurs, attention should be directed toward support of blood pressure and
renal perfusion. Exchange transfusion or dialysis may be required as means
of reversing hypotension and/or substituting for disordered renal function.**
Ramipril which crosses the placenta can be removed from the neonatal circulation
by these means, but limited experience has not shown that such removal
is central to the treatment of these infants. </p>

<p>No teratogenic effects of Ramipril were seen in studies of pregnant
rats, rabbits, and cynomolgus monkeys. On a mg/kg basis, the doses used
were up to 2500 times (in rats), 6.25 times (in rabbits), and 1250 times
(in monkeys) the maximum recommended human dose. </p>

<p>** Information on the removal of ACE inhibitors from the circulation
can be found in the individual package inserts. </p>

<p><a name="PRECAUTIONS"></a><b>PRECAUTIONS </b></p>

<p>General </p>

<p>Impaired Renal Function: As a consequence of inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-
aldosterone system, changes in renal function may be anticipated in susceptible
individuals. In patients with severe congestive heart failure whose renal
function may depend on the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone
system treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, including
Ramipril, may be associated with oliguria and/or progressive azotemia and
(rarely) with acute renal failure and/or death. </p>

<p>In hypertensive patients with unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis,
increases in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine may occur. Experience
with another angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor suggests that these
increases are usually reversible upon discontinuation of Ramipril and/or
diuretic therapy. In such patients renal function should be monitored during
the first few weeks of therapy. Some hypertensive patients with no apparent
pre existing renal vascular disease have developed increases in blood urea
nitrogen and serum creatinine, usually minor and transient, especially
when Ramipril has been given concomitantly with a diuretic. This is more
likely to occur in patients with pre-existing renal impairment. Dosage
reduction of Ramipril and/or discontinuation of the diuretic may be required.
EVALUATION OF THE HYPERTENSIVE PATIENT SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE ASSESSMENT
OF RENAL FUNCTION. (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION.) </p>

<p>Hyperkalemia: In clinical trials, hyperkalemia (serum potassium greater
than 5.7 mEq/L) occurred in approximately 1% of hypertensive patients receiving
Ramipril. In most cases, these were isolated values, which resolved despite
continued therapy. None of these patients was discontinued from the trials
because of hyperkalemia. Risk factors for the development of hyperkalemia
include renal insufficiency, diabetes, mellitus, and the concomitant use
of potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, and/or potassium-containing
salt substitutes, which should be used cautiously, if at all, with Ramipril.
(See DRUG INTERACTIONS.) </p>

<p>Cough: Cough has been reported with the use of ACE inhibitors. </p>

<p>Characteristically, the cough is nonproductive, persistent and resolves
after discontinuation of therapy. ACE inhibitor-induced cough should be
considered as part of the differential diagnosis of cough. </p>

<p>Impaired Liver Function: Since ramipril is primarily metabolized by
hepatic esterases to its active moiety, ramiprilat, patients with impaired
liver function could develop markedly elevated plasma levels of ramipril.
No formal pharmacokinetic studies have been carried out in hypertensive
patients with impaired liver function. </p>

<p>Surgery/Anesthesia: In patients undergoing surgery or during anesthesia
with agents that produce hypotension, ramipril may block angiotensin II
formation that would otherwise occur secondary to compensatory renin release.
Hypotension that occurs as a result of this mechanism can be corrected
by volume expansion. </p>

<p>Information For Patients </p>

<p>Pregnancy: Female patients of childbearing age should be told about
the consequences of second- and third-trimester exposure to ACE inhibitors,
and they should also be told that these consequences do not appear to have
resulted from intrautrine ACE-inhibitor exposure that has been limited
to the first trimester. These patients should be asked to report pregnancies
to their physicians as soon as possible. </p>

<p>Angioedema: Angioedema, including laryngeal edema, can occur with treatment
with ACE inhibitors, especially following the first dose. Patients should
be so advised and told to report immediately any signs or symptoms suggesting
angioedema (swelling of face, eyes, lips, or tongue, or difficulty in breathing)
and to take no more drug until they have consulted with the prescribing
physician. </p>

<p>Symptomatic Hypotension: Patients should be cautioned that lightheadedness
can occur, especially during the first days of therapy, and it should be
reported. Patients should be told that if syncope occurs, Ramipril should
be discontinued until the physician has been consulted. </p>

<p>All patients should be cautioned that inadequate fluid intake or excessive
perspiration, diarrhea, or vomiting can lead to an excessive fall in blood
pressure, with the same consequences of lightheadedness and possible syncope.
</p>

<p>Hyperkalemia: Patients should be told not to use salt substitutes containing
potassium without consulting their physician. </p>

<p>Neutropenia: Patients should be told to promptly report any indication
of infection (e.g., sore throat, fever), which could be a sign of neutropenia.
</p>

<p>Drug Interactions </p>

<p>With Diuretics: Patients on diuretics, especially those in whom diuretic
therapy was recently instituted, may occasionally experience an excessive
reduction of blood pressure after initiation of therapy with Ramipril.
The possibility of hypotensive effects with Ramipril can be minimized by
either discontinuing the diuretic or increasing the salt intake prior to
initiation of treatment with Ramipril. If this is not possible, the starting
dose should be reduced. (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION.) </p>

<p>With Potassium Supplements And Potassium-sparing Diuretics: Ramipril
can attenuate potassium loss caused by thiazide diuretics. Potassium-sparing
diuretics (spironolactone, amiloride, triamterene, and others) or potassium
supplements can increase the risk of hyperkalemia. Therefore, if concomitant
use of such agents is indicated, they should be given with caution, and
the patient's serum potassium should be monitored frequently. </p>

<p>With Lithium: Increased serum lithium levels and symptoms of lithium
toxicity have been reported in patients receiving ACE inhibitors during
therapy with lithium. These drugs should be coadministered with caution,
and frequent monitoring of serum lithium levels is recommended. If a diuretic
is also used, the risk of lithium toxicity may be increased. </p>

<p>Other: Neither Ramipril nor its metabolites have been found to interact
with food, digoxin, or antacid. </p>

<p>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment Of Fertility </p>

<p>No evidence of a tumorigenic effect was found when ramipril was given
by gavage to rats (up to 500 mg/kg/day for 24 months) or to mice (up to
1,000 mg/kg/day for 18 months). Dosages greatly in excess of those recommended
for humans produced hypertrophy of the renal juxtaglomerular apparatus
in mice, rats, dogs and monkeys. No mutagenic activity was detected in
the Ames test in bacteria, the micronucleus test in mice, unscheduled DNA
synthesis in a human cell line, or a forward gene-mutation assay in a Chinese
hamster ovary cell line. Several metabolites and degradation products of
ramipril were also negative in the Ames test. A study in rats with dosages
as great as 500 mg/kg/day did not produce adverse effects on fertility.
</p>

<p>Pregnancy </p>

<p>Pregnancy Category C (First Trimester) And D (Second And Third Trimesters).
SEE WARNINGS: FETAL/NEONATAL MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY. </p>

<p>Nursing Mothers </p>

<p>Ingestion of a single 10 mg oral dose of Ramipril resulted in undetectable
amounts of ramipril and its metabolites in breast milk. However, because
multiple doses may produce low milk concentrations that are not predictable
from single doses, Ramipril should not be administered to nursing mothers.
</p>

<p>Geriatric Use </p>

<p>Of the total number of patients who received ramipril in US clinical
studies of Ramipril 11.0% were 65 and over while 0.2% were 75 and over.
No overall differences in effectiveness or safety were observed between
these patients and younger patients, and other reported clinical experience
has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger
patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled
out. </p>

<p>One pharmacokinetic study conducted in hospitalized elderly patients
indicated that peak ramiprilat levels and area under the plasma concentration
time curve (AUC) for ramiprilat are higher in older patients. </p>

<p>Pediatric Use </p>

<p>Safety and effectiveness in children have not been established. </p>

<p><a name="ADVERSE REACTIONS"></a><b>ADVERSE REACTIONS </b></p>

<p>Ramipril has been evaluated for safety in over 4,000 patients with hypertension;
of these, 1,230 patients were studied in US controlled trials, and 1,107
were studied in foreign controlled trials. Almost 700 of these patients
were treated for at least one year. The overall incidence of reported adverse
events was similar in Ramipril and placebo patients. The most frequent
clinical side effects (possibly or probably related to study drug) reported
by patients receiving Ramipril in US placebo-controlled trials were: headache
(5.4%), &quot;dizziness&quot; (2.2%) and fatigue or asthenia (2.0%), but
only the last was more common in Ramipril patients than in patients given
placebo. Generally, the side effects were mild and transient, and there
was no relation to total dosage within the range of 1.25 to 20 mg. Discontinuation
of therapy because of a side effect was required in approximately 3% of
US patients treated with Ramipril. The most common reasons for discontinuation
were: cough (1.0%), &quot;dizziness&quot; (0.5%), and impotence (0.4%).
</p>

<p>The side effects considered possibly or probably related to study drug
that occurred in US placebo-controlled trials in more than 1% of patients
treated with Ramipril are shown below. </p>

<p>In placebo-controlled trials, there was also an excess of upper respiratory
infection and flu syndrome in the ramipril group. As these studies were
carried out before the relationship of cough to ACE inhibitors was recognized,
some of these events may represent ramipril-induced cough. In a later 1-year
study, increased cough was seen in almost 12% of ramipril patients, with
about 4% of these patients, requiring discontinuation of treatment. Other
adverse experiences reported in controlled clinical trials (in less than
1% of ramipril patients), or rarer events seen in postmarketing experience,
include the following (In some, a causal relationship to drug use is uncertain.):
</p>

<p>Cardiovascular: Symptomatic hypotension (reported in 0.5% of patients
in US trials) (see PRECAUTIONS and WARNINGS), syncope (not reported in
US trials), angina pectoris, arrhythmia, chest pain, palpitations, myocardial
infarction and cerebrovascular events. </p>

<p>Renal: Some hypertensive patients with no apparent pre-existing renal
disease have developed minor, usually transient, increases in blood urea
nitrogen and serum creatinine when taking Ramipril, particularly when Ramipril
was given concomitantly with a diuretic. (See WARNINGS.) </p>

<p>Angioneurotic Edema: Angioneurotic edema has been reported in 0.3% of
patients in US clinical trials. (See WARNINGS.) </p>

<p>Cough: A tickling, dry, persistent, nonproductive cough has been reported
with the use of ACE inhibitors. Approximately 1% of patients treated with
Ramipril have required discontinuation because of cough. The cough disappears
shortly after discontinuation of treatment. (See PRECAUTIONS, Cough subsection.)
</p>

<p>Gastrointestinal: Abdominal pain (sometimes with enzyme changes suggesting
pancreatitis), anorexia, constipation, diarrhea, dry mouth, dyspepsia,
dysphagia, gastroenteritis, nausea, increased salivation, taste disturbance,
and vomiting. </p>

<p>Dermatologic: Apparent hypersensitivity reactions (manifested by dermatitis,
pruritis, or rash, with or without fever), photosensitivity, and purpura.
</p>

<p>Neurologic and Psychiatric: Anxiety, amnesia, convulsions, depression,
hearing loss, insomnia, nervousness, neuralgia, neuropathy, paresthesia,
somnolence, tinnitus, tremor, vertigo, and vision disturbances. </p>

<p>FETAL/NEONATAL MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY. See WARNINGS: FETAL/NEONATAL
MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY. </p>

<p>Other: arthralgia, arthritis, dyspnea, edema, epistaxis, impotence,
increased sweating, malaise, myalgia, and weight gain. </p>

<p>CLINICAL LABORATORY TEST FINDINGS: </p>

<p>Creatinine and Blood Urea Nitrogen: Increases in creatinine levels occurred
in 1.2% of patients receiving Ramipril alone, and in 1.5% of patients receiving
Ramipril and a diuretic. Increases in blood urea nitrogen levels occurred
in 0.5% of patients receiving Ramipril alone and in 3% of patients receiving
Ramipril with a diuretic. None of these increases required discontinuation
of treatment. Increases in these laboratory values are more likely to occur
in patients with renal insufficiency or those pretreated with a diuretic
and, based on experience with other ACE inhibitors, would be expected to
be especially likely in patients with renal artery stenosis. (See PRECAUTIONS
and WARNINGS.) </p>

<p>Since ramipril decreases aldosterone secretion, elevation of serum potassium
can occur. Potassium supplements and potassium-sparing diuretics should
be given with caution, and the patient's serum potassium should be monitored
frequently. (See PRECAUTIONS and WARNINGS.) </p>

<p>Hemoglobin and Hematocrit: Decreases in hemoglobin or hematocrit (a
low value and a decrease of 5 g/dl or 5% respectively) were rare, occurring
in 0.4% of patients receiving Ramipril alone and in 1.5% of patients receiving
Ramipril plus a diuretic. No US patients discontinued treatment because
of decreases in hemoglobin or hematocrit. </p>

<p>Other (causal relationships unknown): Clinically important changes in
standard laboratory tests were rarely associated with Ramipril administration.
Elevations of liver enzymes, serum bilirubin, uric acid, and blood glucose
have been reported, as have scattered incidents of leukopenia, eosinophilia,
and proteinuria. In US trials, less than 0.2% of patients discontinued
treatment for laboratory abnormalities: all of these were cases of proteinuria
or abnormal liver-function tests. </p>

<p><a name="OVERDOSAGE"></a><b>OVERDOSAGE </b></p>

<p>The oral LD50 of rats and mice is 10-11 g/kg. In dogs, oral doses as
high as 1 g/kg induced only mild gastrointestinal distress. Human overdoses
of ramipril have not been reported, but the most common manifestation of
human ramipril overdosage is likely to be hypotension. </p>

<p>Laboratory determinations of serum levels of ramipril and its metabolites
are not widely available, and such determinations have, in any event, no
established role in the management of ramipril overdose. </p>

<p>No data are available to suggest physiological maneuvers (e.g., maneuvers
to change the pH of the urine) that might accelerate elimination of ramipril
and its metabolites. Similarly, it is not known which, if any, of these
substances can be usefully removed from the body by hemodialysis. </p>

<p>Angiotensin II could presumably serve as a specific antagonist-antidote
in the setting of ramipril overdose, but angiotensin II is essentially
unavailable outside of scattered research facilities. Because the hypotensive
effect of ramipril is achieved through vasodilation and effective hypovolemia,
it is reasonble to treat ramipril overdose by infusion of normal saline
solution. </p>

<p><a name="DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION"></a><b>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
</b></p>

<p>The recommended initial dose for patients not receiving a diuretic is
2.5 mg once a day. Dosage should be adjusted according to the blood pressure
response. The usual maintenance dosage range is 2.5 to 20 mg per day administered
as a single dose or in two equally divided doses. In some patients treated
once daily, the antihypertensive effect may diminish toward the end of
the dosing interval. In such patients, an increase in dosage or twice daily
administration should be considered. If blood pressure is not controlled
with Ramipril alone a diuretic can be added. </p>

<p>Concomitant administration of Ramipril with potassium supplements, potassium
salt substitutes, or potassium-sparing diuretics can lead to increases
of serum potassium. (See PRECAUTIONS.) </p>

<p>In patients who are currently being treated with a diuretic, symptomatic
hypotension occasionally can occur following the initial dose of Ramipril.
To reduce the likelihood of hypotension, the diuretic should, if possible,
be discontinued two to three days prior to beginning therapy with Ramipril
(see WARNINGS). Then, if blood pressure is not controlled with Ramipril
alone, diuretic therapy should be resumed. </p>

<p>If the diuretic cannot be discontinued, an initial dose of 1.25 mg Ramipril
should be used to avoid excess hypotension. </p>

<p>DOSAGE ADJUSTMENT IN RENAL IMPAIRMENT: For patients with a creatinine
clearance &lt;40 ml/min/1.73M(square) (serum creatinine &gt;2.5 mg/dl),
the recommended initial dose is 1.25 mg Ramipril once daily. Dosage may
be titrated upward until blood pressure is controlled or to a maximum total
daily dose of 5 mg. </p>

<p><a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><b>DESCRIPTION </b></p>

<p>Mometasone furoate is a synthetic corticosteroid with anti-inflammatory
activity. </p>

<p>Chemically, mometasone furoate is 9alpha,21-Dichloro-11beta,17-dihydroxy-
16alpha-methylpregna-1,4-diene-3,20-dione17-(2-furoate), with the empirical
formula C27H30Cl2O6 and a molecular weight of 521.4. </p>

<p>Mometasone furoate is a white to off-white powder practically insoluble
in water, slightly soluble in octanol, and moderately soluble in ethyl
alcohol. </p>

<p><a name="ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY"></a><b>ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
</b></p>

<p>The corticosteroids are a class of compounds comprising steroid hormones
secreted by the adrenal cortex and their synthetic analogs. In pharmacologic
doses corticosteroids are used primarily for their anti-inflammatory and/or
immunosuppressive effects. Topical corticosteroids, such as mometasone
furoate, are effective in the treatment of corticosteroid-responsive dermatoses
primarily because of their anti-inflammatory, anti-pruritic, and vasoconstrictive
actions. However, while the physiologic, pharmacologic, and clinical effects
of the corticosteroids are well known, the exact mechanisms of their actions
in each disease are uncertain. Mometasone furoate has been shown to have
topical (dermatologic) and systemic pharmacologic and metabolic effects
characteristic of this class of drugs. </p>

<p>PHARMACOKINETICS: The extent of percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids
is determined by many factors including the vehicle, the integrity of the
epidermal barrier, and the use of occlusive dressings. (See DOSAGE AND
ADMINISTRATION.) Topical corticosteroids can be absorbed from normal intact
skin. </p>

<p>The percutaneous absorption of 3H-mometasone furoate was evaluated in
rabbits following topical application of both cream (0.1%) and ointment
(0.1%) formulations. Approximately 5% of the topically applied dose was
systemically absorbed following topical application of the cream and 6%
following application of the ointment formulation. Based upon these results,
it was concluded that mometasone furoate is absorbed to a similar extent
following application of either the cream or ointment formulations. Percutaneous
absorption studies of 3H-mometasone furoate ointment in rats and dogs have
shown that approximately 2.5% of a topically applied dose was absorbed
by rats and 2% by dogs. </p>

<p>The percutaneous absorption of 3H-mometasone furoate was also studied
in man following topical application of an ointment (0.1%) formulation.
Results showed that only about 0.7% of the steroid was systemically absorbed
following 8 hours of contact without occlusion. Minimal absorption would
be anticipated with the cream and lotion formulations. </p>

<p>Inflammation and/or other disease processes in the skin increase percutaneous
absorption. Occlusive dressings substantially increase the percutaneous
absorption of topical corticosteroids. (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION.)
</p>

<p>In studies of the effects of mometasone furoate on the hypothalamic-pituitary-
adrenal (HPA) axis (one with the cream and one with the ointment), 15 grams
were applied twice daily for seven days to six patients with psoriasis
or atopic dermatitis. The cream or ointment was applied without occlusion
to at least 30% of the body surface. The results suggest that the drug
caused a slight lowering of adrenal corticosteroid secretion, although
in no case did plasma cortisol levels go below the lower limit of the normal
range. </p>

<p>Mometasone furoate lotion was applied at 15 mL twice daily (30 mL per
day) to diseased skin (patients with scalp and body psoriasis) of four
patients for seven days, to study its effects on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal
(HPA) axis. Plasma cortisol levels for each of the four patients remained
well within the normal range and changed little from baseline. </p>

<p>Once absorbed through the skin, topical corticosteroids are handled
through pharmacokinetic pathways similar to systemically administered corticosteroids.
Corticosteroids are bound to plasma proteins in varying degrees. Corticosteroids
are metabolized primarily in the liver and are then excreted by the kidneys.
Some of the topical corticosteroids and their metabolites are also excreted
into the bile. </p>

<p><a name="INDICATIONS AND USAGE"></a><b>INDICATIONS AND USAGE </b></p>

<p>Mometasone products are indicated for the relief of the inflammatory
and pruritic manifestations of corticosteroid-responsive dermatoses. </p>

<p><a name="CONTRAINDICATIONS"></a><b>CONTRAINDICATIONS </b></p>

<p>Mometasone products are contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive
to mometasone furoate, to other corticosteroids, or to any ingredient in
these preparations. </p>

<p><a name="PRECAUTIONS"></a><b>PRECAUTIONS </b></p>

<p>GENERAL: Systemic absorption of potent topical corticosteroids has produced
reversible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression, manifestations
of Cushing's syndrome, hyperglycemia, and glucosuria in some patients.
Conditions which augment systemic absorption include application of steroids
in optimized vehicles, application of more potent steroids, use over large
surface areas, prolonged use, use in areas where the epidermal barrier
is disrupted, and the use of occlusive dressings. (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION.)
</p>

<p>Patients receiving a large dose of a potent topical steroid applied
to a large surface area or under an occlusive dressing should be evaluated
periodically for evidence of HPA axis suppression by using the urinary
free cortisol and ACTH stimulation tests. If HPA axis suppression is noted,
an attempt should be made to withdraw the drug, to reduce the frequency
of application, or to substitute a less potent steroid. </p>

<p>Recovery of HPA axis function is generally prompt and complete upon
discontinuation of the drug. Infrequently, signs and symptoms of steroid
withdrawal may occur, requiring supplemental systemic corticosteroids.
</p>

<p>Children may absorb proportionally larger amounts of topical corticosteroids
and thus be more susceptible to systemic toxicity. (See PRECAUTIONS--PEDIATRIC
USE.) If irritation develops, topical corticosteroids should be discontinued
and appropriate therapy instituted. </p>

<p>In the presence of dermatological infections, use of an appropriate
antifungal or antibacterial agent should be instituted. If a favorable
response does not occur promptly, the corticosteroid should be discontinued
until the infection has been adequately controlled. </p>

<p>INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS: Patients using topical corticosteroids should
receive the following information and instructions. This information is
intended to aid in the safe and effective use of this medication. It is
not a disclosure of all possible adverse or intended effects. </p>

<p>1. This medication is to be used as directed by the physician. It is
for external use only. Avoid contact with the eyes. </p>

<p>2. Patients should be advised not to use this medication for any disorder
other than that for which it was prescribed. </p>

<p>3. The treated skin area should not be bandaged or otherwise covered
or wrapped so as to be occlusive unless directed by the physician. (See
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION.) </p>

<p>4. Patients should report any signs of local adverse reactions. </p>

<p>5. Parents of pediatric patients should be advised not to use tight-fitting
diapers or plastic pants on a child being treated in the diaper area, as
these garments may constitute occlusive dressing. (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION.)
</p>

<p>LABORATORY TESTS: The following tests may be helpful in evaluating HPA
axis suppression: </p>

<p>Urinary free cortisol test </p>

<p>ACTH stimulation test </p>

<p>CARCINOGENESIS, MUTAGENESIS, AND IMPAIRMENT OF FERTILITY: Long-term
animal studies have not been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential
or the effect on fertility of topical corticosteroids. </p>

<p>Genetic toxicity studies with mometasone furoate, which included the
Ames test, mouse lymphoma assay, and a micronucleus test, did not reveal
any mutagenic potential. </p>

<p>PREGNANCY CATEGORY C: Corticosteroids are generally teratogenic in laboratory
animals when administered systemically at relatively low dosage levels.
Corticosteroids have been shown to be teratogenic after dermal application
in laboratory animals. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies
of teratogenic effects from topically applied corticosteroids in pregnant
women. Therefore, topical corticosteroids should be used during pregnancy
only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.
Drugs of this class should not be used extensively on pregnant patients,
in large amounts, or for prolonged periods. </p>

<p>NURSING MOTHERS: It is not known whether topical administration of corticosteroids
could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities
in breast milk. Systemically administered corticosteroids are secreted
into breast milk in quantities not likely to have a deleterious effect
on the infant. Nevertheless, a decision should be made whether to discontinue
nursing or to discontinue the drug taking into account the importance of
the drug to the mother. </p>

<p>PEDIATRIC USE: Pediatric Patients May Demonstrate Greater Susceptibility
To Topical Corticosteroid-Induced HPA Axis Suppression And Cushing's Syndrome
Than Mature Patients Because Of A Larger Skin Surface Area To Body Weight
Ratio. </p>

<p>Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression, Cushing's syndrome,
and intracranial hypertension have been reported in children receiving
topical corticosteroids. Manifestations of adrenal suppression in children
include linear growth retardation, delayed weight gain, low plasma cortisol
levels, and absence of response to ACTH stimulation. Manifestations of
intracranial hypertension include bulging fontanelles, headaches, and bilateral
papilledema. </p>

<p>Administration of topical corticosteroids to children should be limited
to the least amount compatible with an effective therapeutic regimen. Chronic
corticosteroid therapy may interfere with the growth and development of
children. </p>

<p><a name="ADVERSE REACTIONS"></a><b>ADVERSE REACTIONS </b></p>

<p>The following local adverse reactions were reported with Mometasone
CREAM during clinical studies with 319 patients: burning, 1; pruritus,
1; and signs of skin atrophy, 3. </p>

<p>The following local adverse reactions were reported with Mometasone
OINTMENT during clinical studies with 812 patients: burning, 13; pruritus,
8; skin atrophy, 8; tingling/stinging, 7; and furunculosis, 3. </p>

<p>The following local adverse reactions were reported with Mometasone
LOTION during clinical studies with 209 patients; acneiform reaction, 2;
burning, 4; and itching, 1. In an irritation/sensitization study with 156
normal subjects, folliculitis was reported in 4. </p>

<p>The following local adverse reactions have been reported infrequently
when other topical dermatologic corticosteroids have been used as recommended.
These reactions are listed in an approximate decreasing order of occurrence:
burning, itching, irritation, dryness, folliculitis, hypertrichosis, acneiform
eruptions hypopigmentation, perioral dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis,
maceration of the skin, secondary infection, skin atrophy, striae, miliaria.
</p>

<p><a name="OVERDOSAGE"></a><b>OVERDOSAGE </b></p>

<p>Topically applied corticosteroids can be absorbed in sufficient amounts
to produce systemic effects. (See PRECAUTIONS.) </p>

<p><a name="DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION"></a><b>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
</b></p>

<p>Apply a thin film of Mometasone CREAM or OINTMENT to the affected skin
areas once daily. Do not use occlusive dressings. Apply a few drops of
Mometasone LOTION to the affected areas once daily and massage lightly
until it disappears. For the most effective and economical use, hold the
nozzle of the bottle very close to the affected areas and gently squeeze.

<p><a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><b>DESCRIPTION </b></p>

<p>FOR DERMATOLOGIC USE ONLY-- </p>

<p>NOT FOR OPHTHALMIC USE </p>

<p>Clotrimazole/betamethasone Cream contains a combination of clotrimazole,
USP, a synthetic antifungal agent, and betamethasone dipropionate, USP,
a synthetic corticosteroid, for dermatologic use. </p>

<p>Chemically, clotrimazole is 1-(o-Chloro-alpha,alpha-diphenyl benzyl)imidazole,
with the empirical formula C22H17ClN2 and a molecular weight of 344.8.
</p>

<p>Clotrimazole is an odorless, white crystalline powder, insoluble in
water and soluble in ethanol. </p>

<p>Betamethasone dipropionate has the chemical name 9-Fluoro-11beta,17,21-
trihydroxy-16beta-methylpregna-1,4-diene-3,20-dione17,21-dipropionate,
with the empirical formula C28H37FO7 and a molecular weight of 504.6. </p>

<p>Betamethasone dipropionate is a white to creamy white, odorless crystalline
powder, insoluble in water. </p>

<p><a name="ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY"></a><b>ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</b>
</p>

<p>Clotrimazole is a broad-spectrum, antifungal agent that is used for
the treatment of dermal infections caused by various species of pathogenic
dermatophytes, yeasts, and Malassezia Furfur. The primary action of clotrimazole
is against dividing and growing organisms. </p>

<p>In Vitro, clotrimazole exhibits fungistatic and fungicidal activity
against isolates of Trichophyton Rubrum, Trichophyton Mentagrophytes, Epidermophyton
Floccosum and Microsporum Canis. In general, the In Vitro activity of clotrimazole
corresponds to that of tolnaftate and griseofulvin against the mycelia
of dermatophytes (Trichophyton, Microsporum, and Epidermophyton). </p>

<p>In Vivo studies in guinea pigs infected with Trichophyton Mentagrophytes
have shown no measurable loss of clotrimazole activity due to combination
with betamethasone dipropionate. </p>

<p>Strains of fungi having a natural resistance to clotrimazole have not
been reported. </p>

<p>No single-step or multiple-step resistance to clotrimazole has developed
during successive passages of Trichophyton Mentagrophytes. </p>

<p>In studies of the mechanism of action in fungal cultures, the minimum
fungicidal concentration of clotrimazole caused leakage of intracellular
phosphorous compounds into the ambient medium with concomitant breakdown
of cellular nucleic acids, and accelerated potassium efflux. Both of these
events began rapidly and extensively after addition of the drug to the
cultures. </p>

<p>Clotrimazole appears to be minimally absorbed following topical application
to the skin. Six hours after the application of radioactive clotrimazole
1% cream and 1% solution onto intact and acutely inflamed skin, the concentration
of clotrimazole varied from 100 mcg/cm (raised to the power of 3) in the
stratum corneum, to 0.5 to 1 mcg/cm (raised to the power of 3) in the stratum
reticulare, and 0.1 mcg/cm (raised to the power of 3) in the subcutis.
No measureable amount of radioactivity (&lt;0.001 mcg/ml) was found in
the serum within 48 hours after application under occlusive dressing of
0.5 ml of the solution or 0.8 g of the cream. </p>

<p>BETAMETHASONE DIPROPIONATE </p>

<p>Betamethasone dipropionate, a corticosteroid, is effective in the treatment
of corticosteroid-responsive dermatoses primarily because of its anti-inflammatory
antipruritic, and vasoconstrictive actions. However, while the physiologic,
pharmacologic, and clinical effects of corticosteroids are well-known,
the exact mechanisms of their actions in each disease are uncertain. Betamethasone
dipropionate, a corticosteroid, has been shown to have topical (dermatologic)
and systemic pharmacologic and metabolic effects characteristic of this
class of drugs. </p>

<p>PHARMACOKINETICS: The extent of percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids
is determined by many factors including the vehicle, the integrity of the
epidermal barrier, and the use of occlusive dressings. (See DOSAGE AND
ADMINISTRATION section.) </p>

<p>Topical corticosteroids can be absorbed from normal intact skin. Inflammation
and/or other disease processes in the skin increase percutaneous absorption.
Occlusive dressings substantially increase the percutaneous absorption
of topical corticosteroids. (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION section.) </p>

<p>Once absorbed through the skin, topical corticosteroids are handled
through pharmacokinetic pathways similar to systemically administered corticosteroids.
Corticosteroids are bound to plasma proteins in varying degrees. Corticosteroids
are metabolized primarily in the liver and are then excreted by the kidneys.
Some of the topical corticosteroids and their metabolites are also excr
eted into the bile. </p>

<p>CLOTRIMAZOLE AND BETAMETHASONE DIPROPIONATE </p>

<p>In clinical studies of tinea corporis, tinea cruris and tinea pedis,
patients treated with Clotrimazole/betamethasone Cream showed a better
clinical response at the first return visit than patients treated with
clotrimazole cream. In tinea corporis and tinea cruris, the patient returned
three days after starting treatment, and in tinea pedis, after one week.
Mycological cure rates observed in patients treated with Clotrimazole/betamethasone
Cream were as good as or better than in those patients treated with clotrimazole
cream. </p>

<p>In these same clinical studies, patients treated with Clotrimazole/betamethasone
Cream showed statistically significantly better clinical responses and
mycological cure rates when compared with patients treated with betamethasone
dipropionate cream. </p>

<p><a name="INDICATIONS AND USAGE"></a><b>INDICATIONS AND USAGE </b></p>

<p>Clotrimazole/betamethasone Cream is indicated for the topical treatment
of the following dermal infections: tinea pedis, tinea cruris, and tinea
corporis due to Trichophyton Rubrum, Trichophyton Mentagrophytes, Epidermophyton
Floccosum, and Microsporum Canis. </p>

<p><a name="CONTRAINDICATIONS"></a><b>CONTRAINDICATIONS </b></p>

<p>Clotrimazole/betamethasone Cream is contraindicated in patients who
are sensitive to clotrimazole, betamethasone dipropionate, other corticosteroids
or imidazoles, or to any ingredient in this preparation. </p>

<p><a name="PRECAUTIONS"></a><b>PRECAUTIONS </b></p>

<p>GENERAL: Systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids has produced
reversible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression, manifestations
of Cushing's syndrome, hyperglycemia, and glucosuria in some patients.
</p>

<p>Conditions which augment systemic absorption include the application
of the more potent steroids, use over large surface areas, prolonged use,
and the addition of occlusive dressings. (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
section.) </p>

<p>Therefore, patients receiving a large dose of a potent topical steroid
applied to a large surface area should be evaluated periodically for evidence
of HPA axis suppression by using the urinary free cortisol and ACTH stimulation
tests. If HPA axis suppression is noted, an attempt should be made to withdraw
the drug, to reduce the frequency of application, or to substitute a less
potent steroid. </p>

<p>Recovery of HPA axis function is generally prompt and complete upon
discontinuation of the drug. Infrequently, signs and symptoms of steroid
withdrawal may occur, requiring supplemental systemic corticosteroids.
</p>

<p>Children may absorb proportionally larger amounts of topical corticosteroids
and thus be more susceptible to systemic toxicity. (See PRECAUTIONS-PEDIATRIC
USE.) </p>

<p>If irritation or hypersensitivity develops with the use of Clotrimazole/betamethasone
Cream, treatment should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted.
</p>

<p>INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS Patients using Clotrimazole/betamethasone Cream
should receive the following information and instructions: </p>

<p>1. This medication is to be used as directed by the physician. It is
for external use only. Avoid contact with the eyes. </p>

<p>2. The medication is to be used for the full prescribed treatment time,
even though the symptoms may have improved. Notify the physician if there
is no improvement after one week of treatment for tinea cruris or tinea
corporis, or after two weeks for tinea pedis. </p>

<p>3. Patients should be advised not to use this medication for any disorder
other than for which it was prescribed. </p>

<p>4. The treated skin areas should not be bandaged or otherwise covered
or wrapped as to be occluded. (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION section.)
</p>

<p>5. When using this medication in the groin area, patients should be
advised to use the medication for two weeks only, and to apply the cream
sparingly. The physician should be notified if the condition persists after
two weeks. Patients should also be advised to wear loose fitting clothing.
(See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION section.) </p>

<p>6. Patients should report any signs of local adverse reactions. </p>

<p>7. Patients should avoid sources of infection or reinfection. </p>

<p>LABORATORY TESTS: If there is a lack of response to Clotrimazole/betamethasone
Cream, appropriate microbiological studies should be repeated to confirm
the diagnosis and rule out other pathogens before instituting another course
of antimycotic therapy. </p>

<p>The following tests may be helpful in evaluating HPA axis suppression
due to the corticosteroid component: </p>

<p>Urinary free cortisol test </p>

<p>ACTH stimulation test </p>

<p>CARCINOGENESIS, MUTAGENESIS, IMPAIRMENT OF FERTILITY: There are no animal
or laboratory studies with the combination clotrimazole and betamethasone
dipropionate to evaluate carcinogenesis, mutagenesis or impairment of fertility.
</p>

<p>An 18-month oral dosing study with clotrimazole in rats has not revealed
any carcinogenic effect. </p>

<p>In tests for mutagenesis, chromosomes of the spermatophores of Chinese
hamsters which have been exposed to clotrimazole were examined for structural
changes during the metaphase. Prior to testing, the hamsters had received
five ORAL clotrimazole doses of 100 mg/kg body weight. The results of this
study showed that clotrimazole had no mutagenic effect. </p>

<p>PREGNANCY CATEGORY C: There have been no teratogenic studies performed
with the combination clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate. </p>

<p>Studies in pregnant rats with INTRAVAGINAL doses up to 100 mg/kg have
revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to clotrimazole. </p>

<p>High ORAL doses of clotrimazole in rats and mice ranging from 50 to
120 mg/kg resulted in embryotoxicity (possibly secondary to maternal toxicity),
impairment of mating, decreased litter size and number of viable young
and decreased pup survival to weaning. However, clotrimazole was NOT teratogenic
in mice, rabbits and rats at oral doses up to 200, 180 and 100 mg/kg, respectively.
Oral absorption in the rat amounts to approximately 90% of the administered
dose. </p>

<p>Corticosteroids are generally teratogenic in laboratory animals when
administered systemically at relatively low dosage levels. The more potent
corticosteroids have been shown to be teratogenic after dermal application
in laboratory animals. </p>

<p>There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women
on teratogenic effects from a topically applied combination of clotrimazole
and betamethasone dipropionate. Therefore, Clotrimazole/betamethasone Cream
should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies
the potential risk to the fetus. </p>

<p>Drugs containing corticosteroids should not be used extensively on pregnant
patients, in large amounts, or for prolonged periods of time. </p>

<p>NURSING MOTHERS: It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human
milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be
exercised when Clotrimazole/betamethasone Cream is used by a nursing woman.
</p>

<p>PEDIATRIC USE: Safety and effectiveness in children below the age of
12 have not been established with Clotrimazole/betamethasone Cream. </p>

<p>PEDIATRIC PATIENTS MAY DEMONSTRATE GREATER SUSCEPTIBILITY TO TOPICAL
CORTICOSTEROID-INDUCED HPA AXIS SUPPRESSION AND CUSHING'S SYNDROME THAN
MATURE PATIENTS BECAUSE OF A LARGER SKIN SURFACE AREA TO BODY WEIGHT RATIO.
</p>

<p>Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression, Cushing's syndrome,
and intracranial hypertension have been reported in children receiving
topical corticosteroids. Manifestations of adrenal suppression in children
include linear growth retardation, delayed weight gain, low plasma cortisol
levels, and absence of response to ACTH stimulation. Manifestations of
intracranial hypertension include bulging fontanelles, headaches, and bilateral
papilledema. </p>

<p>Administration of topical dermatologics containing a corticosteroid
to children should be limited to the least amount compatible with an effective
therapeutic regimen. Chronic corticosteroid therapy may interfere with
the growth and development of children. </p>

<p>The use of Clotrimazole/betamethasone Cream in diaper dermatitis is
not recommended. </p>

<p><a name="ADVERSE REACTIONS"></a><b>ADVERSE REACTIONS </b></p>

<p>The following adverse reactions have been reported in connection with
the use of Clotrimazole/betamethasone Cream: paresthesia in 5 of 270 patients,
maculopapular rash, edema and secondary infection, each in 1 of 270 patients.
</p>

<p>Adverse reactions reported with the use of clotrimazole are as follows:
erythema, stinging, blistering, peeling, edema, pruritus, urticaria, and
general irritation of the skin. </p>

<p>The following local adverse reactions are reported infrequently when
topical corticosteroids are used as recommended. These reactions are listed
in an approximate decreasing order of occurrence: burning, itching, irritation,
dryness, folliculitis, hypertrichosis, acneiform eruptions, hypopigmentation,
perioral dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, maceration of the skin,
secondary infection, skin atrophy, striae, and miliaria. </p>

<p><a name="OVERDOSAGE"></a><b>OVERDOSAGE </b></p>

<p>Acute overdosage with topical application of Clotrimazole/betamethasone
Cream is unlikely and would not be expected to lead to a life-threatening
situation. </p>

<p>Topically applied corticosteroids can be absorbed in sufficient amounts
to produce systemic effects. (See PRECAUTIONS.) </p>

<p><a name="DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION"></a><b>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
</b></p>

<p>Gently massage sufficient Clotrimazole/betamethasone Cream into the
affected and surrounding skin areas twice a day, in the morning and evening
for two weeks in tinea cruris and tinea corporis, and for four weeks in
tinea pedis. The use of Clotrimazole/betamethasone Cream for longer than
four weeks is not recommended. </p>

<p>Clinical improvement, with relief of erythema and pruritus, usually
occurs within three to five days of treatment. If a patient with tinea
cruris and tinea corporis shows no clinical improvement after one week
of treatment with Clotrimazole/betamethasone Cream, the diagnosis should
be reviewed. In tinea pedis, the treatment should be applied for two weeks
prior to making that decision. </p>

<p>Treatment with Clotrimazole/betamethasone Cream should be discontinued
if the condition persists after two weeks in tinea cruris and tinea corporis,
and after four weeks in tinea pedis. Alternate therapy may then be instituted
with Clotrimazole Cream, a product containing an antifungal only. </p>

<p>Clotrimazole/betamethasone Cream should NOT be used with occlusive dressings.

<hr width="100%" ></p>

<p><a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><b>DESCRIPTION </b></p>

<p>Cetirizine hydrochloride, is an orally active and selective H1-receptor
antagonist. Cetirizine hydrochloride is a racemic compound with an empirical
formula of &nbsp;C<sub>21</sub>H<sub>25</sub>ClN<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>*2HCl.
The molecular weight is 461.82. Cetirizine hydrochloride is a white, crystalline
powder and is water soluble.</p>

<p><a name="ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY"></a><b> ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
</b></p>

<p>Mechanism of Actions: Cetirizine, a human metabolite of hydroxyzine,
is an antihistamine; its principal effects are mediated via selective inhibition
of peripheral H1 receptors. The antihistaminic activity of cetirizine has
been clearly documented in a variety of animal and human models. In vivo
and ex vivo animal models have shown negligible anticholinergic and antiserotonergic
activity. In clinical studies, however, dry mouth was more common with
cetirizine than with placebo. In vitro receptor binding studies have shown
no measurable affinity for other than H1 receptors. Autoradiographic studies
with radiolabeled cetirizine in the rat have shown negligible penetration
into the brain. Ex vivo experiments in the mouse have shown that systemically
administered cetirizine does not significantly occupy cerebral H1 receptors.</p>

<p>Pharmacokinetics: Cetirizine is rapidly absorbed after oral administration
of a tablet, which had bioavailability similar to an oral solution. Food
had no effect on the extent of cetirizine absorption, but Tmax was delayed
by 1.7 hours and Cmax was decreased by 23% in the presence of food. A mass
balance study in 6 healthy male volunteers indicated that 70% of the administered
radioactive dose was recovered in the urine and 10% in the feces, for a
combined total recovery of about 80%. Approximately 50% of the administered
radioactive dose was excreted in urine as unchanged drug. Most of the rapid
increase in peak plasma radioactivity is associated with parent drug indicating
low first pass metabolism. Cetirizine is metabolized to a very limited
extent by oxidative O-dealkylation to a metabolite with negligible antihistaminic
activity.</p>

<p>Cetirizine exhibits linear kinetics over the dosage range of 5 to 60
mg. In pharmacokinetic studies in 146 healthy volunteers, the mean  SD
terminal half-life was 8.3  1.8 hours, oral clearance was 54  13 mL/min,
and the apparent volume of distribution was 0.50 0.08 L/kg. No accumulation
was observed for cetirizine following daily doses of 10 mg for 10 days.
The steady-state maximum plasma concentration was 311  40 ng/mL and was
achieved within 1.0  0.5 hour. Individual histograms of cetirizine Cmax
and AUC showed unimodal distributions with a two- to four-fold variability
in healthy subjects. Plasma protein binding of cetirizine is 93  0.3%
and is independent of concentration in the range of 0.025 to 1.0 mcg/mL;
this concentration range covers the therapeutic plasma levels.</p>

<p>Formal pharmacokinetic interaction studies were conducted with cetirizine
and pseudoephedrine, antipyrine, ketoconazole, erythromycin, and azithromycin.
No pharmacokinetic interactions were observed. In a multiple dose study
of theophylline (400 mg once daily) and cetirizine, there was a small (16%)
decrease in clearance of cetirizine.</p>

<p>Special Populations </p>

<p>Effect of Age: Following a single 10 mg oral dose, half-life increased
by about 50% and clearance decreased by 40% in 16 elderly subjects as compared
to the 14 normal subjects. The decrease in cetirizine clearance in these
elderly volunteers appeared to be related to their decreased renal function.</p>

<p>Effect of Gender: The effect of gender on cetirizine pharmacokinetics
has not been adequately studied.</p>

<p>Effect of Race: No race-related differences were observed in the kinetics
of cetirizine between 86 white adult males and 11 black adult males.</p>

<p>Renally Impaired Patients: The kinetics of cetirizine were studied following
multiple oral daily doses of 10 mg for 7 days in 7 normal volunteers (creatinine
clearance 89-128 mL/min), 8 patients with mild renal function impairment
(creatinine clearance 42-77 mL/min) and 7 patients with moderate renal
function impairment (creatinine clearance 11-31 mL/min). The pharmacokinetics
of the drug were similar in patients with mild impairment and normal volunteers.
Moderately renally impaired patients had a 3-fold increase in half-life
and 70% decrease in clearance compared to normal volunteers.</p>

<p>Patients (N=5) on hemodialysis (creatinine clearance less than 7 mL/min)
given a single oral 10 mg dose of cetirizine had a 3-fold increase in half-life
and a 70% decrease in clearance compared to normals. Cetirizine was not
completely cleared by hemodialysis as less than 10% of the administered
dose was removed during the dialysis session.</p>

<p>Dosing adjustment is necessary in patients with moderate or severe renal
impairment and patients on dialysis. (See also DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION.)</p>

<p>Hepatically Impaired Patients: Sixteen patients with chronic liver diseases
(hepatocellular, cholestatic, and biliary cirrhosis), given 10 or 20 mg
of cetirizine as a single oral dose had a 50% increase in half-life along
with a 40% decrease in clearance compared to 16 healthy subjects.</p>

<p>Dosing adjustment may be necessary in hepatically impaired patients.
(See also DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION.)</p>

<p>Pharmacodynamics: Studies in normal volunteers show that Certrizine
at doses of 5 and 10 mg strongly inhibits the skin wheal and flare caused
by the intradermal injection of histamine. The onset of this activity after
a single 10 mg dose occurs within 20 minutes in 50% of subjects and within
one hour in 95% of subjects; this activity persists for at least 24 hours.
In a 35-day study in children ages 5 to 12, no tolerance to the antihistaminic
(suppression of wheal and flare response) effects of Certrizine was found.
The effects of intradermal injection of various other mediators or histamine
releasers are also inhibited by cetirizine, as is response to a cold challenge
in patients with cold-induced urticaria. In mildly asthmatic subjects,
Certrizine at 5 to 20 mg blocked bronchoconstriction due to nebulized histamine,
with virtually total blockade after a 20 mg dose. In studies conducted
for up to 12 hours following cutaneous antigen challenge, the late phase
recruitment of eosinophils, neutrophils and basophils, components of the
allergic inflammatory response, was inhibited by Certrizine at a dose of
20 mg.</p>

<p>In four clinical studies in healthy adult males, no clinically significant
mean increases in QTc were observed in Certrizine treated subjects. In
the first study, a placebo-controlled crossover trial, Certrizine was given
at doses up to 60 mg per day, 6 times the maximum clinical dose, for 1
week, and no significant mean QTc prolongation occurred. In the second
study, a crossover trial, Certrizine 20 mg and erythromycin (500 mg every
8 hours) were given alone and in combination. There was no significant
effect on QTc with the combination or with Certrizine alone. In the third
trial, also a crossover study, Certrizine 20 mg and ketoconazole (400 mg
per day) were given alone and in combination. Certrizine caused a mean
increase in QTc of 9.1 msec from baseline after 10 days of therapy. Ketoconazole
also increased QTc by 8.3 msec. The combination caused an increase of 17.4
msec, equal to the sum of the individual effects. Thus, there was no significant
drug interaction on QTc with the combination of Certrizine and ketoconazole.
In the fourth study, a placebo-controlled parallel trial, Certrizine 20
mg was given alone or in combination with azithromycin (500 mg as a single
dose on the first day followed by 250 mg once daily). There was no significant
increase in QTc with Certrizine 20 mg alone or in combination with azithromycin.
</p>

<p>In a six-week, placebo-controlled study of 186 patients with allergic
rhinitis and mild to moderate asthma, Certrizine 10 mg once daily improved
rhinitis symptoms and did not alter pulmonary function. This study supports
the safety of administering Certrizine to allergic rhinitis patients with
mild to moderate asthma.</p>

<p>Clinical Studies: Nine multicenter, randomized, double-blind, clinical
trials comparing cetirizine 5 to 20 mg to placebo in patients with seasonal
or perennial allergic rhinitis were conducted in the United States. Five
of these showed significant reductions in symptoms of allergic rhinitis,
3 in seasonal allergic rhinitis (1 to 4 weeks in duration) and 2 in perennial
allergic rhinitis for up to 8 weeks in duration. Two 4-week multicenter,
randomized, double-blind, clinical trials comparing cetirizine 5 to 20
mg to placebo in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria were also conducted
and showed significant improvement in symptoms of chronic idiopathic urticaria.
In general, the 10 mg dose was more effective than the 5 mg dose and the
20 mg dose gave no added effect. Some of these trials included pediatric
patients age 12 to 16 years.</p>

<p><a name="INDICATIONS AND USAGE"></a><b>INDICATIONS AND USAGE </b></p>

<p>Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis: Certrizine is indicated for the relief of
symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rhinitis due to allergens such
as ragweed, grass and tree pollens in adults and children 6 years of age
and older. Symptoms treated effectively include sneezing, rhinorrhea, nasal
pruritus, ocular pruritus, tearing and redness of the eyes.</p>

<p>Perennial Allergic Rhinitis: Certrizine is indicated for the relief
of symptoms associated with perennial allergic rhinitis due to allergens
such as dust mites, animal dander and molds in adults and children 6 years
of age and older. Symptoms treated effectively include sneezing, rhinorrhea,
post-nasal discharge, nasal pruritus, ocular pruritus and tearing.</p>

<p>Chronic Urticaria: Certrizine is indicated for the treatment of the
uncomplicated skin manifestations of chronic idiopathic urticaria in adults
and children 6 years of age and older. It significantly reduces the occurrence,
severity and duration of hives and significantly reduces pruritus.</p>

<p><a name="CONTRAINDICATIONS"></a><b>CONTRAINDICATIONS </b></p>

<p>Certrizine is contraindicated in those patients with a known hypersensitivity
to it or any of its ingredients or hydroxyzine.</p>

<p><a name="PRECAUTIONS"></a><b>PRECAUTIONS </b></p>

<p>Activities Requiring Mental Alertness: In clinical trials, the occurrence
of somnolence has been reported in some patients taking Certrizine; due
caution should therefore be exercised when driving a car or operating potentially
dangerous machinery. Concurrent use of Certrizine with alcohol or other
CNS depressants should be avoided because additional reductions in alertness
and additional impairment of CNS performance may occur.</p>

<p>Drug-drug Interactions: No clinically significant drug interactions
have been found with theophylline at a low dose, azithromycin, pseudoephedrine,
ketoconazole, or erythromycin. There was a small decrease in the clearance
of cetirizine caused by a 400 mg dose of theophylline; it is possible that
larger theophylline doses could have a greater effect.</p>

<p>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis and Impairment of Fertility: No evidence
of carcinogenicity was observed in a 2-year carcinogenicity study in rats
at dietary doses up to 20 mg/kg/day (15 times the maximum recommended human
dose on a mg/m2/day basis). An increased incidence of benign liver tumors
was found in a 2-year carcinogenicity study in male mice at a dietary dose
of 16 mg/kg/day (6 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m2/day
basis). The clinical significance of these findings during long-term use
of Certrizine is not known. Cetirizine was not mutagenic in the Ames test,
and not clastogenic in the human lymphocyte assay, the mouse lymphoma assay,
and the in vivo micronucleus test in rats. No impairment of fertility was
found in a fertility and general reproductive performance study in mice
at a dose of 64 mg/kg/day (26 times the maximum recommended human dose
on a mg/m2/day basis).</p>

<p>Pregnancy Category B: Cetirizine was not teratogenic in mice, rats and
rabbits at doses up to 96, 225, and 135 mg/kg/day (40, 180, and 216 times
the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m2/day basis), respectively.
There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because
animal studies are not always predictive of human response, Certrizine
should be used in pregnancy only if clearly needed.</p>

<p>Nursing Mothers: Retarded pup weight gain was found in mice during lactation
when dams were given cetirizine at 96 mg/kg/day (40 times the maximum recommended
human dose on a mg/m2/day basis). Studies in beagle dogs indicate that
approximately 3% of the dose is excreted in breast milk. Cetirizine has
been reported to be excreted in human breast milk; use of Certrizine in
nursing mothers is not recommended.</p>

<p>Geriatric Use: In placebo-controlled trials, 186 patients age 65 to
94 years received doses of 5 to 20 mg of Certrizine per day. Adverse events
were similar in this group to patients under age 65. Subset analysis of
efficacy in this group was not done. </p>

<p>Pediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness in children under 6 years of
age has not been established.</p>

<p><a name="ADVERSE REACTIONS"></a><b>ADVERSE REACTIONS </b></p>

<p>Controlled and uncontrolled clinical trials conducted in the United
States and Canada included more than 6000 patients, with more than 3900
receiving Certrizine at doses of 5 to 20 mg per day. The duration of treatment
ranged from 1 week to 6 months, with a mean exposure of 30 days.</p>

<p>Most adverse reactions reported during therapy with Certrizine were
mild or moderate. In placebo-controlled trials, the incidence of discontinuations
due to adverse reactions in patients receiving Certrizine 5 mg or 10 mg
was not significantly different from placebo (2.9% vs. 2.4%, respectively).</p>

<p>The most common adverse reaction that occurred more frequently on cetirizine
than placebo was somnolence. The incidence of somnolence associated with
Certrizine was dose related, 6% in placebo, 11% at 5 mg and 14% at 10 mg.
Discontinuations due to somnolence for Certrizine were uncommon (1.0% on
Certrizine vs. 0.6% on placebo). Fatigue and dry mouth also appeared to
be treatment-related adverse reactions. There were no differences by age,
race, gender or by body weight with regard to the incidence of adverse
reactions.</p>

<p>Table 1 lists adverse experiences which were reported for Certrizine
5 and 10 mg in controlled clinical trials in the United States and that
were more common with Certrizine than placebo.</p>

elevated bilirubin has been reported.</p>

<p>In foreign marketing experience the following additional rare, but potential
severe adverse events have been reported: hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia,
orofacial dyskinesia, severe hypotension, anaphylaxis, hepatitis, glomerulonephritis,
stillbirth, and cholestasis.</p>

<p>DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE </p>

<p>There is no information to indicate that abuse or dependency occurs
with Certrizine.</p>

<p><a name="OVERDOSAGE"></a><b>OVERDOSAGE </b></p>

<p>Overdosage has been reported with Certrizine. In one patient who took
150 mg of Certrizine, the patient was somnolent but did not display any
other clinical signs or abnormal blood chemistry or hematology results.
Should overdose occur, treatment should be symptomatic or supportive, taking
into account any concomitantly ingested medications. There is no known
specific antidote to Certrizine. Certrizine is not effectively removed
by dialysis, and dialysis will be ineffective unless a dialyzable agent
has been concomitantly ingested. The minimal lethal oral dose in rodents
is approximately 100 times the maximum recommended clinical dose on a mg/m2
basis and the liver is the target organ of toxicity.</p>

<p><a name="DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION"></a><b>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
</b></p>

<p>The recommended initial dose of Certrizine is 5 or 10 mg per day in
adults and children 12 years and older, depending on symptom severity. {As of 
October 1996, indicated in children 6-11 years of age.  Syrup now available. See full prescribing information for details} 
Most patients in clinical trials started at 10 mg. Certrizine is given
as a single daily dose, with or without food. The time of administration
may be varied to suit individual patient needs. </p>

<p>In patients with decreased renal function (creatinine clearance 11-31
mL/min), patients on hemodialysis (creatinine clearance less than 7 mL/min),
and in hepatically impaired patients, a dose of 5 mg once daily is recommended.

<p>USE IN PREGNANCY </p>

<p>WHEN USED IN PREGNANCY DURING THE SECOND AND THIRD TRIMESTERS, ACE INHIBITORS
CAN CAUSE INJURY AND EVEN DEATH TO THE DEVELOPING FETUS. </p>

<p>When pregnancy is detected, Fosinopril should be discontinued as soon
as possible. SEE WARNINGS: FETAL/NEONATAL MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY. </p>

<p>Fosinopril (the sodium salt) is the ester prodrug of an angiotensin
converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, fosinoprilat. It contains a phosphinate
group capable of specific binding to the active site of angiotensin converting
enzyme. Fosinopril sodium is designated chemically as: L proline, 4-cyclohexyl-1-(((2-methyl-1-(1-oxopropoxy)
propoxy)(4-phenylbutyl) phosphinyl)acetyl)-, sodium salt, Trans-. </p>

<p>Fosinopril sodium is a white to off-white crystalline powder. It is
soluble in water (100 mg/mL), methanol, and ethanol and slightly soluble
in hexane. </p>

<p>Its empiric formula is C30H45NNaO7P, and its molecular weight is 585.65.
</p>

<p><a name="ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY"></a><b>ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
</b></p>

<p>MECHANISM OF ACTION </p>

<p>In animals and humans, fosinopril sodium is hydrolyzed by esterases
to the pharmacologically active form, fosinoprilat, a specific competitive
inhibitor of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE). </p>

<p>ACE is a peptidyl dipeptidase that catalyzes the conversion of angiotensin
I to the vasoconstrictor substance, angiotensin II. Angiotensin II also
stimulates aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex. Inhibition of ACE
results in decreased plasma angiotensin II, which leads to decreased vasopressor
activity and to decreased aldosterone secretion. The latter decrease may
result in a small increase of serum potassium. </p>

<p>In 647 hypertensive patients treated with fosinopril alone for an average
of 29 weeks, mean increases in serum potassium of 0.1 mEq/L were observed.
Similar increases were observed among all patients treated with fosinopril,
including those receiving concomitant diuretic therapy. Removal of angiotensin
II negative feedback on renin secretion leads to increased plasma renin
activity. </p>

<p>ACE is identical to kininase, an enzyme that degrades bradykinin. Whether
increased levels of bradykinin, a potent vasodepressor peptide, play a
role in the therapeutic effects of Fosinopril remains to be elucidated.
</p>

<p>While the mechanism through which Fosinopril lowers blood pressure is
believed to be primarily suppression of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone
system, Fosinopril has an antihypertensive effect even in patients with
low-renin hypertension. Although Fosinopril was antihypertensive in all
races studied, black hypertensive patients (usually a low-renin hypertensive
population) had a smaller average response to ACE inhibitor monotherapy
than non-black patients. </p>

<p>PHARMACOKINETICS AND METABOLISM </p>

<p>Following oral administration, fosinopril (the prodrug) is absorbed
slowly. The absolute absorption of fosinopril averaged 36% of an oral dose.
The primary site of absorption is the proximal small intestine (duodenum/jejunum).
While the rate of absorption may be slowed by the presence of food in the
gastrointestinal tract, the extent of absorption of fosinopril is essentially
unaffected. </p>

<p>Fosinoprilat is highly protein-bound (&gt;/=95%), has a relatively small
volume of distribution, and has negligible binding to cellular components
in blood. After single and multiple oral doses, plasma levels, areas under
plasma concentration time curves (AUCs) and peak concentrations (Cmaxs)
are directly proportional to the dose of fosinopril. Times to peak concentrations
are independent of dose and are achieved in approximately 3 hours. </p>

<p>After an oral dose of radiolabeled fosinopril, 75% of radioactivity
in plasma was present as active fosinoprilat, 20-30% as a glucuronide conjugate
of fosinoprilat, and 1-5% as a P-hydroxy metabolite of fosinoprilat. Since
fosinoprilat is not biotransformed after intravenous administration, fosinopril
not fosinoprilat, appears to be the precursor for the glucuronide and P
hydroxy metabolites. In rats, the P-hydroxy metabolite of fosinoprilat
is as potent an inhibitor of ACE as fosinoprilat; the glucuronide conjugate
is devoid of ACE inhibitory activity. </p>

<p>After intravenous administration, fosinoprilat was eliminated approximately
equally by the liver and kidney. After oral administration of radiolabeled
fosinopril, approximately half of the absorbed dose is excreted in the
urine and the remainder is excreted in the feces. In two studies involving
healthy subjects, the mean body clearance of intravenous fosinoprilat was
between 26 and 39 mL/min. </p>

<p>In healthy subjects, the terminal elimination half-life (t1/2) of an
intravenous dose of radiolabeled fosinoprilat is approximately 12 hours.
In hypertensive patients with normal renal and hepatic function, who received
repeated doses of fosinopril, the effective t1/2 for accumulation of fosinoprilat
averaged 11.5 hours. </p>

<p>In Patients With Renal Insufficiency (creatinine clearance &lt;80 mL/min/1.73M(square)),
the total body clearance of fosinoprilat is approximately one-half of that
in patients with normal renal function, while absorption, bioavailability,
and protein-binding are not appreciably altered. The clearance of fosinoprilat
does not differ appreciably with degree of renal insufficiency, because
the diminished renal elimination is offset by increased hepatobiliary elimination.
A modest increase in plasma AUC levels (less than two times that in normals)
was observed in patients with various degrees of renal insufficiency, including
end-stage renal failure (creatinine clearance &lt;10 mL/min/1.73M(square)).
(See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION.) </p>

<p>Fosinopril is not well dialyzed. Clearance of fosinoprilat by hemodialysis
and peritoneal dialysis averages 2% and 7%, respectively, of urea clearances.
</p>

<p>In Patients With Hepatic Insufficiency (Alcoholic Or Biliary Cirrhosis),
the extent of hydrolysis of fosinopril is not appreciably reduced, although
the rate of hydrolysis may be slowed; the apparent total body clearance
of fosinoprilat is approximately one-half of that in patients with normal
hepatic function. </p>

<p>In Elderly (Male) Subjects (65-74 years old) with clinically normal
renal and hepatic function, there appear to be no significant differences
in pharmacokinetic parameters for fosinoprilat compared to those of younger
subjects (20-35 years old). </p>

<p>Fosinoprilat was found to cross the placenta of pregnant animals. </p>

<p>Studies in animals indicate that fosinopril and fosinoprilat do not
cross the blood-brain barrier. </p>

<p>PHARMACODYNAMICS AND CLINICAL EFFECTS </p>

<p>Serum ACE activity was inhibited by &gt;/=90% at 2 to 12 hours after
single doses of 10 to 40 mg of fosinopril. At 24 hours, serum ACE activity
remained suppressed by 85%, 93%, and 93% in the 10, 20, and 40 mg dose
groups, respectively. </p>

<p>Administration of Fosinopril to patients with mild to moderate hypertension
results in a reduction of both supine and standing blood pressure to about
the same extent with no compensatory tachycardia. Symptomatic postural
hypotension is infrequent, although it can occur in patients who are salt-and/or
volume-depleted (see WARNINGS). Use of Fosinopril in combination with thiazide
diuretics gives a blood pressure-lowering effect greater than that seen
with either agent alone. </p>

<p>Following oral administration of single doses of 10-40 mg, Fosinopril
lowered blood pressure within one hour, with peak reductions achieved 2-6
hours after dosing. The antihypertensive effect of a single dose persisted
for 24 hours. Following four weeks of monotherapy in placebo-controlled
trials in patients with mild to moderate hypertension, once daily doses
of 20-80 mg lowered supine or seated systolic and diastolic blood pressures
24 hours after dosing by an average of 8-9/6-7 mmHg more than placebo.
The trough effect was about 50-60% of the peak diastolic response and about
80% of the peak systolic response. In most trials, the antihypertensive
effect of Fosinopril increased during the first several weeks of repeated
measurements. The antihypertensive effect of Fosinopril has been shown
to continue during long-term therapy for at least 2 years. Abrupt withdrawal
of Fosinopril has not resulted in a rapid increase in blood pressure. </p>

<p>Limited experience in controlled and uncontrolled trials combining fosinopril
with a calcium channel blocker or a loop diuretic has indicated no unusual
drug drug interactions. Other ACE inhibitors have had less than additive
effects with beta-adrenergic blockers, presumably because both drugs lower
blood pressure by inhibiting parts of the renin-angiotensin system. </p>

<p>ACE inhibitors are generally less effective in blacks than in non-blacks.
The effectiveness of Fosinopril was not influenced by age, sex, or weight.
</p>

<p>In hemodynamic studies in hypertensive patients, after three months
of therapy, responses (changes in BP, heart rate, cardiac index, and PVR)
to various stimuli (e.g., isometric exercise, 45 deg head-up tilt, and
mental challenge) were unchanged compared to baseline, suggesting that
Fosinopril does not affect the activity of the sympathetic nervous system.
Reduction in systemic blood pressure appears to have been mediated by a
decrease in peripheral vascular resistance without reflex cardiac effects.
Similarly, renal, splanchnic, cerebral, and skeletal muscle blood flow
were unchanged compared to baseline, as was glomerular filtration rate.
</p>

<p><a name="INDICATIONS AND USAGE"></a><b>INDICATIONS AND USAGE </b></p>

<p>Fosinopril is indicated for the treatment of hypertension. It may be
used alone or in combination with thiazide diuretics. </p>

<p>In using Fosinopril, consideration should be given to the fact that
another angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, has caused
agranulocytosis, particularly in patients with renal impairment or collagen-vascular
disease. Available data are insufficient to show that Fosinopril does not
have a similar risk (see WARNINGS). </p>

<p><a name="CONTRAINDICATIONS"></a><b>CONTRAINDICATIONS </b></p>

<p>Fosinopril is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to
this product or to any other angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (e.g.,
a patient who has experienced angioedema with any other ACE inhibitor therapy).
</p>

<p><a name="WARNINGS"></a><b>WARNINGS </b></p>

<p>USE IN PREGNANCY </p>

<p>WHEN USED IN PREGNANCY DURING THE SECOND AND THIRD TRIMESTERS, ACE INHIBITORS
CAN CAUSE INJURY AND EVEN DEATH TO THE DEVELOPING FETUS. </p>

<p>When pregnancy is detected, Fosinopril should be discontinued as soon
as possible. SEE WARNINGS: FETAL/NEONATAL MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY. </p>

<p>ANGIOEDEMA </p>

<p>Angioedema involving the extremities, face, lips, mucous membranes,
tongue, glottis or larynx has been reported in patients treated with ACE
inhibitors. If angioedema involves the tongue, glottis or larynx, airway
obstruction may occur and be fatal. If laryngeal stridor or angioedema
of the face, lips, mucous membranes, tongue, glottis or extremities occurs,
treatment with Fosinopril should be discontinued and appropriate therapy
instituted immediately. WHERE THERE IS INVOLVEMENT OF THE TONGUE, GLOTTIS,
OR LARYNX, LIKELY TO CAUSE AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION, APPROPRIATE THERAPY, E.G.,
SUBCUTANEOUS EPINEPHRINE SOLUTION 1:1000 (0.3 mL TO 0.5 mL) SHOULD BE PROMPTLY
ADMINISTERED (see PRECAUTIONS: Information for Patients and ADVERSE REACTIONS).
</p>

<p>HYPOTENSION </p>

<p>Fosinopril can cause symptomatic hypotension. Like other ACE inhibitors,
fosinopril has been only rarely associated with hypotension in uncomplicated
hypertensive patients. Symptomatic hypotension is most likely to occur
in patients who have been volume- and/or salt-depleted as a result of prolonged
diuretic therapy, dietary salt restriction, dialysis, diarrhea, or vomiting.
Volume and/or salt depletion should be corrected before initiating therapy
with Fosinopril . </p>

<p>In patients with congestive heart failure, with or without associated
renal insufficiency, ACE inhibitor therapy may cause excessive hypotension,
which may be associated with oliguria or azotemia and, rarely, with acute
renal failure and death. In such patients, Fosinopril therapy should be
started under close medical supervision; they should be followed closely
for the first 2 weeks of treatment and whenever the dose of fosinopril
or diuretic is increased. </p>

<p>If hypotension occurs, the patient should be placed in a supine position
and, if necessary, treated with intravenous infusion of physiological saline.
Fosinopril treatment usually can be continued following restoration of
blood pressure and volume. </p>

<p>NEUTROPENIA/AGRANULOCYTOSIS </p>

<p>Another angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, has been
shown to cause agranulocytosis and bone marrow depression, rarely in uncomplicated
patients, but more frequently in patients with renal impairment, especially
if they also have a collagen-vascular disease such as systemic lupus erythematosus
or scleroderma. Available data from clinical trials of fosinopril are insufficient
to show that fosinopril does not cause agranulocytosis at similar rates.
Monitoring of white blood cell counts should be considered in patients
with collagen-vascular disease, especially if the disease is associated
with impaired renal function. </p>

<p>FETAL/NEONATAL MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY </p>

<p>ACE inhibitors can cause fetal and neonatal morbidity and death when
administered to pregnant women. Several dozen cases have been reported
in the world literature. When pregnancy is detected, ACE inhibitors should
be discontinued as soon as possible. </p>

<p>The use of ACE inhibitors during the second and third trimesters of
pregnancy has been associated with fetal and neonatal injury, including
hypotension, neonatal skull hypoplasia, anuria, reversible or irreversible
renal failure, and death. Oligohydramnios has also been reported, presumably
resulting from decreased fetal renal function; oligohydramnios in this
setting has been associated with fetal limb contractures, craniofacial
deformation, and hypoplastic lung development. Prematurity, intrauterine
growth retardation, and patent ductus arteriosus have also been reported,
although it is not clear whether these occurrences were due to the ACE-inhibitor
exposure. </p>

<p>These adverse effects do not appear to have resulted from intrauterine
ACE inhibitor exposure that has been limited to the first trimester. Mothers
whose embryos and fetuses are exposed to ACE inhibitors only during the
first trimester should be so informed. Nonetheless, when patients become
pregnant, physicians should make every effort to discontinue the use of
fosinopril as soon as possible. </p>

<p>Rarely (probably less often than once in every thousand pregnancies),
no alternative to ACE inhibitors will be found. In these rare cases, the
mothers should be apprised of the potential hazards to their fetuses, and
serial ultrasound examinations should be performed to assess the intraamniotic
environment. </p>

<p>If oligohydramnios is observed, fosinopril should be discontinued unless
it is considered life-saving for the mother. Contraction stress testing
(CST), a nonstress test (NST), or biophysical profiling (BPP) may be appropriate,
depending upon the week of pregnancy. Patients and physicians should be
aware, however, that oligohydramnios may not appear until after the fetus
has sustained irreversible injury. </p>

<p>Infants with histories of In Utero exposure to ACE inhibitors should
be closely observed for hypotension, oliguria, and hyperkalemia. If oliguria
occurs, attention should be directed toward support of blood pressure and
renal perfusion. Exchange transfusion or dialysis may be required as a
means of reversing hypotension and/or substituting for disordered renal
function. Fosinopril is poorly dialyzed from the circulation of adults
by hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis. There is no experience with any
procedure for removing fosinopril from the neonatal circulation. </p>

<p>When fosinopril was given to pregnant rats at doses about 80 to 250
times (on a mg/kg basis) the maximum recommended human dose, three similar
orofacial malformations and one fetus with Situs Inversus were observed
among the offspring. No teratogenic effects of fosinopril were seen in
studies in pregnant rabbits at doses up to 25 times (on a mg/kg basis)
the maximum recommended human dose. </p>

<p><a name="PRECAUTIONS"></a><b>PRECAUTIONS </b></p>

<p>GENERAL </p>

<p>Impaired Renal Function: As a consequence of inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-
aldosterone system, changes in renal function may be anticipated in susceptible
individuals. In patients with severe congestive heart failure whose renal
function may depend on the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone
system treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, including
Fosinopril , may be associated with oliguria and/or progressive azotemia
and (rarely) with acute renal failure and/or death. </p>

<p>In hypertensive patients with renal artery stenosis in a solitary kidney
or bilateral renal artery stenosis, increases in blood urea nitrogen and
serum creatinine may occur. Experience with another angiotensin converting
enzyme inhibitor suggests that these increases are usually reversible upon
discontinuation of ACE inhibitor and/or diuretic therapy. In such patients,
renal function should be monitored during the first few weeks of therapy.
Some hypertensive patients with no apparent pre-existing renal vascular
disease have developed increases in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine,
usually minor and transient, especially when Fosinopril has been given
concomitantly with a diuretic. This is more likely to occur in patients
with pre-existing renal impairment. Dosage reduction of Fosinopril and/or
discontinuation of the diuretic may be required. </p>

<p>EVALUATION OF THE HYPERTENSIVE PATIENT SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE ASSESSMENT
OF RENAL FUNCTION (SEE DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). </p>

<p>Impaired renal function decreases total clearance of fosinoprilat and
approximately doubles AUC. In general, however, no adjustment of dosing
is needed (see ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY). </p>

<p>Hyperkalemia: In clinical trials, hyperkalemia (serum potassium greater
than 10% above the upper limit of normal) has occurred in approximately
2.6% of hypertensive patients receiving Fosinopril. In most cases, these
were isolated values which resolved despite continued therapy. In clinical
trials, 0.1% of patients (two patients) were discontinued from therapy
due to an elevated serum potassium. Risk factors for the development of
hyperkalemia include renal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus, and the concomitant
use of potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, and/or potassium-containing
salt substitutes, which should be used cautiously, if at all, with Fosinopril
(see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions). </p>

<p>Cough: Cough has been reported with the use of ACE inhibitors. Characteristically,
the cough is nonproductive, persistent, and resolves after discontinuation
of therapy. ACE inhibitor-induced cough should be considered as part of
the differential diagnosis of cough. </p>

<p>Impaired Liver Function: Since fosinopril is primarily metabolized by
hepatic and gut wall esterases to its active moiety, fosinoprilat, patients
with impaired liver function could develop elevated plasma levels of unchanged
fosinopril. In a study in patients with alcoholic or biliary cirrhosis,
the extent of hydrolysis was unaffected, although the rate was slowed.
In these patients, the apparent total body clearance of fosinoprilat was
decreased and the plasma AUC approximately doubled. </p>

<p>Surgery/Anesthesia: In patients undergoing surgery or during anesthesia
with agents that produce hypotension, fosinopril will block the angiotensin
II formation that could otherwise occur secondary to compensatory renin
release. Hypotension that occurs as a result of this mechanism can be corrected
by volume expansion. </p>

<p>HERMODIALYSIS </p>

<p>Recent clinical observations have shown an association of hypersensitivity
like (anaphylactoid) reactions during hemodialysis with high-flux dialysis
membranes (e.g., AN69) in patients receiving ACE inhibitors. In these patients
consideration should be given to using a different type of dialysis membrane
or a different class of medication. </p>

<p>INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS </p>

<p>Angioedema: Angioedema, including laryngeal edema, can occur with treatment
with ACE inhibitors, especially following the first dose. Patients should
be advised to immediately report to their physician any signs or symptoms
suggesting angioedema (e.g., swelling of face, eyes, lips, tongue, larynx,
mucous membranes, and extremities; difficulty in swallowing or breathing;
hoarseness) and to discontinue therapy. (See WARNINGS and ADVERSE REACTIONS.)
</p>

<p>Symptomatic Hypotension: Patients should be cautioned that lightheadedness
can occur, especially during the first days of therapy, and it should be
reported to a physician. Patients should be told that if syncope occurs,
Fosinopril should be discontinued until the physician has been consulted.
</p>

<p>All patients should be cautioned that inadequate fluid intake or excessive
perspiration, diarrhea, or vomiting can lead to an excessive fall in blood
pressure, with the same consequences of lightheadedness and possible syncope.
</p>

<p>Hyperkalemia: Patients should be told not to use potassium supplements
or salt substitutes containing potassium without consulting the physician.
</p>

<p>Neutropenia: Patients should be told to promptly report any indication
of infection (e.g., sore throat, fever), which could be a sign of neutropenia.
</p>

<p>PREGNANCY: Female patients of childbearing age should be told about
the consequences of second- and third-trimester exposure to ACE inhibitors,
and they should also be told that these consequences do not appear to have
resulted from intrauterine ACE-inhibitor exposure that has been limited
to the first trimester. These patients should be asked to report pregnancies
to their physicians as soon as possible. </p>

<p>DRUG INTERACTIONS </p>

<p>With Diuretics: Patients on diuretics, especially those with intravascular
volume depletion, may occasionally experience an excessive reduction of
blood pressure after initiation of therapy with Fosinopril. The possibility
of hypotensive effects with Fosinopril can be minimized by either discontinuing
the diuretic or increasing salt intake prior to initiation of treatment
with Fosinopril. If this is not possible, the starting dose should be reduced
and the patient should be observed closely for several hours following
an initial dose and until blood pressure has stabilized (see DOSAGE AND
ADMINISTRATION). </p>

<p>With Potassium Supplements And Potassium-Sparing Diuretics: Fosinopril
can attenuate potassium loss caused by thiazide diuretics. Potassium-sparing
diuretics (spironolactone, amiloride, triamterene, and others) or potassium
supplements can increase the risk of hyperkalemia. Therefore, if concomitant
use of such agents is indicated, they should be given with caution, and
the patient's serum potassium should be monitored frequently. </p>

<p>With Lithium: Increased serum lithium levels and symptoms of lithium
toxicity have been reported in patients receiving ACE inhibitors during
therapy with lithium. These drugs should be coadministered with caution,
and frequent monitoring of serum lithium levels is recommended. If a diuretic
is also used, the risk of lithium toxicity may be increased. </p>

<p>With Antacids: In a clinical pharmacology study, coadministration of
an antacid (aluminum hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, and simethicone) with
fosinopril reduced serum levels and urinary excretion of fosinoprilat as
compared with fosinopril administrated alone, suggesting that antacids
may impair absorption of fosinopril. Therefore, if concomitant administration
of these agents is indicated, dosing should be separated by 2 hours. </p>

<p>Other: Neither Fosinopril nor its metabolites have been found to interact
with food. In separate single or multiple dose pharmacokinetic interaction
studies with chlorthalidone, nifedipine, propranolol, hydrochlorothiazide,
cimetidine, metoclopramide, propantheline, digoxin, and warfarin, the bioavailability
of fosinoprilat was not altered by coadministration of fosinopril with
any one of these drugs. In a study with concomitant administration of aspirin
and Fosinopril , the bioavailability of unbound fosinoprilat was not altered.
</p>

<p>In a pharmacokinetic interaction study with warfarin, bioavailability
parameters, the degree of protein binding, and the anticoagulant effect
(measured by prothrombin time) of warfarin were not significantly changed.
</p>

<p>DRUG/LABORATORY TEST INTERACTION </p>

<p>Fosinopril may cause a false low measurement of serum digoxin levels
with the Digi-Tab RIA Kit for Digoxin. Other kits, such as the Coat-A-Count
RIA Kit, may be used. </p>

<p>CARCINOGENESIS, MUTAGENESIS, AND IMPAIRMENT OF FERTILITY </p>

<p>No evidence of a carcinogenic effect was found when fosinopril was given
in the diet to mice and rats for up to 24 months at doses up to 400 mg/kg/day.
On a body weight basis, the highest dose in mice and rats is about 250
times the maximum human dose of 80 mg, assuming a 50 kg subject. On a body
surface area basis, in mice, this dose is 20 times the maximum human dose;
in rats, this dose is 40 times the maximum human dose. Male rats given
the highest dose level had a slightly higher incidence of mesentery/omentum
lipomas. </p>

<p>Neither fosinopril nor the active fosinoprilat was mutagenic in the
Ames microbial mutagen test, the mouse lymphoma forward mutation assay,
or a mitotic gene conversion assay. Fosinopril was also not genotoxic in
a mouse micronucleus test In Vivo and a mouse bone marrow cytogenetic assay
In Vivo. </p>

<p>In the Chinese hamster ovary cell cytogenetic assay, fosinopril increased
the frequency of chromosomal aberrations when tested without metabolic
activation at a concentration that was toxic to the cells. However, there
was no increase in chromosomal aberrations at lower drug concentrations
without metabolic activation or at any concentration with metabolic activation.
</p>

<p>There were no adverse reproductive effects in male and female rats treated
with 15 or 60 mg/kg daily. On a body weight basis, the high dose of 60
mg/kg is about 38 times the maximum recommended human dose. On a body surface
area basis this dose is 6 times the maximum recommended human dose. There
was no effect on pairing time prior to mating in rats until a daily dose
of 240 mg/kg, a toxic dose, was given; at this dose, a slight increase
in pairing time was observed. On a body weight basis, this dose is 150
times the maximum recommended human dose. On a body surface area basis,
this dose is 24 times the maximum recommended human dose. </p>

No overall differences in effectiveness or safety were observed between
these patients and younger patients, and other reported clinical experience
has not identified differences in response between the elderly and younger
patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled
out. </p>

<p>In a pharmacokinetic study comparing elderly (65-74 years old) and non-elderly

<p>Fosinopril has been evaluated for safety in more than 1500 individuals
in hypertension trials, including approximately 450 patients treated for
a year or more. Generally adverse events were mild and transient, and their
frequency was not prominently related to dose within the recommended daily
dosage range. </p>

<p>In placebo-controlled clinical trials (688 fosinopril-treated patients),
the usual duration of therapy was two to three months. Discontinuations
due to any clinical or laboratory adverse event were 4.1 and 1.1 percent
in fosinopril- treated and placebo-treated patients, respectively. The
most frequent reasons (0.4 to 0.9%) were headache, elevated transaminases,
fatigue, cough (See PRECAUTIONS: General, Cough), diarrhea, and nausea
and vomiting. </p>

<p>Urogenital: Renal insufficiency, urinary frequency. </p>

<p>FETAL/NEONATAL MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY </p>

<p>SEE WARNINGS: FETAL/NEONATAL MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY. </p>

<p>POTENTIAL ADVERSE EFFECTS REPORTED WITH ACE INHIBITORS </p>

<p>BODY AS A WHOLE: ANAPHYLACTOID REACTIONS (SEE PRECAUTIONS: HEMODIALYSIS).
</p>

<p>Other medically important adverse effects reported with ACE inhibitors
include: Cardiac arrest; eosinophilic pneumonitis; neutropenia/agranulocytosis,
pancytopenia, anemia (including hemolytic and aplastic), thrombocytopenia;
acute renal failure; hepatic failure, jaundice (hepatocellular or cholestatic);
symptomatic hyponatremia; bullous pemphigus, exfoliative dermatitis; a
syndrome which may include: arthralgia/arthritis, vasculitis, serositis,
myalgia, fever, rash or other dermatologic manifestations, a positive ANA,
leukocytosis, eosinophilia, or an elevated ESR. </p>

<p>LABORATORY TEST ABNORMALITIES </p>

<p>Serum Electrolytes: Hyperkalemia, (see PRECAUTIONS); Hyponatremia, (see
PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions, With diuretics). </p>

<p>BUN/Serum Creatinine: Elevations, usually transient and minor, of BUN
or serum creatinine have been observed. In placebo-controlled clinical
trials, there were no significant differences in the number of patients
experiencing increases in serum creatinine (outside the normal range or
1.33 times the pre treatment value) between the fosinopril and placebo
treatment groups. Rapid reduction of longstanding or markedly elevated
blood pressure by any antihypertensive therapy can result in decreases
in the glomerular filtration rate and, in turn, lead to increases in BUN
or serum creatinine. (See PRECAUTIONS: General.) </p>

<p>Hematology: In controlled trials, a mean Hemoglobin decrease of 0.1
g/dL was observed in fosinopril-treated patients. In individual patients
decreases in hemoglobin or hematocrit were usually transient, small, and
not associated with symptoms. No patient was discontinued from therapy
due to the development of anemia. Other: Neutropenia (see WARNINGS), leukopenia
and eosinophilia. </p>

<p>Liver Function Tests: Elevations of transaminases, LDH, alkaline phosphatase
and serum bilirubin have been reported. Fosinopril therapy was discontinued
because of serum transaminase elevations in 0.7% of patients. In the majority
of cases, the abnormalities were either present at baseline or were associated
with other etiologic factors. In those cases which were possibly related
to fosinopril therapy, the elevations were generally mild and transient
and resolved after discontinuation of therapy. </p>

<p><a name="OVERDOSAGE"></a><b>OVERDOSAGE </b></p>

<p>Oral doses of fosinopril at 2600 mg/kg in rats were assocaited with
significant lethality. Human overdoses of fosinopril have not been reported,
but the most common manifestation of human fosinopril overdosage is likely
to be hypotension. </p>

<p>Laboratory determinations of serum levels of fosinoprilat and its metabolites
are not widely available, and such determinations have, in any event, no
established role in the management of fosinopril overdose. No data are
available to suggest physiological maneuvers (e.g., maneuvers to change
the pH of the urine) that might accelerate elimination of fosinopril and
its metabolites. Fosinoprilat is poorly removed from the body by both hemodialysis
and peritoneal dialysis. </p>

<p>Angiotensin II could presumably serve as a specific antagonist-antidote
in the setting of fosinopril overdose, but angiotensin II is essentially
unavailable outside of scattered research facilities. Because the hypotensive
effect of fosinopril is achieved through vasodilation and effective hypovolemia,
it is reasonable to treat fosinopril overdose by infusion of normal saline
solution. </p>

<p><a name="DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION"></a><b>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
</b></p>

<p>The recommended initial dose of Fosinopril is 10 mg once a day, both
as monotherapy and when the drug is added to a diuretic. Dosage should
then be adjusted according to blood pressure response at peak (2-6 hours)
and trough (about 24 hours after dosing) blood levels. The usual dosage
range needed to maintain a response at trough is 20-40 mg but some patients
appear to have a further response to 80 mg. In some patients treated with
once daily dosing, the antihypertensive effect may diminish toward the
end of the dosing interval. If trough response is inadequate, dividing
the daily dose should be considered. If blood pressure is not adequately
controlled with Fosinopril alone, a diuretic may be added. </p>

<p>Concomitant administration of Fosinopril with potassium supplements,
potassium salt substitutes, or potassium-sparing diuretics can lead to
increases of serum potassium (see PRECAUTIONS). </p>

<p>In patients who are currently being treated with a diuretic, symptomatic
hypotension occasionally can occur following the initial dose of Fosinopril.
To reduce the likelihood of hypotension, the diuretic should, if possible,
be discontinued two to three days prior to beginning therapy with Fosinopril
(see WARNINGS). Then, if blood pressure is not controlled with Fosinopril
alone, diuretic therapy should be resumed. If diuretic therapy cannot be
discontinued, an initial dose of 10 mg of Fosinopril should be used with
careful medical supervision for several hours and until blood pressure
has stabilized. (See WARNINGS; PRECAUTIONS: Information for Patients and
Drug Interactions.) </p>

<p>Since concomitant administration of Fosinopril with potassium supplements,
or potassium-containing salt substitutes or potassium-sparing diuretics
may lead to increases in serum potassium, they should be used with caution.
</p>

<p>For Hypertensive Patients With Renal Impairment: In patients with impaired
renal function, the total body clearance of fosinoprilat is approximately
50% slower than in patients with normal renal function. Since hepatobiliary
elimination partially compensates for diminished renal elimination, the
total body clearance of fosinoprilat does not differ appreciably with any
degree of renal insufficiency (creatinine clearances &lt; 80 mL/min/1.73M(square)),
including end-stage renal failure (creatinine clearance &lt; 10 mL/min/1.73M(square)).
This relative constancy of body clearance of active fosinoprilat, resulting
from the dual route of elimination, permits use of the usual dose in patients
with any degree of renal impairment. (See also PRECAUTIONS: Hemodialysis.)

<p><a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><b>DESCRIPTION </b></p>

<p>FOR ORAL INHALATION ONLY </p>

<p>Triamcinolone acetonide, USP, the active ingredient in Triamcinolone
Oral Inhaler is a glucocorticosteroid with a molecular weight of 434.5
and with the chemical designation 9-Fluoro-11beta,16alpha,17,21-tetrahydroxypregna-1,4
diene-3,20- dione cyclic 16,17-acetal with acetone.(C24H31FO6) </p>

<p>Triamcinolone Oral Inhaler is a metered-dose aerosol unit containing
a microcrystalline suspension of triamcinolone acetonide in the propellant
dichlorodifluoromethane and dehydrated alcohol USP 1% w/w. Each canister
contains 60 mg triamcinolone acetonide. Each actuation releases approximately
200 mcg triamcinolone acetonide, of which approximately 100 mcg are delivered
from the unit (In-Vitro Testing). There are at least 240 actuations in
one Triamcinolone aerosol canister. After 240 actuations, the amount delivered
per actuation may not be consistent and the unit should be discarded. </p>

<p><a name="ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY"></a><b>ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
</b></p>

<p>The precise mechanism of the action of the inhaled drug is unknown.
However, use of the inhaler makes it possible to provide effective local
steroid activity with minimal systemic effect. </p>

<p>Triamcinolone acetonide is a more potent derivative of triamcinolone.
Although triamcinolone itself is approximately one to two times as potent
as prednisone in animal models of inflammation, triamcinolone acetonide
is approximately 8 times more potent than prednisone. </p>

<p>Pharmacokinetic studies with radiolabeled triamcinolone acetonide have
been carried out by the oral route and intravenous route in several species.
The pharmacokinetic behavior of the triamcinolone acetonide was similar
in all species within each route of administration. The major portion of
the dose was eliminated in the feces irrespective of route of administration
with only one species (rabbit) showing significant urinary excretion of
radioactivity. </p>

<p>The results of studies in which triamcinolone acetonide was administered
as an aerosol showed rapid disappearance of radioactivity from the lungs
comparable to that observed following oral administration with peak blood
levels occurring in one to two hours. Virtually no radioactivity was present
in the lung and trachea 24 hours after dosing. </p>

<p>Based upon intravenous dosing of triamicinolone acetonide phosphate
ester, the half-life of triamcinolone acetonide was reported to be 88 minutes.
The volume of distribution (Vd) reported was 99.5 L (SD+/-27.5) and clearance
was 45.2 L/hour (SD+/-9.1) for triamcinolone acetonide. The plasma half-life
of corticoids does not correlate well with the biologic half-life. </p>

<p>Three metabolites of triamcinolone acetonide have been identified. They
are 6beta-hydroxytriamcinolone acetonide, 21-carboxytriamcinolone acetonide
and 21- carboxy-6beta-hydroxytriamcinolone acetonide. All three metabolites
are expected to be substantially less active than the parent compound due
to (a)the dependence of anti-inflammatory activity on the presence of a
21-hydroxyl group (b)the decreased activity observed upon 6-hydroxylation,
and (c)the markedly increased water solubility favoring rapid elimination.
There appeared to be some quantitative differences in the metabolites among
species. No differences were detected in metabolic pattern as a function
of route of administration. </p>

<p><a name="INDICATIONS AND USAGE"></a><b>INDICATIONS AND USAGE </b></p>

<p>Triamcinolone Oral Inhaler is indicated only for patients who require
chronic treatment with corticosteroids for the control of the symptoms
of bronchial asthma. Such patients would include those already receiving
systemic corticosteroids and selected patients who are inadequately controlled
on a non steroid regimen and in whom steroid therapy has been withheld
because of concern over potential adverse effects. </p>

<p>Triamcinolone Oral Inhaler is NOT indicated: </p>

<p>1. For relief of asthma which can be controlled by bronchodilators and
other non-steroid medications. </p>

<p>2. In patients who require systemic corticosteroid treatment infrequently.
</p>

<p>3. In the treatment of non-asthmatic bronchitis. </p>

<p><a name="CONTRAINDICATIONS"></a><b>CONTRAINDICATIONS </b></p>

<p>Triamcinolone Oral Inhaler is contraindicated in the primary treatment
of status asthmaticus or other acute episodes of asthma where intensive
measures are required. </p>

<p>Hypersensitivity to any of the ingredients of this preparation contraindicates
its use. </p>

<p><a name="WARNINGS"></a><b>WARNINGS </b></p>

<p>Particular care is needed in patients who are transferred from systemically
active corticosteroids to Triamcinolone Oral Inhaler because deaths due
to adrenal insufficiency have occurred in asthmatic patients during and
after transfer from systemic corticosteroids to aerosolized steroids in
recommended doses. After withdrawal from systemic corticosteroids, a number
of months is usually required for recovery of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal
(HPA) function. For some patients who have received large doses of oral
steroids for long periods of time before therapy with Triamcinolone Oral
Inhaler is initiated, recovery may be delayed for one year or longer. During
this period of HPA suppression, patients may exhibit signs and symptoms
of adrenal insufficiency when exposed to trauma, surgery or infections,
particularly gastroenteritis or other conditions with acute electrolyte
loss. Although Triamcinolone Oral Inhaler may provide control of asthmatic
symptoms during these episodes, in recommended doses it supplies only normal
physiological amounts of corticosteroid systemically and does NOT provide
the increased systemic steroid which is necessary for coping with these
emergencies. </p>

<p>During periods of stress or a severe asthmatic attack, patients who
have been recently withdrawn from systemic corticosteroids should be instructed
to resume systemic steroids (in large doses) immediately and to contact
their physician for further instruction. These patients should also be
instructed to carry a warning card indicating that they may need supplementary
systemic steroids during periods of stress or a severe asthma attack. </p>

<p>Localized infections with Candida Albicans have occurred infrequently
in the mouth and pharynx. These areas should be examined by the treating
physician at each patient visit. The percentage of positive mouth and throat
cultures for Candida Albicans did not change during a year of continuous
therapy. The incidence of clinically apparent infection is low (2.5%).
These infections may disappear spontaneously or may require treatment with
appropriate antifungal therapy or discontinuance of treatment with Triamcinolone
Oral Inhaler. </p>

<p>Children who are on immunosuppressant drugs are more susceptible to
infections than healthy children. Chickenpox and measles, for example,
can have a more serious or even fatal course in children on immunosuppressant
doses of corticosteroids. In such children, or in adults who have not had
these diseases particular care should be taken to avoid exposure. If exposed,
therapy with varicella zoster immune globulin (VZIG) or pooled intravenous
immunoglobulin (IVIG), as appropriate, may be indicated. If chickenpox
develops, treatment with antiviral agents may be considered. </p>

<p>Triamcinolone Oral Inhaler is not to be regarded as a bronchodilator
and is not indicated for rapid relief of bronchospasm. </p>

<p>Patients should be instructed to contact their physician immediately
when episodes of asthma which are not responsive to bronchodilators occur
during the course of treatment with Triamcinolone Oral Inhaler. During
such episodes, patients may require therapy with systemic corticosteroids.
</p>

<p>There is no evidence that control of asthma can be achieved by the administration
of Triamcinolone Oral Inhaler in amounts greater than the recommended doses,
which appear to be the therapeutic equivalent of approximately 10 mg/day
of oral prednisone. </p>

<p>The use of Triamcinolone Oral Inhaler with alternate-day systemic prednisone
could increase the likelihood of HPA suppression compared to a therapeutic
dose of either one alone. Therefore, Triamcinolone Oral Inhaler should
be used with caution in patients already receiving alternate-day prednisone
treatment for any disease. </p>

<p>Transfer of patients from systemic steroid therapy to Triamcinolone
Oral Inhaler may unmask allergic conditions previously suppressed by the
systemic steroid therapy, e.g., rhinitis, conjunctivitis, and eczema. </p>

<p><a name="PRECAUTIONS"></a><b>PRECAUTIONS </b></p>

<p>During withdrawal from oral steroids, some patients may experience symptoms
of systemically active steroid withdrawal, e.g., joint and/or muscular
pain, lassitude and depression, despite maintenance or even improvement
of respiratory function (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION for details). Although
steroid withdrawal effects are usually transient and not severe, severe
and even fatal exacerbation of asthma can occur if the previous daily oral
corticosteroid requirement had significantly exceeded 10 mg/day of prednisone
or equivalent. </p>

<p>In responsive patients, inhaled corticosteroids will often permit control
of asthmatic symptoms with less suppression of HPA function than therapeutically
equivalent oral doses of prednisone. Since triamcinolone acetonide is absorbed
into the circulation and can be systemically active, the beneficial effects
of Triamcinolone Oral Inhaler in minimizing or preventing HPA dysfunction
may be expected only when recommended dosages are not exceeded. </p>

<p>Suppression of HPA function has been reported in volunteers who received
4000 mcg daily of triamcinolone acetonide. In addition, suppression of
HPA function has been reported in some patients who have received recommended
doses for as little as 6-12 weeks. Since the response of HPA function to
inhaled corticosteroids is highly individualized, the physician should
consider this information when treating patients. </p>

<p>Because of the possibility of systemic absorption of inhaled corticosteroids,
patients treated with these drugs should be observed carefully for any
evidence of systemic corticosteroid effects including suppression of growth
in children. Particular care should be taken in observing patients post-operatively
or during periods of stress for evidence of a decrease in adrenal function.
</p>

<p>The long-term effects of triamcinolone acetonide inhaler in human subjects
are not completely known, although patients have received Triamcinolone
Oral Inhaler on a continuous basis for periods of two years or longer.
While there has been no clinical evidence of adverse experiences, the local
effects of the agent on developmental or immunologic processes in the mouth,
pharynx, trachea and lung are also unknown. </p>

<p>Triamcinolone Oral Inhaler should be used with caution, if at all, in
patients with active or quiescent tuberculous infections of the respiratory
tract or in patients with untreated fungal, bacterial, or systemic viral
infections or ocular herpes simplex. The potential effects of long-term
administration of Triamcinolone Oral Inhaler on lung or other tissues are
unknown. However, pulmonary infiltrates with eosinophilia have occured
in patients receiving other inhaled corticosteroids. </p>

<p>When used at excessive doses, systemic corticosteroid effects such as
hypercorticism and adrenal suppression may appear. If such changes occur,
Triamcinolone Oral Inhaler should be discontinued slowly, consistent with
accepted procedures for discontinuing oral steroid therapy. </p>

<p>INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS: Patients who are on immunosuppressant doses
of corticosteroids should be warned to avoid exposure to chickenpox or
measles and if exposed, to obtain medical advice. </p>

<p>CARCINOGENESIS, MUTAGENESIS: Animal studies of triamcinolone acetonide
to test its carcinogenic potential are underway. </p>

<p>IMPAIRMENT OF FERTILITY: Male and female rats which were administered
oral triamcinolone acetonide at doses as high as 15 mcg/kg/day (110 mcg/
m(squared)/day, as calculated on a surface area basis) exhibited no evidence
of impaired fertility. The maximum human dose, for comparison, is 22.9
mcg/kg/day (889 mcg/m(squared)/day). However, a few female rats which received
maternally toxic doses of 8 or 15 mcg/kg/day (60 mcg/m(squared)/day or
110 mcg/m(squared)/ day, respectively, as calculated on a surface area
basis) exhibited dystocia and prolonged delivery. Developmental toxicity,
which included increases in fetal resorptions and stillbirths and decreases
in pup body weight and survival also occurred at the maternally toxic doses
(2.5-15.0 mcg/kg/day or 20-110 mcg/ m(squared)/day, as calculated on a
surface area basis). Reproductive performance of female rats and effects
on fetuses and offspring were comparable between groups that received placebo
and non-toxic or marginally toxic doses (0.5 and 1.0 mcg/kg/day or 3.8
mcg/m(squared)/day and 7.0 mcg/m(squared)/day). </p>

<p>PREGNANCY: Pregnancy Category C. Like other corticoids, triamcinolone
acetonide has been shown to be teratogenic in rats and rabbits. Teratogenic
effects, which occured in both species at 0.02, 0.04 and 0.08 mg/kg/day
(approximately 135, 270 and 540 mcg/m(squared)/day in the rat and 320,
640 and 1280 mcg/m(squared)/day in the rabbit, as calculated on a surface
area basis), included a low incidence of cleft palate and/or internal hydrocephaly
and axial skeletal defects. Teratogenic effects, including CNS and cranial
malformations have also been observed in non-human primates at 0.5 mg/kg/day
(approximately 6.7 mg/ m(squared)/day). Administration of aerosol by inhalation
to pregnant rats and rabbits produced embryotoxic and fetotoxic effects
which were comparable to those produced by administration by other routes.
There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Triamcinolone
acetonide should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit
justifies the potential risk to the fetus. </p>

<p>Experience with oral corticoids since their introduction in pharmacologic
as opposed to physiologic doses suggests that rodents are more prone to
teratogenic effects from corticoids than humans. In addition, because there
is a natural increase in glucocorticoid production during pregnancy, most
women will require a lower exogenous steroid dose and many will not need
corticoid treatment during pregnancy. </p>

<p>NONTERATOGENIC EFFECTS: Hypoadrenalism may occur in infants born of
mothers receiving corticosteroids during pregnancy. Such infants should
be carefully observed. </p>

<p>NURSING MOTHERS: It is not known whether triamcinolone acetonide is
excreted in human milk. Because other corticosteroids are excreted in human
milk, caution should be exercised when Triamcinolone Oral Inhaler is administered
to nursing women. </p>

<p>PEDIATRIC USES: Safety and effectiveness have not been established in
children below the age of 6. Oral corticoids have been shown to cause growth
suppression in children and teenagers, particularly with higher doses over
extended periods. If a child or teenager on any corticoid appears to have
growth suppression, the possibility that they are particularly sensitive
to this effect of steroids should be considered. </p>

<p><a name="ADVERSE REACTIONS"></a><b>ADVERSE REACTIONS </b></p>

<p>A few cases of oral candidiasis have been reported (see WARNINGS). In
addition, some patients receiving Triamcinolone Oral Inhaler have experienced
hoarseness, dry throat, irritated throat and dry mouth. Increased wheezing
and cough have been reported infrequently as has facial edema. These adverse
effects have generally been mild and transient. </p>

<p><a name="DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION"></a><font SIZE=+1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
</font></p>

<p>All patients should be instructed that the Triamcinolone Oral Inhaler
must be used on a regular daily basis rather than Prn. Reliable dosage
delivery cannot be assured after 240 actuations and patients should be
cautioned against longer use of individual canisters. </p>

<p>Good oral hygiene including rinsing of the mouth after inhalation is
recommended. </p>

<p>ADULTS: The usual dosage is two inhalations (approximately 200 mcg)
given three to four times a day. The maximal daily intake should not exceed
16 inhalations (1600 mcg) in adults. Higher initial doses (12-16 inhalations
per day) may be advisable in patients with more severe asthma, the dosage
then being adjusted downward according to the response of the patient.
In some patients maintenance can be accomplished when the total daily dose
is given on a twice a day schedule. </p>

<p>CHILDREN 6 TO 12 YEARS OF AGE: The usual dosage is one or two inhalations
(100 to 200 mcg) given three to four times a day according to the response
of the patient. The maximal daily intake should not exceed 12 inhalations
(1200 mcg) in children 6 to 12 years of age. Insufficient clinical data
exist with respect to the administration of Triamcinolone Oral Inhaler
in children below the age of 6. The long-term effects of inhaled steroids
on growth are still under evaluation. </p>

<p>Patients receiving bronchodilators by inhalation should be advised to
use the bronchodilator before Triamcinolone Oral Inhaler in order to enhance
penetration of triamcinolone acetonide into the bronchial tree. After use
of an aerosol bronchodilator, several minutes should elapse before use
of the Triamcinolone Oral Inhaler to reduce the potential toxicity from
the inhaled fluorocarbon propellants in the two aerosols. </p>

<p>DIFFERENT CONSIDERATIONS MUST BE GIVEN TO THE FOLLOWING GROUPS OF PATIENTS
IN ORDER TO OBTAIN THE FULL THERAPEUTIC BENEFIT OF Triamcinolone ORAL INHALER:
</p>

<p>PATIENTS NOT RECEIVING SYSTEMIC STEROIDS: The use of Triamcinolone Oral
Inhaler is straightforward in patients who are inadequately controlled
with non-steroid medications but in whom systemic steroid therapy has been
withheld because of concern over potential adverse reactions. In patients
who respond to Triamcinolone, an improvement in pulmonary function is usually
apparent within one to two weeks after the start of Triamcinolone Oral
Inhaler. </p>

<p>PATIENTS RECEIVING SYSTEMIC STEROIDS: In those patients dependent on
systemic steroids, transfer to Triamcinolone Oral Inhaler and subsequent
management may be more difficult because recovery from impaired adrenal
function is usually slow. Such suppression has been known to last for up
to 12 months or longer. Clinical studies, however, have demonstrated that
Triamcinolone Oral Inhaler may be effective in the management of these
asthmatic patients and may permit replacement or significant reduction
in the dosage of systemic corticosteroids. </p>

<p>The patient's asthma should be reasonably stable before treatment with
Triamcinolone Oral Inhaler is started. Initially, the inhaler should be
used concurrently with the patient's usual maintenance dose of systemic
steroid. After approximately one week, gradual withdrawal of the systemic
steroid is started by reducing the dose. The next reduction is made after
an interval of one or two weeks, depending on the response of the patient.
Generally, these decrements should not exceed 2.5 mg of prednisone or its
equivalent. A slow rate of withdrawal cannot be overemphasized. During
withdrawal, some patients may experience symptoms of systemically active
steroid withdrawal, e.g., joint and/or muscular pain, lassitude and depression,
despite maintenance or even improvement of respiratory function. Such patients
should be encouraged to continue with the inhaler but should be watched
carefully for objective signs of adrenal insufficiency, such as hypotension
and weight loss. If evidence of adrenal insufficiency occurs, the systemic
steroid dose should be boosted temporarily and thereafter further withdrawal
should continue more slowly. No clinical studies have been conducted evaluating
Triamcinolone with alternate day prednisone regimens. However, based on
the results of such a study with another inhaled corticosteroid, inhaled
corticosteroids generally are not recommended for chronic use with alternate
day prednisone regimens (see WARNINGS). </p>

<p>DURING PERIODS OF STRESS OR A SEVERE ASTHMA ATTACK, TRANSFER PATIENTS
WILL REQUIRE SUPPLEMENTARY TREATMENT WITH SYSTEMIC STEROIDS. Exacerbations
of asthma which occur during the course of treatment with Triamcinolone
Oral Inhaler should be treated with a short course of systemic steroid
which is gradually tapered as these symptoms subside. There is no evidence
that control of asthma can be achieved by administration of Triamcinolone
Oral Inhaler in amounts greater than the recommended doses. </p>

<p><a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><b>DESCRIPTION </b></p>

<p>Beclomethasone dipropionate, USP, the active component of Beclomethasone
Inhaler, is an anti-inflammatory steroid having the chemical name 9-Chloro-11beta,17,21-
trihydroxy-16beta-methylpregna-1,4-diene-3,20-dione 17,21-dipropionate.
</p>

<p><a name="ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY"></a><b>ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
</b></p>

<p>Beclomethasone 17,21-dipropionate is a diester of beclomethasone, a
synthetic corticosteroid which is chemically related to dexamethasone.
Beclomethasone differs from dexamethasone only in having a chlorine at
the 9-alpha in place of a fluorine and in having a 16beta-methyl group
instead of a 16 alpha-methyl group. Animal studies showed that beclomethasone
dipropionate has potent anti- inflammatory activity. When administered
systemically to mice, the anti- inflammatory activity was accompanied by
other typical features of glucocorticoid action including thymic involution,
liver glycogen deposition, and pituitary-adrenal suppression. However,
after systemic administration to rats, the anti-inflammatory action was
associated with little or no effect on other tests of glucocorticoid activity.
</p>

<p>Beclomethasone dipropionate is sparingly soluble and is poorly mobilized
from subcutaneous or intramuscular injection sites. However, systemic absorption
occurs after all routes of administration. When given to animals in the
form of an aerosolized suspension of the trichloromonofluoromethane clathrate,
the drug is deposited in the mouth and nasal passages, the trachea and
principal bronchi and in the lung; a considerable portion of the drug is
also swallowed. Absorption occurs rapidly from all respiratory and gastrointestinal
tissues, as indicated by the rapid clearance of radioactively labeled drug
from local tissues and appearance of tracer in the circulation. There is
no evidence of tissue storage of beclomethasone dipropionate or its metabolites.
Lung slices can metabolize beclomethasone dipropionate rapidly to beclomethasone
17 monopropionate and more slowly to free beclomethasone (which has very
weak anti inflammatory activity). However, irrespective of the route of
administration (injection, oral, or aerosol), the principal route of excretion
of the drug and its metabolites is the feces. Less than 10% of the drug
and its metabolites is excreted in the urine. In humans, 12% to 15% of
an orally administered dose of beclomethasone dipropionate was excreted
in the urine as both conjugated and free metabolites of the drug. </p>

<p>The mechanisms responsible for the anti-inflammatory action of beclomethasone
dipropionate are unknown. The precise mechanism of the aerosolized drug's
action in the lung is also unknown. </p>

<p><a name="INDICATIONS AND USAGE"></a><b>INDICATIONS AND USAGE </b></p>

<p>Beclomethasone Inhaler is indicated only for patients who require chronic
treatment with corticosteroids for control of the symptoms of bronchial
asthma. Such patients would include those already receiving systemic corticosteroids,
and selected patients who are inadequately controlled on a non-steroid
regimen and in whom steroid therapy has been withheld because of concern
over potential adverse effects. </p>

<p>Beclomethasone Inhaler is NOT indicated: </p>

<p>1. For relief of asthma which can be controlled by bronchodilators and
other non-steroid medications. </p>

<p>2. In patients who require systemic corticosteroid treatment infrequently.
</p>

<p>3. In the treatment of non-asthmatic bronchitis. </p>

<p><a name="CONTRAINDICATIONS"></a><b>CONTRAINDICATIONS </b></p>

<p>Beclomethasone Inhaler is contraindicated in the primary treatment of
status asthmaticus or other acute episodes of asthma where intensive measures
are required. </p>

<p>Hypersensitivity to any of the ingredients of this preparation contraindicates
its use. </p>

<p><a name="WARNINGS"></a><b>WARNINGS </b></p>

<p>Particular care is needed in patients who are transferred from systemically
active corticosteroids to Beclomethasone Inhaler because DEATHS DUE TO
ADRENAL INSUFFICIENCY HAVE OCCURRED IN ASTHMATIC PATIENTS DURING AND AFTER
TRANSFER FROM SYSTEMIC CORTICOSTEROIDS TO AEROSOL BECLOMETHASONE DIPROPIONATE.
After withdrawal from systemic corticosteroids, a number of months are
required for recovery of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) function.
During this period of HPA suppression, patients may exhibit signs and symptoms
of adrenal insufficiency when exposed to trauma, surgery or infections,
particularly gastroenteritis. Although Beclomethasone Inhaler may provide
control of asthmatic symptoms during these episodes, it does NOT provide
the systemic steroid which is necessary for coping with these emergencies.
</p>

<p>During periods of stress or a severe asthmatic attack, patients who
have been withdrawn from systemic corticosteroids should be instructed
to resume systemic steroids (in large doses) immediately and to contact
their physician for further instruction. These patients should also be
instructed to carry a warning card indicating that they may need supplementary
systemic steroids during periods of stress or a severe asthma attack. To
assess the risk of adrenal insufficiency in emergency situations, routine
tests of adrenal cortical function, including measurement of early morning
resting cortisol levels, should be performed periodically in all patients.
An early morning resting cortisol level may be accepted as normal only
if it falls at or near the normal mean level. </p>

<p>Localized infections with Candida Albicans or Aspergillus Niger have
occurred frequently in the mouth and pharynx and occasionally in the larynx.
Positive cultures for oral Candida may be present in up to 75% of patients.
Although the frequency of clinically apparent infection is considerably
lower, these infections may require treatment with appropriate antifungal
therapy or discontinuance of treatment with Beclomethasone Inhaler. </p>

<p>Beclomethasone Inhaler is not to be regarded as a bronchodilator and
is not indicated for rapid relief of bronchospasm. </p>

<p>Patients should be instructed to contact their physician immediately
when episodes of asthma which are not responsive to bronchodilators occur
during the course of treatment with Beclomethasone. During such episodes,
patients may require therapy with systemic corticosteroids. </p>

<p>There is no evidence that control of asthma can be achieved by the administration
of Beclomethasone in amounts greater than the recommended doses. </p>

<p>Transfer of patients from systemic steroid therapy to Beclomethasone
Inhaler may unmask allergic conditions previously suppressed by the systemic
steroid therapy, e.g., rhinitis, conjunctivitis, and eczema. </p>

<p>Persons who are on drugs which suppress the immune system are more susceptible
to infections than healthy individuals. Chickenpox and measles, for example,
can have a more serious or even fatal course in non-immune children or
adults on corticosteroids. In such children or adults who have not had
these diseases, particular care should be taken to avoid exposure. How
the dose, route and duration of corticosteroid administration affects the
risk of developing a disseminated infection is not known. The contribution
of the underlying disease and/or prior corticosteroid treatment to the
risk is also not known. If exposed to chickenpox, prophylaxis with varicella-zoster
immune globulin (VZIG) may be indicated. If exposed to measles, prophylaxis
with pooled intramuscular immunoglobulin (IG) may be indicated. (See the
respective package inserts for complete VZIG and IG prescribing information).
If chickenpox develops, treatment with antiviral agents may be considered.
</p>

<p><a name="PRECAUTIONS"></a><b>PRECAUTIONS </b></p>

<p>During withdrawal from oral steroids, some patients may experience symptoms
of systemically active steroid withdrawal, e.g., joint and/or muscular
pain, lassitude and depression, despite maintenance or even improvement
of respiratory function (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION for details). </p>

<p>In responsive patients, beclomethasone dipropionate may permit control
of asthmatic symptoms without suppression of HPA function, as discussed
below (See </p>

<p>CLINICAL STUDIES). Since beclomethasone dipropionate is absorbed into
the circulation and can be systemically active, the beneficial effects
of Beclomethasone Inhaler in minimizing or preventing HPA dysfunction may
be expected only when recommended dosages are not exceeded. </p>

<p>The long-term effects of beclomethasone dipropionate in human subjects
are still unknown. In particular, the local effects of the agent on developmental
or immunologic processes in the mouth, pharynx, trachea, and lung are unknown.
There is also no information about the possible long-term systemic effects
of the agent. </p>

<p>The potential effects of Beclomethasone on acute, recurrent, or chronic
pulmonary infections, including active or quiescent tuberculosis, are not
known. Similarly, the potential effects of long-term administration of
the drug on lung or other tissues are unknown. </p>

<p>Pulmonary infiltrates with eosinophilia may occur in patients on Beclomethasone
Inhaler therapy. Although it is possible that in some patients this state
may become manifest because of systemic steroid withdrawal when inhalational
steroids are administered, a causative role for beclomethasone dipropionate
and/or its vehicle cannot be ruled out. </p>

<p>USE IN PREGNANCY: Glucocorticoids are known teratogens in rodent species
and beclomethasone dipropionate is no exception. </p>

<p>Teratology studies were done in rats, mice, and rabbits treated with
subcutaneous beclomethasone dipropionate. Beclomethasone dipropionate was
found to produce fetal resorptions, cleft palate, agnathia, microstomia,
absence of tongue, delayed ossification and partial agenesis of the thymus.
Well controlled trials relating to fetal risk in humans are not available.
Glucocorticoids are secreted in human milk. It is not known whether beclomethasone
dipropionate would be secreted in human milk but it is safe to assume that
it is likely. The use of beclomethasone dipropionate in pregnancy, nursing
mothers, or women of childbearing potential requires that the possible
benefits of the drug be weighed against the potential hazards to the mother,
embryo, or fetus. Infants born of mothers who have received substantial
doses of corticosteroids during pregnancy should be carefully observed
for hypoadrenalism. </p>

<p>INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS: Persons who are on immunosuppressant doses
of corticosteroids should be warned to avoid exposure to chickenpox or
measles. Patients should also be advised that if they are exposed, medical
advice should be sought without delay. </p>

<p><a name="ADVERSE REACTIONS"></a><b>ADVERSE REACTIONS </b></p>

<p>DEATHS DUE TO ADRENAL INSUFFICIENCY HAVE OCCURRED IN ASTHMATIC PATIENTS
DURING AND AFTER TRANSFER FROM SYSTEMIC CORTICOSTEROIDS TO AEROSOL BECLOMETHASONE
DIPROPIONATE (SEE WARNINGS). </p>

<p>Suppression of HPA function (reduction of early morning plasma cortisol
levels) has been reported in adult patients who received 1600 mcg daily
doses of Beclomethasone for one month. A few patients on Beclomethasone
have complained of hoarseness or dry mouth. </p>

<p>Rare cases of immediate and delayed hypersensitivity reactions, including
urticaria, angioedema, rash and bronchospasm have been reported following
the oral and intranasal inhalation of beclomethasone. </p>

<p><a name="DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION"></a><b>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
</b></p>

<p>ADULTS: The usual recommended dosage is two inhalations (84 mcg) given
three or four times a day. Alternatively, four inhalations (168 mcg) given
twice daily has been shown to be effective in some patients. In patients
with severe asthma it is advisable to start with 12 to 16 inhalations a
day and adjust the dosage downward according to the response of the patient.
THE MAXIMAL DAILY INTAKE SHOULD NOT EXCEED 20 INHALATIONS, 840 MCG (0.84
MG), IN ADULTS. </p>

<p>CHILDREN 6 TO 12 YEARS OF AGE: The usual recommended dosage is one or
two inhalations (42 to 84 mcg) given three or four times a day according
to the response of the patient. Alternatively, four inhalations (168 mcg)
given twice daily has been shown to be effective in some patients. THE
MAXIMAL DAILY INTAKE SHOULD NOT EXCEED TEN INHALATIONS, 420 MCG (0.42 MG),
IN CHILDREN 6 TO 12 YEARS OF AGE. Insufficient clinical data exist with
respect to the administration of Beclomethasone Inhaler in children below
the age of 6. </p>

<p>Rinsing the mouth after inhalation is advised. </p>

<p>Patients receiving bronchodilators by inhalation should be advised to
use the bronchodilator before Beclomethasone Inhaler in order to enhance
penetration of beclomethasone dipropionate into the bronchial tree. After
use of an aerosol bronchodilator, several minutes should elapse before
use of the Beclomethasone Inhaler to reduce the potential toxicity from
the inhaled fluorocarbon propellants in the two aerosols. </p>

<p>DIFFERENT CONSIDERATIONS MUST BE GIVEN TO THE FOLLOWING GROUPS OF PATIENTS
IN ORDER TO OBTAIN THE FULL THERAPEUTIC BENEFIT OF Beclomethasone INHALER.
</p>

<p>PATIENTS NOT RECEIVING SYSTEMIC STEROIDS: The use of Beclomethasone
Inhaler is straightforward in patients who are inadequately controlled
with non-steroid medications but in whom systemic steroid therapy has been
withheld because of concern over potential adverse reactions. In patients
who respond to Beclomethasone, an improvement in pulmonary function is
usually apparent within one to four weeks after the start of Beclomethasone
Inhaler. </p>

<p>PATIENTS RECEIVING SYSTEMIC STEROIDS: In those patients dependent on
systemic steroids, transfer to Beclomethasone and subsequent management
may be more difficult because recovery from impaired adrenal function is
usually slow. Such suppression has been known to last for up to 12 months.
Clinical studies, however, have demonstrated that Beclomethasone may be
effective in the management of these asthmatic patients and may permit
replacement or significant reduction in the dosage of systemic corticosteroids.
</p>

<p>The patient's asthma should be reasonably stable before treatment with
Beclomethasone Inhaler is started. Initially, the aerosol should be used
concurrently with the patient's usual maintenance dose of systemic steroid.
After approximately one week, gradual withdrawal of the systemic steroid
is started by reducing the daily or alternate daily dose. The next reduction
is made after an interval of one or two weeks, depending on the response
of the patient. Generally, these decrements should not exceed 2.5 mg of
prednisone or its equivalent. A slow rate of withdrawal cannot be overemphasized.
During withdrawal, some patients may experience symptoms of systemically
active steroid withdrawal, e.g., joint and/or muscular pain, lassitude
and depression, despite maintenance or even improvement of respiratory
function. Such patients should be encouraged to continue with the inhaler
but should be watched carefully for objective signs of adrenal insufficiency,
such as hypotension and weight loss. If evidence of adrenal insufficiency
occurs, the systemic steroid dose should be boosted temporarily and thereafter
further withdrawal should continue more slowly. </p>

<p>DURING PERIODS OF STRESS OR A SEVERE ASTHMA ATTACK, TRANSFER PATIENTS
WILL REQUIRE SUPPLEMENTARY TREATMENT WITH SYSTEMIC STEROIDS. Exacerbations
of asthma which occur during the course of treatment with Beclomethasone
Inhaler should be treated with a short course of systemic steroid which
is gradually tapered as these symptoms subside. There is no evidence that
control of asthma can be achieved by administration of Beclomethasone in
amounts greater than the recommended doses. </p>

<p>ANIMAL PHARMACOLOGY </p>

<p>ANIMAL PHARMACOLOGY AND TOXICOLOGY </p>

<p>Studies in a number of animal species including rats, rabbits, and dogs
have shown no unusual toxicity during acute experiments. However, the effects
of beclomethasone dipropionate in producing signs of glucocorticoid excess
during chronic administration by various routes were dose related. </p>

<p>CLINICAL STUDIES </p>

<p>The effects of beclomethasone dipropionate on hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal
(HPA) function have been evaluated in adult volunteers. There was no suppression
of early morning plasma cortisol concentrations when beclomethasone dipropionate
was administered in a dose of 1000 mcg/day for one month as an aerosol
or for three days by intramuscular injection. However, partial suppression
of plasma cortisol concentration was observed when beclomethasone dipropionate
was administered in doses of 2000 mcg/day either intramuscularly or by
aerosol. Immediate suppression of plasma cortisol concentrations was observed
after single doses of 4000 mcg of beclomethasone dipropionate. </p>

<p>In one study, the effects of beclomethasone dipropionate on HPA function
were examined in patients with asthma. There was no change in basal early
morning plasma cortisol concentrations or in the cortisol responses to
tetracosactrin (ACTH 1:24) stimulation after daily administration of 400,
800 or 1200 mcg of beclomethasone dipropionate for 28 days. After daily
administration of 1600 mcg each day for 28 days, there was a slight reduction
in basal cortisol concentrations and a statistically significant (p &lt;.01)
reduction in plasma cortisol responses to tetracosactrin stimulation. The
effects of a more prolonged period of beclomethasone dipropionate administration
on HPA function have not been evaluated. However, a number of investigators
have noted that when systemic corticosteroid therapy in asthmatic subjects
can be replaced with recommended doses of beclomethasone dipropionate,
there is gradual recovery of endogenous cortisol concentrations to the
normal range. There is still no documented evidence of recovery from other
adverse systemic corticosteroid- induced reactions during prolonged therapy
of patients with beclomethasone dipropionate. </p>

<p>Clinical experience has shown that some patients with bronchial asthma
who require corticosteroid therapy for control of symptoms can be partially
or completely withdrawn from systemic corticosteroid if therapy with beclomethasone
dipropionate aerosol is substituted. Beclomethasone dipropionate aerosol
is not effective for all patients with bronchial asthma or at all stages
of the disease in a given patient. </p>

<p>The early clinical experience has revealed several new problems which
may be associated with the use of beclomethasone dipropionate by inhalation
for treatment of patients with bronchial asthma: </p>

<p>1. There is a risk of adrenal insufficiency when patients are transferred
from systemic corticosteroids to aerosol beclomethasone dipropionate. Although
the aerosol may provide adequate control of asthma during the transfer
period, it does not provide the systemic steroid which is needed during
acute stress situations. DEATHS DUE TO ADRENAL INSUFFICIENCY HAVE OCCURRED
IN ASTHMATIC PATIENTS DURING AND AFTER TRANSFER FROM SYSTEMIC CORTICOSTEROIDS
TO AEROSOL BECLOMETHASONE DIPROPIONATE. (SEE WARNINGS.) </p>

<p>2. Transfer of patients from systemic steroid therapy to beclomethasone
dipropionate aerosol may unmask allergic conditions which were previously
controlled by the systemic steroid therapy, e.g., rhinitis, conjunctivitis,
and eczema. </p>

<p>3. Localized infections with Candida Albicans or Aspergillus Niger have
occurred frequently in the mouth and pharynx and occasionally in the larynx.
It has been reported that up to 75% of the patients who receive prolonged
treatment with beclomethasone dipropionate have positive oral cultures
for Candida Albicans. The incidence of clinically apparent infection is
considerably lower but may require therapy with appropriate antifungal
agents or discontinuation of treatment with beclomethasone dipropionate
aerosol. </p>

<p>The long-term effects of beclomethasone dipropionate in human subjects
are still unknown. In particular, the local effects of the agent on developmental
or immunologic processes in the mouth, pharynx, trachea and lung are unknown.
There is also no information about the possible long-term systemic effects
of the agent. The possible relevance of the data in animal studies to results
in human subjects cannot be evaluated. </p>

<p><a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><b>DESCRIPTION </b></p>

<p>Chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride, the prototype benzodiazepine compound,
is 7-chloro- 2-(methylamino)- 5-phenyl-3H-1,4- benzodiazepine 4-oxide hydrochloride.
A white to practically white crystalline substance, it is soluble in water.
It is unstable in solution and the powder must be protected from light.
The molecular weight is 336.22. </p>

<p><a name="ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY"></a><b>ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
</b></p>

<p>Chlordiazepoxide (chlordiazepoxide HCl) has antianxiety, sedative, appetite-stimulating
and weak analgesic actions. The precise mechanism of action is not known.
The drug blocks EEG arousal from stimulation of the brain stem reticular
formation. It takes several hours for peak blood levels to be reached and
the half-life of the drug is between 24 and 48 hours. After the drug is
discontinued plasma levels decline slowly over a period of several days.
Chlordiazepoxide is excreted in the urine, with 1% to 2% unchanged and
3% to 6% as a conjugate. </p>

<p>Animal Pharmacology: The drug has been studied extensively in many species
of animals and these studies are suggestive of action on the limbic system
of the brain, which recent evidence indicates is involved in emotional
responses. Hostile monkeys were made tame by oral drug doses which did
not cause sedation. Chlordiazepoxide HCl revealed a &quot;taming&quot;
action with the elimination of fear and aggression. The taming effect of
chlordiazepoxide HCl was further demonstrated in rats made vicious by lesions
in the septal area of the brain. The drug dosage which effectively blocked
the vicious reaction was well below the dose which caused sedation in these
animals. </p>

<p>The LD50 of parenterally administered chlordiazepoxide HCl was determined
in mice (72 hours) and rats (5 days), and calculated according to the method
of Miller and Tainter, with the following results: mice, IV, 123 (+/-)
12 mg/kg; mice, IM, 366 (+/-) 7 mg/kg; rats, IV, 120 (+/-) 7 mg/kg; rats,
IM, &gt; 160 mg/kg. Effects On Reproduction: Reproduction studies in rats
fed 10, 20 and 80 mg/kg daily and bred through one or two matings showed
no congenital anomalies, nor were there adverse effects on lactation of
the dams or growth of the newborn. However, in another study at 100 mg/kg
daily there was noted a significant decrease in the fertilization rate
and a marked decrease in the viability and body weight of offspring which
may be attributable to sedative activity, thus resulting in lack of interest
in mating and lessened maternal nursing and care of the young. One neonate
in each of the first and second matings in the rat reproduction study at
the 100 mg/kg dose exhibited major skeletal defects. Further studies are
in progress to determine the significance of these findings. </p>

<p><a name="INDICATIONS AND USAGE"></a><b>INDICATIONS AND USAGE </b></p>

<p>Chlordiazepoxide is indicated for the management of anxiety disorders
or for the short- term relief of symptoms of anxiety, withdrawal symptoms
of acute alcoholism, and preoperative apprehension and anxiety. Anxiety
or tension associated with the stress of everyday life usually does not
require treatment with an anxiolytic. </p>

<p>The effectiveness of Chlordiazepoxide in long-term use, that is, more
than 4 months, has not been assessed by systematic clinical studies. The
physician should periodically reassess the usefulness of the drug for the
individual patient. </p>

<p><a name="CONTRAINDICATIONS"></a><b>CONTRAINDICATIONS </b></p>

<p>Chlordiazepoxide is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity
to the drug. </p>

<p><a name="WARNINGS"></a><b>WARNINGS </b></p>

<p>Chlordiazepoxide HCl may impair the mental and/or physical abilities
required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks such as driving
a vehicle or operating machinery. Similarly, it may impair mental alertness
in children. The concomitant use of alcohol or other central nervous system
depressants may have an additive effect. PATIENTS SHOULD BE WARNED ACCORDINGLY.
USAGE IN PREGNANCY: AN INCREASED RISK OF CONGENITAL MALFORMATIONS ASSOCIATED
WITH THE USE OF MINOR TRANQUILIZERS (CHLORDIAZEPOXIDE, DIAZEPAM AND MEPROBAMATE)
DURING THE FIRST TRIMESTER OF PREGNANCY HAS BEEN SUGGESTED IN SEVERAL STUDIES.
BECAUSE USE OF THESE DRUGS IS RARELY A MATTER OF URGENCY, THEIR USE DURING
THIS PERIOD SHOULD ALMOST ALWAYS BE AVOIDED. THE POSSIBILITY THAT A WOMAN
OF CHILDBEARING POTENTIAL MAY BE PREGNANT AT THE TIME OF INSTITUTION OF
THERAPY SHOULD BE CONSIDERED. PATIENTS SHOULD BE ADVISED THAT IF THEY BECOME
PREGNANT DURING THERAPY OR INTEND TO BECOME PREGNANT THEY SHOULD COMMUNICATE
WITH THEIR PHYSICIANS ABOUT THE DESIRABILITY OF DISCONTINUING THE DRUG.
Withdrawal symptoms of the barbiturate type have occurred after the discontinuation
of benzodiazepines. (See DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE section.) </p>

<p><a name="PRECAUTIONS"></a><b>PRECAUTIONS </b></p>

<p>In elderly and debilitated patients, it is recommended that the dosage
be limited to the smallest effective amount to preclude the development
of ataxia or oversedation (10 mg or less per day initially, to be increased
gradually as needed and tolerated). In general, the concomitant administration
of Chlordiazepoxide and other psychotropic agents is not recommended. If
such combination therapy seems indicated, careful consideration should
be given to the pharmacology of the agents to be employed--particularly
when the known potentiating compounds such as the MAO inhibitors and phenothiazines
are to be used. The usual precautions in treating patients with impaired
renal or hepatic function should be observed. Paradoxical reactions, eg,
excitement, stimulation and acute rage, have been reported in psychiatric
patients and in hyperactive aggressive children, and should be watched
for during Chlordiazepoxide therapy. The usual precautions are indicated
when Chlordiazepoxide is used in the treatment of anxiety states where
there is any evidence of impending depression; it should be borne in mind
that suicidal tendencies may be present and protective measures may be
necessary. Although clinical studies have not established a cause and effect
relationship, physicians should be aware that variable effects on blood
coagulation have been reported very rarely in patients receiving oral anticoagulants
and Chlordiazepoxide. In view of isolated reports associating chlordiazepoxide
with exacerbation of porphyria, caution should be exercised in prescribing
chlordiazepoxide to patients suffering from this disease. </p>

<p>Information For Patients: To assure the safe and effective use of benzodiazepines,
patients should be informed that, since benzodiazepines may produce psychological
and physical dependence it is advisable that they consult with their physician
before either increasing the dose or abruptly discontinuing this drug.
</p>

<p><a name="DRUG INTERACTIONS"></a><b>DRUG INTERACTIONS </b></p>

<p>SEE WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS </p>

<p><a name="ADVERSE REACTIONS"></a><b>ADVERSE REACTIONS </b></p>

<p>The necessity of discontinuing therapy because of undesirable effects
has been rare. Drowsiness, ataxia and confusion have been reported in some
patients-- particularly the elderly and debilitated. While these effects
can be avoided in almost all instances by proper dosage adjustment, they
have occasionally been observed at the lower dosage ranges. In a few instances
syncope has been reported. </p>

<p>Other adverse reactions reported during therapy include isolated instances
of skin eruptions, edema, minor menstrual irregularities, nausea and constipation,
extrapyramidal symptoms, as well as increased and decreased libido. Such
side effects have been infrequent and are generally controlled with reduction
of dosage. Changes in EEG patterns (low-voltage fast activity) have been
observed in patients during and after Chlordiazepoxide treatment. </p>

<p>Blood dyscrasias (including agranulocytosis), jaundice and hepatic dysfunction
have occasionally been reported during therapy. When Chlordiazepoxide treatment
is protracted, periodic blood counts and liver function tests are advisable.
</p>

<p>DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE </p>

<p>Chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride capsules are classified by the Drug Enforcement
Administration as a Schedule IV controlled substance. </p>

<p>Withdrawal symptoms, similar in character to those noted with barbiturates
and alcohol (convulsions, tremor, abdominal and muscle cramps, vomiting
and sweating), have occurred following abrupt discontinuance of chlordiazepoxide.
The more severe withdrawal symptoms have usually been limited to those
patients who had received excessive doses over an extended period of time.
Generally milder withdrawal symptoms (eg, dysphoria and insomnia) have
been reported following abrupt discontinuance of benzodiazepines taken
continuously at therapeutic levels for several months. Consequently, after
extended therapy, abrupt discontinuation should generally be avoided and
a gradual dosage tapering schedule followed. Addiction-prone individuals
(such as drug addicts or alcoholics) should be under careful surveillance
when receiving chlordiazepoxide or other psychotropic agents because of
the predisposition of such patients to habituation and dependence. </p>

<p><a name="OVERDOSAGE"></a><b>OVERDOSAGE </b></p>

<p>Manifestations of Chlordiazepoxide overdosage include somnolence, confusion,
coma and diminished reflexes. Respiration, pulse and blood pressure should
be monitored, as in all cases of drug overdosage, although, in general,
these effects have been minimal following Chlordiazepoxide overdosage.
General supportive measures should be employed, along with immediate gastric
lavage. Intravenous fluids should be administered and an adequate airway
maintained. Hypotension may be combated by the use of Levophed(R) (norepinephrine)
or Aramine (metaraminol). Dialysis is of limited value. There have been
occasional reports of excitation in patients following chlordiazepoxide
HCl overdosage; if this occurs barbiturates should not be used. As with
the management of intentional overdosage with any drug, it should be borne
in mind that multiple agents may have been ingested. </p>

<p>Flumazenil, a specific benzodiazepine-receptor antagonist, is indicated
for the complete or partial reversal of the sedative effects of benzodiazepines
and may be used in situations when an overdose with a benzodiazepine is
known or suspected. Prior to the administration of flumazenil, necessary
measures should be instituted to secure airway, ventilation, and intravenous
access. Flumazenil is intended as an adjunct to, not as a substitute for,
proper management of benzodiazepine overdose. Patients treated with flumazenil
should be monitored for resedation, respiratory depression and other residual
benzodiazepine effects for an appropriate period after treatment. THE PRESCRIBER
SHOULD BE AWARE OF A RISK OF SEIZURE IN ASSOCIATION WITH FLUMAZENIL TREATMENT,
PARTICULARLY IN LONG- TERM BENZODIAZEPINE USERS AND IN CYCLIC ANTIDEPRESSANT
OVERDOSE. </p>

<p>The complete flumazenil package insert, including CONTRAINDICATIONS,
WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS, should be consulted prior to use. </p>

<p><a name="DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION"></a><b>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
</b></p>

<p>Because of the wide range of clinical indications for Chlordiazepoxide,
the optimum dosage varies with the diagnosis and response of the individual
patient. The dosage, therefore, should be individualized for maximum beneficial
effects.</p>

                   CHILDREN                      USUAL DAILY DOSE
                   Because of the                5 mg, 2 to 4 times
                   varied response of            daily (may be in-

                   ing drugs, therapy            children to 10 mg,
                   should be initiated           2 to 3 times daily)
                   with the lowest dose
                   and increased as required.
                   Since clinical experience
                   in children under 6
                   years of age is limited,
                   the use of the drug
                   in this age group is
                   not recommended.</pre>

<p>
<br>For the relief of withdrawal symptoms of acute alcoholism, the parenteral
form is usually used initially. If the drug is administered orally, the
suggested initial dose is 50 to 100 mg, to be followed by repeated doses
as needed until agitation is controlled--up to 300 mg per day. Dosage should
then be reduced to maintenance levels. </p>
