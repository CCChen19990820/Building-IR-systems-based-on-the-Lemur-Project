<B>STUDY GOAL AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>

The U.S. market for medical and pharmaceutical disposables is
growing rapidly because of the increasing average age of the
population, and the need to reduce the costs of healthcare.
Concurrently, environmental issues involving air, water, and solid
waste favor the use of medical products which can be fabricated,
consumed, and then disposed of without harm to the environment.<P>

We will demonstrate in this study that disposable products, chiefly
composed of plastics, can contribute to our society's need for
quality healthcare at an affordable price, while concurrently
supporting efforts to improve the environment.  The trend toward
disposables and away from reusable products is consistent with the
desire to better handle the disposal of medical waste.  The study
reveals that the use of plastics will accomplish that objective.<P>


<B>SCOPE AND FORMAT OF THE STUDY</B><P>

Healthcare involves the demand for durable products, such as
medical and surgical equipment, which have long lifetimes, and
disposables, which may be used a single time or, in some cases
(e.g., syringes), reused a short time before their function is
completed.  This study targets those plastic products and devices
viewed as "disposable."  Many product types have been grouped
together since there are several thousand different products.<P>

The dominant plastic materials used in these applications are the
thermoplastics, particularly the commodity plastics of
polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, and PVC.  The study,
however, identifies and quantifies all thermoplastics employed in
medical/pharmaceutical packaging and non-packaging, including
engineering resins.  In addition, silicone and thermoplastic
elastomer data are included, since these materials are closely
related to the thermoplastics in property performance and do
compete in the medical disposables market.  The material picture is
completed through our analysis of competing non-plastics such as
glass, paper, and metal in terms of cost and performance.<P>

The study covers the resins consumed in medical disposables, from
the resin suppliers, through the grades of resin used, competing
materials, profiles of the players in product fabrication,
distribution channels, and the identification of the key medical
products suppliers.  These data are presented in a framework of
current trends in materials, markets, and technologies within the
structure of the medical and pharmaceutical industries.  A
comparison with trends and products in other developed nations is
included, since these products are sold in a global market.<P>

In addition to a description of resins used in typical healthcare
products, our analyses include specific product offerings,
particularly where material selected, product design, or manner of
use represents an innovation versus traditional consumption.<P>

Since these products are consumed in a highly regulated
environment, an important aspect of the study is a discussion of
the regulatory agencies and specific regulations that determine the
types of resins which may used, the role of safety and health
issues, and the potential liabilities associated with product
design and performance.<P>

The demand data shown represent current (1992) levels through the
next 10 years.  Data are keyed to the years 1992, 1997, and 2002,
with average annual growth rates calculated for the 5-year 1992-
1997 and 1997-2002 time periods.<P>


<B>STUDY METHODOLOGY</B><P>

In addition to telephone interviews with resin suppliers,
fabricators, and medical product suppliers, we have gathered data
and insight from trade associations and government agencies.  These
contacts have been supplemented with information obtained from the
technical and marketing trade publications and relevant data from
previous BCC studies.<P>

All BCC estimates of future demand are based on our interpretation
of the information received from an extensive list of industry
specialists.  Thus, we believe this study represents an accurate
view of the current and future demand for medical/ pharmaceutical
disposables.<P>


<B>CONTRIBUTION OF THE STUDY</B><P>

The U.S. market for plastics disposables in the medical and
pharmaceutical industries has essentially doubled in the last five
years, reaching approximately 1.35 billion pounds in 1992.
Plastics consumption in the U.S. healthcare industry for disposable
products alone grew at 9.7% annually from 1987 to 1992, compared to
a 2.2% growth rate for plastics overall during that period.
Medical/pharmaceutical disposables now account for about 2% of
total U.S. plastics consumption.  This combination of widespread
use and fast growth confirms the importance of such products for
the future of the plastics industry.<P>

This study is intended for use by companies along the chain of
distribution of healthcare products -- resin suppliers,
fabricators, medical product suppliers, plus companies who
participate in the healthcare industry with non-plastics products.
Our comprehensive analyses identify those resins which will have
the greatest future success in healthcare products and the reasons
for their use versus competing plastics and non-plastics.<P>

<B>STUDY GOAL AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>

Blister/skin packaging is one of the fastest-growing segments of the plastic
packaging business.  Blisters, clamshells and carded skin packages are part of
the transparent (high-visibility) packaging market, involving containers
designed to expose all or partial product contents for the benefit of the
consumer.  (The term "high-visibility" is credited to Packaging Magazine,
coined in the late 1980s).  This packaging is so designed to assist the
retailer in promoting sales of products, as well.<P>

This BCC study assesses the current and future role played by blister and skin
packaging as barrier media, in point-of-purchase displays and for tamper-
evidence in the packaging of a variety of consumer products for healthcare,
toiletries and cosmetics, hardware, stationery and a myriad of other consumer
markets.  The use of blister/skin packaging is compared and contrasted to
other packaging media, such as bags, pouches and skin packaging in each market
and application, reviewing the advantages and disadvantages of each medium
with respect to cost and performance.<P>


<B>SCOPE AND FORMAT OF THE STUDY</B><P>

This study highlights that packaging in which thermoformed plastic film/sheet
is converted into highly-transparent containers either affixed to a paperboard
card or as hinged and/or reclosable stand-alone packages.  The terms "film"
and "sheet" are used interchangeably since the thickness definitions as to
what constitutes each differ among the thermoplastics.  Alternative packaging
media will be discussed only in terms of direct competition with blister
packaging in a specific market.   In all cases, the term "packaging" refers to
primary packaging, not the secondary type, such as shipping containers.<P>

We have focused on seven major markets, which are believed to be the major
outlets for blister/skin packaging.  In each of those markets we calculate the
share of total packaging represented by blister/skin packaging, measured in
percent of current dollar shipments, and the share of blister/skin packaging
versus alternative packaging media in terms of units, when available.
Otherwise, the market is characterized by the percentage of each segment
employed (i.e., blister, clamshell and skin), in terms of units.  Value data
will be based on the packaging medium itself, not on the cost of the package
with product included.<P>

The demand for blister/skin packaging is further separated by type of plastic
resin and adjunct materials, measured in pounds for each major market.  Demand
keyed to 1991 and 1992, then forecast for 1997.  Average annual growth rates are
data are    calculated for the 5-year period, 1992-1997.<P>

Major players are identified and ranked in each phase of blister packaging--
those companies which make the blister and skin cards, blister/skin
fabricators, and thermoforming companies which participate in this industry.<P>

Those trends which have already affected the demand for blister/skin packaging
and the ones which are likely to have some impact in the future are
highlighted.  These issues can be compressed into factors relating to the type
of packaging needed and wanted by retailers and consumers, regulatory
considerations and economics.<P>

As with any aspect of competitive evaluation, we have included economic data
on the costs of production for the various competing packaging technologies.
This includes a description of the required equipment and technologies,
further clarifying the reasons why blister packaging may or may not be the
packaging medium selected for a particular application.<P>


<B>STUDY METHODOLOGY</B><P>

The research for this study included personal contacts with key participants
at every level of blister packaging marketing.  The information gathered from
these primary sources formed the basis for our current and forecast estimates
of demand.  In addition, we reviewed secondary sources of information such as
trade publications, trade associations, company literature, industry
conferences and on-line data bases to supplement our understanding of the
markets, applications and trends affecting blister packaging specifically, and
plastic packaging generally.  Finally, macroeconomic data from government
sources yielded information about the industries in which blister packaging
participates.<P>

Our final analyses and projections are based on a combination of a consensus
among primary contacts and our understanding of the impact of trends from an
historical perspective.<P>


<B>CONTRIBUTION OF THE STUDY</B><P>

Whereas BCC has touched on blister packaging as it relates to specific markets
in past business opportunity reports, this is the first study to focus on the
blister packaging business in terms of its contribution to plastic packaging
and its competitiveness with other plastic and non-plastic packaging.<P>

This study is intended for use by existing resin and film suppliers,
film/sheet converters and packaging end-users seeking to identify the
opportunities and growth prospects for the blister packaging industry.  Resin
and film suppliers will be interested in the evolving plastic material and
inter-material competition.  Film and sheet converters' interest will focus on
the techno-economic issues that determine packaging media selection.
Retailers can gain an insight into consumer attitudes toward packaging media,
and marketing techniques which can promote product sales.<P>


<B>RELATED BCC REPORTS</B><P>

BCC publishes studies regularly on packaging technologies, markets and
processes. These studies usually relate to plastics and the materials with
which they compete in specific markets.   Listed below are relevant studies
published within the last three years which may offer further insight into the
opportunities for plastic packaging.<P>

<B>STUDY GOALS AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>

BCC's goal in conducting this study was to determine the current
status of the market for surface modified polymers and assess the
growth potential of these materials over a five-year period from
1993-1998.  We were particularly interested in the kinds of
polymers being used for industrial and consumer applications and
the processes by which they were modified.<P>

Our major objective was to present a comprehensive analysis of the
current surface modified polymer industry and plot its future
course.<P>

<B>REASONS FOR DOING THIS STUDY</B><P>

Over the past decade, improvements in technology have made it
possible to expand surface modification of polymer substrates.  At
the same time, more sophisticated manufacturing and fabrication
methods have broadened the demand for modified polymers.  A variety
of new products require properties that can best be delivered by
polymer materials, specifically those polymers whose surface
characteristics have been modified.<P>

BCC decided to examine the current position of surface-modified
polymers used in key industries.  We were interested in what
materials and surface technologies were being used to meet the
demands of more sophisticated products.<P>

<B>CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE STUDY AND FOR WHOM</B><P>

We assembled a study of the types of polymers used in eight key
industries.  Within each industry segment, we present a worldwide
structure, examine the competitive aspects, summarize the
advantages of using modified polymers, analyze the current markets,
identify factors that will drive demand, and project shipments by
type of polymer to 1998.  This study will be of interest to those
in the packaging and container business, and manufacturers of
magnetic and optical storage products, medical devices,
microelectronics, automotive and aerospace products.  It will also
be of interest to companies engaged in membrane separation, polymer
manufacturers, and surface coaters.<P>

<B>SCOPE AND FORMAT</B><P>

The scope of this study encompasses polymer materials and
technologies in terms of applications, processes, and properties.
We analyze the major types of polymers used in the manufacture of
products in the eight key industries.  The applications are
discussed, as are the properties imparted through modified polymer
substrates.   Trends in demand for various products are reviewed
and their impact on polymer modification technologies is discussed.<P>

Future market drivers for each industry segment are identified.
Materials are analyzed by their basic functions such as barriers,
dielectrics, and adhesives.  Shipments of surface-modified polymers
are projected within each industry by type of polymer.  The value
of these shipments is also projected.  Modification by type of
technology is presented.  Technological issues and trends are
reviewed and other influential factors such as the economic climate
are also discussed.<P>

Because this is a worldwide industry, BCC analyzes the domestic and
international standards issues, economic considerations, and the
environmental implications.  BCC also presents an analysis of
market factors for each industry and examines their impact on the
future.<P>

<B>METHODOLOGY</B><P>

BCC presents an analysis of the volume and value of modified
polymer shipments by type of polymer and industry segment.  Our
estimated value is what manufacturers and material providers have

<B>STUDY OBJECTIVES</B><P>

BCC has been monitoring and reporting on plastics recycling since 1988, when 
recycling was first considered as a prime option to solve the solid waste 
management problem.  This study brings together all of the information from 
BCC's data base on plastics recycling, and merges it with current primary 
research.  Thus, this study is a comprehensive analysis of the state of 
plastics recycling through the first quarter of 1994, as viewed by material 
suppliers, end users, government recycling officials and environmentalists.<P> 

The study takes a critical view of the wide range of factors affecting 
recycling.  It identifies the technologies and markets that will be capable of 
sustaining the forecasted growth of the post-consumer recycling business over 
the coming decade. BCC believes that today's dedicated recycling efforts are 
still in their infancy, and that the expected developments within the next few 
years will be a boon to the recycling industry as well as to the equipment 
manufacturers.<P> 


<b>SCOPE AND FORMAT</B><P>

This is the first time that BCC has incorporated all of its research to 
present a complete picture of all the factors that influence plastics 
recycling and the resultant markets for products which have been recycled.  In 
addition to identifying of the major participants at every level of the 
plastics recycling infrastructure, the study discusses the technologies, 
economics, relevant legislation and regulations, both in the U.S. and 
abroad.  Finally, the objectives and issues facing the key trade groups are 
reviewed.<P> 

The study reviews the collection and sorting technologies that promise a 
steady supply of post-consumer plastic products to recyclers.  We discuss the 
role of Municipal Recovery Facilities (MRFs) and the possible establishment of 
Plastics Recovery Facilities (PRFs).  We analyze the present and forthcoming 
types and sales prospects of equipment used in the mechanical/thermal 
processes (i.e., granulation, extrusion and pelletizing).  We also analyze 
developments in and expectations for the use of chemical processes such as 
glycolysis, methanolysis, refinery recycling and energy recovery. Because of 
the limited information available and the low level of activity in the 
durables sector, we have restricted our efforts to the study of four 
industries, namely, construction, transportation, industrial containers and a 
grouping of appliances, housewares and electrical/electronic products.<P> 


<b>METHODOLOGY</B><P>

The primary data gathered for this study involved contact with more than 100
recyclers, equipment manufacturers and resin companies, as well as with trade
associations and government entities at the federal and state level.<P>

This primary research was reinforced with information gathered from 
organizations devoted to recycling and waste management such as plastics and 
non-plastics trade associations, trade journals and federal government 
agencies, both in the U.S. and overseas.<P> 


<b>CONTRIBUTION OF THE STUDY</B><P>

In a business segment which is constantly changing, this study provides the 
reader with the latest scenario in the development of plastics recycling.  
Existing and new driving forces are explored to support the forecasts for the 
near-term future.<P> 

By taking a closer look at each stage of the recycling process, we are in a 
better position to understand the limits of post-consumer waste recycling 
efforts and the opportunities that will be created for equipment 
manufacturers.  By reporting on the research being done, we can better assess 
the outlook for plastics recycling during the next ten years.<P> 

There are two other reasons for focusing now on the equipment and 
technological aspects of post-consumer plastic recycling.  First, the plastics industry is under intense pressure to increase its recycling rate of not only plastics packaging but of all plastics products.  Unless the industry widens its recycling efforts, it will continue to lag behind the other material industries.  In some instances, because some resins are under these environmental pressures, recycling will also ensure the survival and continued growth of those resins and plastics products.  In other instances, it could help shape legislative actions that will influence the future growth of most plastic resins.<P> 

Secondly, the development of new technologies will benefit both the recyclers and the equipment manufacturers.  Those companies can only benefit from a rapidly growing recycling business.  Thus, this study is aimed at the plastics recycling community and the equipment manufacturers.  We believe the information included in this report is unique.  The reader can find, in one place, information about the present status of plastics recycling as well as a discussion of how current developments will impact this industry in the near future.<P>

<B>STUDY GOALS AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>

Plastics are ubiquitous. Since their discovery many years
ago and subsequent commercialization and public acceptance
after World War II, plastics now play a major, although
often unnoticed part, in the lives of virtually everyone who
lives in a developed country.  Not only are many products
packaged in plastic, but many durable goods are also either
produced from plastics or are encased in them.<P>

The public often does not think about it, but everything
from the bottle that holds the hair shampoo used in the
shower that morning, to the plastic milk jug used at
breakfast, to the cassette tape placed in the car stereo on
the way to work (and also the car's steering wheel, seats,
and the dashboard), are all made of plastic.<P>

The inevitable end to all goods, natural or manufactured, is
either consumption or disposal.  Some products are made to
be used and disposed of in a short time; we call these
disposables and this group includes virtually all packaging
materials and products as well as food service and foodware
disposable cutlery, plates, etc.  Others are meant to last
for some period of time, short or long; we call these
durable goods.  But eventually everything wears out, and we
throw out the shampoo botttle and cassette tape, and trade
in the car, the refrigerator, and the personal computer.<P>

Waste disposal has become a major industry, and disposal of
plastics has become a technological, business, and political
and social subject that has created and attracted a lot of
attention from researchers, businessmen, politicians,
environmental activists, and the general public.<P>

One very visible form of solid waste (SW) is plastic waste,
primarily because so much plastic packaging is used in the
U.S. (about one-quarter or more of all plastic used in the
U.S. goes into packaging).  The public is aware of plastic
packaging and its volume and unsightly litter when
improperly disposed of.  The attention is probably
unwarranted, for plastic packaging represents only a small
percentage of SW, especially municipal solid waste (MSW),
and an even smaller percentage, currently only less than
half a percent of all wastes being recycled (by far the
largest percentage is in paper and other fiber products).<P>

Whether or not they warrant all the attention they get,
plastics wastes have become a very popular subject for
discussion and controversy.  And when one adds in the
disposal of durable plastic wastes, the problem is bigger
and more challenging.<P>

One way to dispose of plastics, both disposables and
durables, is to recycle them, that is, to recover used
plastics from the municipal or industrial waste stream and
in some way convert plastic waste into new and useful
objects.<P>

Plastics recycling is a relatively recent phenomenon. The
United States started down the road of environmental
consciousness with "Earth Day" in 1970 and the passage of
the first Clean Air and Clean Water Acts.  But plastics
recycling only became a prime option to help solve the solid
waste management problem in the late 1980s.  Thus, even
though most of us think that recycling has been with us for
a long time, its importance and commercial operation is less
than 10 years old at this writing in 1996.<P>

Our objective in this study is to look critically at
plastics recycling from a number of viewpoints, and to
investigate a number of different important factors.
Plastics recycling is still a relatively new and small
market, at least when compared to the large U.S. plastics
industry.  Therefore, this BCC report will be somewhat more
concerned with technology and growing markets than with more
conventional market research estimates and forecasts of
commercial products (although we certainly will try to
estimate and forecast some important markets in plastics
recycling).<P>


<B>REASONS FOR DOING THE STUDY</B><P>

As noted above, plastics are everywhere in our lives, and
disposal of plastics is an important facet of everyday
American life these days.  Recycling is taking on greater
importance each day, sociologically, economically, and
politically.<P>

BCC performed this study to provide a comprehensive
reference for those interested and/or involved in plastics
recycling. This is a wide and varied group of chemical and
other companies which make and use polymers, process
technology and equipment designers and marketers,
politicians of all stripes, and the general public. We have
sorted through, organized, and condensed information from a
large amount of literature and other reference materials to
compile this report.<P>


<B>CONTRIBUTION OF THE STUDY AND FOR WHOM</B><P>

This report is intended to assist those involved in several
different segments of U.S. industrial and commercial
business sectors, primarily those whose main interest is in
plastics, their use, and their disposal. These organizations
and people include those who are involved in the
development, formulation, manufacture, sale, use, and
disposal of plastics, both disposable and durable objects.<P>

Since plastics recycling is the prime focus of this study,
it will be of interest and value to those involved in
polymer and polymer processes, from manufacture of bulk
resins to converting and other plastics fabrication
processes. It will be of major interest to those who either
recycle plastics or use recyled resins, including those who
are contemplating entering this business in any aspect.<P>

Companies and personnel in ancillary businesses such as
processing equipment, additives, and other support chemicals
and equipment will find information useful to their
operations. These include process and product development
experts, process and product designers, purchasing agents,
construction and operating personnel, market staff, and top
management. BCC feels that this report will be of great
value to technical and business personnel in the following
areas, among others:<P>
  
         Marketing and management personnel in companies which
        produce, market, and sell plastic resins, both virgin and
        recycled.<P>
     
         Companies involved in the design and construction of
        plastics recycling plants, and those which service these
        plants.<P>
     
         Companies which supply, or want to supply, equipment
        and services to plastics recycling plants, such as
        manufacturers of balers, conveyors, and granulators.<P>
     
         Financial institutions which supply money for such
        facilities, including banks, merchant bankers, venture
        capitalists, and others.<P>
     
         Personnel in end-user companies and industries which
        purchase and use recyled plastics, ranging from packaging
        companies to automobile manufacturers, including a number of
        producers of consumer goods and industrial products.<P>
     
         Personnel in government at many levels, primarily at
        the   state and local level where most of the recycling
        action is taking place. These include environmental and
        other regulators who must implement and enforce the laws
        regarding disposal of solid wastes, including plastics.
        Federal officials, primarily at the EPA and FDA, are
        involved to protect national standards regarding public
        health and safety.<P>


<B>SCOPE AND FORMAT</B><P>

This BCC study covers in depth many of the most important
technological, economic, political, and environmental
considerations in U.S. plastics recycling.  It is primarily
a study of activities and markets in the United States, but
because of the global nature of polymer and packaging
chemistry and industry, it touches on some noteworthy
international activities. These are primarily those which
can have an impact on the U.S. activities and markets, such
as international technologies, standards and protocols for
recycling.<P>

All market figures are rounded to the nearest million or
billion pounds, and all growth rates are compounded
(signified as average annual growth rates or AAGRs). Because
of this rounding, some growth rates may not agree exactly
with figures in the market tables.<P>

This report is segmented into 10 sections, of which this is
the first.<P>

The Summary, encapsulates our findings and conclusions, and
includes the summary major market tables.  It is the place
where the busy executive can find the major findings of the
study in summary format.<P>

The Overview, covers both plastics and recycling.  We start
with an overview of the petrochemical and plastic resin
industries, since these are the source of plastics for
disposal and recycling. We move on to diffferent types of
plastics, introduce disposal of municipal solid waste (MSW)
and alternative systems MSW disposal, and end with an
introduction to recycling of plastics and other materials.
This last part includes some important definitions, such as
the "chasing arrows" recycling symbols now used, and some
important applications for recycled plastics.<P>

The first of the two Recycling sections is devoted to
markets for recycling plastics.  This section covers
recycling of disposable plastics; this primarily means
plastics used for packaging.  We look at disposal and
recycling of the principal types of packaging plastics and
structures, including flexible, foam, and rigid packaging
products and the effect of recycling on these markets.
Because recycling of plastics is still in its infancy, we
analyze and predict markets via different scenarios:
pessimistic, optimistic, and most likely.<P>

The second Recycling section is devoted to markets for
recycling of durable plastic goods, items as small as audio
cassette cases and as large as large automobile bumpers,
construction materials such as siding and insulation, and
electrical wiring and cable.  Also employed is a scenario
analysis for durables, with the caveat that precision is
much less than in the analysis of disposable plastics
recycling.<P>

The chapter on Technology is a major section devoted to
recycling technology, starting with the plastics "value
chain" and the types of plastics recycled. We then describe
some new sortation technology, and discuss both conventional
(that is, mechanical) and advanced (so-called chemical)
recycling in detail, outlining several different approaches
and technologies in each case. The discussion concludes with
some interesting additional recycling problems, such as
recycling multilayer plastics structures and the effects of
other materials such as polymer additives and labels on the
recycling processes and the resins and products produced.<P>

The Industry Structure looks at the structure of the
growing, developing, and constantly changing U.S. plastics
recycling industry, including the principal players, both
industrial and municipal. We cover the dynamics of economics
and pricing of recycling plastics and products, which drive
the markets. We discuss competitive materials to plastics,
such as aluminum cans and glass containers, and how their
use and recycling affect plastics and plastics recycling. In
this regard we introduce the subject of "life cycle
analysis" for comparing the use of different competing
materials, as well as certification programs for recycled
plastics.  This closes with some activities and trends
outside the U.S., and some comments on future trends and
public perceptions/attitudes.  In this section we analyze
and forecast potential levels for plastics recycling to the
year 2000 as well as projected markets for some major
products that use recycled plastics.<P>

The following section covers such public issues as
environmental and regulatory matters and other public policy
concerns.  Under discussion are the environmental and
regulatory status of recycling several of the most important
plastics, ranging from the important packaging HDPE and PET
to durable products made of polyurethane, polystyrene, and
other plastics.<P>

Organization Profiles contains information on many of the
most important organizations in plastics recycling. It
differs from the typical corporate profiles in BCC reports
in that there is no readily identifiable list of prominent
supplier companies, such as the Dows and Du Ponts, in other
reports on chemicals and plastics. Instead, prominent
recycling companies, trade associations, environmental
groups, and the like are included, all of whom are active in
and affecting the future of plastics recycling.<P>

The Glossary presents some important terms, abbreviations,
acronyms, etc. used in the chemical, polymer, packaging, and
recycling industries.<P>

Some topics and materials covered in the text of this report
are not included in our market forecast tables, since, as we
said above, this report is not a typical product group
market research report.  We include these topics and
materials for completeness; however, they are either really
outside the scope of this study (such as full discussion of
international activities) or are too new to have yet
developed a measurable commercial market (an area which
includes many yet-to-be developed or accepted products made
from recycling plastics). Much of the current activity in
plastics recycling is experimental and/or developmental, and
as such has no commercial market at this time.<P>

We cite and report a number of statistics in this report,
virtually all of them from various public sources such as
trade and government publications. An effort was made to
cite the most recent figures available, which for this
report ideally would be statistics for 1995.  Unfortunately,
the time required to collect and analyze large amounts of
data, for example amounts and percentages of recycled
plastics, is long and tedious, and such data are usually
only available a year or more after the fact.  Compounding
this problem is the fact that the U.S. government statistics
are notoriously late, often several years late.  Also, the
continual downsizing of the government has meant that many
statistics are either less complete and therefore less
useful, or simply no longer collected and analyzed.  For
these reasons the reader will find information from 1994 and
earlier cited in many places.<P>


<B>METHODOLOGY AND INFORMATION SOURCES</B><P>

Searches were made of the literature, including many of the
leading trade publications, as well as technical compendia,
government publications, and information from trade and
other associations. Product and market information was
obtained whenever possible from the principals involved. The
information for our organizational profiles was obtained
primarily from the organizations, especially the larger
publicly owned firms, trade associations, etc. Other sources
included directories and articles.<P>

<B>STUDY OBJECTIVES</B><P>
 

The rise in consumption of plastics in consumer appliances is the
direct result of substitution of metals and glass.   Plastics usage
has been driven not only by the need for lightweight materials but
also for colorability, safety and for cost reduction.<P>

BCC has not reviewed the consumption of plastics for these products
for some time.  The development of new materials and products,
along with changing consumer purchasing practices, means that the
types of resins employed in small appliances and the volumes
consumed have changed dramatically in the interim.  This study
updates the impact that the changing appliance industry has had on
plastics generally and for individual resins specifically.<P>  

<b>SCOPE AND FORMAT</B><P>

Appliance makers are among the most innovative users of plastics,
and the volume of resins consumed in small appliances has reached 
several hundred million pounds.  This study reviews that portion of
the appliance business we describe as small devices.  It traces the
consumption of plastics from the thermosets, the first metal
replacement materials, through the engineering and transitional
materials, and finally to the resin blends, thermoplastic
elastomers and upgraded commodity resins which now account for a
major portion of these products.<P>  

The study is divided into sub-sections of small appliances:
portable power tools and outdoor appliances, including leaf
blowers, drills, snowblowers, hedge trimmers, saws, etc.; home care
products, including vacuums and other floor care products; personal
care products, including hair dryers, curling irons, shavers,
toothbrushes, massagers, hair setters, etc.; and, electric
housewares, including hotplates, toasters, vacuums, mixers, irons,
knives, fryers, coffee makers, food processors, etc.<P>

Several related products were arbitrarily excluded from the study,
such as clocks, comfort conditioning products and business
appliances.  Such products have been covered in other BCC studies. 
However, no distinction was made for products used commercially or
in the home.  Every attempt was made to separate out and exclude
data on the non-electric models (e.g., gas-powered and manual) of
the products included in the study.  However, battery-driven
devices are included.<P>
                                
Generally, data are presented on a recent historical basis (e.g.,
1993), current (1994) and for the near-term future (i.e., next five
years) with annual growth rates indicated for the 5-year period. 
In some cases, the timeline was extended further into the past and
into the next decade, when data were available and appropriate.
The amount of resin calculated for each product includes that
amount attributed to imports.  Although some of that material is
sourced by the foreign affiliates of U.S.-based resin companies,
the data should not be construed to represent the actual volume of
resin contributed by U.S. resin suppliers.<P> 

Also, the data on resin consumption is for "compound," including
reinforcement and fillers.  Thus, in order to determine the actual
amount of resin, it should be recognized that approximately 15-40%
of the compound may not be resin.  The majority of resins used in
small appliances are filled and/or reinforced.<P> 


<b>METHODOLOGY</B><P>

The research for this study included personal contacts with key
participants among the appliance manufacturers, resin companies and
compounders.  The information gathered from these primary sources
formed the basis for our estimates of current resin usage in
appliance products.  Their forecasts for near-term future demand
were merged with our analysis of industry trends and the
probabilities of resin consumption to meet future demand.  Our
final analyses and projections are based on a combination of a
consensus among the primary contacts and our understanding of the
impact of trends from an historical perspective.<P>

In addition, we reviewed secondary sources of information such as
trade publications, trade associations, company literature,
industry conferences and on-line databases to supplement our
understanding of the markets, applications and trends affecting the
use of plastics in small electrical appliances.  Data from
government sources yielded information on industries impacting on
appliance use and information related specifically to appliances.<P>

<b>CONTRIBUTION OF THE STUDY</B><P>

The appliance industry trails only the automotive and packaging
industries in terms of worldwide plastics consumption.  Small
appliances alone account for some $7 billion in product shipments,
and the volume of plastics consumed is in excess of 500 million
pounds.  Thus, the dual importance of plastics to the small
appliance industry and concurrent significance of that industry to
the growth of plastics prompted BCC's interest in understanding the
current state of appliance products and materials.<P>

While there has been little activity lately in terms of new
plastics processing technologies for this industry, the
introduction of totally new products and the jockeying of materials
suppliers to accommodate those products has been extensive.  There
is a continuing evolution of cost-reducing material substitution
which greatly affects material suppliers.<P>

This study is targeted to the resin suppliers and compounders,
which already have an investment in small appliance marketing, and
those companies which are considering serving that market.  In both
instances, the dynamics of consumer purchasing preferences and
resulting appliance manufacturers' responses are critical to
understanding how and why the consumption of plastics in small
appliances is different from the past and will continue to be so in
the future.<P> 


<b>RELATED BCC STUDIES</B><P>

BCC has a long history of monitoring the use of plastics in all
major markets.  BCC studies not only report and project consumption
of plastics by product but also review the factors that impact on
such use.  These include standards and regulations, intermaterial
competition, new product/material technologies and the influence of
foreign competition.  There are several recently-published studies,
cited below, which deal with some related aspect of the appliance
market and the plastics consumed in that market.<P>

<B>OBJECTIVES</B><P>

We have designed this study to be one oriented to the plastics industry's 
contribution to the electronic components industry.  It is not a review of the 
entire electronics industry but a commentary on the development of plastics 
resins and resin grades to meet the requirements of new electronic 
technologies emerging in the computer, telecommunications, recording, 
automotive and other industries employing electronic components.<P> 

Having completed recent studies on electronic device housings for stationary 
and portable devices, this study completes the trilogy of plastics' 
contribution to the electronics industry.<P> 

<b>SCOPE AND FORMAT</B><P>

Based on the parameters set in our objectives, this study does not cover all 
electronic components, only those where there is a plastics contribution.  In 
addition, fiber optics, wire and cable and housings are excluded.  The study 
covers single devices (e.g., resistors, capacitors and transducers), multiple-
component devices (e.g., printed circuit boards) and recording media.<P>      

In addition, we identify the key participants in electronic components and 
other factors impacting on plastics demand, such as foreign trade and pricing.<P> 

Current and forecast demand data are presented for the years 1993, 1994 and 
1999. These data points represent the most accurate description of the current 
demand situation and provide an insight into the short-term growth that can be 
anticipated. Five-year average annual growth rates are calculated for the 
period 1994-1999.<P> 

<b>METHODOLOGY</B><P>

The research for this study included personal contacts with key participants 
among OEM electronics manufacturers, resin suppliers and processors.  The 
information gathered from these primary sources formed the basis for our 
estimates of current plastics usage in electronic components.  Their forecasts 
for future demand of resin and product were merged with our analysis of 
electronics trends and the probabilities of resin consumption to meet future 
demand.  Our final analyses and projections are based on a combination of a 
consensus among the primary contacts and our understanding of the impact of 
trends from an historical perspective.<P> 

In support of the primary research, we reviewed secondary sources of 
information such as the plastics and electronics trade publications, trade 
associations, company literature, industry conferences and online databases.  
Macroeconomic data and import/export data from government sources yielded 
information on the importance of this segment within the electronics industry 
and the influence of foreign-based manufacture on U.S. demand.<P> 


<b>CONTRIBUTION OF THE STUDY</B><P>

From an electronics point of view, electronic components represent about one-
fourth of total electronics sales, an industry valued at more than $300 
billion in 1994. Concurrently, the electronic industry is a major market, 
accounting for more than 1.5 billion pounds of plastic resins and coatings.<P>   

In addition, the electronics industry is one of the most dynamic industries in 
terms of new technologies affecting materials usage.  In summary, our review 
of this industry segment demonstrates and confirms the trend forecasts we 
mentioned in the other two related studies on electronic housings and portable 
electronics.  Any resin company supplying materials to the electronics 
industry, resin compounder, resin distributor, processor serving the 
electronics industry and OEM will find the current data on plastics usage, 
review of new technologies and especially the demand forecasts of interest in 
anticipating the future direction of the electronic components segment.<P>

</CENTER>

<B>STUDY GOALS AND OBJECTIVES</B>


<P>The objective of this study is to provide an analysis of high-performance 
films in terms of current and forecasted markets.  The report also segments 
the market by major end use.</P> 

<P>The report also identifies major resin producers and film manufacturers in the 
United States, Western Europe and Japan.</P> 


<B>REASONS FOR DOING STUDY</B>

<P>High-performance films have become a niche market in that they are specialty 
products at premium prices.  Consumption is driven by end-use application.</P> 

<P>Although volumes used are relatively low compared to commodity films, the 
value of this market is disproportionately high, especially with most prices 
in excess of $2/lb and many others over $5/lb and even higher.</P> 

<P>Furthermore, the high-performance film business is global in scope.  Industry 
leaders have worldwide marketing (and sometimes manufacturing) capabilities, 
held either independently or via joint ventures with local companies.</P> 


<B>SCOPE AND FORMAT</B>

<P>High performance films may be defined in any of several ways: by volume, 
price, performance end-use markets, resin types or a combination of two or 
more of these characteristics.</P> 

<P>For this study, high-performance films are defined as thin gauge, mostly 
extruded or solution cast polymer sheets, most of which meet the following 
criteria: list price above $2.00/lb; continuous use temperatures above 100C; 
major end uses other than packaging; and thicknesses at or below 10 mils (30 
mils or less for polycarbonate film).</P> 


<P>Therefore, distinguishing characteristics of high-performance films are:</P>

      <P>relatively expensive</P>
      <P>thin gauge (compared to sheet)?</P>
      <P>have special performance characteristics</P>
      <P>significant non-packaging applications</P>

<P>High-performance films are generally fabricated (or converted) in relatively 
small volumes, and often are priced more on the basis of value to customers 
than on a manufacturing cost basis.</P> 

<P>Focus of this study is on six broad classes of films which cover a variety of 
resins.</P>  

<UL>
      <LI>polyesters (used interchangeably with PET throughout report)
      <LI>nylons
      <LI>polycarbonates
      <LI>fluoropolymers
      <LI>polyimides
      <LI>other
</UL>

<P>Fluoropolymer films include:</P>

<UL>
      <LI>Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)
      <LI>Polyvinylfluoride (PVF)
      <LI>Fluorinated Ethylene-Propylene (FEP)
      <LI>Polychlorotrifluoroethylene (PCTFE)
      <LI>Polyvinylidene Fluoride (PVDF)
      <LI>Perfluoroalkoxy (PFA)
      <LI>Ethylene Tetrafluoroethylene (ETFE)
      <LI>Ethylene Chlorotrifluoroethylene (ECTFE)
</UL>

<P>Polyimide films include several types of polyimides made from monomers such as 
pyromellitic dianhydride and biphenyl tetracarboxylic dianhydride.</P> 

<P>Other high-performance films with market estimates include:</P>

<UL>
     <LI>Ionomers
     <LI>Ethylene Vinyl Alcohol (EVOH)
     <LI>Polymethylpentene (PMP)
     <LI>Polyvinylidene Chloride (PCdC)
     <LI>Polyvinyl Alcohol (PVOH)
     <LI>Polyetheretherketones (PEEK)
     <LI>Polysulfones (PSO, PES & PAS)
     <LI>Polyetherimides (PEI)
     <LI>Polyphenylene Sulfides (PPS)
     </UL>

<P>Another group of high-performance films have very small consumption and/or not 
considered commercial include:</P> 

<UL>
     <LI>Polyarylates (PAR)
     <LI>Liquid Crystal Polymers (LCP)
     <LI>Polyethylene Naphthalate (PEN)
</UL>

<B>STUDY OBJECTIVES</B><P>

The movement of plastics resins and fabricated products throughout the world 
is a multibillion dollar business involving thousands of resin suppliers, 
fabricators, distributors, and machinery companies.  Economic, political and 
demographic changes within the past few years induced BCC to review the 
dynamics of world plastics.<P>  

This study examines the production, consumption, balance of trade and key 
trends in each of the 70 countries investigated.  In addition, key contacts 
(i.e., manufacturers, associations and publications) are identified.  The 
overview section summarizes the movement of plastics resins by geographical 
region, highlighting the marketing power of regional blocs (e.g., the EEC and 
NAFTA) and the changes in marketing derived from these united regions.<P>  


<b>SCOPE AND FORMAT</B><P>

The study targets any country in the world where plastics are produced and/or 
consumed in significant quantities.  We have selected 70 countries which fit 
this parameter.  Since the data come from different sources, there are 
countries in which there are a considerable amount of market opportunity 
discussions, and many where the discussion describes only the production, 
consumption and trade data.<P> 

Data on production, consumption, imports, exports, apparent consumption, etc. 
are based on three years--1994, 1995 and 2000.  In addition 5-year growth 
rates are forecast for the 1995-2000 time period.<P> 


<b>METHODOLOGY</B><P>

The primary source of information for this study are the market research 
reports prepared by the U.S. Department of Commerce, employing local 
representatives for the analyses.  In addition, we contacted the appropriate 
Commerce Department personnel in charge of individual country commercial and 
trade information.  Finally, contacts were made with the Commercial Attaches 
and Chambers of Commerce of the individual countries located in New York City.<P> 

Secondary information was obtained through the trade literature and plastics 
trade associations throughout the world.  References in the study to IPAD 
refer to an organization representing more than 20 countries.  This 
"International Plastics Association Directors" group is responsible for 
collecting production, consumption and trade data on plastics through 
countries' primary plastics trade associations.<P> 

In most cases, the available data were for 1993 and earlier years.  We 
extrapolated the data for 1994, 1995 and 2000 based on the suggested growth 
rates offered by Commerce's representatives, whenever possible.  If 
significantly varying data appeared from different sources, then the primary 
source was considered to be more accurate.<P> 


<b>CONTRIBUTION OF THE STUDY</B><P>

This analysis can be an advantage for U.S. plastics resin suppliers seeking to 
increase their marketing capabilities, considering business relationships with 
foreign companies, plant construction and in general, anticipating greater 
involvement in foreign countries.<P>  


<b>RELATED BCC STUDIES</B><P>

As can be seen from the list below, BCC has not done much work during the past 
15 years in the area of world plastics.  The P-2000 study did cover much of 
the information in this current study.  However, it highlighted feedstock data 
and regional plastics consumption by resin.  This study, in addition to the 
regional analysis, highlights the plastics activity in some 40 countries.<P>

THE GLOBAL PLASTICS MARKET OF THE 1990s</H2>

<B>CONTEXT OF THE ANALYSIS</B><P>

The U.S. plastics industry has been an "engine of growth" for
the U.S economy since its inception.  The growth of U.S.
plastics production (for both domestic and foreign consumption)
has consistently exceeded the growth of the overall U.S. economy
and its manufacturing sector.  The output of U.S. resin
manufacturers as of 1990 was nearly $40 billion, and total
employment in the manufacture of resins was 55,000 strong.
Moreover, the value added and the employment involved in
downstream plastics manufacturing operations such as the
compounding of plastic materials and the processing, finishing
and assembly of plastic parts are a multiple of these numbers.<P>

As a result of historic comparative advantages in the
availability of petrochemical resources, skilled and unskilled
labor, equipment for the polymerization, compounding and
processing of plastics, and a resin distribution system that is
still the envy of the global plastics business, the U.S.
plastics industry rose to a position of leadership in the global
plastics marketplace.  By the end of the 1980s U.S. resin
production represented over 30 percent of the world total.  When
Canadian resin production is included, the share of the world
supply of resins coming out of North America was roughly
one-third of the total as of 1990.<P>

In the 1990s the U.S. (and North America as a whole) is likely
to experience a diminution of its leadership role in the global
resin manufacturing business and associated downstream plastics
operations.  In the 1960s and 1970s the Japanese plastics
industry grew behind protectionist barriers to the point where
it joined the U.S. and Western Europe as the dominant forces in
global resin supplies.  By 1980 these three countries/regions
accounted for roughly three-quarters of all resin produced
around the world.  However, other countries in other regions,
exploiting recently commercialized petrochemical resources, have
begun to compete vigorously on world markets for plastics, as
well a winning large shares of their own growing plastics
requirements.  In Central/South America, Brazil and Mexico have
been investing heavily to construct world-scale resin plants. In
Asia, South Korea and Taiwan have converted over from the status
of net importers to net exporters of resins.  And in the Middle
East, Saudi Arabia and other oil-rich states have been plowing
enormous amounts of "petro-dollars" generated subsequent to 1973
in programs designed to move these countries up along the
petrochemical value-added production chain -- from crude oil to
feedstocks to resins to plastic materials and ultimately to
plastic parts fabricated for their own nascent manufacturing
sectors.<P>

The globalization of the resin manufacturing business is
reflected in the export performance of the U.S. plastics
industry.  In the 1970s U.S. resin exports grew at a faster pace
than domestic sales of resins -- that is, 12.3 percent as
opposed to 8.5 percent.  Thus, exports in that decade constituted
a stimulus to the overall growth of the U.S. plastics industry.
In the 1980s, however, that position was reversed -- that is,
exports grew by only 4.5 percent per year compared to domestic
sales growth of 5.9 percent.  Thus, the U.S. resin export
business constituted a drag on, rather than a stimulus to,
overall growth.<P>

At face value, the global petrochemicals business in the 1990s
is on course to witness an unprecedented expansion of global
capacity for feedstocks and resins.  One-half of these additions
are being made in Third World countries which see plastics as a
modern route to industrialization.  The strategies adopted by
these countries are to cut down on imports of plastics and to
increase/commence exports of resins in order to generate the
hard currency required to support their industrialization
programs.  The results for resin manufacturers in the U.S. and
other established plastics industries could be

<UL><LI> overcapacity (e.g., capacity utilization rates dropping
from 87% in 1989 to perhaps below 80% by 1995)<BR>
<LI> price-cutting to preserve market share<BR>
<LI> profit declines</UL><P>

What, in fact, does the next decade hold?  Can the U.S. and
Canadian resin manufacturers compete in the growing global
marketplace for plastics?  What shares of the global resin
export business did the U.S. and Canada hold as of 1990, and
what will those shares be by the year 2000?  Who will we be
competing against and who will we be directing our sales efforts
towards?  What will be our future competitive advantages of a
raw material cost and/or technological nature? Which will be our
primary export markets as established players such as the West
German and Japanese companies confront the same dilemma as we do
and as new players in countries such as Brazil, Thailand and
Saudi Arabia seek out new customers for their looming surplus
production?<P>


<B>RESEARCH METHODOLOGIES AND SOURCES OF THE DATA</B><P>

In order to put together this comprehensive assessment of trends
in global resin manufacturing and foreign trade, BCC has
surveyed all the domestic published plastics literature, going
back, in many cases, to the early 1970s.  It has also consulted
directly with foreign (e.g., U.K. and Japanese) sources of
plastics statistics to gather data on trends abroad and to
solicit their insights as well as on the salient trends of the
1990s.  The data relating to plastics production, consumption
and trade for most of the developed countries were relatively
easy to assemble; those relating to the developing countries
required a critical scanning of the global plastics, chemicals,
energy and general materials literature.  We feel quite
confident that the degree of detail and the accuracy of the data
assembled here make this report unique among the various recent
attempts to isolate and describe global plastics trade trends.<P>

<B>CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE REPORT</B><P>

First and foremost, this report represents a unique analysis of
past and likely future trends in U.S., Canadian and global
exports of resins of all types.  It may be the first
comprehensive assessment of the regional composition of resin
exports as of 1990, based on recently available data from
various countries.  Yet, going beyond the primary focus on resin
exports, this report is intended to serve as an invaluable
source of information for U.S., Canadian and foreign resin
manufacturers on the<P>

<UL><LI>  capacities<BR>
<LI> production<BR>
<LI> consumption<BR>
<LI> foreign trade<P></UL>

of resins over the recent past (back to 1970 in most cases) and
into the future (out to 2000).  We envisage this research being
used by all resin manufacturers as a vital reference work as
they assess their prospects  in and their strategies for the
emerging global plastics industry of the 1990s.<P>

<B>STUDY GOAL AND OBJECTIVES</B>

<P>The goals and objectives of this technical/marketing study are to illustrate the
complexity and dynamic nature of the U.S. specialty water treatment chemicals
industry, within the context of the marketplace.  This study seeks to ascertain how
this industry relates to and is influenced by government regulations, technology and
economic factors.  It also aims to provide the facts, figures, and statistics necessary to
evaluate and to make projections regarding this industry. </P>  


<B>REASONS FOR DOING THE STUDY</B>

<P>This revised BCC technical/marketing study provides an in-depth analysis that
forecasts and tracks significant changes in the mature, yet still dynamic, U.S.
specialty water treatment chemicals industry.  The risks and rewards involved in
these economic, environmental, governmental, and technological changes determine
the difference between success or failure in this industry.</P> 


<B>HISTORY OF THE MARKET</B>

<P>Plagued by impure water for centuries, mankind has employed a variety of primitive
purification means to produce clean, potable water.  These means range from Moses
throwing a tree and Elisha throwing a cruse of salt into impure water sources to an
ancient Hindu filtration recipe that involves boiling foul water in copper pots and
filtering it through charcoal.  As early as 1450 B.C., the Egyptians are reported to
have used siphons to draw clear water from settling tanks.  The Chinese are credited
with the discovery that the addition of aluminum sulfate to contaminated water
coagulates the turbidity and increases the settled water's potability.  An extensive
waterworks network employed by the Roman Empire is said to have included the
first reliable meters, the extensive use of settling tanks, and the separation of potable
water, heated process water, sewage, and storm runoff.</P>  

<P>The U.S. water treatment chemicals industry has its roots in the desire to produce a
clean, disease-free supply of potable water for municipal consumers.  Within 20 years
of the British Parliament requiring the City of London to use sand filters for
removing bacteria and other impurities from its water, Poughkeepsie, NY was
installing them.  By 1912, liquid chlorine was being applied to U.S. municipal water
systems to destroy disease-producing bacteria.</P>

<P>Since that time, the U.S. water treatment industry has now evolved into the design of
facilities for the conveyance, control and treatment of industrial waters.  This
evolvement comes in response to an altered federal environmental policy and a
shifting of national industrial priorities.  From that response comes the trend toward
waste minimization and water recycling/reuse.  This evolvement has also seen the
creation of the government water expert, who (in theory) balances the public's need
for a reliable supply of potable water with industry's need to operate in a safe,
ultimately profitable manner.</P>  

<P>Over the last 25 years, the U.S. water treatment chemicals industry has also
segmented into commodity and specialty chemicals, with the basis of the
segmentation being how the individual chemical or chemical formulation is sold. 
Specialty chemicals remains the most competitive and fastest growing segment, due
to the development of new polymer technologies that enhance water/solids separation
and higher-priced products that replace chlorine, chromates, and hydrazine. </P> 


<B>SCOPE OF THE REPORT</B>

<P>Water treatment touches nearly every individual or industry in one way or another,
as the water treatment industry seeks to bring impure water up to potable standards
or better.  As this extremely large industry continues to expand, the lines between
commodity and specialty chemicals and mechanical and other treatment methods
sometimes blurs.</P> 

<P>This report concentrates on the most competitive, high-growth segment of the water
treatment industry:  those chemicals sold by specialty suppliers.  Using information
gathered from diverse sources, this report has been organized into a cohesive unit
that includes an overview of the industry with relevant information on the
environmental and regulatory constraints and actions that greatly control this
industry.  This report addresses the structure of the industry and its competitive
aspects, as well as specialty water treatment chemicals by function and market
application.  Abstracted patents represent many of the research and development
trends in the industry.  Not all of these patents become commercialized; however,
they do illustrate areas of company activity and alternative technologies under
development.</P>


<B>METHODOLOGY</B>

<P>The methodologies employed in this study include extensive library research and
information from BCC internal files, as well as contact with representatives from the
leading water treatment chemicals companies.  This report also ilcludes an on-line
data search of databases that cover all existing literature and an evaluation of
government statistics, company activities, state-of-the-art technology, and patents. 
Since it revises, expands, and updates an older BCC report, the report contains some
historical and background information from the older report.  This information
conforms to the newer BCC format and the more focused objectives of this report.</P>

<P>Values reflect U.S. sales of specialty water treatment chemicals for the market
applications covered in this report.  Projections for the 1995-2000 time period are
given in 1995 constant dollars and represent real growth.  Where precise information
was not available, a consensus was made, using a formulation of reasonable
assumptions and estimates based on a baseline obtained from historical data.</P>

      
<B>VALUE OF THE REPORT</B>

<P>This report consolidates a range of legislative/industrial/technical information into a
comprehensive technical/marketing study.  This study should aid technical personnel
in the research and development of water treatment chemicals, as well as suppliers to
any of the application market applications and readers interested in discovering and
exploiting current or projected market sub-niches.  Senior marketing, venture
capitalists, executive planners, government officials, and environmentalists should
find this report of interest.  As for the novice reader who desires to understand how
regulation, market pressures, and technology interact in the water treatment
chemicals industry, this report should be a key source.</P>

<B>STUDY GOAL AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>

Depending on how the problem is defined, there are between 150 and
300 million tons of hazardous waste generated in the U.S. every
year.  For instance, the federal government has defined hazardous
waste as a "toxic"  solid or aqueous pollutant, without clearly
defining just how toxic the pollutant must be.  Much of the
industrial waste generated by industrial and commercial operations
is not officially designated "hazardous waste," but can still be
considered dangerous.  As an example, oilfield drilling wastes are
not considered "hazardous wastes," despite their established
toxicity.<P>

Municipal incinerator ash may or may not be designated
"hazardous waste."  Upon these definitions rest millions of
dollars: in costs to waste generators and in opportunities for
environmental management companies.  Still, there are approximately
1400 National Priority List or "Superfund" sites: chemically
poisoned locations abandoned by their owners and left to the
government to make safe.  The EPA has identified nearly 2,500
additional sites that will eventually require remediation.  Worse,
some analysts say this is only the tip of the iceberg.  There may
be as many as 425,000 potentially hazardous waste sites.  Some
people or organizations, including those who should know better,
are calling for a technological retrenchment, and a retreat from
the progress made during the last hundred years.  Others point out
that "technology got us into this, and technology will get us out."<P>

Until the early seventies, acceptable ways to treat hazardous
wastes included dilution and unsecure containment in landfills that
were often little more than town dumps.  Hazardous wastes routinely
entered municipal wastewater treatment systems, or the groundwater,
or the soil.  This "no tech" waste treatment prevailed until the
federal government, mainly through the EPA, began requiring more
stringent treatment.<P>

Today, the hazardous waste treatment situation is in transition.  Dozens of advanced or "high tech" hazardous waste treatment techniques are on the verge of commercialization.  Approximately $20 billion dollars annually are spent dealing with the nation's hazardous waste situation.  The advanced hazardous waste market is a fraction of this total, but
among the technologies that make up the market are processes and
designs that will grow to dominate the overall hazardous waste
market in coming years.  This report examines these new techniques.
Will they solve the problem?  How soon will they displace existing
waste treatment techniques?  What are the most promising markets?<P>

<B>Reasons for Doing the Study</B><P>

This Business Opportunity Report is intended to be a complete,
technical, economic, and business document and is designed to
provide information of a professional nature.  The technical data
are dependent on the accuracy of the manufacturers and technical
sources that helped make up the BCC database.  This report is not
intended to constitute a legal or accounting document, nor is it an
endorsement of any given product or process.  The authors, and BCC
Inc., as the publisher, assume no liability for loss or damage as
a result of reliance on this material.  BCC wishes to thank all of
the environmental management industry professionals who cooperated
in the preparation of this report.<P>

<B>Contribution of the Study and for Whom</B><P>

This report will be valuable to those involved in the generation or
management of hazardous or potentially hazardous wastes.
Generators include municipalities, industries, commercial
establishments, and government entities engaged in manufacturing,
mining, farming, transportation, or any other waste-producing
activity.  Environmental management companies include businesses
collecting and transporting wastes or operating on-site treatment
or disposal facilities, commercial waste management facilities, and
government agencies regulating these activities.  At the same time,
the report serves as an introduction to the environmental
management industry for the engineering, chemical, and
biotechnology research and development industries. These end users
will learn the extent of the U.S. hazardous waste problem, and what
kind of "high tech" solutions are possible or aren't.  Valuable
information is also provided for investors, insurance
investigators, legislators, and underwriters.<P>

<B>Scope and Format</B><P>

This Business Opportunity Report examines five main advanced waste
treatment technologies:<P>

<UL>Advanced incineration<BR>
Advanced containment<BR>
Advanced microbial treatment<BR>
Advanced chemical treatment<BR>
Advanced separation</UL><P>

These five designations were chosen because they characterize
essentially all developmental efforts to come to grips with the
hazardous waste treatment problem.<P>

In addition, the advanced recycling and waste minimization
situation is examined, especially with respect to how these five
technologies can be used to reduce hazardous waste generation, not
merely treat or remediate it.  The report explains what makes a
given treatment "high tech," then describes and defines each of
these technologies as market sub-sectors of the overall "high tech"
waste treatment market.  Recent advances, including specific
examples and material provided by the companies involved are
discussed.  Promising developmental technology, the cutting edge of
high tech hazardous waste treatment, is outlined.  Particularly
promising examples are covered with examples and progress reports.<P>

Finally, a market analysis of the five groups shows which
technologies will pay off over the next ten years.  These markets
are discussed with respect to existing commercial activity.
Company profiles for significant companies involved in the high
tech hazardous waste treatment industry are provided.  These range
from descriptions of product lines and contact information to
detailed analysis of sales, locations, and research progress.
These markets are placed in perspective with an overview of the
history of the hazardous waste management situation, including
legislation.  EPA and industry assessments (benchmarks) of the U.S.
residential, commercial, and industrial hazardous waste management
situation are provided.  A summary of the international situation
is included.<P>

Environmental management companies using biotechnology are
identified and profiled.  These range from descriptions of product
lines and contact information to detailed analysis of sales,
locations, and recent activities.  A chronology of waste management
industry mergers is provided.<P>

<B>Methodology</B><P>

Throughout the report, past market data is expressed in current
dollars, and estimates and predictions in constant 1992 dollars.
Estimated 1991 expenditures, along with predictions for 1992 and
1997 are provided.  Market summaries are based on a consensus
scenario that assumes no extraordinary moves toward waste
minimization and no unexpected legislation.  Totals are rounded to
the nearest ten million. In many cases, the market is divided into
expenditures for ongoing "operation" costs, and one-time
expenditures for "construction," including one-time engineering
services.  When appropriate, information from previously published
sources is identified to allow a more detailed examination by
clients.<P>

<B>Information Sources</B><P>

This report update is based on an extensive literature review,
patent examination, discussions with commercial and government
sources, attendance at technical conferences, and an analysis of
manufacturers and markets.  Waste Treatment Technology News, a
monthly newsletter founded by this report's project analyst and
published by BCC, serves as a valuable secondary source.    The
project analyst also draws on years of hands-on experience, both in
the lab and in the field, as a waste management analyst and
consultant.  BCC has published a number of general and specific
Business Opportunity Reports concerning the environmental
management and biotechnology industry, and a catalog of these
reports is available.  Of particular interest are:<P>

<UL>C-038R  The Huge Conventional Waste Management Business<BR>
C-110  Environmental Management Through Biotechnology<BR>

<B>STUDY GOAL AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>

Microorganisms have been used to treat human wastes from a very
early time.  Sewage treatment is based on the enhancement of
naturally-occurring human bacteria.  Biodegradation naturally
occurs in landfills, even hazardous waste landfills.  Advanced
microbial treatment includes a variety of techniques involving
bacteria, fungi, or other microorganisms.  Microorganisms are
responsible for much of the natural degradation that slowly
remediates contaminants released into the environment.  There are
a number of specific mechanisms involved.  These include
biodegradation (often through the biosynthesis of enzymes),
accumulation, biologically-induced precipitation, bioenhanced
filtration, formation of biological barriers, and bioregeneration
of granular activated carbon.  Any of these techniques could
potentially be improved by genetically altering the microorganisms
involved.  Currently, microorganisms are "improved" through
selective breeding.  Someday, it could be possible to design
microorganisms for a specific waste stream or treatment task.
Although sophisticated selective breeding of microorganisms is now
routine, true genetic engineering remains developmental.  This BCC
Business Opportunity Report updates a technical market study
originally prepared in 1989.  Since then, a number of developmental
processes have been commercialized.  Other processes have been
limited by legislation or competition from alternative
environmental management techniques.<P>

<B>REASONS FOR DOING THE STUDY</B><P>

This Business Opportunity Report is intended to be the most
complete, technical, economic and business document of this type on
this subject and is designed to provide information of a
professional nature.  The technical data are dependent on the
accuracy of the manufacturers and technical sources that helped
make up the BCC database.  This report is not intended to
constitute a legal or accounting document, nor is it an endorsement
of any given product or process.  The authors, and BCC Inc., as the
publisher, assume no liability for loss or damage as a result of
reliance on this material.  BCC wishes to thank all of the
environmental management and biotechnology industry  professionals
who cooperated in the preparation of this report.<P>

<B>CONTRIBUTION OF THE STUDY AND FOR WHOM</B><P>

This extensive and comprehensive report will be valuable to those
involved in the generation or management of municipal, commercial,
or industrial wastes.  Generators include municipalities, industry,
commercial establishments, and government entities engaged in
manufacturing, mining, farming, transportation or any other waste-
producing activity.  Environmental management companies include
businesses collecting and transporting wastes, operating on-site
treatment or disposal facilities, commercial waste management
facilities, or government agencies regulating these activities.  At
the same time, it serves as an introduction to the environmental
management industry for the biotechnology research and development
industry. Valuable information is also provided for investors,
insurance investigators, legislators and underwriters.<P>

<B>SCOPE & FORMAT</B><P>

This Business Opportunity Report divides the environmental
management market into the municipal wastewater,  municipal solid
waste, hazardous waste, and waste-to-energy sub-sectors.  The
existing technology base and developmental technology situation is
analyzed, along with a market analysis. The biotechnology market is
divided into the microorganisms, equipment, and services sub-
sectors. The scope of the R&D market is assessed.  Biotechnology
activity at leading environmental management companies is
summarized.  Environmental management activity at leading
biotechnology companies is summarized.  An international
perspective of the U.S. market is provided.  Leading microbial
waste treatment companies are profiled.  These range from
descriptions of product lines and contact information to detailed
analysis of sales, locations, and recent activities.  A chronology
of waste management industry mergers is provided.<P>

These markets are placed in perspective with an overview of the
history of the waste management situation, including legislation.
EPA and industry assessments (benchmarks) of the U.S. residential,
commercial, and industrial waste management situation are provided.<P>


<B>METHODOLOGY</B><P>

Throughout the report, past market data is expressed in current
dollars, and estimates and predictions in constant 1993 dollars.
Estimated 1992 expenditures, along with predictions for 1998 are
provided.  Market summaries are based on a consensus scenario that
assumes no extraordinary moves toward waste minimization and no
unexpected legislation.  Totals are rounded to the nearest ten
million. In many cases, the market is divided into expenditures for
ongoing "operation" costs, and one-time expenditures for
"construction," including one-time engineering services.  When
appropriate, information from previously published sources is
identified to allow a more detailed examination by clients.<P>

<B>INFORMATION SOURCES</B><P>

This report is based on an extensive literature review, patent
examination, discussions with commercial and government sources,
attendance at technical conferences, and an analysis of
manufacturers and markets.  Waste Treatment Technology News, and
Applied Genetics News, monthly newsletters published by BCC, serve
as valuable secondary sources.  The author also draws on years of
hands-on experience, both in the lab and in the field, as a waste
management analyst and consultant.  BCC has published a number of
general and specific Business Opportunity Reports concerning the
environmental management and biotechnology industry, and a catalog
of these reports is available.  Of particular interest are:<P>

The report's project analyst, Donald Saxman, edited the BCC monthly
newsletter Waste Treatment Technology News, as well as several
other BCC newsletters.  Mr. Saxman has fourteen years' experience
in market analysis, freelance technical writing and newsletter
editing.  Since 1983, he has operated as a full-time technical
market consultant and subcontractor to BCC.  Previous experience
includes supervision of a quality control laboratory at a major
secondary lead refinery and experience as an analytical chemist at
a hazardous waste testing service.  Since 1991, Mr. Saxman has been
involved in the design of the water treatment system for the Space
Station Freedom.  His experience in both technical and commercial
operations is especially useful when explaining technical
situations to businessmen, as well as when explaining market and
business-related factors to technical personnel.<P>

<B>STUDY GOALS AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>

This report considers the intersection of two markets: the catalyst industry
and the environmental management industry.  These two industries are driven by
some similar and some fundamentally dissimilar market forces.  In general, the
catalyst industry is driven by cost-effectiveness.  A successful catalyst must
promote or allow a chemical reaction to occur more easily (in practice, more
cheaply).  Cost control is also important in the environmental management
industry.  In the majority of cases, however, environmental expenditures are
driven by legislation.  Catalysts are used in over 90% of all U.S.
petrochemical, chemical, and pharmaceutical processes.  Because they are so
widely used, catalyst technology has always been an important environmental
management consideration.  A number of specific environmental management
technologies rely completely on catalytic processes.  With this in mind, this
Business Opportunity Report divides the environmental management catalyst
market into the following sectors and sub-sectors:<P>

<UL><LI>  CATALYSTS FOR AIR POLLUTION ABATEMENT
      <UL><LI>   Catalysts for stationary air pollution abatement
      <LI>   Catalysts for mobile air pollution abatement</UL>

 <LI>  CATALYSTS FOR SOLID WASTE AND WASTEWATER MANAGEMENT
     <UL><LI>   Inorganic solid waste and wastewater management catalysts
      <LI>  Waste management biocatalysts and enzymes
      <LI>  Incineration catalysts</UL>

   <LI>  CATALYSTS FOR WASTE MINIMIZATION
    <UL><LI>   Catalyst recycling and recharging
      <LI>   Catalysts for alternative fuel production
      <LI>  Catalysts for process enhancement</UL></UL><P>

<B>SCOPE & FORMAT</B><P>

Each environmental management catalyst market sector and sub-sector is
defined.  In each the market target is presented and competing technologies
are reviewed.  A detailed market analysis includes background, technology,
companies involved, and recent developments. Finally, a market prediction is
presented.  The markets for the catalytic materials used during environmental
management are also considered separately and are cross-referenced to
environmental management market sectors.

These markets are placed in perspective with an overview of the history of the
waste management situation, including legislation.  EPA and industry
assessments (benchmarks) of the U.S. residential, commercial, and industrial
waste management situation are provided. The trend toward waste minimization
by  consumers, and commercial, municipal, and industrial operators is
discussed in terms of long term catalyst opportunities.<P>

International aspects of the environmental catalyst market are discussed.
Legislative and technological market drivers are compared and contrasted.
Leading environmental catalyst companies are profiled.  These profiles range
from descriptions of product lines and contact information to detailed
analysis of sales, locations, and recent activities.<P>

<B>METHODOLOGY</B><P>

Throughout the report, past market data is expressed in current dollars, and
estimates and predictions are in constant 1993 dollars.  Estimated 1992
expenditures, along with predictions for 1993 and 1998 are provided.  Unless
otherwise indicated, market predictions are based on a consensus scenario that
assumes no extraordinary moves toward waste minimization, no unexpected
legislation, and no large swings in platinum group metal prices. Totals are
rounded to the nearest five million dollars.<P>

<B>INFORMATION SOURCES</B><P>

This report is based on an extensive literature review, patent examination,
discussions with commercial and government sources, attendance at technical
conferences, and an analysis of manufacturers and markets.  Waste Treatment
Technology News, a monthly newsletter published by BCC, served as a valuable
secondary source.  The author also draws on years of hands-on experience, both
in the lab and in the field, as an environmental management analyst and
consultant.  BCC has published a number of general and specific Business
Opportunity Reports concerning the environmental management and biotechnology
industry, and a catalog of these reports is available.  Of particular interest are:<P>

<UL>C-110R, Bioremediation of Hazardous Wastes, Wastewater, and Municipal Waste<P>

   C-059R, Hazardous Waste Control: Advanced Waste Management Technology<P>

   C-038R, The Huge Conventional Waste Management Business<P>

   GB-127, The Solid Waste Recycling Business<P>

   Z3C-147, The Enzyme Industry: A Comprehensive Outlook of Industrial and
   Specialty Enzymes<P>

   E-049R, Air Pollution Monitors and Monitoring Systems<P></UL>


<B>REASONS FOR DOING THE STUDY</B><P>

This Business Opportunity Report is intended to be the most complete,
technical, economic and business document of this type on this subject and is
designed to provide information of a professional nature.  The technical data
are dependent on the accuracy of the manufacturers and technical sources that
helped make up the BCC database.  This report is not intended to constitute a
legal or accounting document, nor is it an endorsement of any given product or
process.  The authors, and BCC Inc., as the publisher, assume no liability for
loss or damage as a result of reliance on this material.  BCC wishes to thank
all of the environmental management and catalyst industry  professionals who
cooperated in the preparation of this report.<P>

<B>CONTRIBUTION OF THE STUDY AND FOR WHOM</B><P>

This report will be valuable to those involved in the generation or management
of municipal, commercial, or industrial wastes, as well as the catalyst
companies that serve these generators.  Generators include municipalities,
industry, commercial establishments, and government entities engaged in
manufacturing, mining, farming, transportation or any other waste-producing
activity.  Automotive and "smokestack" industries should find the report
particularly useful.  Environmental management companies include businesses
collecting and transporting wastes, operating on-site treatment or disposal
facilities, commercial waste management facilities, or government agencies
regulating these activities.  Valuable information is also provided for
investors, insurance investigators, legislators and underwriters.<P>

<B>RELATED BCC WORK CREDENTIALS</B><P>

<B>STUDY GOAL AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>

Municipal solid waste (MSW) is increasing in volume at an
estimated 1.3% per year while landfill space in many regions is
continually shrinking. An estimated 30% of the nation's
landfills are expected to fill to capacity by 1991 or be shut
down for failing regulatory standards. With only about one-third
of needed capacity to make up the shortfall being added each
year, waste managers in certain municipalities, industries and
institutions are being forced to consider alternative options to
dumping waste in landfills.<P>

Specifically, this report deals with waste to energy (WTE) as
one option, a method for incinerating and recovering heat used
for the generation of steam or electricity for use or sale. The
report evaluates WTE as a response by different types of waste
generators to the disposal demands made by regulators,
legislators, environmentalists and citizens. This response, in
turn, is evaluated chiefly in economic terms by the waste
generator, in accordance with the particular type of waste
generated at the site.<P>

In addition to WTE, the options for municipal solid waste
managers facing problems with in-state landfills include
recycling or shipping waste to out-of-state landfills, both of
which have benefits and drawbacks. There can be high
transportation and tipping fees for these landfills, and there
are even state and federal efforts to ban waste imports.
Everything is not recyclable, and only a certain percentage of
recyclables will, in fact, be recycled. Similarly, all types of
waste cannot be incinerated, used for heat recovery or sold as
energy. Finally, landfills cannot be entirely eliminated because
they play a vital role as dumping grounds for ash produced from
incineration.<P>

For waste managers in industries and institutions, who often
have to deal with liquid, sludge and fume wastes in addition to
solid waste, the choice is basically between treatment on-site
or off-site. On-site incineration and heat recovery systems
allow companies and institutions to use steam or electricity for
their own needs and save on energy costs, a boon when
conventional fossil fuels are especially high.<P>

Or the waste can be sent off-site to a landfill that is charging
increasingly high disposal rates, or to some type of off-site
facility that collects it and either disposes of it by
incineration only or uses it to produce energy for sale. These
facilities can be regional centers set up for a particular type
of waste, such as medical waste, independent power producers, or
large industries or institutions that help smaller
establishments cope with disposal problems at lower  costs than
landfill fees.<P>


<B>REASONS FOR DOING THE STUDY</B><P>

Manufacturers of incineration systems, heat and gas recovery
systems and air pollution control equipment, as well as
companies providing various services, such as waste handlers,
landfill operators and engineering firms, have an interest in
understanding how WTE is being considered by waste managers.
With regulations being the major driving force on municipalities
and industries to find alternatives to dumping in landfills, it
is necessary to evaluate how and why WTE is viewed positively or
negatively by each end-user.<P>

Since each end-user has its own needs and interests in using
waste to produce energy, it is first necessary to explore these
needs and interests in order to determine how they fit into
economic and regulatory pressures. In addition, there are a host
of other factors that each market must weigh before a purchasing
decision is made, such as variations in waste volume due to
changing business and industry conditions, changing needs for
energy end-products, size of the waste generator, and possible
community opposition.<P>

Once insight has been gained into current needs, it is possible
to suggest future needs and interests in WTE. The assumption is
that this information will be of value and import to those
companies interested in sustaining their participation, as well
as to those considering entry into any segment.<P>


<B>CONTRIBUTION OF THE STUDY</B><P>

BCC sought to provide insight into one key question:  How can
WTE simultaneously be used to satisfy the demands of regulators
and environmentalists, be economical to waste generators
themselves, and  be profitable to the manufacturers and service
providers that supply the systems and equipment?<P>
 
In order to make this evaluation, BCC first delineates the
nature of the problem; how and why shrinking landfill space
requires new methods of waste disposal for each market segment;
how regulatory, economic, social and political factors exert
their influence on waste managerial decisions; how each type of
waste is capable of being used for certain end-users and energy
end-products; how each type of technology is best suited for
each type of waste, disposal method and value in meeting air
pollution regulations; how the regulatory climate so strongly
drives the market that uncertainty about new regulations can put
projects on hold while well-defined standards create strong
demand; how municipal plants, industries and institutions can
accrue economic and environmental benefits from WTE; how
purchasing decisions are influenced not only by overall market
forces and general economic conditions, but also by the size of
a site and amount of waste generated, and benefits and
deficiencies specifically related to each type of WTE system.<P>


<B>SCOPE AND FORMAT</B><P>

This report is limited to examining non-hazardous waste that
would be dumped in municipal landfills if not treated otherwise.
The WTE industry is comprised of separate and discrete
industries dealing with incineration and heat recovery systems
for one or more types of waste, end-users and energy
end-products. The precise nature of each type of waste dictates
the systems and equipment required, as well as posing
limitations and possibilities for each type of end-user.<P>

<B>METHODOLOGIES</B><P>

BCC first estimates the number and types of incineration and
heat recovery systems purchased for use with each type of waste,
then suggests estimates and projections based upon regulatory,
marketing, community and political influences exerted on each
waste type.<P>


<B>INFORMATION SOURCES</B><P>

BCC conducted an extensive review of the literature and then
supplemented the review with more than one hundred telephone
interviews.  Interviewees included personnel in local, state and
federal government agencies, trade and professional
organizations, manufacturers of incineration and heat recovery
systems, air pollution equipment, engineering firms, waste
handlers and municipal plant operators.<P>

<B>STUDY GOAL AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>

The goal of this report is to provide a detailed and
comprehensive multi-client study of the U.S. market for clean
coal technologies, products, and systems and potential
business opportunities.  The objectives include a thorough
coverage of the underlying social, political, economic,
energy, and environmental issues driving the clean coal
technology and air pollution control business, as well as
assessments of new and potential products and systems.
Another important objective is to provide realistic market
data and forecasts for low-sulfur coal, related air pollution
control equipment, instrumentation, and related chemical
technologies.<P>

<B>REASONS FOR DOING THE STUDY</B><P>

The main reason for doing this study is that during the past
five years there has been a growing concern about the
environment in the United States.  This has manifested itself
in the emergence of Green political initiatives and an
expanding number of environmental standards, air emission
targets, and regulations.   For the clean coal technology
business, the most important has been the passage into law of
the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.  Recent directions in
the legislative and regulatory arena indicate that
environmental pressures -- despite the recession -- remain
important to the public and legislators.   In addition, it is
assumed that these pressures will intensify in the years to
come, engendering further changes in the clean coal technology
business.<P>

<B>SCOPE AND FORMAT</B><P>

The clean coal technology industry is not a precisely defined
sector and has not yet been assigned in any of the major
economic classification codes or activities.  Indeed, even air
pollution control and environmental protection does not fit
any one standard definition or classification.  Air pollution
control is usually defined as including the suppliers of
equipment, technologies, products, and services which monitor,
prevent, and limit damage to air quality.  Clean coal
technology would deal with those technologies, products, and
services that monitor, prevent, and limit damage to air
quality arising from the burning of coal.  This is the
definition of the industry used in this report which includes
"end-of-pipe" air pollution control equipment, instrumentation
and monitoring equipment, low-sulfur coal, and chemical
products used in coal desulfurization and denitrification.<P>

Basically, the scope of the report is limited to those goods
which monitor, prevent, and limit damage from air pollution
arising from combustion of coal at stationary sources such as
electric power generation plants and industrial facilities.
The scope of the report does not include the cost of ancillary
equipment and components (piping, wire and cable, electrical
devices, etc.), construction-related costs (field erection and
construction labor, concrete foundations, sitework, etc.), and
general engineering and environmental services.  Many of these
technologies and chemicals can be used to treat flue gases
arising from the combustion of other fossil fuels.  To the
furthest extent possible, revenues associated with
technologies to reduce sulfur dioxide and nitrous oxide
emissions from these other fossil fuels are not included
within the scope of this report.<P>

As the number of environmental issues of major concern
increase, the definition proposed by some industry observers
has been broadened to include the supply of energy-efficient
equipment, which contribute to reducing greenhouse gas and
other emissions.  This report does not include this type of
equipment because to a certain extent the substitutionary
adoption of such technologies may be motivated by financial
incentives rather than environmental policy initiatives.  In
addition, the report does not include advanced clean coal
technologies such as fluidized bed combustion (FBC),
pressurized fluidized bed combustion, (PFBC) integrated
gasification combined-cycle (IGCC), and other advanced coal
conversion/-combustion technologies.  The report also does not
include chemicals used in traditional coal preparation
processes (wet-washing, froth flotation, etc.).<P>

Within the report some duplication does exist.  Revenue
estimates of catalysts used in selective catalyst reduction
(SCR) systems are presented in the section dealing with
chemicals.  The reported revenues include catalysts used for
both the initial "charging" of these systems and replacement
demand.  In the section dealing with SCR systems, the revenue
estimates of the SCR systems reflect their net sales value,
about 60 to 70 percent the value of which is catalysts.  This
duplication is taken care of in the summary by removing the
value of catalysts -- about $25 million in 1993 -- from the
total.<P>

The scope of this report is comprehensive, covering the
present status of and future prospects for clean coal
technologies in the United States.  It covers the many issues
concerning the merits and future prospects of the clean coal
technology business, including low-sulfur coal, technologies
and equipment  for sulfur dioxide and nitrous oxide removal,
ESP upgrades, boiler modifications, instrumentation and
monitoring, and related chemical products.  It also covers in
detail the socio-political, economic, energy, and
environmental issues that so many regard as critical to the
industry's current state of change.  The report provides a
review of the clean coal technology industry, its structure
and the many companies involved in supplying these goods.
The competitive position of the main players in the market and
the strategic options they face are also discussed, as well as
such competitive factors as marketing, technical services,
distribution, and operations.  The report also looks at the
varieties of basic research, product development, and
commercialization that are being conducted in the area of
clean coal technology.<P>

The value of revenues for clean coal technology products -- in
million of U.S. dollars -- represents the value of the
products sold.  This value reflects the net sales price,
f.o.b. plant or mine, to the customer, net of discounts,
allowances, and freight charges.  As used in this study, the
term revenues is equivalent to, and used interchangeably with,
the terms demand and sales.  During the discussion of the
individual market segments, revenues are related to indicators
in the tables which are  used for comparative purposes.  They
do not imply that the indicator used (e.g. electric utilities'
new plant and equipment expenditures) represents the sole
market for that product.<P>

All growth rates mentioned in the tables and in the text are
based on the average annual rate of growth from 1993 through
1998 or from 1998 to the year 2003.  The compounding method of
calculating growth rates is used.  Because current dollar
measures are used, these growth rates thus reflect the growth
in volume or real growth and the growth including the effects
of price changes and changes in product mix.  The effects of
inflation are  eliminated by including unit sales data or by
the use of price indexes to provide measures of real growth.<P>

<B>CONTRIBUTION OF THE STUDY</B><P>

This study provides the most complete accounting of ongoing
clean coal technology developments in the United States
currently available in a multi-client format.  It provides the
most thorough and up-to-date assessment that can be found
anywhere on the subject.  The study also provides extensive
quantification of the many important facets of the market
developments in the United States for clean coal technologies,
products, equipment, and systems.  This, in turn, contributes
to the determination of what kind of strategic response
companies may adopt in order to compete in this dynamic
market.<P>

<B>INFORMATION SOURCES</B><P>

Initially, a comprehensive and exhaustive search of the
literature on clean coal technology was conducted.  These
secondary sources included technical journals, technical
books, marketing literature, other product/promotional
literature, annual reports, security analyst reports, and
other publications.  In addition, there were formal and
informal interviews with coal producers, electric utilities,
air pollution control equipment producers, instrumentation
producers, suppliers of environmental services, technical
experts, government officials, trade association officials,
and personnel of the companies themselves.<P>

<B>STUDY GOAL AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>

The goal of this report is to provide a detailed and comprehensive
multi-client study of the European air pollution control markets
and potential business opportunities.  The objectives include a
thorough coverage of the underlying social, political, economic,
energy, and environmental issues driving the air pollution control
business, as well as assessments of new and potential products and
systems.  Another important objective is to provide realistic
market data and forecasts for air pollution control equipment,
instrumentation, and environmental services.<P>


<B>REASONS FOR DOING THE STUDY</B><P>

The main reason for doing this study is that during the past five
years there has been a growing concern about the environment in
Western Europe.  This has manifested itself in the emergence of
Green political parties and an expanding number of environmental
standards, emissions targets, directives, rules, and regulations.
 Recent directions in the legislative and regulatory arena indicate
that environmental pressures -- despite the recession -- remain
important to the public and legislators.  In addition, it is
assumed that these pressures will intensify in the years to come,
engendering further changes in the air pollution control business.<P>


<B>SCOPE AND FORMAT</B><P>

The air pollution control industry is not a precisely defined
sector and has not yet been assigned in any of the major economic
classification codes or activities.  It is usually defined as
including the suppliers of equipment, technologies, products, and
services which monitor, prevent, and limit damage to air quality.
This is the definition of the industry that is used in this report,
which includes "end-of-pipe" air pollution control equipment,
instrumentation and monitoring equipment, and related environmental
services.<P>  

Basically, the scope of the report is limited to those
goods and services which monitor, prevent, and limit damage from
air pollution arising from stationary sources (electric power fuel
combustion, industrial boilers and processes, etc.).  The value of
engineering services is limited to that work associated with air
pollution control equipment and instrumentation.  It also includes
other environmental services (environmental impact assessment,
computer modeling, environmental auditing, etc.).  The scope of the
report does not include the cost of ancillary equipment and
components (piping, wire and cable, electrical devices, etc.),
construction-related costs (field erection and construction labor,
concrete foundations, sitework, etc.), and general engineering
services (i.e. for the whole project).  As a result, the data
presented will not be comparable to national income and product
account (GDP)  data.  In addition, air pollution control devices for motor
vehicles are also not included within the scope of this report.<P>

As the number of environmental issues of major concern increases,
the definition proposed by some industry observers has been
broadened to include the supply of energy-efficient equipment,
which contributes to reducing greenhouse gas emissions.  This
report does not include this type of equipment (e.g. fluid bed
combustion) because to a certain extent the substitutionary
adoption of such technologies may be motivated by financial
incentives rather than environmental policy initiatives. The same
is true for efficient appliances, alternative propellants for
chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), alternative-fueled vehicles (AFVs), and
clean fuels, among other goods.<P>

The scope of this report is comprehensive, covering the present
status of and future prospects for air pollution control goods and
services in France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, the
United Kingdom, and other national/regional markets in Europe.  It
covers the many issues concerning the merits and future prospects
of the air pollution control business, including air pollution
control equipment for particulate removal and gas treatment,
instrumentation, and related environmental services.  In addition,
the report covers the electric power, chemical, petroleum, pulp and
paper, and other industries in which these air pollution control
goods and services are used.<P>

It also covers in detail the socio-political, economic, energy, and environmental issues that so many
regard as critical to the industry's current state of change.  The
report provides a review of the air pollution control industry, its
structure and the many companies involved in supplying these goods
and services.   The competitive position of the main players in the
market and the strategic options they face are also discussed, as
well as such competitive factors as marketing, technical services,
distribution, and operations.  The roles of major multinational
companies and vertical integration by supplying companies are
considered as well.  The report also looks at the varieties of
basic research, product development, and commercialization that are
being conducted in the area of air pollution control.<P>

Unless noted otherwise, all figures represent revenues from the
sale or provision of these air pollution control goods and services
in millions of constant 1992 U.S. Dollars.  The adoption of a
constant currency measure eliminates the effect of inflation and
thus provides a more realistic assessment of real opportunities.
Other indicators (population and emissions) are presented in the
unit of measure as noted in the table or text.<P>

The use of exchange rates to convert foreign currencies into U.S.
Dollars has some inherent flaws, largely because (1) exchange rates
between currencies are reflective of only internationally traded
goods and not the entire economy, and (2) because exchange rates
depend upon capital flows and can fluctuate widely from year to
year.  Consequently, they may not reflect actual differences in
living standards and the purchasing power of a currency.  In this
report, foreign currencies are converted into U.S. Dollars through
the use of ratios that better reflect the purchasing power parity
(PPP) of a currency.<P>

By nation, these ratios are as follows:<P>
<UL>Austria (11.71 Schillings = $1.00)<BR> 
Belgium-Luxembourg (34.46 Francs = $1.00)<BR> 
Denmark (6.40 Krone = $1.00)<BR> 
Finland (4.03 Markka = $1.00)<BR> 
France (5.63 Francs = $1.00)<BR>
Germany (1.664 Deustchemark = $1.00)<BR> 
Greece (171.8 Drachma = $1.00)<BR> 
Ireland (0.624 Pounds = $1.00)<BR> 
Italy (1234 Lira = $1.00)<BR> 
The Netherlands (1.917 Guilders = $1.00)<BR> 
Norway (6.38 Krone = $1.00)<BR> 
Portugal (142.9 Escudo =$1.00)<BR> 
Spain (104.7 Peseta = $1.00)<BR>
Sweden (5.95 Krona = $1.00)<BR>
Switzerland (1.440 Francs = $1.00)<BR> 
United Kingdom (0.566 Pounds Sterling = $1.00)</UL><P>

The value of revenues ($5.9 billion in 1992) for air pollution
control goods and services in Western Europe, in millions of
constant 1992 U.S. Dollars,  represents the actual transaction
prices between a supplier and the entity (company or government)
purchasing the good or service.  As used in this study, the term
revenues is equivalent to, and used interchangeably with, the terms
demand and sales.  During the discussion of the individual national
markets, revenues are related to indicators in the table which are
used for comparative purposes.  All growth rates mentioned in the
tables and in the text are based on the average annual rate of
growth from 1992 through 1997 or from 1997 to the year 2002.
Because constant dollar measures are used, these growth rates thus
reflect the growth in volume or real growth.  The effects of
inflation are thus eliminated. The compounding method of
calculating growth rates is used.<P>


<B>CONTRIBUTION OF THE STUDY</B><P>

This study provides the most complete accounting of ongoing air
pollution control developments in Western Europe currently
available in a multi-client format.  It provides the most thorough
and up-to-date assessment that can be found anywhere on the
subject.  The study also provides extensive quantification of the
many important facets of the market developments in Europe for air
pollution control.  This, in turn, contributes to the determination
of what kind of strategic response companies may adopt in order to
compete in this dynamic market.<P>


<B>INFORMATION SOURCES</B><P>

Initially, a comprehensive and exhaustive search of the literature
on air pollution control was conducted.  These secondary sources
included technical journals, technical books, marketing literature,
other product/promotional literature, annual reports, security
analyst reports, and other publications.  In addition, there were
formal and informal interviews with air pollution control equipment
producers, instrumentation producers, suppliers of environmental
services, technical experts, government officials, trade
association officials, and personnel of the companies themselves.<P>

<B>STUDY GOAL AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>

This report  is to  provides a  detailed and comprehensive multi-
client study  of the European water pollution control markets and
potential business  opportunities.    The  objectives  include  a
thorough coverage  of the underlying social, political, economic,
water use,  and environmental  issues driving the water pollution
control business,  as well  as assessments  of new  and potential
products and  systems.  Another important objective is to provide
realistic market  data and  forecasts for water pollution control
equipment, instrumentation, and environmental services.<P>


<B>REASONS FOR DOING THE STUDY</B><P>

The main reason for doing this study is that during the past five
years there  has been  a growing concern about the environment in
Western Europe.   This  has manifested itself in the emergence of
Green political  parties and an expanding number of environmental
standards, discharge targets, directives, rules, and regulations.
Recent  directions   in  the  legislative  and  regulatory  arena
indicate that environmental pressures -- despite the recession --
remain important to the public and legislators.   In addition, it
is assumed  that these  pressures will  intensify in the years to
come, engendering  further changes in the water pollution control
business.<P>


<B>SCOPE AND FORMAT</B><P>

The water  pollution control  industry is not a precisely defined
sector and has not yet been assigned in any of the major economic
classification codes  or activities.   It  is usually  defined as
including the suppliers of equipment, technologies, products, and
services which  monitor,  prevent,  and  limit  damage  to  water
quality.   This is the definition of the industry that is used in
this report  which includes "end-of-pipe" water pollution control
equipment   (filters,   clarifiers,   membrane   systems   etc.),
instrumentation   and    monitoring   equipment,    and   related
environmental services.   Basically,  the scope  of the report is
limited to  those goods and services which are designed to remove
pollutants from  an aqueous stream or body of water or to convert
the pollutant to a non- or less-polluting form prior to discharge
or use.  Put another way, goods and services for the treatment of
water and  effluents   at both  municipal  and  industrial  point
sources are included.  Non-point sources are not included.<P>

The value  of  engineering  services  is  limited  to  that  work
associated   with   water   pollution   control   equipment   and
instrumentation.   It also  includes other environmental services
(environmental    impact     assessment,    computer    modeling,
environmental auditing,  etc.).  The scope of the report does not
include the  cost of  ancillary equipment and components (piping,
wire and  cable, electrical  devices, etc.), construction-related
costs  (field   erection   and   construction   labor,   concrete
foundations, sitework,  etc.), and  general engineering  services
(i.e. for  the whole  project).   As a result, the data presented
will not  be comparable  to national  income and  product account
(GDP) data.   In  addition, water  management chemicals,  sorbant
materials and  other consumables are also not included within the
scope of this report.<P>

As the  number of environmental issues of major concern increase,
the definition  proposed by  some  industry  observers  has  been
broadened to  include the  supply of  clean technologies.    This
report does  not include these types of technologies (e.g. oxygen
bleaching in  pulp manufacture  as opposed to chlorine bleaching)
because to  a certain extent the substitutionary adoption of such
technologies  may   in  some  cases  be  motivated  by  financial
incentives rather than environmental policy initiatives.<P>

The scope  of this  report is comprehensive, covering the present
status of  and future prospects for water pollution control goods
and services  in France,  Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain,
the  United  Kingdom,  and  other  national/regional  markets  in
Europe.   It covers  the many  issues concerning  the merits  and
future  prospects   of  the  water  pollution  control  business,
including  water   pollution  control   equipment  for   primary,
secondary, and  advanced treatment,  instrumentation, and related
environmental services.   In  addition,  the  report  covers  the
municipal sector and the chemical, petroleum, pulp and paper, and
other industries in which these water pollution control goods and
services are used.  It also covers in detail the socio-political,
economic, energy, and environmental issues that so many regard as
critical to  the industry's  current state of change.  The report
provides a  review of  the water  pollution control industry, its
structure and  the many  companies involved  in  supplying  these
goods and  services.    The  competitive  position  of  the  main
players in  the market  and the  strategic options  they face are
also discussed, as well as such competitive factors as marketing,
technical services,  distribution, and  operations.  The roles of
major  multinational   companies  and   vertical  integration  by
supplying companies  are considered  as well.   The  report  also
looks at  the varieties  of basic  research, product development,
and commercialization  that are  being conducted  in the  area of
water pollution control.<P>

Unless noted  otherwise, all  figures represent revenues from the
sale or  provision of  these water  pollution control  goods  and
services in millions of constant 1992 U.S. Dollars.  The adoption
of a constant currency measure eliminates the effect of inflation
and  thus   provides  a   more  realistic   assessment  of   real
opportunities.  Other indicators (e.g. population and discharges)
are presented  in the  unit of  measure as  noted in the table or
text.<P>

The use of exchange rates to convert foreign currencies into U.S.
dollars has  some inherent  flaws, largely  because  1)  exchange
rates between  currencies are  reflective of only internationally
traded goods  and not the entire economy, and 2) because exchange
rates depend  upon capital  flows, and  can fluctuate widely from
year to year.  Consequently, they may not actually reflect actual
differences in  living standards  and the  purchasing power  of a
currency.   In this report, foreign currencies are converted into
U.S. dollars  through the  use of  ratios that better reflect the
purchasing power  parity (PPP)  of a  currency.  By nation, these
ratios are  as follows: <P>

<UL>Austria  (11.71  Schillings  =  $1.00)<BR>
Belgium-Luxembourg (34.46  Francs = $1.00)<BR>
 Denmark (6.40 Krone =
$1.00)<BR>
 Finland  (4.03 Markka  = $1.00)<BR>  France (5.63  Francs  =
$1.00)<BR>
 Germany  (1.664  Deutschemark  =  $1.00)<BR>
 Greece  (171.8
Drachma =  $1.00)<BR> Ireland  (0.624 Pounds  = $1.00)<BR>  Italy (1234
Lira =  $1.00)<BR> the  Netherlands (1.917 Guilders = $1.00)<BR> Norway
(6.38 Krone  = $1.00)<BR>  Portugal (142.9  Escudo =  $1.00)<BR>  Spain
(104.7 Peseta  = $1.00)<BR> Sweden (5.95 Krona = $1.00)<BR> Switzerland
(1.440 Francs  = $1.00)<BR>  and the  United Kingdom  (0.566  Pounds
Sterling = $1.00)<P></UL>

The value  of revenues  for water  pollution  control  goods  and
services in  Western Europe are expressed in millions of constant
1992 U.S.  dollars and   represent  the actual transaction prices
between  a  supplier  and  the  entity  (company  or  government)
purchasing the  good or service.  As used in this study, the term
revenues is  equivalent to,  and used  interchangeably with,  the
terms demand  and sales.  During the discussion of the individual
national markets, revenues are related to indicators in the table
which are   used  for comparative  purposes.   All  growth  rates
mentioned in  the tables and in the text are based on the average
annual rate  of growth from 1992 through 1997 or from 1997 to the
year 2002.   Because  constant dollar  measures are  used,  these
growth rates  thus reflect  the growth  in volume or real growth.
The effects  of inflation  are thus  eliminated. The  compounding
method of calculating growth rates is used.<P>


<B>CONTRIBUTION OF THE STUDY</B><P>

This study provides the most complete accounting of ongoing water
pollution  control   developments  in  Western  Europe  currently
available in  a  multi-client  format.    It  provides  the  most
thorough and  up-to-date assessment that can be found anywhere on
the subject.  The study also provides extensive quantification of
the many  important facets  of the  market developments in Europe
for water  pollution control.   This, in turn, contributes to the
determination of  what kind  of strategic  response companies may
adopt in order to compete in this dynamic market.<P>


<B>INFORMATION SOURCES</B><P>

Initially,  a   comprehensive  and   exhaustive  search   of  the
literature on  water pollution  control  was  conducted.    These
secondary sources  included technical  journals, technical books,
marketing  literature,   other  product/promotional   literature,
annual reports, security analyst reports, and other publications.
In addition, there were formal and informal interviews with water
pollution control equipment producers, instrumentation producers,
suppliers   of   environmental   services,   technical   experts,
government officials,  trade association officials, and personnel
of the companies themselves.<P>

<B>STUDY GOAL AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>

This report provides a detailed and comprehensive multi-client study of the
European waste management and soil pollution markets and potential business
opportunities. The objectives include a thorough coverage of the underlying
social, political, economic, and environmental issues driving the waste
management and soil pollution business, as well as assessments of new and
potential products and systems.  Another important objective is to provide
realistic market data and forecasts for solid and hazardous waste treatment
equipment, instrumentation, waste management services, soil remediation
services, and other environmental services.<P>



<B>REASONS FOR DOING THE STUDY</B><P>

The main reason for doing this study is that during the past five years there
has been a growing concern about the environment in Western Europe.  This has
manifested itself in the emergence of Green political parties and an expanding
number of environmental standards, directives, rules, and regulations.
Recent directions in the legislative and regulatory arena indicate that
environmental pressures -- despite the recession -- remain important to the
public and legislators.   In addition, it is assumed that these pressures will
intensify in the years to come, engendering further changes in the waste
management and soil pollution business.<P>



<B>SCOPE AND FORMAT</B><P>

The waste management and soil pollution goods and services industry is not a
precisely defined sector and has not yet been assigned in any of the major
economic classification codes or activities.  It is usually defined as
including the suppliers of equipment, technologies, products, and services
which monitor, prevent, and limit damage from wastes to soil or land quality.
Basically, the scope of the report is limited to those goods and services
which are designed to monitor, prevent, or remove pollutants from the land or
to convert the waste or pollutant to a non- or less-polluting form prior to
ultimate disposal or use.  This is the definition of the industry that is used
in this report, which includes equipment, instrumentation and monitoring,
waste management services, soil pollution services, and other related
environmental services.<P>

The scope of the report includes equipment for the management of  solid waste,
liquid, hazardous or toxic waste, and waste recycling. Such equipment includes
incineration and recycling equipment in addition to compactor trucks, tank
trucks, and related solid waste handling equipment.  Also included are related
instrumentation and monitoring equipment.<P>

Waste management services include all services to collect, transport, treat,
landfill, and dispose of refuse and solid, liquid, and other wastes from
homes, municipalities, commercial establishments, and industrial facilities.
In addition to household, commercial, and industrial wastes, this topic also
includes hazardous and medical wastes and can involve incineration and other
treatment methods.<P>

Soil pollution services include sanitation, reclamation of contaminated land
as well as evacuation, transportation, storage, and the disposal or treatment
of contaminated soil and other materials.  Thus, soil pollution services may
include some revenues (landfilling, incineration, etc.) that would
traditionally be classified under waste management services.<P>

The value of other engineering services is limited to that work associated
with waste treatment equipment and instrumentation.  It also includes other
environmental services (environmental impact assessment, computer modeling,
environmental auditing, etc.).<P>

The scope of the report does not include the cost of ancillary equipment
(containers, handling equipment, etc.) and components (piping, wire and cable,
electrical devices, etc.), construction-related costs (field erection and
construction labor, concrete foundations, sitework, etc.), and general
engineering services (i.e., for the whole project).  As a result, the data
presented will not be comparable to national income and product account (GDP)
data.<P>

As the number of environmental issues of major concern increase, the
definition proposed by some industry observers has been broadened to include
the supply of clean technologies.  This report does not include these types of
technologies (e.g., oxygen bleaching in pulp manufacture as opposed to
chlorine bleaching) because to a certain extent the substitutionary adoption
of such technologies may in some cases be motivated by financial incentives
rather than environmental policy initiatives.<P>

The scope of this report is comprehensive, covering the present status of and
future prospects for waste management and soil pollution goods and services in
France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, the United Kingdom, and other
national/regional markets in Europe.  It covers the many issues concerning the
merits and future prospects of the waste management and soil pollution
business, including waste treatment equipment for municipal, industrial, and
hazardous wastes, in addition to instrumentation, waste management services,
soil remediation services, and related environmental services.  It also covers
in detail the socio-political, economic, and environmental issues that so many
regard as critical to the industry's current state of change.<P>  

The report
provides a review of the waste management and soil pollution industry, its
structure, and the many companies involved in supplying these goods and
services.   The competitive position of the main  players in the market and
the strategic options they face are also discussed, as well as such
competitive factors as marketing, technical services, distribution, and
operations.  The roles of major multinational companies and vertical
integration by supplying companies are considered as well.  The report also
looks at the varieties of basic research, product development, and
commercialization that are being conducted in the area of waste management and
soil pollution services.<P>

Unless noted otherwise, all figures represent revenues from the sale or
provision of these waste management and soil pollution  goods and services in
millions of constant 1992 U.S. dollars.  The adoption of a constant currency
measure eliminates the effect of inflation and thus provides a more realistic
assessment of real opportunities.  Other indicators (population, wastes
generated, and recycling rates) are presented in the unit of measure as noted
in the table or text.<P>

The use of exchange rates to convert foreign currencies into U.S. dollars has
some inherent flaws, largely because 1) exchange rates between currencies are
reflective of only internationally traded goods and not the entire economy,
and 2) because exchange rates depend upon capital flows and can fluctuate
widely from year to year. Consequently, they may not reflect actual
differences in living standards and the purchasing power of a currency.  In
this report, foreign currencies are converted into U.S. dollars through the
use of ratios that better reflect the purchasing power parity (PPP) of a
currency.<P>  

By nation, these ratios are as follows:  

<UL>Austria (11.71 Schillings = $1.00)<BR>
Belgium-Luxembourg (34.46 Francs = $1.00)<BR> 
Denmark (6.40 Krone = $1.00)<BR>
Finland (4.03 Markka = $1.00)<BR>
France (5.63 Francs = $1.00)<BR>
Germany (1.664 Deutschemark = $1.00)<BR>
Greece (171.8 Drachma = $1.00)<BR>
Ireland (0.624 Pounds = $1.00)<BR>
Italy (1234 Lira = $1.00)<BR>
The Netherlands (1.917 Guilders = $1.00)<BR>
Norway (6.38 Krone = $1.00)<BR>
Portugal (142.9 Escudo = $1.00)<BR>
Spain (104.7 Peseta = $1.00)<BR>
Sweden (5.95 Krona = $1.00)<BR>
Switzerland (1.440 Francs = $1.00)<BR> 
United Kingdom (0.566 Pounds Sterling = $1.00)</UL><P>

The value of revenues ($25.6 billion in 1992) for waste management and soil
pollution goods and services in Western Europe, in millions of constant 1992
U.S. dollars, represents the actual transaction prices between a supplier and
the entity (company or government) purchasing the good or service.  As used in
this study, the term revenues is equivalent to, and used interchangeably with,
the terms demand and sales. During the discussion of the individual national
markets, revenues are related to indicators in the table which are used for
comparative purposes.  All growth rates mentioned in the tables and in the
text are based on the average annual rate of growth from 1992 through 1997 or
from 1997 to the year 2002.  Because constant dollar measures are used, these
growth rates thus reflect the growth in volume or real growth.  The effects of
inflation are thus eliminated. The compounding method of calculating growth
rates is used.<P>



<B>CONTRIBUTION OF THE STUDY</B><P>

This study provides the most complete accounting of ongoing waste management
and soil pollution developments in Western Europe currently available in a
multi-client format.  It provides the most thorough and up-to-date assessment
that can be found anywhere on the subject.  The study also provides extensive
quantification of the many important facets of the market developments in
Europe for waste management and soil pollution goods and services.  This, in
turn, contributes to the determination of what kind of strategic response
companies may adopt in order to compete in this dynamic market.<P>



<B>INFORMATION SOURCES</B><P>

Initially, a comprehensive and exhaustive search of the literature on waste
management and soil pollution was conducted.  These secondary sources included
technical journals, technical books, marketing literature, other
product/promotional literature, annual reports, security analyst reports, and
other publications.  In addition, there were formal and informal interviews
with waste treatment equipment producers, instrumentation producers, suppliers
of environmental services, technical experts, government officials, trade
association officials, and personnel of the companies themselves.<P>

</CENTER>

<B>REASONS FOR DOING THE STUDY</B><P>

The water pollution sensor and monitor market has not really been covered as a
whole in any market study.  There are many studies on water pollution
equipment in general, but little attention has been paid to taking a closer
look at the "business end" of maintaining water quality.  This study addresses
those short-comings by providing broad analysis of the markets, products and
suppliers for the product areas in question.<P>

There is a need for an analysis that shows how different types of water
pollution monitoring are used in different areas of environmental management.
There is also considerable market potential that has not been fully tapped.
New products that could enhance performance and productivity in different
areas of application have not yet been used by customers.  It has also been
found that there are a number of new niche markets for some products based on
different kinds of devices.  Part of this is also coming from new federal
regulations that will essentially boost sales in several product areas.<P>


<B>STUDY OBJECTIVES</B><P>

The basic objective of this study is to provide an overview of the different
markets for sensors, monitors and other devices used in water pollution
control.  How big is it? How many end users are there for the different types
of devices?  What are the important products and technologies? These are some
of the questions that need to be asked.<P>

Since this market has not been covered before, we discuss the basic principles
underlying the different technologies, along with the products that are on the
market, and the companies selling these products.  This also includes looking
at the markets for these products, and how those markets are likely to change.<P>

The market for these products is highly fragmented.  Any one of the variety of
applications and capabilities that are available to end users could be a
special study in itself.  Most of the products here make up small niche
markets.  But a number of them have the potential to grow into larger markets.<P>

The complexity of this market is compounded by a large number of product
variations and combinations that are available to the end user.  The most
basic products are items such as pH meters, and dissolved oxygen problems.
But a number of these include other measurement capabilities, even though they
do not necessarily constitute multiparameter devices, which is a different
product group altogether.<P>

These devices can be used in industry, in commerce, in municipalities, in
laboratories, in remote locations, and even in residential markets.  Moreover,
the various kinds of devices covered here can also be used in different kinds
of pre-treatment for any of the above application areas, as well as for
effluent discharge and other work involved in cleaning up waste streams.  So,
at its most basic, the objective of this study is to assess all these
different areas and determine their likely future directions.<P>


<B>CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE STUDY</B><P>

This is the first study ever that looks at the sensors, monitors and related
devices in water pollution control as a whole market.  Among its contributions
are the identification of areas of decline as well as areas of significant
growth.  It also contributes by bringing into one place much of the
information on many different products.  This gives a sense of how the overall
field has changed in the last several years.  Still another contribution is
that this study provides data on different market segments that are either
hardly covered or not covered at all.  Thus, this study is probably the only
source for many of the estimates about consumption of various products.<P>


<B>SCOPE OF THE STUDY</B><P>

This study evaluates technologies and markets as they relate to the market for
sensors, monitors and related devices used in water pollution control.  The
ways in which types of gas and liquid chromatography are conducted is
explained.  The current and projected sales for many different types of
products are considered as well.<P>

This study is intended to provide broad coverage of many different products
used in aspects of water pollution control.  Some emphasis is also given to
the kinds of new products that could develop in the next few years.
Regulatory factors are also discussed because of their impact on these
markets.<P>

<B>METHODOLOGY</B><P>

The first step was to conduct a comprehensive literature and patent search.
The literature included technical newsletters and journals, as well as many
other sources described below.<P>

The collected information was read, studied, analyzed and otherwise compared,
where appropriate, for consistency and feasibility.  A number of different
models were constructed considering different assumptions about the likely
developments that could occur in the market.  The assumptions were based on
the experience of the author, other analysts with extensive experience in
related areas, along with market knowledge learned in interviews of managers
in the supplier companies involved in these markets.<P>


Projections were based on such estimates as the current number of end users,
funding levels, potential end-users, likely unit prices and rates of
consumption.  Special cases were considered as well where competing
technologies might be involved or where other end user preferences might
become factors.  Estimates were also based on such things as demographic
factors and on square-foot-of-use for given types of applications.<P>


It should be pointed out that while many factors were considered in
constructing different models, the projections are ultimately speculative.  As
a composite of the opinions and assessments of interviewees, the author, other
analysts, and secondary sources, these projections represent something of a
consensus.  But all recognize that the relative importance of selected factors
could change at any time with new technologies and new products, and thus
change the direction of the market projections.<P>


<B>INFORMATION SOURCES</B><P>

A broad range of information sources was consulted in preparing this study.
These included newsletters, company literature, product literature, a host of
technical articles, journals, indices, abstracts, as well as trade magazines,
books, and reference guides.  Also, a number of different computer searches
were carried out, along with exhaustive investigations of databases by key
terminology.<P>

<B>STUDY GOALS AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>

The goal of this report is to provide a detailed and comprehensive multi-client
study of the U.S. market for VOC (volatile organic compound) technologies,
products, systems, and potential business opportunities.  The objectives
include a thorough coverage of the underlying social, political, economic, and
environmental issues driving the VOC control technology business, as well as
assessments of new and potential products and systems.  Another important
objective is to provide realistic market data and forecasts for these equipment
types, instrumentation, and related technologies.<P>


<b>REASONS FOR DOING THE STUDY</B><P>

The main reason for doing this study is that since the late-1980s there has
been a growing concern about the environment in the United States.  This has
manifested itself in the emergence of Green political initiatives and an
expanding number of environmental standards, air emissions targets, and
regulations.   For the VOC control technology business, the most important
has been the passage into law of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. 
Recent directions in the legislative and regulatory arena indicate that
environmental pressures -- despite the recession and slow economic
expansion -- remain important to the public and legislators.  In addition, it is
assumed that these pressures will intensify in the years to come, engendering
further changes in the VOC control technology business. <P>


<b>SCOPE AND FORMAT</B><P>

The VOC control technology industry is not a precisely defined sector and has 
not yet been assigned in any of the major economic classification codes or 
activities.  Indeed, even air pollution control and environmental protection 
does not fit any one standard definition or classification.  Air pollution 
control is usually defined as including the suppliers of equipment, 
technologies, products, and services which monitor, prevent, and limit damage 
to air quality. VOC control technology would deal with those technologies, 
products, and services which monitor, prevent, and limit damage to air quality 
arising from stationary industrial sources of VOCs.  This is the definition of 
the industry that is used in this report which includes "end-of-pipe" air 
pollution control equipment, instrumentation, and monitoring equipment.  This 
includes incineration, adsorption, absorption, condensation, and other VOC 
control technologies.  Equipment types include recuperative and regenerative 
thermal oxidizers, catalytic oxidizers, flares (ground, elevated, etc.), 
carbon adsorbers, scrubbers, and refrigerated condensers, among others. 
Basically, the scope of the report is limited to those goods which monitor, 
prevent, and limit damage from VOC emissions arising from stationary point 
sources accidental releases arising from the production process, storage and 
transfer as well as the use of solvents at chemical, oil refining, surface 
coating, and industrial and other facilities.<P>

The scope of the report 
includes some ancillary equipment (blowers, pumps, instruments, etc.) 
typically sold as part of an overall package.  The report, however, does not 
include the cost of ancillary components (piping, wire and cable, electrical 
devices, etc.), construction-related costs (field erection and construction 
labor, concrete foundations, site work, etc.), and general engineering and 
environmental services.  Some of these technologies (e.g. scrubbers) can be 
used to treat flue gases arising from the combustion of fossil fuels.  The 
inclusion of these costs would boost the overall fixed capital cost of 
removing VOCs by a factor of 2.5 to 4.5.  To the furthest extent possible, 
revenues associated with those VOC control technologies used to reduce sulfur 
dioxide and other emissions from fossil fuels are not included within the 
scope of this report.<P> 

As the number of environmental issues of major concern increase, the
definition proposed by some industry observers has been broadened to
include the supply of pollution prevention and waste minimization
technologies that contribute to reducing potential VOC emissions.  This report
does not include this type of equipment because to a certain extent the
substitutionary adoption of such technologies may be motivated by financial
incentives rather than environmental policy initiatives.  Nonetheless, special
emphasis is placed on the role of pollution prevention in reducing VOC
emissions.<P>

The scope of this report is comprehensive, covering the present status of and
future prospects for VOC control technologies in the United States.  It covers
the many issues concerning the merits and future prospects of the VOC
control technology business, including pollution prevention strategies,
technologies and equipment for VOC removal, as well as instrumentation and
monitoring.<P>  

It also covers in detail the socio-political, economic, and environmental 
issues that so many regard as critical to the industry's current state of 
change.  The report provides a review of the VOC control technology industry, 
its structure and the many companies involved in supplying these goods.  The 
competitive position of the main players in the market and the strategic 
options they face are also discussed, as well as such competitive factors as 
marketing, technical services, distribution, and operations.  The report also 
looks at the varieties of basic research, product development, and 
commercialization that are being conducted in the area of VOC control 
technology.<P> 

The value of revenues for VOC control technology systems and products -- in 
millions of U.S. dollars -- represents the value of the product sold.  This 
value reflects the net sales price, f.o.b. plant, to the customer, net of 
discounts, allowances, and freight charges.  As used in this report, the term 
revenues is equivalent to, and used interchangeably with, the terms purchases, 
demand and sales.  During the discussion of the individual market segments, 
revenues are related to indicators in the tables which are  used for 
comparative purposes.  They do not imply that the indicator used (e.g. non-
durable manufacturing new plant and equipment expenditures) represents the 
sole market for that product.  All growth rates mentioned in the tables and in 
the text are based on the average annual rate of growth from 1994 through the 
year 2000.  The compounding method of calculating growth rates is used. 
Because current dollar measures are used, these growth rates thus reflect the 
growth in volume or real growth and the growth including the effects of 
price changes and changes in product mix.  The effects of inflation are 
eliminated by including unit sales data or by the use of price indexes to 
provide measures of real growth.<P>  


<b>CONTRIBUTION OF THE STUDY</B><P>

This study provides the most complete accounting of ongoing VOC control
technology developments in the United States currently available in a multi-
client format.  It provides the most thorough and up-to-date assessment that
can be found anywhere on the subject.  The study also provides extensive
quantification of the many important facets of the market developments in the
United States for VOC control technologies, products, equipment, and
systems.  This, in turn, contributes to the determination of what kind of
strategic response companies may adopt in order to compete in this dynamic
market.<P> 


<b>INFORMATION SOURCES</B><P>

Initially, a comprehensive and exhaustive search of the literature on VOC
chemistry and technology was conducted.  These secondary sources included
technical journals, technical books, marketing literature, other product/
promotional literature, annual reports, security analyst reports, and other
publications.  In addition, there were formal and informal interviews with
chemical producers, oil refiners, air pollution control equipment producers,
instrumentation producers, suppliers of environmental services, technical
experts, government officials, trade association officials, and personnel of the
VOC control technology companies themselves.<P>

<B>BACKGROUND
</B><P>

Conformal coatings are widely used in the electronics industry for
environmental protection of PCBs from humidity, corrosive gases and
solvents, dust, sand, and other contaminants.  Traditionally, the
major market for conformal coatings has been the U.S. defense
electronic industry where the need for long-term, high reliability
demanded the presence of environmental, electrically-insulative
coatings.  The original military specification for conformal
coating dates back to 1966, and has been the controlling document
in obtaining a market position for sales of new products.  Defense
contractors have had very strong opinions (based on repairability,
ease of application, and long-term reliability with respect to
thermal cycling) as to the proper product to use and have preferred
higher priced, higher performance products.<P>

Conformal coatings can be formulated from many different chemical
technologies and are normally applied by dipping, spraying, or flow
coating processes.  The cured coatings are chosen based on their
dielectric properties, abrasion, solvent and thermal resistance,
and ease of application.  Earlier coating formulations based on
solvent carriers and long cure times are being replaced with non-
solvent coatings that cure in minutes via ultraviolet wave energy
or low temperature thermal energy.<P>


<b>STUDY GOALS AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>

The goal of this study is to update the original study performed in
late 1989 that defined the market and projected consumption of
conformal coatings for a six-year period on a global basis.  As in
1989, individual study objectives focused on:<P>

<LI> Current and future chemical types of coatings and suppliers<P>

<LI> Current and future coating consumption by major industry<P>

<LI> End-user electronic applications and growth of printed circuit
  boards (the building block of electronics within electronic
  systems)<P>

<LI> End-user performance and application requirements<P>

<LI> Coating application equipment suppliers and sales<P>


<b>REASONS FOR DOING STUDY</B><P>

The early '90s witnessed Desert Storm which demonstrated the
capabilities of electronics applied to defense weaponry, the
breakup of the U.S.S.R. ending the Cold War and the beginnings of
defense budget cutbacks as "peace dividends" and deficit reducers,
a worldwide economic recession affecting the global automotive and
electronics industries, and continued international, federal, and
state automotive legislation mandating improved emissions and
safety.<P>

The 1989 conformal coating market was in a state of growth, with
many dynamic forces creating the first significant changes in over
20 years.  Solvent regulations, new coating curing technology, and
industrial electronic reliability requirements were the major
forces creating a "new" conformal coating marketplace, with new
players, new products, and significant new growth opportunities
emerging.  A worldwide electronics manufacturing infrastructure
emerging in the automotive and defense industries was to have a
significant effect on  international conformal coating sales.<P>

The curtailment of solvents in industrial applications arising from
the Montreal Protocol (Accord) plus state and federal regulations
would not only affect the formulation of the future coatings
themselves, but also all the areas pertaining to the processing of
boards before and after coating.  Important auxiliary aspects of
conformal coating (e.g. board cleaning, temporary masking,
application equipment, and repairability) needed to be re-evaluated
in light of changing solvent restrictions,  end-user requirements,
and new cure systems.<P>

Many coating suppliers developed new products and offered broader
selection of coatings and application methods than ever before.
The key criteria was "100% solids coatings" for environmental
safety.  Large volume coating end-users committed their companies
to reducing solvent usage in all operations, but especially in the
coating and cleaning areas.  These factors were to change the
conformal coating market at an accelerated rate, and open the doors
of many previously committed end-users
to the new coating technologies being offered.<P>

This 1993/94 study revisits the global market to quantify what has
happened in the last four years, and to project what will happen in
the next five.<P>


<b>CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE STUDY</B><P>

At this time, suppliers have a current need for an up-to-date and
in-depth  analysis of the domestic and international conformal
coating market, in order to understand the present technology
capabilities of competitors, the present and future requirements of
end-users, and the process considerations of board cleaning  and
coating application.  This study will be of direct benefit to
current and future suppliers of conformal coatings to the
automotive, defense, industrial, computer, telecommunications, and
consumer electronics industries.<P>

Suppliers, both current and potential, need to understand the
direction and magnitude of changes occurring in the coating
marketplace in order to take appropriate action to maintain or gain
market share.  This study will benefit chemical coating suppliers,
as well as application equipment suppliers and PCB contractors.<P>


<b>SCOPE AND FORMAT</B><P>

Forecasting of coating and process equipment sales is done for the
period 1993 through 1998 in constant 1993 dollars.  Real increases
in sales volume are identified as resulting from higher priced
products (100% solids) being substituted for existing solvent-based
coatings, new coatings applications occurring in the 1993-1998
period, and increased material usage per board based on performance
requirements.  Tables of data are used to easily indicate magnitude
and trends for each industry and coating type, with concise text
explaining the data.<P>


<b>METHODOLOGY</B><P>

To evaluate end-use markets, the domestic industrial market was
broken down into eight distinct market segments which were examined
separately.  Major end-users who control or produce 75% of the
electronic systems of that industry were surveyed by interviewing
the key technical or manufacturing personnel who are responsible
for specifying or using conformal coatings within their respective
corporations.<P>

Hundreds of telephone and personal interviews were conducted in
order to define what current requirements are, and what future
requirements will be, for the next five years.<P>

To evaluate the supplier side of the market, all leading conformal
coating suppliers as compiled from industrial directories and
registers, were contacted, and in-depth interviews were held with
the responsible product or market manager. As a further analysis
step, each of the five major chemical technologies used in
conformal coating were separated and crosschecked with primary and
secondary suppliers, including distributors.<P>


<b>INFORMATION SOURCES</B><P>

The market analysis consists of two separate efforts:  primary
research consisting of in-depth interviews with end-users,
suppliers, and independent experts; and secondary research
consisting of trade literature, government documentation, patent,
technical publication, and feature article searches.  The research
program was completed during the fourth quarter of 1993 and focuses
on the 1993-1998 period.  This report consolidates and updates
information on the overall industrial markets which have
historically only been looked at on a fragmented basis by special
interest groups, and brings objectivity to the comprehensive
analysis.<P>

Auxiliary services suppliers such as application equipment,
cleaning materials, repair equipment or materials, and contract
processing houses were also interviewed in order to evaluate the
process support that end-users would find available.<P>

</CENTER>

<B>STUDY GOAL AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>

For more than a generation, concern over the quality of water has been
growing. This concern has been expressed by consumers, businesses, and
eventually governments. The combination of normal market forces and (more
recently) regulation has been propelling the entire water treatment market.
This study examines the forces driving the product and end-use consumer water
treatment markets. Forecasts for these markets and the reasons for the
forecasts are then developed.<P>



<B>REASONS FOR THIS STUDY</B><P>

Three trends not all directly related to each other are occurring concurrently:
<UL><LI> The amount of pollution in the air, water, and elsewhere is
        increasing<P>
<LI> Legislative efforts to control the pollution are continuing<P>
<LI>There is a growing health trend that is making people more
        conscious of the food and water they consume, the need to
        exercise, etc.</UL><P>

This study analyzes the combined impact of these three trends in the US on the
consumer water treatment products and markets defined below. These are,
products designed to help individuals purify their own water. This analysis
also includes:<P>

<UL><LI> The role of water treatment authorities.<P>
<LI> The numerous laws and regulations on the books of many state
        and local governments; included is the relatively low degree of
        uniformity amongst the standards set by these authorities.<P>
<LI> The fact that most water is physically different from most other
        water.  This even applies to water drawn from different parts of
        the same source.<P>
<LI> The fact that any given user is likely to want water different
        from, or at least treated differently than, that of other users.<P>
<LI> The questionable claims and practices that continue to hurt the
        products under study here.<P>
<LI> The impact of what is likely to be slow economic growth during
        most of the remainder of this century. This includes a slowing
        in building and construction. Demographic trends play a role in
        this as well.<P></UL>


<B>CONTRIBUTION OF THE STUDY</B><P>

This study offers a look at the consumer water treatment market. It includes
discussions on technology and leading companies, in addition to the forecasts by
product market and by end-use market. Also, this study draws certain conclusions
that are the result of analyzing the above mentioned trends.<P>



<B>SCOPE AND FORMAT</B><P>

Estimates of the total U.S. water treatment market for 1991 range from $7
billion to over $15 billion. That broad range depends on whether one includes
large-scale treatment facilities such as those built by municipalities to
treat waste water or by big corporations to recycle their "used" water.

This study analyzes and forecasts one specific segment of that market: the US
product and end-use markets for consumer water treatment products. These
products are divided primarily into:<P>

<UL><LI> Point-of-entry (POE) which is where water enters the building
                               and<P>
    <LI> Point-of-use (POU) which is at the faucet.<P></UL>

Water for consumer uses is often described as drinking water. However,
virtually all ordinary individual uses, such as washing and cooking, are
regarded as consumer uses. The product markets are divided between
purification and softening. The five purification technologies included are:
carbon, filtration, reverse osmosis, ultra violet, and others. The end-use
markets are divided between residences and non-residences. In this study, non-
residential buildings are generally places of employment and places of
hospitality.<P>



<B>METHODOLOGY</B><P>

Forecast methods include standard statistical techniques such as simple linear
regression and the analysis of numerical trends, growth rates, and ratios. The
final forecasts represent an integration of these quantitative results, the
literature review, and the interviews.<P>

Three particular aspects of the interviewing were:<P>

<UL><LI> "Shopping" for the products discussed here. The stores shopped
        were: building supply stores; hardware stores; a plumbing
        wholesaler; a discount house; and four water stores--that is,
        stores specializing in water treatment products for residences
        and non-residences<BR>
<LI> Attending two trade shows where these products and their
        bottled water competitors were exhibiting<BR>
<LI> Touring the facilities of one manufacturer.<P></UL>

Because this study was completed in 1992 before all 1991 data were available,
the base year for this study is 1990 with 1991 values estimated. The forecast
years are 1993 and 1997. 1988 is the backcast, or historic, year. All indices
and inflation adjusted (i.e., real) values have been adjusted to 1991=100.<P>

Market data relate to shipments measured in both current value (i.e.,
unadjusted for inflation) and in units. The units provide a real (or
inflation-adjusted) measure. The average price or cost is the estimated cost
for the manufacturer. This should eliminate most "add-ons" such as freight,
advertising, etc. The result should be a better picture of the actual dollar
value of products shipped to market. Since products are grouped together with
the original product and the aftermarket repair and replacement parts, there
is some distortion in the average prices. Most parts are relatively
inexpensive. This is partially offset by the higher price of the fewer new
units. The term "carag" stands for compound average rate of annual growth,
and the time period covered is 1991-1997.<P>

<B>STUDY GOAL AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>

The goal of the study on protective coatings and liners for pipe
and tanks is to provide a technological and economical
documentation of the state of the art in the industry and to
provide insight into its future direction   Objectives include:<P>


<MENU><LI>Definition of the size of the 1990 market<P>

<LI>Identification of major types of protective coatings
and liners in current use<P>

<LI>Segmentation of use by major consuming industry<P>

<LI>Identification of key applications of major user
          industries<P>

<LI>Compilation of major trends in the user industries
          having a significant effect on suppliers<P>

<LI>Projection of future demand through 1995</MENU><P>

<B>REASONS FOR THE STUDY</B><P>

Paint, coatings and eventually high-performance coatings were
developed as a need for them arose and as the materials allowing
their production became available.  Protective coatings and liners
(as opposed to paint used for decorative value) are used to protect
manufacturing facilities. The values of the old and new structures
are escalating continually, making it essential to have them
protected against corrosion with coatings and/or linings to keep
these essential structures intact and in good operating condition.<P>

The need for these specialized coating products will continue to
rise as new industries develop, new chemicals are produced, new
processes are used to protect the environment, and the cost of
basic building materials increases.  Their use will also increase
as, in providing structural protection and added years of useful
life, they become more widely recognized as a major source of
energy savings.<P>

While the cost of corrosion to mankind is extremely difficult to
measure, some experts estimate that over $100 billion are lost
annually in the United States alone through the effects of
corrosion.  In addition to damage costs, corrosion has prompted
some engineers to overdesign structures by specifying extra metal
thickness for additional life and strength.  As a result, lacking
effective corrosion control, countless tons of metal are consumed
needlessly.<P>

It is of economic, engineering, marketing, and management
importance to determine the current value of protective coatings
and liners in their major application area on pipe and tanks, and
to determine growth expectations for major types as pollution and
safety regulations increasingly affect materials of choice.<P>

<B>CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE STUDY</B><P>

The study provides current statistical and analytical information
on protective coatings and liners used on pipe and tanks, and major
industry users, reviews major material and application technologies
in use, identifies major driving forces of change, and projects
future use through 1995.  It provides a compilation of information
believed to be unavailable elsewhere.<P>

It is of primary importance to supplier personnel involved in
technology development, marketing,  and general or financial
management.  It is of equal importance to supplier personnel
involved in new business development, whether in planning,
research, commercial development, or directing.<P>

Pipe coating applicators and lining installers interested in new
marketing opportunities can also benefit from the study.<P>

<B>SCOPE AND FORMAT</B><P>

The scope of the study includes the major coating and liner
materials used on pipe and tanks, i.e., epoxy, bitumens,
thermoplastic resins (polyethylene, vinyl and plastisols),
specialty resins (urethanes, fluorocarbons, phenolics and
polyesters), elastomerics, and inorganics (glass, zinc, and lead).
Major suppliers of materials are identified and their respective
sales estimated.<P>

Paints, commonly used for decorative purposes, are excluded from
the study, as are specialty repair processes such as internal
sleeving of worn metal pipe with plastic pipe.<P>

Major industry users of protective coatings and liners for pipe and
tanks, --chemical, gas transmission and distribution, power, pulp
and paper, food, steel and mining-- are identified by size, growth
anticipated, and major application areas.<P>

Quantification and projection of market sizes are for the period
1990 through 1995, in constant 1990 dollars, and discount
inflationary increases.  Values presented are for shipments from
the manufacturers of coatings and linings.<P>

Real increases in sales volume result from higher priced products
(100 % solids) substitution for existing solvent-based coatings. An
increased percentage of higher performance (and higher priced)
coatings are specified for maintenance and repair, and a continuing
increase in higher performance coatings being specified for new
construction.  Tables of data indicate magnitude and trends for
each chemical type and major user industry, with concise text
explaining the data.<P>


<B>METHODOLOGY</B><P>

The information on which the study is based was gathered by
secondary and primary research.<P>

Secondary research included the gathering, organizing, and
analyzing of available information from a thorough literature
search. Sources include all major technical and business
associations and/or societies related to the field of study, all
major publications associated with the suppliers and users, leading
newspaper articles dealing with the subject, and government data.<P>

Primary research involved telephone interviews of suppliers, users,
personnel of associations, publications, government, and
consultants knowledgeable in the field.<P>

Quantification of coating and lining types was accomplished by
several means, including a thorough review of the published
literature, analysis of government data, segmentation of suppliers'
sales data, estimation of coating applicator sales and their,
reconciliation to obtain best estimate, and confirmation of
estimates with association, applicator, distribution, and supplier
personnel knowledgeable in the field.  Projection of future use was
accomplished similarly, adding the inputs of users in major
consuming industries.<P>


<B>INFORMATION SOURCES</B><P>

The major origins of information contained in the study emanate
from personal telephone interviews conducted with user, applicator
and supplier personnel concerning the validity of secondary
research information gathered from a thorough literature search
encompassing several general and technical libraries, all major
technical and business associations and/or societies related to the
field of study, all major publications associated with the
suppliers and users, leading national newspaper articles dealing
with the subject, and available government data.

<B>STUDY GOAL AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>

     BCC's goal in writing this report is to develop a succinct
     understanding of the market size, growth and trends for the
     main types of components used in the manufacture, fabrication
     and assembly of selected types of high purity water treatment
     systems.
     Specifically, the objectives of this study are:<P>

<LI> To identify the major components for selected types of high
       purity water treatment systems.<P>
    <LI>  To estimate current size and projected growth for each type
       of component by type and by application.<P>
    <LI>  To identify and evaluate the key suppliers, their estimated
       current and projected shares for each type of component,
       and the main underlying industry structure characteristics.<P>
    <LI>  To identify the key technical and technological changes in
       materials, processes, and manufacturing methods, and to
       broadly determine from where the main influences for change
       are coming. For example, do manufacturers spur improvements
       in water treatment systems' technology/performance, or are
       components manufacturers driven by the demands of their
       customers?<P>

<B>REASONS FOR DOING THE STUDY</B><P>

    BCC's principal reasons for doing this study are to fill a
    perceived gap in market information on the many components
    which are needed for the manufacture, assembly or fabrication
    of standard high purity water treatment systems.
    The current and anticipated growth in water treatment
    applications is creating a high growth business opportunity
    for manufacturers of some components; however, while the
    market for water treatment systems and its end applications
    are very well researched, there is a dearth of market
    information on the inputs that make up the system. The
    constant flux in water treatment technologies is spurring many
    changes in components and, likewise, any improvements in
    component technology have profound effects on the development
    of systems technology. The use of TOC analyzers and data
    tracking instruments is a prime example of componentry that is
    a virtual "must" in any water treatment system today. However,
    these items hardly existed six or seven years ago and their
    use was a virtual novelty. Their advent has forced
    manufacturers to re-design systems and improve their
    efficiencies since the systems can no longer "hide" the
    problems, as was the case prior to the availability of these
    tracking devices.<P>

    Likewise these same developments have resulted in many new
    opportunities, some of which have spawned small successful new
    companies with patented breakthrough products, or given new
    life to old concepts. Ultra-violet sterilization is a key
    example of existing technology getting a new fillip.<P>

<B>SCOPE AND FORMAT</B><P>
    This report focuses on selected
    components for high purity water
    treatment systems, the commonest
    of which are reverse osmosis
    (RO) and deionized water (DI)
    systems. Broadly, the
    interest/scope starts when city
    feedwater enters a media
    filtration system.  Components selected for
    study:<P>

                                      <UL>Ultraviolet Sterilizers<BR>
                                       Chemical Metering Pumps<BR>
                                       Deionized Water Heaters<BR>
                                       Ozonation Equipment<BR>
                                       Reverse Osmosis Pumps<BR>
                                       Reverse Osmosis Pressure Vessels<BR>
                                       Pressure Tanks<BR>
                                       Piping Systems<P></UL>

Treatment processes (and components involved therein) prior to this point are generally not included for
study because they would begin to involve the study of generic products rather than the specialty lines
on which this report attempts to focus. Even within the context of high purity water treatment, the study's
scope excludes generic products. For example, ordinary storage tanks for holding water in a treatment
process are not of interest because some one hundred-odd manufacturers fabricate these; however, the
holding of product water in specially constructed pressure tanks is a "specialty" product line because of
the high technology characteristics of these tanks.<P>

 Further, since more than one technology/method is utilized in the production of high purity water, there
 is sometimes a thin dividing line between a "system" and a "component." For example, ozonation
 equipment is not really a component. It is a system on its own, yet also one of the sub-systems that
 make up the high purity process. Likewise, ultra-filtration systems and even entire RO systems are  often
 the pretreatment "components" in a loop, e.g., in a triple membrane system.  As far as possible, the scope of the study attempts to identify components, as opposed to complete
 technologies/systems.<P>

 The scope of the study is further defined by reference to the production of high purity water for the  following types of applications:<P>

<LI> Power generation applications are primarily concerned with systems which supply boiler
       feedwater and industrial cooling water. In general, the purity requirements for these are
       increasing, and even though the industry is mature from a macro-economic standpoint, the
       production of high purity water is a growth market.<P>
    <LI>  Electronics is a key application area for the production of ultra-pure water using DI and
       increasingly DI/RO processes. The high growth/high profile requirement for industrial ultra-
       pure water in semi-conductor operations is slowing, but, as chip densities increase, more
       rinse water is required despite a slower macro-growth scenario.
       These applications primarily focus on medium capacity (up to 20,000 gallons per day) RO
       systems, de-ionization, and to some extent ultra-filtration for pre-treatment.<P>
    <LI>  Pharmaceutical/drug/medical applications are separated as a major application area which
       is relatively fast-growing, and the focus of attention for component manufacturers who see
       opportunities to make up for the slump in the electronics industry. For example, fluoroplastic
       piping manufacturers are actively looking at the pharmaceutical industry as an area where
       stainless steel piping can be replaced by the type of materials prevalent in the electronics
       industry.<P>
    <LI>  Industrial processes represent applications where the growth in high purity systems is tied
       not just to the production of high purity water required for manufacturing processes, but also
       in re-use of the wastewater stream, especially where the waste stream is environmentally
       unacceptable for disposal.<P>
    <LI>  Municipal/desalination applications are primarily concerned with large-scale desalination of
       brackish water and sea-water, which are two different sub-applications from a technological
       standpoint, although components are relatively common for both. The traditional method of
       distillation still continues to be prominent in all desalination requirements, but the focus in
       new plant installations is rapidly shifting towards large-scale, engineered RO systems and
       some towards micro-filtration.<P>
    <LI>  Point-of-use applications are primarily concerned with the advent and growth of small reverse
       osmosis units and carbon filtration in point-of-use drinking water systems for home, office and
       factory environments. Typically, these systems work on municipal line-pressure, although there is some evidence that small pumps are beginning to  make in-roads into a growing percentage of shipments of these types of units.<P>
<LI>    Methodology/ Sources of Information/ Related Work Credentials
    The research method first concentrated on an extensive perusal of literature to determine which
    components to study. It was found that many OEMs, such as Culligan, list their suppliers by
    product and the more important of these product definitions then became the scope for the
    manufacture/ installation/assembly and operation of high purity water treatment systems.<P>
<LI>    The industry's principal components were further identified after a perusal of trade literature, such
    as Ultrapure Water. From the above secondary research, an extensive program of executive
    interviews was carried out. The solicitation of expert and reasoned analysis and the commentary
    from key respondents provided the main source of information on the content of each component
    section.<P>

<LI>    Company literature, patent searches, news articles and all relevant public domain information
    were thoroughly culled and incorporated into the  evaluation.<P>

<B>DEFINITIONS/FORMAT</B><P>

    All figures in this report are in current dollars, including forecasts, primarily because this is the
    way executives tend to support their views on how fast their product or market is growing. It is
    natural for a respondent to reference sales dollars as a matter of habit and view growth in like
    terms. However, when it is possible to factor out price increases, this is mentioned in the text,
    though all data remains in current dollars.
    The reporting of growth in constant dollars is an issue in times of high inflation, but in this study
    most component pricing is being held within a narrow 2-4% range increase each year. With many
    of these markets growing at double digit rates, price increases are readily absorbed, and it would
    take away something of the objectivity of a natural response in (current dollars) by focusing on
    a narrow range price factor.<P>

    All market size and growth definitions in this report relate to the value of shipments from U.S.
    companies plus imports into the U.S.<P>

    In some product areas, exports are a major factor. Exports by U.S. manufacturers are commented
    upon where such information is available.<P>

<B>STUDY GOAL AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>

  BCC's goal in writing this report is to develop a succinct
  understanding of the market size, growth and trends for the
  main types of instrumentation utilized in the maintenance,
  testing and control of high purity water treatment systems.
  Specifically, the objectives of this study are:<P>

<LI> To identify major types of instrumentation used in high
  purity water treatment systems.<P>
<LI> To estimate current size and projected growth for each type
  of instrument by type and by application.<P>
<LI> To identify and evaluate the key suppliers, their estimated
  current and projected shares for each type of instrument,
  and the main underlying industry structure characteristics.<P>
<LI> To identify the key technical and technological changes in
  materials, processes, and manufacturing methods, and to
  broadly determine from where the main influences for change
  are coming. For example, do manufacturers spur improvements
  in technology/performance, or are instrumentation
  manufacturers driven by the demands of their customers?<P>

<B>REASONS FOR DOING THE STUDY</B><P>

BCC's principal reasons for doing this study are to fill a
perceived gap in market information on the types of instruments
needed to monitor and maintain high purity water treatment systems.<P>

The current and anticipated growth in water treatment applications
is creating a high growth business opportunity for manufacturers of
some types of instruments; however, while the market for water
treatment systems and its end applications is very well researched,
there is a dearth of market information on the inputs that make up
the system. The constant flux in water treatment technologies is
spurring many changes in instrumentation and, likewise, any
improvements in instrument technology has profound effects on the
development of systems technology. The use of TOC analyzers and
data tracking instruments is a prime example of componentry that is
a virtual "must" in any water treatment system today. However,
these items hardly existed six or seven years ago and their use was
a virtual novelty. Their advent has forced manufacturers to re-
design systems and improve their efficiencies since the systems can
no longer "hide" the problems, as was the case prior to the
availability of these tracking devices.<P>

Likewise these same developments have resulted in many new
opportunities, some of which have spawned small successful new
companies with patented breakthrough products, or given new life to
old concepts.<P>



<B>SCOPE AND FORMAT</B><P>


This report focuses on selected instrumentation for high purity
water treatment systems, the most common of which are reverse
osmosis (RO) and deionized water (DI) systems. Broadly, the
interest/scope starts when city feedwater enters a media filtration
system. Treatment processes (and instrumentation involved therein)
prior to this point are generally not included for study because they would begin to involve the study of generic
products rather than the specialty lines on which this report
attempts to focus. <P>

Instrumentation Selected for Study:<P>
<UL>TOC Analyzers<BR>
Liquid Particle Counters<BR>
Other Selected Online Instrumentation<BR>
            <UL><LI>  Conductivity/Resistivity<BR>
            <LI> Silica Analyzers<BR>
            <LI> Sodium Analyzers<BR>
            <LI> Data Logging Systems<BR>
            <LI> pH Measurement<BR>
            <LI> Ion Chromatography</UL><P></UL>

Even within the context of high purity water treatment, the study's scope excludes generic products.  The scope of the study is further defined by reference to the production of high purity water for the following types of applications:<P>

<LI> Power generation applications are primarily concerned with systems
which supply boiler feedwater and industrial cooling water. In
general, the purity requirements for these are increasing, and even
though the industry is mature from a macro-economic standpoint, the
production of high purity water is a growth market.<P>

<LI> Electronics is a key application area for the production of ultra-
pure water using DI and increasingly DI/RO processes. The high
growth/high profile requirement for industrial ultra-pure water in
semi-conductor operations is slowing, but as chip densities
increase, more rinse water is required despite a slower macro-
growth scenario.<P>

These applications primarily focus on medium capacity (up to
20,000 gallons per day) RO systems, de-ionization, and to some
extent ultra-filtration for pre-treatment.<P>

<LI> Pharmaceutical/drug/medical applications are separated as a major
application area that is relatively fast-growing, and the focus of
attention for instrumentation manufacturers who see opportunities
to make up for the slump in the electronics industry.<P>

<LI> Industrial processes represent applications where the growth in
high purity systems is tied not just to the production of high
purity water required for manufacturing processes, but also in re-
use of the wastewater stream, especially where the waste stream is
environmentally unacceptable for disposal.<P>

<LI> Municipal/desalination applications are primarily concerned with
large-scale desalination of brackish water and sea-water, which are
two different sub-applications from a technological standpoint,
although components are relatively common for both. The traditional
method of distillation still continues to be prominent in all
desalination requirements, but the focus in new plant installations
is rapidly shifting towards large-scale, engineered RO systems and
some towards micro-filtration.<P>


<B>Methodology/ Sources of Information/ Related Work  Credentials</B><P>

The research method first concentrated on an extensive perusal of
literature to determine which components to study.<P>

The industry's principal types of instruments were further
identified after a perusal of trade literature, such as Ultrapure
Water. From the above secondary research, an extensive program of
executive interviews was carried out. The solicitation of expert
and reasoned analysis and the commentary from key respondents
provided the main source of information on the content of each
section.<P>

Company literature, patent searches, news articles and all relevant
public domain information was thoroughly culled and incorporated
into the  evaluation.<P>

<B>DEFINITIONS/FORMAT</B><P>

All figures in this report are in current dollars, including
forecasts, primarily because this is the way executives tend to
support their views on how fast their product or market is growing.
It is natural for a respondent to reference sales dollars as a
matter of habit and view growth in like terms. However, when it is
possible to factor out price increases, this is mentioned in the
text, though all data remains in current dollars.<P>

The reporting of growth in constant dollars is an issue in times of
high inflation, but in this study most component pricing is being
held within a narrow 2-4% range increase each year. With many of
these markets growing at double digit rates, price increases are
readily absorbed, and it would take away something of the
objectivity of a natural response in (current dollars) by focusing
on a narrow range price factor.<P>

All market size and growth definitions in this report relate to the
value consumed in the U.S., including imports, i.e. U.S. market
size.<P>

<B>RELATED CREDENTIALS</B><P>

The authors of this report have worked on a number of consultancy
assignments for major companies in the filtration business and have
analytical familiarity with many of the important issues affecting
the filtration/separation and purification industry.<P>
        BCC is well-known for its many publications in the membrane
        and filtration/separation areas. These include multi-client
        studies, newsletters and on-line information.<P>

<B>STUDY GOAL AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>

BCC's goal in writing this report is to develop a succinct
understanding of the market size, growth and trends for the main
types of consumable products which are used in the operation of
high purity water treatment systems.
Specifically, the objectives of this study are:<P>

 <LI>  To identify the major types of consumables utilized in high
     purity water treatment systems.<P>
  <LI>  To estimate current size and projected growth of the U.S.
     market for these products by type and by application.<P>
  <LI>  To identify and evaluate the key suppliers, their estimated
     current and projected shares for each type of product, and
     the main underlying industry structure characteristics.<P>
  <LI>  To identify the key technical and technological changes in
     materials, processes, and manufacturing methods, and to
     broadly determine from where the main influences for change

<B>REASONS FOR DOING THE STUDY</B><P>

BCC's principal reasons for doing this study are to fill a
perceived gap in market information on the consumable products
utilized in the maintenance and operation of standard high purity
water treatment systems.<P>

The current and anticipated growth in water treatment applications
is creating a high growth business opportunity for manufacturers of
some products; however, while the market for water treatment
systems and its end applications are very well researched, there is
a dearth of market information on the inputs that make up the
system. The constant flux in water treatment technologies is
spurring many changes in related products and, likewise, any
improvements in water treatment consumables has profound effects on
the development of systems technology.<P>

Likewise these same developments have resulted in many new
opportunities, some of which have spawned small successful new
companies with patented breakthrough products, or given new life to
old concepts.<P>

<B>SCOPE AND FORMAT</B><P>

This report focuses on selected consumables for high purity water
treatment systems, the commonest of which are reverse osmosis (RO)
and deionized water (DI) systems. Broadly, the interest/scope
starts when city feedwater enters a media filtration system.
Treatment processes (and products involved therein) prior to this
point are generally not included for study because they would
begin to involve the study of generic products rather than the
specialty lines on which this report attempts to focus.<P>

This study includes the following consumables required for
operation, maintenance and on-going testing of high purity water
treatment systems' cartridge filters, ion exchange resins,
specialty RO chemicals, and RO membranes. A chapter on mobile high
purity water services is also included.<P>

Consumables Selected for Study:<P>

<UL>Cartridge Filters<BR>
Ion Exchange Resins<BR>
Specialty RO Chemicals<BR>
RO Membranes<BR>
Aftermarket Services</UL><P>

The scope of the study is further defined by reference to the
production of high purity water for the following types of
applications:<P>

 <LI>  Power generation applications are primarily concerned with
     systems that supply boiler feedwater and industrial cooling
     water. In general, the purity requirements for these are
     increasing, and even though the industry is mature from a
     macro-economic standpoint, the production of high purity
     water is a growth market.<P>

  <LI>  Electronics is a key application area for the production of
     ultra-pure water using DI and increasingly DI/RO processes.
     The high growth/high profile requirement for industrial
     ultra-pure water in semiconductor operations is slowing,
     but as chip densities increase, more rinse water is
     required despite a slower macro-growth scenario.
     These applications primarily focus on medium capacity (up
     to 20,000 gallons per day) RO systems, de-ionization, and
     to some extent ultra-filtration for pre-treatment.<P>
  <LI>  Pharmaceutical/drug/medical applications are separated as
     a major application area, which is relatively fast-growing,
     and the focus of attention for manufacturers who see
     opportunities to make up for the slump in the electronics
     industry.<P>

  <LI>  Industrial processes represent applications where the
     growth in high purity systems is tied not just to the
     production of high purity water required for manufacturing
     processes, but also in re-use of the wastewater stream,
     especially where the waste stream is  environmentally
     unacceptable for disposal.<P>

<LI>  Municipal/desalination applications are primarily concerned
     with large-scale desalination of brackish water and sea-
     water, which are two different sub-applications from a
     technological standpoint, although components are
     relatively common for both. The traditional method of
     distillation still continues to be prominent in all
     desalination requirements, but the focus in new plant
     installations is rapidly shifting towards large-scale,
     engineered RO systems and some towards micro-filtration.<P>

  <LI>  Point-of-use applications are primarily concerned with the
     advent and growth of small reverse osmosis units and carbon
     filtration in point-of-use drinking water systems for home,
     office and factory environments. Typically, these systems
     work on municipal line-pressure though there is some
     evidence that small pumps are beginning to make in-roads
     into a growing percentage of shipments of these types of
     units.<P>

<B>METHODOLOGY/SOURCES OF INFORMATION/RELATED WORK CREDENTIALS</B><P>

The research method first concentrated on an extensive perusal of
literature to determine which products to study.<P>

The industry's principal consumable products were further
identified after a perusal of trade literature, such as Ultrapure
Water. From the above secondary research, an extensive program of
executive interviews was carried out. The solicitation of expert
and reasoned analysis and the commentary from key respondents
provided the main source of information on the content of each
product section.<P>

Company literature, patent searches, news articles and all
relevant public domain information was thoroughly culled and
incorporated into the  evaluation.<P>

<B>DEFINITIONS/FORMAT</B><P>

All figures in this report are in current dollars, including
forecasts, primarily because this is the way executives tend to
support their views on how fast their product or market is
growing. It is natural for a respondent to reference sales dollars
as a matter of habit and view growth in like terms. However, when
it is possible to factor out price increases, this is mentioned
in the text, though all data remain in current dollars.<P>

The reporting of growth in constant dollars is an issue in times
of high inflation, but in this study most component pricing is
being held within a narrow 2-4% range increase each year. With
many of these markets growing at double digit rates, price
increases are readily absorbed, and it would take away something
of the objectivity of a natural response in (current dollars) by
focusing on a narrow range price factor.<P>

All market size and growth definitions in this report relate to the
value of shipments from U.S. companies, plus imports into the U.S.
In some product areas, exports are a major factor. For example in
RO membranes, around 45% of U.S. manufacturers' production is
exported, while imports are not a major factor as yet.
Exports by U.S. manufacturers are commented upon where such
information is available.<P>

 <B>RELATED CREDENTIALS</B><P>

<H2> Digital Equipment Goes For Internet Brass Ring </H2>

Digital Equipment Corp. has been more aggressive than most computer
companies in promoting itself as the Internet vendor of choice. It
continued the offensive last month by forming an independent business
group devoted to developing and executing the company's Internet
strategy.<P>
Digital has been using the Internet aggressively, working with
partners
and customers, for at least two years now, but it was only in January
of
this year that the company took on its first bona fide Internet
customer.
That was a distributor of science fiction books in San Francisco
called
"Future Fantasy Bookstore." Soon after it put up its home page on
Digital's server, it got swamped with new orders from Europe.
Although at
first Digital had to fax orders to the bookstore, it is now hooked up
to
a BBS on Digital's server where it can receive the orders directly as
electronic mail.<P>
Digital has since signed up several customers in the publishing
industry
(the company isn't saying how many) who want to set up similar
catalogue-type arrangements. "There's a giant market for products and
services for customers to use the Internet," says Russ Jones,
Internet
Program Manager at Digital (529 Bryant, Palo Alto, CA 94301; e-mail:
rjones@pa.dec.com).<P>
Of course, neither Jones nor anybody else at Digital knows just how
big
this market is--only that demand exceeds supply for the time
being.<P>
So far, Digital's new business unit has one employee, Rose Anne
Giordano,
Vice President for the Internet Business. Giordano plans to recruit
from
current business employees, such as Jones, who have been involved in
the
firm's Internet activities to date, though bringing in outsiders has
not
been ruled out. "We don't have organizational thoughts," says Jones.
"We
will run it as a start up company and will work with a lot of
partners
and third parties."<P>
Potential partners will include makers of graphical interfaces and
software for navigating the net. "The idea," says Jones, "is to make
the
Internet easy to use."<P>

<h2>How Many Users Are On The Net?</h2>

Now that the Internet has made the cover of Time magazine and the
engineers who built it 25 years ago have made the pages of Newsweek,
a
new wave of hype deflating press may be about to break. One of the
first
signs was a New York Times story debunking estimates that 20 million
to
30 million people now use the Internet.<p>
People who do business on the Internet, however, are getting a bit
annoyed with this up today, down tomorrow, coverage. The Times
article
prompted a flood of user-group postings recently complaining about
consultants who should know better than making exaggerated claims to
the
press. Savvy Internet users are skeptical of claims that touch both
extremes.<P>
The notion propagated in the Times article that the Internet has only
2
to 3 million users does not have much of a following. "That's
ludicrous,"
says Russ Jones, Internet Program Manager for Digital Equipment
Corp., in
Palo Alto, CA. He objects to the methodology of the demographer, John
S.
Quarterman (mids@tic.com) of Matrix Information and Directory
Services
(1106 Clayton Lane, Austin, TX 78723-7602; Tel: 512/451-7602) whose
information formed the basis of the story.<P>
Quarterman arrived at his estimate by assuming that each host
computer on
the Internet had 7.5 users attached, which Quarterman himself admits
is
arbitrary. Jones, for one, disputes the figure. Although at Digital
only
20 hosts present themselves to the Internet, behind the company's
firewall lies a population of 80,000 employees with direct e-mail
access.
One argument put forth in the Times, of course, says that firewalls
prevent the vast number of users connected via e-mail from using the
Net's full range of capabilities. But that's not the case, at least
at
Digital, where as many as 20,000 people behind the firewall browse
the
net with Mosaic.<P>
For Internet marketers, the debate is anything but academic. Coming
up
with sound marketing strategies generally depends on getting good
numbers
to work with, but good numbers on the Internet are hard to find. Many
users of one new mailing list that deals with marketing topics
believe
that relying on the numbers being bandied around by Quarterman and
others
is fruitless.<P>
Andrew Anker, Chief Technology Officer of Wired Ventures Ltd. (544
Second
Street, San Francisco, CA 94119; e-mail: aa@wired com), asserts that
people should not bother to analyze Internet demographics until
somebody
finds a reliable methodology. "I would love to have an exact count of
the
number of people on the Internet, as would all of the reporters that
are
calling [consultants] for help," he writes, "but bad numbers are very
often worse than no numbers.  At least one of [Quarterman's] numbers
was
picked from nowhere."<P>
Without reliable numbers, what is to be done? One solution is to
attack
as many avenues of "advertisement" (to use the forbidden word) as
possible--user groups, ftp archives, WWW home pages, advertisements
on
Commercenet and so on.<P>
The Internet has at least one silver lining for marketers. The people
who
access an Internet server leave behind a trace that clever marketers
can
interpret to their advantage. Although this trace does not amount to
an
electronic fingerprint--precise identities of people cannot usually
be
ascertained, only of the hosts that support them--the information is
useful for determining trends, for getting gross counts of the number
of
times data is accessed, for finding out which items posted are the
most
popular, and for differentiating commercial from academic market
segments.<P>

<h1>INTERNATIONAL</h1>
<h2>Leaders Press for Euronet Policy</h2>
Europe's industrial leaders pooled their vast intellects and came up
with
a recommendation for a European information policy. Although they
took
the opportunity to praise the virtues of the free market, they spent
much
of the report sounding the alarm vis-a-vis competitors in the United
States and the inroads they threaten to make in the Old World.<P>
"Why the urgency?" asks the report. The answer: "Competitive
suppliers of
networks and services from outside Europe are increasingly active in
our
markets. They are convinced, as we must be, that if Europe arrives
late,
our suppliers of technologies and services will lack the commercial
muscle needed to win a share of the enormous opportunities which lie
ahead."<P>
The report goes on to point out that while Europe is in good shape in
smart cards and other technologies, they lag considerably in most
others.
For instance, whereas 60% of U.S. households have cable television,
which
could carry text and data services, only 25% of European homes are so
equipped. And the U.S. boasts 34 personal computers per 100 citizens
against 10 per 100 Europeans. That means that Europe's
telecommunications
networks, competitive though they are, remain underutilized because
of
monopolies and high costs.<P>
Without a smidgen of irony, the report touts Europe's only home-run
success with information technology--France's Minitel network. Of
course,
what made Minitel was a heavy subsidy from the French government.
That
fact alone is enough to make one think that, in the hearts and minds
of
Europeans, dirigisme is not dead.<P>

<h2>The Electronic Frontier Now Includes Japan</h2>

The Washington based organization that has appointed itself to look
after
freedom of the networks is extending its activities by forming a
mailing
list dealing with Japan and its place in the international Internet
community.<P>
The reason is that Electronic Frontiers is worried that policy
decisions
in Japan are not being made in the best interest of the Japanese
public,
but rather in the interests of government agencies and large
telecommunications corporations. By promoting a dialogue about
connectivity issues in Japan, public policy decisions and the law,
Electronic Frontiers hopes to sow the seeds of discontent that might
eventually lead to an EFF outpost in Japan, as there are in Canada
and
Australia, as well as the U.S.<P>
The list is unmoderated, but users are encouraged to discuss topics
such
as the role of government agencies in setting communications policy,
freedom and privacy, cultural issues in linking to the Internet where
English, so far, has been the dominant language, finding online
resources
in Japan, and support of Internet services in Japan. To subscribe,

<h1>HARDWARE</h1>
<h2>Broad Band Router for Internet via Cable TV</h2>

Digital Equipment Corp., in its continued effort to capitalize on the
growing market for network equipment, has introduced a router for
connecting to the Internet via high speed cable television networks.
The
product, which combines the capabilities of a bridge and a router, is
called a "brouter."<P>
The device is designed to work with Digital's ChannelWorks bridge and
is
expected to allow organizations to use their Ethernet local area
network
connections on cable television installations. It provides TCP/IP
routing
and SNMP-based network management, and allows users to run client
server
applications over their cable links. Digital's brouter uses one 6
megahertz channel for outbound transmission and another 6 megahertz
channel for inbound transmission.<P>
Information on Digital's router can be found on the firm's WWW home
page:

<h2>Some Nuggets from OTA's Ramblings</h2>
The impact of networking technology on the economic and social life
of the
nation is the subject of a recent tome from the Office of Technology
Assessment in Washington, D.C. Intended to provide grist for the
policy
mill that is part of President Clinton's National Information
Infrastructure, the report deals little with the Internet and rambles
a
great deal about things we already knew. But, it does have a few
nuggets
of useful information.<P>
In particular, the report points out that the Internet may give small
businesses an edge over their big brethren that they lost when Ma
Bell
broke up back in 1984. Before the breakup, small businesses had a
relative advantage over large businesses because the telephone
company
absorbed much of the costs of communications.<P>
Deregulation shifted these costs to users, with small businesses
taking a
proportionately larger burden. For example, small businesses that
lack
the in-house staff to develop their own data networks must pay value
added network providers to provide the service. The high costs of
interconnection provides a disincentive to use, say, an EDI mailbox.
The
Internet obviates the need for bringing in expensive service
providers--at least in theory. By using the Internet, the mailbox
would
reside on the user's work station, giving them more control and lower
costs.<P>

<h1>EDUCATION</h1>

<h1>SOFTWARE</h1>
<h2>World Wide Web To Get Overhaul</h2>
The World Wide Web has brought huge resources to the fingertips of
Internet browsers, but scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology (MIT) and the European Laboratory of Particle Physics
(CERN)
think the Web needs an overhaul. MIT and CERN plan to survey users on
the
Web, and to draft standards that will make the Web better organized
and
easier to use. A pilot program is expected to be launched sometime in
the
next year.<P>
Michael Dertouzos of MIT's Laboratory for Computer Science is heading
up
a consortium that will bring academic institutions and commercial
companies together to develop standards for the Web. The consortium
will
work in a similar way to the X Consortium, which is widely praised
for
developing the X Windows standards.<P>
Although the make-up of the consortium has not been determined, the
group
will conduct a survey of users of the Web and come up with a plan to
make
improvements. In addition to finding ways to organize information,
the
group is expected to deal with authentication issues. "At present ,
you
don't really know if you are looking at information from the company
who
owns the server or whether somebody has done something nasty," says
Henry
Houh, an MIT graduate student at the Lab.<P>
The consortium is not being formed because the Web is broken and
needs
fixing but rather because protocols such as HTML and HTTP need to be
developed and enhanced in a way that provides some consistency
throughout
the industry. As the Web grows in popularity, people are using it
increasingly in an interactive way, such as asking users to fill in
forms
or otherwise to initiate actions that result in unique responses.<P>

<h1>GATEWAYS</h1>
<h2>Women Get a Wire of Their Own</h2>
If you think our society is too segmented as it is, so-called
boutique
online services are making it more so. Women's Wire, an online
service
for--you guessed it--women, seems to have tapped a new market. Since
launching the WIRE (Women's Information Resource) service in January
1994, Women's Wire has grown to more than 1300 members. Each pay
$15.00
per month for the service and two hours of usage and $2.50 an hour
beyond
that.<P>
The fee buys women an opportunity to "hear" guest speakers, including
Maggie Canon, Editor of MacUser Magazine; Esther Dyson, Editor of
Release
1.0; and Autumn Stephens, author of Wild Women and other books.<P>
The founders of Women's Wire (435 Grand Ave. Suite D, South San
Francisco, CA, 94080; Tel: 415/615-8989) apparently feel that the
chief
advantage to women of having their own online service is the
anonymity. 
"This is a community where women have the rare opportunity to
interact on
the basis of their interests, wit, personality and quality of
thought,
rather than superficial factors such as circumstances or appearance,"
says Ellen Pack, the 29-year-old co-founder and President of Women's
Wire. "It's an opportunity to express one's true self to tap into
true
wisdom and the support of like minds or to let down your hair and
have
fun with friends."<P>
Women's Wire's other co-founder, Nancy Rhine, 43, is no stranger to
forming "intentional communities." She participated in starting up
the
Well in the Bay Area and also The Farm, a commune, in the 1970's.<P>
Women's Wire is also providing access through its Internet server to
other online resources, including the National Organization for Women
,
National Education Center for Women in Business, and the Domestic
Abuse
Awareness Project. It uses Pandora Systems of San Francisco to
operate
the service. For more information send e-mail to info@wwire.net or

<h1>THE SUPERHIGHWAY</h1>
<h2>Is Fast Growth Hazardous to the Internet's Health?</h2>
The Internet is continuing its "inexorable" expansion, said
Anthony-Michael Rutkowski, the Executive Director of the Internet

revolution
scale in near real-time," Rutkowski says. "Every thirty minutes
another

Perhaps because it is part of his job as the chief spokesman for the
Internet, Rutkowski is enthusiastic about the growing importance of
the
Internet as a business tool. He seems to accept the optimistic 20 to
30
million figure for the number of people on the Internet, and even
goes so
far as to claims that 80% of all scientists who ever lived are
currently
on the Internet.<P>
These users, he says, form an "ideal" market of young, middle to
upper
class of well-educated and highly motivated people. And the Internet
provides a low cost way of interacting with these "beautiful" people.
"This interaction not only includes public relations and advertising
but
testing of target audiences, sales, and customer support," he says.
<P>
On the other hand, Rutkowski glosses over the threat that this
opportunity poses to the Internet as we know it today. "The principle
major caveat concerns the strong traditions for propriety and privacy
that rule out mass mailing or other intrusive techniques. Such
misconduct
and fraudulent behavior can propagate very quickly."
<P>
Although the Internet Society tends to put a positive spin on the
state
of the Internet, the organization is nevertheless the source of a
great
deal of information about Internet traffic. It measures Internet size
in
terms of connected countries, gateways, hosts, users, services,
networks,
and traffic. Some tidbits:
<P>
* At the end of May, there were 435,760 network addresses. Of those,
47,846 were registered at the global Network Information Center. On
NSFNet, the biggest network on the Internet, new networks connected
to
NSFNet increased last year by 160%. That figure increases to 183%
outside
of the US. Most of the new networks are commercial.
<P>
* In terms of traffic, the largest Internet backbones have been
doubling
every year. In 1994, according to Rutkowski, they are likely to
triple
in size. Traffic on smaller backbones is increasing by roughly 20%
per
month.<P>
* What does all this new traffic mean? File transfers account for 37%
and
messaging only about 18%. However, World Wide Web traffic has grown
to
6.1% of total NSFNet traffic from a negligible amount a little more
than
a year ago. In the past three months, new Web servers have been added
at
the rate of 12 per day.
<P>
According to the Internet Society's latest "Internet Walk"--a survey
of
machines on the net--one million machines got hitched in the last six
months, bringing the total to 3.2 million. That's 81% more than a
year
ago (see tables). The survey was conducted by Mark Lottor of
NetworkWizards. For more detailed data, see the zone directory on

<h2>Exactly What Are All These People Doing?</h2>

In case you're wondering just what all these people are doing on the
Internet, research firm InternetInfo (Falls Church, VA)
(info@internetinfo.com) recently ran a listing of public companies in
seven industries against the InterNIC database. They counted all
those
who had a registered domain, network or host. High tech industries
came
out on top, but surprisingly, biotech was lower than average, while
electric power was higher than average. It seems that the more your
business deals with electrons, the more likely you are to be on the
net
(see table).<P>

<h2>A Flood of Foreign Oil</h2><br>
<h3>
In 1994, imports exceeded domestic 
petroleum production for the first time. </h3>

</center>
<hr>


In 1994, for the first time in history, more than half the oil used 
		in the U.S. was imported, the American Petroleum Institute reported.  The total volume of imported oil also set an all-time record.  The 8,894,000 barrels a day (b/d) of crude oil and petroleum products imported into the U.S. in 1994 amounted to 50.4% of domestic demand.  The previous high was 49.9% in 1993.  <p>
	For total imports, the old mark was 8,786,000 b/d, set in 1977.  Compared with that year, however, U.S. petroleum demand was nearly 800,000 b/d lower in 1994. It has been the decline in domestic crude productiondown more than 1.5 million b/d since 1977that has led to higher imports.  In fact, domestic crude oil production in 1994 averaged 6,629,000 b/dthe lowest level in 40 years, API said.  At the same time, total domestic products supplieda key measure of demandaveraged 17,653,000 b/d.  This was 2.4% more than the 17,237,000 b/d supplied during the previous year.<p>
<p>
<b>Domestic Consumption Gains</b><p>
	Driven by continued robust economic growth, domestic energy consumption increased for the third straight year and reached a historic high of approximately 86 quadrillion BTUs.  Energy use in 1994 grew more slowly than the economy, as it has in every year since 1988.  Total energy consumption grew by 2.4% compared to a nearly 4% increase in the GDP.  The percentage increase in energy consumption in 1994 was the largest since 1988.  Petroleums share of the total energy supplied remained relatively constant from 1993 to 1994.  Since 1991, the percentage share of total energy supplied by oil has been between 40-41%, down from a historical high of 48.7% in 1977.<p>
	Once again, the growth in the consumption of natural gas outpaced the growth in the consumption of oil and other energy sources.  Natural gas consumption rose by an estimated 4.4% in 1994 when compared to the year before, largely due to a projected 10% increase in the use of natural gas by electric utilities.  With the completion of the Iroquois pipeline in 1991 and increased production in both the U.S. and Canada, supplies of natural gas have been more readily available in the Northeast, where consumption of natural gas has been growing most quickly.<p>
	The energy generated from coal use rose by an estimated 1.9%, somewhat slower than the 2.9% increase of the year before.  Nuclear power grew by less than 1%, while the consumption of hydroelectric and other energy fell by 3.7%.<p>
	Industrial demand for total energy is estimated to have risen by nearly 3%, about half the rate of growth in industrial production.  Residential demand is estimated to have grown by a little less than 2%, while transportation demand is estimated to have grown by a little more than 2%.<p>
	Gasoline: Though gasoline deliveries rise for 1994 was the largest since 1988, the 1.7%, roughly 130,000 b/d, gain was still the smallest of any the increases among the major products.<p>
	Since that minor growth spurt six years ago, the increase in gasoline deliveries, once adjusted for definitional changes, have grown only a little over 2%.  (Those changes, having to do with the treatment of ethanol blending and other methodological issues, boosted 1993 figures by about 1.5% from what they would have been on the old basis.)  Even over the past 10 years, which have included some stronger years than in more recent times, gasoline deliveries growth has averaged only a little over 1% annually.  This is only roughly one third the growth rate for highway diesel and jet fuels.<p>
	The years gasoline deliveries amounted to 7.6 million b/d, roughly matching the historical peak reached in 1978.  As evidence of the magnitude of the increase in overall fuel efficiency over the past decade and a half, it is noteworthy that since then the nations economy, and highway travel with it, have grown by roughly 50%.  The rate of improvement in overall fleet efficiency has slowed in the past several years as increasing market penetration of more fuel-efficient vehicles has left fewer less-efficient vehicles to replace.  While gasoline deliveries continued to grow more slowly than highway travel in 1994, the gap was smaller than in the past.  Growth in highway travel in 1994 is estimated at 2.2%, roughly the same as in 1993.<p>
	Deliveries of reformulated gasoline (RFG) rose to over 2 million b/d in December, as the new product moved from the primary distribution system to service stations in advance of EPAs January 1 deadline affecting roughly a third of the gasoline market.  Most likely, the push to get RFG to market in time for the deadline accounts for Decembers unusually large increase in deliveries of 4.6%, to over 8 million b/d.  Although last-minute opt-outs in Pennsylvania, New York, and Maine cut the size of the RFG market by perhaps 7%, these developments occurred after logistical operations to get RFG into place were well under way and likely had little effect on Decembers data for RFG deliveries.<p>
	While RFG deliveries rose compared with prior months, deliveries of oxygenated gasoline slipped counter-seasonally, from 1.9 million b/d in November to less than 1.3 million b/d in December.<p>
	This was only because a significant amount of oxygenated gasoline also falls under the RFG requirement and is grouped in the data with "reformulated" rather than as "oxygenated" gasoline.  When the RFG and oxygenated categories are viewed together, the deliveries of the two combined rose from 2.2 million b/d in November to 3.3 million b/d in December.<p>
	Market shares of gasoline by grade changed little in 1994.  Premium held steady at 20% of gasoline deliveries, as did mid-grade at 12%.  Unleaded regular accounted for the remaining 68% of deliveries.<p>
	Distillate Fuel Oil: Spurred by a strong economic recovery, 1994 deliveries of distillate oil grew at a brisk rate of 4.6%.  At 3.2 million b/d, deliveries in 1994 were the highest that they had been since 1979.  The years deliveries of distillate increased roughly twice as fast as they had in the two previous years.  Deliveries of low sulfur diesel, introduced during the fourth quarter of 1993, were an estimated 20% higher during the fourth quarter of 1994 than the year before.<p>
	The major factor contributing to the robust growth of distillate was the increased demand for diesel from transportation sources.  Industrial output grew by an estimated 6% during 1994, leading to an estimated 8% growth in trucking tonnage.  On-highway diesel demand is estimated to have grown by nearly 9%, or an additional 130,000 b/d; this was significantly more than the 1993 increase of 6.5%.  Since 1984, on-highway diesel use is estimated to have grown by 48%.<p>
	While transportation demand grew sharply, residential demand for distillate decreased by more than 4%, or 20,000 b/d from the year before.  Despite an extremely cold January and February, the areas of the country that rely most heavily on home heating oil were slightly warmer in the first quarter than in the even-colder period one year earlier.  With the fourth quarter 1994 also colder than the year-ago period, the total number of winter heating degree days, a measure of heating demand, was between 1-2% less in the Northeast and Great Lakes states than the year before.<p>
	In addition to slightly warmer temperatures, distillate consumption also reflected a shift away from home heating oil.  The number of homes heated by oil in New England is estimated to be decreasing by 40,000 homes each year, largely due to the increased availability of natural gas in the region.  Between 1990 and 1993, the demand for home heating oil per winter heating degree day decreased by roughly 18%.  The combined effect, then, of a milder first and fourth quarter, and the shift away from home heating oil, caused residential demand for distillate to fall by approximately 20,000 b/d when averaged throughout the year.<p>
	Although low-sulfur distillate is the fastest growing area of the distillate market, the level of deliveries of low-sulfur distillate were even higher in 1994 than might have been expected based on the growth of on-highway demand, where it is mandated.  Deliveries of low-sulfur oil accounted for more than 1.8 million b/d, or 57% of total deliveries. Given that the price differential between high-sulfur and low-sulfur diesel on the spot market has been as low as less than 1 cent during 1994, the spill-over of low-sulfur distillate into non-mandated uses may exceed 100,000 b/d.<p>
	Kerosine Jet Fuel: Deliveries of kerosine jet fuel grew rapidly in 1994, stimulated by higher commercial demand in the fourth quarter and the ongoing conversion of defense aircraft to kerosine jet fuel.  At nearly 1.5 million b/d, yearly deliveries of jet kerosine were at an all-time high, and 9% higher than the year before.  The annual growth rate in jet kerosine deliveries greatly exceeded the previous years growth rate of 3.6%, and was the highest since 1984.  Since 1984, deliveries of jet kerosine have grown by roughly 47%.<p>
	Despite a sharp increase in the number of passengers flying on commercial airlines in 1994, this segment of demand for kerosine jet fuel remained relatively unchanged from 1993 levels until the end of the year.  At least partially due to lower fares and more flights by smaller, low-cost air carriers, the number of passengers carried by the nations airlines rose by more than 6%.  However, the number of available seat miles, a measure of airline capacity, remained roughly the same from year to year.  Thus, the ratio of revenue passenger miles to available capacity grew from 63.5% in 1993 to an estimated 66.4% in 1994, exceeding the postwar high of 66.1% set in 1951.  As a result, during the first three quarters of 1994, the amount of jet fuel consumed by commercial passenger airlines was unchanged from the year before, or even slightly lower.  During the last quarter, available passenger miles grew by between 2-3%, increasing daily demand for kerosine jet fuel by 20-30,000 b/d.<p>
	Although it is a relatively small component of jet kerosine demand, the air cargo industry grew strongly in 1994.  For the year, total cargo miles rose by 10%.  But total air cargo capacity expanded more slowly, and is estimated to have grown by 5% during the year.  The kerosine jet fuel demand from air cargo is estimated to represent between 8-10% of the total commercial demand for jet kero, or approximately 100,000 b/d of total deliveries.  Thus, the growth in air cargo capacity may have added up to an additional 10,000 b/d to final jet kero demand.<p>
	Over the past two years, the U.S. military has been engaged in a program to substitute kerosine jet fuel for the naphtha-based fuel that had been used in military aircraft.  Progressing by region, the first stage of defense conversion began in October 1993, followed by a second stage in June 1994, and a third stage the following October.  A fourth and final stage of defense conversion is scheduled to begin in October 1995.  For the year, military conversion is estimated to have raised demand for kerosine jet fuel by 100,000 b/d, or roughly 80% of the average growth of deliveries in 1994.<p>
	Residual Fuel Oil: Despite a 4% increase in GDP and a 5.7% increase in industrial output that helped to boost demand for other fuels, deliveries of residual oil (resid) continued to fall as they have every year since 1987.  Deliveries of residual oil in 1994 fell below 1 million b/d for the first time since 1940. Since 1987, deliveries of resid have fallen by nearly 400,000 b/d.<p>
	One of the major sources of decline in residual oil deliveries has been a reduction in its demand for use by electric utilities.  In 1988, electric utility demand was roughly 630,000 b/d; currently, electric utility demand for resid has diminished to an average of less than 400,000 b/d.  At the same time, electric utility output has increased by 8%.<p>
	Although the year-to-year variance in electric utility demand for residual oil is influenced by climatic conditions, resid demand has tended to decline as utilities have switched to lower cost fuels.  Over the last five years, the consumption of coal has grown by 8%, due to prices that are 43-57% less per BTU than oil.  Since 1993, increased production and expansion of the supply network has also made more natural gas available to utilities in the Northeast, the area that has traditionally accounted for more than 60% of the consumption of resid by utilities.  Consequently, natural gas consumption by utilities is up by 11% from 1993, displacing more than 50,000 b/d of residual oil demand.<p>
	Demand for bunker fuel, another major component of total residual demand, declined by roughly 8% from 1994.  The year-to-year decline is at least partially due to higher prices for resid in the U.S. compared to alternative fueling sites, particularly during the fourth quarter.  Since 1989, when the demand for resid from vessel bunkering was at its highest point in the last ten years, the use of resid for vessel bunkering has fallen by more than 30%, from approximately 470,000 b/d in 1989 to an estimated 320,000 b/d in 1994.<p>
	Other Oils: The growth in deliveries of "other oils" in 1994, at 2.9%, was stronger than the relatively flat performance in 1993 but still not as large as the nearly 4% increase two years ago.  Most of the past years growth took place in liquefied petroleum gases (LPGs), and propane and butane in particular.  Deliveries of other products in the "other oils" category, such as asphalt, lubricants, and petroleum coke, were relatively flat for the year.<p>
	Over the past 10 years, deliveries of "other oils" have grown over 17%, or close to 700,000 b/d.  Ninety percent of that growth can be attributed to an expanding market for petrochemical feedstocksincluding naphtha, gasoil, ethane, propane, and other petroleum fractionswhich has swelled by over 50% since 1984.  Total petroleum deliveries over the same span have risen over 12%.<p>
	Although streams derived from crude oil account for a substantial portion of petrochemical raw materials, roughly half of these feedstocks are ultimately by-products of natural gas production.  Most ethane and a sizable portion of propane and other feedstocks are extracted from natural gas streams, becoming part of petroleum supply under the category of "natural gas liquids."  Taken together, petrochemical feedstocks now account for 10% of the domestic use of petroleummore than the residential/commercial heating and electric utility sectors combined.
<p><p><b>
Record Low Production</b><p>
	U.S. production of crude oil in 1994 fell by 3.2% to slightly more than 6.6 million b/d, its lowest level since 1954.  While production in the lower 48 states fell by 3.7%, slightly greater than the rate the year before, Alaskan production fell by less than 2% compared to nearly 8% drop from the year before.  Despite technical difficulties, the completion of the GHX-II gas handling project at Prudhoe Bay, coupled with production at the Point McIntyre field beginning in the last quarter of 1993, led to the decrease in the rate of decline of Alaskan production.<p>
	Accompanying the drop in annual production, domestic drilling activity declined sharply during 1994.  Total completions of oil wells fell by more than 30% from their 1993 levels.  Natural gas completions fared somewhat better, with a decline of about 14% from year to year.  However, fourth quarter completions of natural gas wells weakened, perhaps due to persistently low prices for natural gas during the latter part of the year.<p>
	Since 1990, the ratio of exploratory wells that produce either oil or gas has fallen from one out of four wells to one in three.  While the total number of exploratory wells has dropped by 44%, better technology has helped to insure a higher percentage of successful wells. One of these technologies, the three-dimensional seismic survey, has become more readily available as costs have fallen.  By the end of 1994, 5% of the area suitable for the technique had been surveyed, up from less than 1% at the beginning of the decade.<p>
	Imports: By a small margin, total petroleum imports in 1994 surpassed, after 14 years, the previous all-time high of 8.79 million b/d set in 1977.  Imports for the year rose 3.4% to 8.89 million b/d, with both crude oil and products increasing at roughly the same rate.  Total imports amounted to 50.4% of domestic deliveries for the year, up slightly from 1993s previous high of 49.9%.<p>
	It is instructive to note what shifts in the supply/demand balance have occurred since 1977.  Specifically, the return to 1977 import levels cannot be attributed to demand growth, for, in fact, deliveries last year were nearly 800,000 b/d lower than in 1977.  Rather the growth in petroleum imports has been the result of declining domestic crude oil production.  After rising to nearly 9 million b/d in 1985, in part because of Alaskan development, U.S. crude oil output has fallen by 2.4 million b/d to 6.6 million b/d in 1994.  This was more than 1.5 million b/d below 1977s level of 8.2 million b/d.<p>
	The years increase in imports of about 290,000 b/d was less than half the 730,000 b/d increase of 1993.  However, the slower increase was due largely to short-term developments, among them a smaller stock build than in 1993 and a downward shift in product exports, rather than to any slowing in the underlying trend in import growth.  The years increase in deliveries of 415,000 b/d and the decline in domestic crude oil production of about 240,000 b/d together imply growth in import needs for the year of 7-8%.<p>
	Crude oil imports rose 3.4% for the year to 7.0 million b/d and thus accounted for just over half of refinery crude runs in 1994.  Product imports rose at nearly the same rate to 1.9 million b/d.  The largest increase among the major products was for finished gasoline.  Imports of that product rose 110,000 b/d to nearly 360,000 b/d for the year, mainly because of arbitrage opportunities with Europe earlier in the year which have since diminished.  But by November and December, gasoline imports had dropped to the 20-25,000 b/d range.<p>
	Imports of distillate fuel oil in 1994 rose about 20,000 b/d to just over 200,000 b/d, and imports of kerosine jet fuel edged up by about 15,000 b/d to just over 100,000 b/d.  Residual fuel oil imports fell nearly 70,000 b/d to 305,000 b/d, their lowest annual level in decades.  In fact, in 1994 resid lost its long-standing role as the largest product import.  It was surpassed, by 50,000 b/d, by finished gasoline.<p>
	Refinery Operations:  Refinery activity advanced for the third straight year in 1994, as input to crude oil distillation units rose 1.4% for the year.  This was a slightly smaller increase than the 1.8% rise of the prior year, but utilization of reported capacity still reached 92.7%the highest in at least 20 years.  For 1993, utilization had averaged 91.5%.<p>
	These capacity figures measure only basic crude oil distillation capacity, and not the substantial additional capacity to further process petroleum streams into the sophisticated product slate required in the U.S. market.  With the increasing demands on the refining industry both in terms of shifts in the product demands and in environmental requirements - including lead phase-down since the early 1970s, summer gasoline volatility reductions beginning in 1989, the winter oxygenate program since 1992, low-sulfur diesel in 1993, and the RFG program which is just beginningit is not surprising that the U.S. industry leads the world in terms of technical sophistication.  Although domestic refineries account for only about one fifth of the worlds basic crude oil distillation capacity, U.S. refiners operate nearly 40% of the worlds additional downstream processing capacity.<p>
	The effects of one of those shifts in product demand was evident in 1994s refinery output figures.  With continued investment in refinery upgrades and enhancements, output of residual fuel oil, a lower-valued product, fell for the fifth straight year.  Declining by over 3% to just over 800,000 b/d, resid production as a percent of inputs hit a new low of 5.7%.  Meanwhile, output of distillate fuel oil rose 2.7% and moved increasingly towards the low-sulfur variety as the year progressed.  By the fourth quarter, low-sulfur distillate accounted for 60% of distillate output, up from 52% a year earlier.  Production of kerosine jet fuel rose over 8% for the year as increasing demand from converted military facilities added to existing commercial jet fuel demand.<p>
	Gasoline output for the year was down 0.9% because of unusually attractive European imports earlier in the year which had absorbed an additional 110,000 b/d of demand versus 1993.  But in the past two months, gasoline output from refineries and downstream blenders has jumped, reaching 7.8 million b/d in November and December.  As for reformulated gasoline, Decembers production reached nearly 2.1 million b/d.<p>
	Inventories: Total inventories, after dropping a less-than-seasonal 24 million barrels during December, ended the year at 1.064 billion barrels, the highest year-end level in seven years and more than 30 million barrels above the recent-year average.  Crude stocks fell 9 million barrels to 330 million barrels, slightly above average for year-end.<p>
	Gasoline inventories, however, finished the year at only 210 million barrels.  This was 10 million barrels or so above recently-observed lows, but was less than usual for the end of December.  In recent past years, ending stocks for December have more commonly ranged from 215-225 million barrels.  Stocks of RFG at year-end amounted to 41 million barrels, about a quarter of finished gasoline stocks and more or less in line with what many analysts had expected.  The process of turning over storage for RFG and moving product down the distribution chain in time for the January 1 deadline may have contributed to Decembers lower-than-usual level.  Meanwhile, distillate inventories decreased slightly to 144 million barrels, 3 million barrels above average for year-end.<p>

<h2>Coal Production Is Set to Gain</h2><br>
<h3>Record demand for steam coal by utilities will
drive production to record levels.</h3>

</center>
<hr>
The National Coal Association 
		is forecasting increased coal 
		production levels for the second consecutive year, led by continued record demand for steam coal at electric utilities.  Production in 1995 is forecast to reach 1.031 billion tonsan all-time record.<p>
	Utility coal use will hit 838 million tons, the most ever by the utility sector and a clear indication that coal remains the utility fuel of choice.  Fifty-six percent of the electricity produced in the U.S. is generated by coal-fired power plants. This years utility levels will come five years earlier than Dept. of Energy long-term forecasts, which do not call for this level of utility consumption until after the year 2000.<p>
	Production in the East will decrease slightly to 562 million tons from the preliminary 1994 level of 567.4 million tons.  This reflects a decline in production in the Illinois Basin due to implementation of the Clean Air Act of 1990.  Production in the West will continue to increase, reaching 469 million tons, a 1.3% increase from the preliminary 1994 level of 463.1 million tons.<p>
	Total consumption of coal also is expected to reach record levels in 1995, due primarily to the utility coal demand.  Domestic coal consumption and coal for export during 1995 will total 1.029 billion tons, a 1.08% increase from the 1.018 billion tons of estimated 1994 coal use.  Consumer stocks will increase by 11 million tons in 1995.<p>
	The NCA 1995 forecast is based upon the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) forecast published in early November 1994 by the "Blue Chip Indicators."  In 1995, economic growth is expected to slow to an annual rate of 2.7%.  Supporting growth will be a smaller trade deficit and strong business spending on plant and equipment.  However, economists expect interest rates to rise, investment in inventory to slacken off and the important housing and consumer durable sectors to slow.  Thus, a forecast for slower annual growth in GDP.<p>

<b>Utility Coal</b><p>
	Coal consumption at utilities in 1995 should total 838 million tons, 5 million tons above 1994 levels.  Electrical generation is expected to increase by 2.3% in 1995.  Coals market share will be 56%.  Nuclear is expected to increase slightly to a 21.2% market share, oil and gas combined will hold a 13.6% share and hydro/other generation will increase to 9.2% of total generation.<p>
	The forecast notes that the growth in electrical generation by utilities, while related to economic growth, is not as tied to economic growth as it once was.  For the past several years the increase in generation by utilities has been lower than economic growth.  Greater efficiencies, lower energy use per unit of GDP, and an increase in nonutility generation (NUG) and imports have contributed to the decoupling of the one-to-one electricity/GDP relationship.<p>
	Utility coal use during 1995 will increase in the East North Central, West North Central, and South Atlantic/East South Central regions with small declines elsewhere.  In the Northeast, electricity use is expected to be up more than utility generation with the demand being met from nonutility generators and imports.<p>
	While the utility sector will demand record amounts of coal, share is expected to decline slightly from 56.9% to 56%; the oil/gas share of the utility market will increase slightly to 13.6%.  In the West South Central states, coal generation is being affected by an increase in nuclear generation (the Commanche Peak complex in Texas) and by a slight increase in oil/gas generation.  In the Mountain/Pacific states coal use is being impacted by slow growth in electricity demand and a return of hydro power to more normal levels.<p>
	The production sources for utility coal are shifting, partially in response to the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 and partially in response to the shifting centers of demand.  In 1995, for the first time, sub-bituminous coal use by utilities will exceed use of Appalachian coal although the absolute use of Appalachian coal will increase to 300 million tons to meet new demands, especially in the Southeast.  Use of Illinois Basin coal will decline as will lignite.  Utilities will import 6.7 million tons in 1995.<p>
	Nonutility generation continues to have an impact on the generation of electricity from the traditional utility, although the rate of increase is definitely slowing.  In 1985, utility purchases from NUGs were 40,000 gigawatt-hours (GWH); 188,000 GWH in 1994; and will be 192,000 GWH in 1995.  Approximately 15% of this comes from coal generation, 54% from natural gas.<p>
	Two plants will come on-line during 1995, South Carolina Public Service Co.s Cross plant and Virginia Electrics Clover 1.  The Tennessee Valley Authoritys Watts Bar nuclear unit is still scheduled for service in 1995.<p>

<b>Metallurgical Coal</b><p>
	Metallurgical coal use will increase slightly to 32 million tons during 1995.  Raw steel production, which has been strong since 1992, will total approximately 98 million tons during 1995.  Pig iron production, which has been flat at 52 million tons since 1992, should increase to 53 million tons during 1995.  Coke consumption and U.S. coke production capacity seem to be limited to current production levels.  Any changes in demand will be met with increases, or decreases, in imports.  Imports are expected to be about 1 million tons in 1995.
<p>
<b>Industrial/Retail</b><p>
	Coal use by industry and for residential/commercial use has ranged from 80 million to 82 million tons for several years.  This year will be no exception as 82 million tons again will be used by the combined sectors.  Approximately 76 million tons will be used by industry and 6 million by residential and commercial users.<p>

<b>Exports</b><p>
	In 1995 total U.S. exports of metallurgical and steam coal will increase to 77 million tons, up slightly from the 1994 level of 72 million tons.<p>
	Metallurgical coal exports to Canada are expected to experience little growth in 1995, totaling 5 million tons; steam coal exports to Canada also should reach 5 million tons. Metallurgical coal exports overseas in 1995, which have fared relatively well during the past couple of years, will total 46 million tons, up 1 million tons from the 1994 level.<p>
	Steam coal shipments overseas, which dropped from 21 million tons in 1993 to an estimated 18 million tons in 1994, will rebound in 1995 to the 21 million ton level.  Last years decline was in shipments to Europe.  The European economy, and thus the demand for electricity, did not pickup as rapidly in Europe and only showed signs of strength late in 1994.  Also, coal contracts for 1994 were made while portions of the U.S. coal industry were on strike in late 1993.  Customers showed some reluctance to commit to 1994 shipments during this period.  In 1995, with a pickup in the European economy and with competitors sold out, the U.S. should regain some small market share in the European steam coal market.<p>
	Over the next few years U.S. exporters will have to carefully monitor actions that various European countries are taking to respond to their individual climate action plans.  These plans, which all are pointing at a stabilization or reduction in carbon dioxide emissions by 2000, are relying partly on a reduction in coal use to meet stated goals.  These plans, if implemented, could result in reduction of both current and future markets for U.S. steam coal exports.<p>

<b>Varied Picture</b><p>
	Experts outlined a varied picture for coal production and use, power distribution and bulk transportation.  National Coal Association vice president for transportation, Joe Lema, said the industry is witnessing "significant changes" in the demand for coal for power generation.<p>
	As a result, he said, "There is a rising demand for transportation services required to distribute coal to utility and nonutility generators of electricity.<p>
	"Spurred by current and projected growth in the demand for coal, particularly low sulfur coal consumed by utilities to reduce emissions in compliance with deadlines in 1995 and 2000, coal-carrying railroads are being driven toward substantial new investments in transportation equipment and trackage."<p>
	In addition, because of the long-standing importance of barge transportation, and the growing importance of intermodal truck/barge and rail/barge services, "NCA has a continuing program of seeking preservation of an effective network of inland navigation channels and lockage facilities."<p>
	Jack Kawa, senior vice president for research at Dean, Witter, Reynolds, and Kathleen Walton, industry analyst, Merrill Lynch Capital Markets, discussed how the investment sector views the outlook for coal.<p>
	Kawa said there has been a "secular change in the way Americans use electricity, driven by the utilities themselves," which, in turn, has ramifications for coal use.<p>
	"Using demand-side management, utilities have urged customers to use more energy-efficient devices to hold down the demand for electricity," he noted.  This was made necessary, he said, by the difficulty utilities experienced in building new power plants.<p>
	The slowdown in electricity demand, combined with a projected rise in electricity generation by natural gas, is likely to hold down coal demand to some extent, Kawa said.  Electricity demand, which has recently been at the 3% growth level, "is going to come in around 1.2% for 1994 and around 1.5% or less for 1995," he predicted.<p>
	In addition, the composition of coal production has changed in recent years, due to a higher percentage of Powder River Basin production.  "I dont think were going to see eastern coal producers get back to the 1990 level (630 million tons) for a long time.  Western coal will continue to make inroads," he said.<p>
	Walton said that for the first time since the 1980s, there have been "positive changes" in coal prices.  "We believe U.S. coal companies are in a very favorable position to benefit from both this realized and the anticipated turnaround."<p>
	Several key economic indicators are in place which, Walton said, could lead to increased future coal prices.  These include: coal consumption; electricity generating capacity expansions worldwide; low inventories; and an improving global economic outlook.<p>
	Dr. Marion B. Stewart said the good news for coal in terms of market outlook is that "increased competition among electric utilities could sharply reduce the price of electricity to most customers, thus increasing demand."  The bad news, he added, is that "lighter-handed regulation has made natural gas an even more formidable competitor."<p>
	Eugene Trisko discussed Ozone Transport Commission (OTC) activities and the potential impact on coal.  The OTC region currently consumes about 75 million tons of coal annually, about 8% of U.S. utility consumption, he noted.  Regulators in the region have stipulated strict measures to comply with Clean Air Act Amendment nitrogen oxide (NOx) emission limitations.<p>
	"The peculiar danger (to coal) that is associated with using natural gas to reduce NOx emissions is that natural gas has no sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions.  A utility plant confronted with a Phase II SO2 emission limitation may find it can meet its entire acid rain limitations by burning coal six months out of the year and gas six months of the year.  This presents a very real risk to coal," he said.<p>
	Bulk Freight Transportation and Intermodal Minerals Distribution was discussed by David G. Wolach, executive VP, Savage Industries, Inc.; Jimmy F. Bates, deputy director, Civil Works Directorate, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers; David W. Kreutzer, general manager-River Division, CONSOL, Inc.; and Thomas OConnor, VP, Snavely, King & Associates.<p>
	Wolach outlined several reasons for the increasing trend toward rail/truck transportation alliances including the price or cost of receiving coal by the end users; diversification of supply, or the alleviation of risk of shipping or receiving coal by a single mode; access by no other way; environmental concerns; efficiency in deliveries or distribution; and railroads seeking new business.<p>
	Bates noted that dredging "is clearly critical for keeping our navigable waterways operating.  But," he warned, "funding and finding environmentally sound sites to put this material will continue to be problems."  The problem is compounded by the fact that by 2000, nearly half of the nations lock chambers will be more than 50 years old, he said. "We hope that the (budget) outlook for our program will be steady as she goes, in the $3 billion to $4 billion range, for the next few years," he said.<p>
	Kreutzer said the federal government collects some $3 billion to $6 billion in revenue as a result of waterway activity, "far greater than what they expend on construction and maintenance."  <p>
	While this proposal was defeated, a 10-year moratorium on new waterway taxes is over in 1996, raising the possibility that the idea will be reintroduced.  "A $1 tax will cost the towing industry $500 million, over three times the annual profit of the towing industry," he said. "Rather than increase the present tax, efforts must be made to reduce the costs." <p>

<h2>Natural Gas Demand
Continues to Climb
</h2><br>
<h3>The U.S. industry is now in its eighth year of steady expansion.</h3>

</center>
<hr>
The U.S. natural gas industry 
		will continue to grow in the 
		coming year, maintaining the expansion begun in 1986.  Factors that have fueled rapid increases in natural gas usage in recent years (economic growth, competitive natural gas prices, restructuring in the natural gas industry, and market penetration of new high-efficiency gas-fired technologies) will generate continued natural gas demand growth through 1995.  <p>
	This analysis of these factorseven allowing for substantial uncertainty regarding the severity of the winter weather, economic growth, and the global oil marketindicates that expansion of U.S. natural gas demand will proceed substantially unabated in 1995.<p>
	The natural gas industry in the U.S. is currently enjoying its eighth year of expansion after reaching a turning point in 1986.  From the low point of 16.7 Quads registered in 1986, U.S. natural gas demand grew at an average rate of 3.2% per year through 1993.  Growth was particularly strong in the industrial sector, which experienced an average growth rate of 5.2% per year over the period.  Natural gas use in electric utilities, however, remained virtually unchanged.  The industrys growth has continued, and even accelerated, in 1994.  This year, every market sector has grown substantially.  Overall, preliminary estimates indicate that we will register a near-record growth rate of 4.2% by year-end.<p>
	This 1995 Base Case projection of 22.5 Quads of U.S. natural gas consumption is the highest level since 1973.  It represents a 3.4% increase over 1994, and is a scant 0.2 Quads short of the 1972 all-time high of 22.7 Quads.  The range for 1995, 22.0-22.9 Quads, reflects uncertainties associated with weather, economic growth, and oil prices.<p>
	Coming off a base of 4.2% natural gas market growth in 1994 (which was fueled by an economy growing at better than 3%, but restrained by warm weather last spring and this fall and extremely low oil prices throughout the first 3 quarters of 1994), A.G.A. believes that our industry will most likely grow by 3.4% in 1995, delivering 22.4 Quads of natural gas to U.S. consumers in the coming year.  This 1995 Base Case scenario assumes a return to normal weather, continued economic growth of 2.9%, and crude oil prices rising to an average of $17.50 per barrel for the year as a whole.<p>
	Table 1 shows the 1993 actual, 1994 estimated, and 1995 Base Case projections of natural gas use in each market.  As a result of 2.9% economic growth and 1995 crude oil prices, which current market indicators suggest are likely to be higher than in 1994, the largest increase is expected to take place in the industrial sector (up 0.3 Quads over 1994).  If the 1995 heating months see a return to normal weather, then, in combination with an anticipated addition of 1.1 million new residential customers, the residential sector could experience the next-largest increase (0.2 Quads up from 1994).<p>
	The Low Case (5% below normal winter heating degree days {HDDs}, 2% economic growth, and crude oil prices averaging $15.50 per barrel in 1995) projects 1995 natural gas use to be 22.0 Quads, 1.4% above the expected 1994 level and 2.0% lower than the Base Case projection for 1995.  The High Case (5% above normal winter HDDs, 3.5% economic growth, and $19.50 per barrel crude oil prices in 1995) projects 22.9 Quads of natural gas use in 1995, 0.5 Quads (2%) more than foreseen in the Base Case and 1.2 Quads (5.4%) above the estimated 1994 level.<p>
	Three quarters of the 0.9 Quad spread between the Low Case and the High Case in 1995 occurs in the residential and commercial marketsa result of the differences in assumed weather patterns.  Most of the remainder occurs in the industrial sector.  Only one ninth of the range is related to net changes in the electric utility sectorbecause, for electric utilities, weather-induced effects tend to work against, rather than complement, income-induced and price-induced effects.<p>

<b>Residential/Commercial</b><p>
	The principal source of projected natural gas demand growth in the residential and commercial markets in 1995 comes primarily from traditional spaceheating applications.  Consequently, year-to-year changes in natural gas demand in these sectors will depend heavily on the relative severity of one winter as compared with the next.  The anticipated return to normal weather in 1995 in the Base Case (from a 3% below-normal average in 1994) is a positive factor driving the projected 3.6% increase in 1995.<p>
	The rate of growth in residential and commercial customers and the rate of efficiency improvement represent the two other primary factors that affect short-term demand growth.  In recent years, with the availability of new high-efficiency appliances improving natural gas market share, the natural gas industry has been adding about 1.1 million new residential customers and 0.23 million new commercial customers per year.  <p>
	The rate of new business formation, as shown by the component to the Index of Leading Economic Indicators, has been accelerating through September of 1994.  This trend, supported by consumer retail sales growth of 5.5% over 1993, represents one key driver for increasing commercial demand for natural gas in the U.S.  <p>
	Recent increases in interest rates are likely to dampen construction activity, business formation, and, therefore, may slightly reduce the rate of new residential and commercial gas customer additions in 1995.  This effect partly offsets the effect (mentioned above) of an assumed return to normal weather.<p>
	Over the longer term, natural gas cooling and heat pump technologies are likely to gain increasing market penetrations.  Their emergence will augment growth in traditional residential and commercial natural gas applications.  However, to date, they have yet to significantly influence load growth.<p>
	The low and high projections of natural gas demand in these two markets8.4 Quads and 9.0 Quads, respectivelyare driven primarily by the temperature assumptions of 5% fewer and 5% greater winter HDDs, respectively, than assumed in the Base Case.  Variations in assumed economic growth and oil prices have somewhat less effect.<p>

<b>Industrial</b><p>
	In the last year, the durable goods portion of the industrial sector, which is the most energy-intensive portion, has increased its output by nearly 1% and its contribution to GDP by 16%.  Autos, household appliances and other consumer durables led the advance in the early part of 1994.  Business Fixed Investment provided a major contribution to growth in the most recent quarter.<p>
	As the U.S. economy continues its growth, the industrial sector has relied increasingly heavily on natural gas as its energy source of choice.  A significant portion of this growth has been associated with the increasing popularity of cogeneration as a highly efficient and economical approach to simultaneously meeting industrial needs for electricity and steam.  The A.G.A. outlook for 1995 continues the trend.  The success of new natural gas technologies (such as the Reduced NOX Emissions Donlee Boiler and the Packaged Engine-Driven Integrated Industrial Refrigeration System) are beginning to supplement traditional boiler and process uses.<p>
	The industrial sector is the single largest natural gas consumer in the U.S., using more gas in 1994 than the residential and commercial sectors combined.  Industrial gas demand in 1993 grew 5.4% above 1992 levels.  Industrial natural gas use during the first eight months of 1994 was 2.2% higher than the same period in 1992, and is expected to finish the year with 2.0% growth over 1993.<p>
	For 1995, the Base Case foresees 3.2% increase in industrial natural gas use, to 8.6 Quads for the year.  Much of this growth is expected to occur in gas-fired cogenerators and independent power plants coming on-line in 1995.  Growth in basic industries such as steel, paper and petrochemicals, all major natural gas users, is being supported by the overall economic recovery, and provides an important force for natural gas demand growth.<p>
	In the Low Case, the combination of slower economic growth, lower oil prices, and warmer temperatures (which reduce industrial space-heating requirements) choke off industrial natural gas use at 8.5 Quads in 1995a 2.2% advance over 1994.  The High Case, with faster economic growth, higher oil prices, and colder temperatures, projects 4.2% growth in industrial natural gas use in 1995, reaching 8.7 Quads for the year.  In the industrial market, the variations in assumed economic growth and oil prices account for most of the total range.  Variations in assumed weather patterns play only a secondary role in these projections of industrial natural gas use.<p>

<b>Electric Utilities</b><p>
	Short-term growth in this sector is affected by several major factors.  Weather (both HDDs and CDDs), the availability of hydropower, the status of nuclear power plants, and the relative prices of natural gas, coal, and oil all play important roles.  In 1994, demand growth in this sector was boosted by low natural gas prices relative to coal.<br>
	The 1995 Base Case projects 2.6% increase in electric utility natural gas use from 1994 to 1995, to a level of 3.2 Quads.  Factors contributing to the increase in projected electric utility natural gas use in the Base Case include continued growth in demand for electricity and in gas-fired generating capacity, and continued favorable price relationships between natural gas and alternative fuels.<p>
	The Low Case, influenced by the $2.00 per barrel drop in assumed crude oil prices, holds projected electric utility natural gas use in 1995 at 3.1 Quads, the same as in 1994.  The High Case, affected by the assumed $2.00 per barrel increase in crude oil prices, projects natural gas use by electric utilities in 1995 to reach slightly above 3.2 Quads.<p>
	It is important to recognize that natural gas use by electric utilities can rise or fall significantly from one year to the next due to the influence of factors not incorporated in either the Low or High sensitivity cases.  Low rainfall and/or snowfall can decrease the operability of hydro plants and bring about increased natural gas use by electric utilitiesand high rainfall and/or snowfall levels can have the opposite effect.  Start-up of a nuclear plant can bring about a noticeable drop-off in natural gas use by electric utilitiesand shutdown of another for maintenance and/or repair can result in a perceptible increase in electric utility natural gas use.  <p>
	Changes in the cost or availability of coal or heavy oil, sometimes triggered by strikes here or even abroad, can also affect the amount of natural gas used by electric utilities.  Therefore, the full range of potential natural gas use levels projected for electric utilities in 1995 in the two sensitivity cases probably understates the actual amount of variability to which this market sector is susceptible.<p>

<b>Production and Transport</b><p>
	Roughly 1.3 Quads of natural gas are used each year in operating gas and oil production facilities.  The total amount of natural gas used in this market has changed very little in recent years, perhaps partly because ongoing declines in U.S. oil production have been accompanied by increases in natural gas production.  Analysis suggests that the amount of lease and plant fuel is unlikely to change markedly in the short run, and will not be greatly affected by the factors incorporated in the two sensitivity cases.<p>
	Roughly 0.6 Quad of natural gas is used annually in operating the U.S. natural gas delivery network.  The total amount of natural gas used in this fashion has grown gradually in recent years, as overall U.S. natural gas use has increased.  The changes in total natural gas throughput foreseen in the sensitivity cases presented here cause only very minor changes in the amount of natural gas used as compressor fuel. <p>

<h2>Meeting the Priorities 
for Nuclear Energy
</h2><br>
<h3>Design is becoming more sophisticated.</h3>

</center>
<hr>The road in 1995 for Americas 
		nuclear industry is clearly 
		marked with three priority goalsmoving ahead in developing designs for advanced nuclear plants, continuing to improve the cost-competitiveness of todays 109 plants, and helping break the impasse on waste.<p>
	Advanced-plant designs will move closer to the marketplace in the coming year.  The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission is expected to certify two designs for large advanced plants in early 1996.  Testing of key systems in two designs for mid-sized plants will also move forward.  Progress on these designs is essential to keeping America the world leader in nuclear power and assuring that U.S. companies can compete in international markets.  Nowhere is this clearer than in Asia, where countries with growing economies are turning increasingly to nuclear power, and where the first advanced nuclear plantsof American designare being built.<p>
	Average operating costs of U.S. nuclear units continued to decline in 1994, but we will not rest on this achievement.  Unrelenting competition demands that we fine-tune every aspect of plant performance.  Nuclear plants with the best safety records are also generally the lowest-cost producers.  This experience demonstrates that high safety levels can be maintained as operations costs are further reduced.<p>
	The new Congress will have an opportunity to set Americas nuclear-waste program on course in 1995.  The nuclear industry will work closely with legislators and the Clinton Administration to put in place an integrated system for managing spent fuel from nuclear plants.  This system should begin moving spent fuel to an interim storage facility in 1998 as the first step toward permanent disposal.<p>

<b>1994: A Review</b><p>
	Like other companies, U.S. electric utilities are facing intensified competition, making it imperative that nuclear energy plants fine-tune every aspect of their performance to enhance their economic position. A year after the nuclear industry launched a strategic plan to improve the economic performance of its plants, nuclear units chalked up progress with greater productivity, shorter outages and lower production costs.<p>
	Productivity of U.S. nuclear power plants continued its upward climb.  In 1993 (the last full year for which data are available), they had the highest average capacity factor ever at 74.6%, up from 73.2% the year before.  (Capacity factor is the ratio of electricity produced by a generating unit over a period of time, compared to the electricity that could have been produced by full-time operation during the same period.)<p>
	This peak performance, coupled with a drop in operating and maintenance costs, resulted in a 2.6% decrease in the average cost per kilowatt-hour (kWh) of producing nuclear electricity in 19931.55 cents per kWh, down from 1.59 cents in 1992.<p>
	The industry also addressed another key cost factor at nuclear plantsthe duration of planned maintenance outages.  Planned outages cost utilities an average of $300,000 in lost revenues each day a plant does not produce electricity, so reducing the number of outage days represents a significant savings.  The median number of days needed to refuel nuclear energy plants dropped to 58 days in the first half of 1994, down from 78 days four years ago.  Some U.S. plants now hold outages to 40 days, and a few keep them to 30 days - rivaling their European counterparts.<p>
	This year the industry also continued to work with the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to identify regulatory procedures that do not increase safety in nuclear-plant operations, but drive up costs.<p>
	An important component of the industrys cost-reduction effort is a program to share information between plants, so operators learn about the most effective operating practices and can implement those improvements industry-wide.<p>
	In 1993, President Clinton pledged the U.S. would meet the goals of the Rio Earth Summits global climate change treaty by committing the country to reduce carbon dioxide emissions to 1990 levels by the end of the decade.  Nuclear energy can help meet those goals without sacrificing a growing economy.<p>
	Without its nuclear energy plants, U.S. carbon dioxide emissions would have been 30% higher in 1993, the last year for which complete data are available.  In that year alone, Americas 109 nuclear energy plants cut out 133 million metric tons of carbonabout as much as was absorbed by natural carbon "sinks" like trees, plants and soils.  Nuclear energy also cut 4.7 million tons of sulfur dioxide emissions and 2.2 million tons of nitrogen oxides that year.<p>
	Over the past 20 years, U.S. nuclear energy plants have significantly reduced greenhouse gas emissions.  From 1973-1993, nuclear energy plants cut a total of 1.6 billion metric tons of carbon, 65 million tons of sulfur dioxidethought to cause acid rainand 27 million tons of nitrogen oxides, known to contribute to urban smog and acid rain.<p>
	The U.S. nuclear industry took an important step into the future in 1994 when the NRC issued final design approvals for two large advanced nuclear-plant designs: the General Electric Advanced Boiling Water Reactor (ABWR) and the ABB Combustion Engineering System 80+ pressurized water reactor.<p>
	These final design approvals were first awarded under a reformed licensing process.  The next generation of nuclear plants will have more predictable construction costs and schedules because they will be licensed based on preapproved designs, and major regulatory issues will have been reviewed and resolved before plants are ordered and built.  This approach will help eliminate the financial risks and schedule delays that resulted from major design changes during construction.<p>
	Two mid-size advanced designs - Westinghouses AP600 and General Electrics Simplified Boiling Water Reactor (SBWR) - are under review at the NRC.  They moved toward final design approval in 1994, when the NRC approved a comprehensive utility requirements document for plants of this size.<p>
	The utility requirements document was developed by the Electric Power Research Institute and reflects the market-driven philosophy underlying the development of advanced plants.  It contains thousands of requirements to meet five goals vital to potential owners: higher safety levels; greater and longer plant life reliability; simplified design; improved economics; and shorter construction times.<p>
	A program to take two designs beyond the level of information required for design certification - and develop so-called "first-of-a-kind" engineering - moved ahead on GEs SBWR and Westinghouses AP600.<p>
	The first-of-a-kind-engineering program is managed by the Advanced Reactor Corp., a consortium of 14 utilities.  Engineers are using computer-assisted tools to produce the detailed engineering information that prospective buyers will need to develop firm construction schedules and cost estimates for those plants.  This $276 million program is a cost-shared effort that is funded primarily by the industry, with $34.2 million appropriated by Congress for 1995.<p>
	Continued Congressional support for advanced-plant programs in 1994 showed the importance legislators place on maintaining American leadership in nuclear-power technology, based on a market-driven approach and a partnership between government and industry.<p>
	Development of designs for advanced nuclear plants is critical to a secure energy future for America.  Several trends point to the need for new electricity plants in the years ahead.  U.S. electricity demand is expected to grow at about 2% each year through the end of the decade, even with highly successful conservation measures.  About 200 new large electricity plants will be needed by 2010 to meet that growth.<p>
	At the same time electricity needs are growing, Americas electricity supply system is aging.  By 2000, more than a third of todays plants will be more than 30 years old, and some will need to be replaced.<p>
	In 1994, progress on the proposed site for a federal spent-fuel repository at Yucca Mountain, NV reached a crucial milestone when a tunnel boring machine began digging a network of underground laboratories that will allow scientists to conduct in-depth, scientific studies of the site.  Also this year, Congress allowed the U.S. Dept. of Energy (DOE) greater access to ratepayer funds contributed to run the federal spent-fuel disposal project.  For fiscal year 1995, available funds for the project will be 47% higher than the year before.<p>
	Despite this progress, DOE has been unwilling to acknowledge its obligation under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 to begin moving spent fuel from nuclear energy plants in 1988.<p>
	The need for action is critical.  Twenty-six nuclear units will run out of existing spent-fuel storage space by 1998, and 80 will run out by 2010the earliest date a repository is expected to open.<p>
	In May 1994, DOE issued a notice of inquiry seeking public comment on its obligation to take spent fuel by 1998.  An overwhelming response from the public, the financial community, state regulators and industry sent DOE the clear message that it must begin the process of managing spent fuel by meeting its deadline.<p>
	The nuclear energy industrys response to DOE proposed an integrated spent-fuel management system that includes a cask and transportation system to move the fuel, a central interim spent-fuel storage facility, and a permanent repository.<p>
	The nuclear energy industry estimated that an interim storage facility that would operate until a permanent repository is ready could save utility ratepayers $5 billion over the life of the spent-fuel management system.<p>
	Efforts to create a private, interim spent-fuel storage alternative also moved ahead in 1994.  In April, 33 utilities and the Mescalero Apache Tribe in New Mexico entered an agreement to develop plans for a private storage facility on tribal lands in Southern New Mexico.  The proposed agreement will be voted on by the full tribe early next year.  If approved, the work will begin on environmental studies to support an NRC license, and the facility could begin accepting spent fuel in 2002.<p>
	The need for new low-level radioactive waste disposal facilities moved into the national spotlight this summer.  In June, South Carolina closed its Barnwell disposal site to states outside the Southeast.  The move left industrial, medical, scientific and electricity production facilities in 31 states with no disposal facility.<p>
	South Carolinas action means that hospitals, laboratories, factories and nuclear plants in states without access to disposal facilities must store waste on-site.  Some companies are running out of space and are curtailing operations, while others must spend money for on-site disposal that would otherwise go for research, medical care or investments in facilities.<p>
	Progress in developing new disposal facilities has been slow since Congress put states on notice in 1980 that they are responsible for siting facilities, either individually or in groups called compacts.  In 1994 some forward steps were taken.  Maine and Vermont approved a plan developed in cooperation with Texas, which agreed to locate a disposal facility for the three states in the Lone Star State.  Pennsylvania is moving toward choosing a site for a regional facility that will also serve Maryland, Delaware and West Virginia.<p>
	But California, the state that was once closest to siting a new facility, remained stalled in 1994.  In February 1993, the Clinton Administration refused to allow the transfer of federal land at the Ward Valley site in Southern California, even though the state had completed extensive environmental reviews and licensed the facility.  The California disposal site would also serve Arizona, North Dakota and South Dakota.  In 1994 the federal government ordered an additional study of the site by the National Academy of Science.  Results of the NAS study are expected in early 1995.<p>

<b>Next Generation Readied</b><p>
	After more than 10 years of intensive effort, EPRIs and the nuclear industrys program to develop the next generation of advanced light water reactors (ALWRs) is coming to fruition.  These reactors embody advanced technical features that enhance their safety, performance, and economic competitiveness.  Their development has been undertaken as part of a larger strategic plan that addresses broad institutional issues, such as public acceptance, financing, and regulatory reform. All of these elements are needed to revitalize the nuclear option in the U.S.<p>
	The technical program has made substantial progress, and already versions of the first power plants based on the new designs are under construction abroad, where demand for electricity is growing at a faster pace than in the U.S.  By the time American utilities are expected to begin ordering new baseload plants again, around the year 2000, their options will include four standardized ALWR designs precertified by the Nuclear Regulatory Commissionplants that can be built with a high degree of confidence with respect to schedules and total costs.<p>
	The design certification process, focusing primarily on safety issues, covers only a fraction of the engineering details needed to build an ALWR.  The first-of-a-kind engineering (FOAKE) work brings the level of design detail up to about 65% completionenough to define firm cost estimates, support commercial standardization, and pave the way for plant construction in the American utility market.  Since only about 15-20% of the total design scope that defines a plant has to be customized for site-specific needs, eventually about 80-85% of the engineering design of a plant will be part of a standardized, off-the-shelf plant package.<p>
	The FOAKE program for ALWRs has been under way since 1992.  A consortium of utilities, working through EPRI in a tailored collaboration arrangement, established ARC as a vehicle to merge, under utility management, government and utility funds to support FOAKE on selected designs.  Funding of the FOAKE effort is provided through matching contributions from DOE and private industry.  ARC has already completed two phases of work on the FOAKE programthe definition of engineering scope and design evaluation criteria, and the selection of two ALWR alternatives for full FOAKE design.  Phase 3 design work began in 1993 on the two plants selected: the ABWR and the AP600.  For the ABWR, FOAKE is expected to be completed in 1996; for the AP600, in 1997.  Over $275 million has been committed for this work.<p>
	General Electrics ABWR is characterized by several advanced design features.  In the FOAKE design, control blades are operated with electric motors capable of fine-motion control during start-up and power maneuvering.  The use of such motors will reduce the maintenance requirements and occupational exposure associated with equivalent controls in current plants.  The flow of coolant through the core is accomplished by 10 internal pumps, thus eliminating external recirculation piping and all large-vessel nozzles below the core.  This arrangement results in a 50% reduction in the number of welds for the primary system pressure boundary and also reduces the need for in-service inspections.  In addition, no equipment inside the primary containment structure requires routine surveillance and maintenance.<p>
	Several passive safety features have also been incorporated into the evolutionary ABWR design.  In the unlikely event of an extreme accident, high temperatures in the drywell directly below the reactor vessel would automatically initiate flooding from the large suppression pool that surrounds the vessel.  Such flooding would prevent the generation of noncondensable gases from a reaction of core debris with concrete at the bottom of the drywell.  Water in the suppression pool would also serve to trap most fission products so that they could not be released to the environment, even if the containment structure should become overpressurized.<p>
	FOAKE work on the Westinghouse AP600 concentrates on taking the philosophy of standardization and simplification one step furthertoward modular construction and a primarily passive safety system.  Compared with conventional reactors, the AP600 in its final design is expected to have 50% fewer valves, 80% less safety-grade piping, 35% fewer pumps, and 70% less control cable.  Construction time could be reduced to three years or less, from groundbreaking to fuel loading.<p>
	Passive safety features dominate both the emergency core cooling system and the containment cooling system of the AP600.  To handle small leaks that may occur during normal operation, water from the core makeup tank would flow into the reactor by the force of gravity.  In the event of a loss-of-coolant accident (LOCA), additional water could be injected by gas pressure from the accumulator tank.  The contents of an even larger refueling water storage tank would also be available, if needed, to cope with a LOCA.  Air-operated valves are designed to send makeup water to the core automatically if they lose either pressure or their control signal.  This design eliminates the need for a separate emergency feedwater system, and no operator action would be needed to ensure a safe response to either a small leak or a major LOCA.<p>
	The passive containment cooling system of the AP600 uses convective airflow and evaporative cooling in much the same way a conventional cooling tower does.  The steel containment vessel is separated from the surrounding concrete shield building by an airflow baffle.<p>
	In addition to the two designs selected for the present FOAKE work, two other plants are also being developed aggressively.  ABB Combustion Engineering has designed an evolutionary plant based on its three operating nuclear units at the Palo Verde plant in Arizona and four plants under construction in Korea.  Called the System 80+, the new design is a 1350-MWe pressurized water reactor that embodies design features for enhanced safety, increased operating margins, improved operability and maintainability, and simplification for reduced costs.  The System 80+ received final design approval from the NRC in the summer of 1994.<p>
	One of the key features of the plant design is an improved state-of-the-art advanced control room design.  Human factors engineering considerations have been treated explicitly in this design, as have considerations for simplified operations and maintenance aspects.  The first unit of the advanced System 80+ design is expected to be built in Taiwan.<p>
	In addition to supporting the development of the AP600, EPRI and DOE are also supporting the development of General Electrics SBWR, which employs natural circulation for power generation.  This design offers levels of simplicity unprecedented in a commercial nuclear power plant of this size.  The testing activities are expected to be completed by mid-1995, and in early 1996, the NRC will commence review of the SBWR safety analysis report and related documentation, leading to issuance of final design approval and design certification.<p>

<b>International Markets</b><p>
	From the beginning of the ALWR program, international participation and the international market have been critical factors.  Unlike U.S. utilities, which have faced an unprecedented period of slow growth and generally have not placed orders for large new baseload plants in several years, utilities in other countries face supply shortages and are ordering new power plants at a rapid pace.  <p>
	In these markets, nuclear isand is expected to continue to bean important player.  Nine international utilities are currently sponsoring participants in the ALWR program. <p> 
	The level of international interest in the U.S. program is increasing.  For example, Chinas National Nuclear Corp. recently signed a letter of intent with Westinghouse that, subject to government approvals, could lead to the construction of two AP600 plants. The first actual construction of an advanced light water reactor is currently under way in Japan, where two General Electric ABWR units are being built at Tokyo Electric Power Co.s (TEPCOs) Kashiwazaki-Kariwa site, northwest of Tokyo.<p>

<h2>Moving Toward
Competition
</h2><br>
<h3>Do nonutility generators spell the demise
of the vertically integrated utility?</h3>

</center>
<hr>Electricity markets in the U.S. are 
		in the midst of a period of rapid 
		change.  The age of the domination of the vertically integrated system, where one utility controlled the generation, transmission, and distribution of electricity to each customer - while not over - is waning.  The final outcome of the changes occurring is still unclear, but various states are taking steps to look to a more competitive future.<p>
	One indication of the changes occurring is the rise of nonutility generators in wholesale power markets.  From the beginning of this century through the 1970s, the economies of scale associated with large generating facilities led the industry to be dominated by large, vertically integrated utilities.  During the 1970s, the capacity of nonutility generators actually declined, while utility generating capacity grew by more than 240 gigawatts.  Electric utilities continued to dominate through the 1980s, but nonutilities, spurred by the passage of the Public Utilities Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (PURPA), increased their capacity substantially.  Their growth continued into the early 1990s, when nonutilities accounted for approximately one half of all new capacity additions.<p>
	Further stimulated by the passage of EPACT, nonutilities are expected to continue to play an important role in meeting growth in the demand for electricity through 2010.  However, utilities are also taking steps to increase their competitiveness.  Through consolidations, staffing reductions, and other cost-cutting measures, utilities are preparing for a more competitive future.<p>
	While utilities and nonutilities try to keep up with the evolving structure of the electricity market, they are also faced with slower growth in demand than in the past.  Historically, the demand for electricity has been linked with economic growth.  This positive relationship will continue, but the magnitude of the ratio is uncertain.<p>
	During the 1960s, electricity demand grew by over 7%, nearly twice the rate of economic growth.  In the 1970s and 1980s, however, the ratio of electricity demand growth to economic growth declined to 1.5 and 1.0, respectively.  Throughout the forecast this slowing trend is expected to continue.  Several factors have contributed to this trend, including increasing market penetration of electric appliances; improvements in equipment efficiency brought about by consumer expectations of higher energy prices; utility investments in demand-side management programs; and legislation establishing more stringent equipment efficiency standards.  For example, by 1991, nearly 70% of homes in the U.S., the majority of those in warmer climates, had air conditioning systems.<p>
	There are factors that could mitigate the slowing of electricity demand growth seen in these projections.  New electricity appliances seem to appear almost daily.  Only a few years ago, no one could have foreseen the growth in home computers, facsimile machines, copiers, and security systems, all powered by electricity.  If the new uses of electricity are more substantial than currently expected, they could partially offset the efficiency gains shown in these projections.
<p><p>
<b>Demand Growth Slows</b><p>
	To 2010, the annual growth rate for electricity demand is projected to be between 0.8-1.4%.  The electricity demand growth rate is also significantly lower than the historical 3.2% annual growth in electricity demand from 1970-1993.<p>
	Several factors contribute to the decrease in electricity demand growth in the forecast.  By complying with EPACT, businesses and municipalities are expected to improve energy efficiency through the installation of energy-efficient lighting and appliances, increased building efficiency, and support of energy efficiency in process-related industries.  In addition, appliance manufacturers are required to meet efficiency standards for certain appliances before they can be marketed.<p>
	Demand-side management programs are also expected to increase throughout the 1990s.  By granting customers rebates for installing energy-efficient appliances, utilities provide incentives to lower energy consumption.  In charging reduced rates for off-peak service, utilities can delay the need for new capacity by promoting the efficient use of currently available capacity.  Demand-side management programs are expected to reduce the demand for electricity by 73 billion kWh in 1997, relative to the level that would have been reached in their absence.<p>
	A difference of 0.9 percentage point in the economic growth rate yields a 63 gigawatt range in total capacity additions requiredfrom 107 gigawatts in the low growth case to nearly 170 gigawatts in the high growth case.  This capacity range is equivalent to 207 power plants, assuming a capacity of 300 megawatts per plant.  In the reference case, utilities are expected to add 78 gigawatts of new capacity and retire 53 gigawatts between 1993 and 2010, for a net gain of 25 gigawatts.  Nonutilities add 41 gigawatts of new net capacity, accounting for 62% of the total net capacity added.  Renewable capacity additions range from 15 gigawatts in the low growth case to more than 24 gigawatts in the high growth case.  Nearly 16 gigawatts of new net capacity is supplied by cogenerators during this period.<p>
	Gas-fired combined-cycle and combustion turbine technologies provide a significant share of the expected new capacity. These technologies have the advantages of relatively low initial capital cost, high efficiency, and low emissions.  New coal and renewable capacity will also be used for baseload and peak requirements, respectively.  Across the low and high growth cases, coal-fired capacity additions vary by 18 gigawatts, and renewable capacity additions vary by 9 gigawatts.  Gas turbines, while adding the most capacity, essentially meet peak requirements.  Most electricity requirements will be met by coal-fired and gas combined-cycle capacity.
<p><p>
<b>Extended Plant Life</b><p>
	Before building new capacity, utilities are expected to use other options to meet demand growthlife extension and repowering of existing plants, imported power from Canada and Mexico, demand-side management, and purchases from cogenerators.  Even so, assuming an average plant capacity of 300 megawatts, a projected 450 new plants with a total of 135 gigawatts of capacity will be needed by 2010 to meet growing demand and to offset retirements.<p>
	Of the new capacity needed, 61% is projected to be gas-fired or oil- and gas-fired combined-cycle or combustion turbine technology.  Both technologies are designed primarily to supply peak and intermediate capacity, whereas combined-cycle technology can also be used to meet baseload requirements.<p>
	Through 2010, the equivalent of 97 plants with a total of 29 gigawatts of new planned and additional unplanned coal-steam capacity are projected to come on-line, and the equivalent of 52 plants totaling 16 gigawatts are expected to retire.  After 2005, coal-steam plants will compete effectively with gas-fired plants for baseload capacity.  More than 46% of the new coal-fired capacity will be added after 2005.<p>
	Except for units in the construction pipeline, no additional nuclear or hydroelectric capacity is expected.  Nuclear plants are assumed to retire, with no life extension, as their current operating licenses expire.  Increases in hydroelectric capacity that result from repowering are expected to be offset by retirements.<p>
	As they have since early in this century, coal-fired power plants are expected to remain the dominant source of electricity through 2010.  In 1993, coal plants accounted for 41% of the generating capacity in the United States and for 53% of the electricity generated.  Rising environmental concerns about coal plants, combined with their relatively long construction lead times and the availability of economical natural gas, make it unlikely that many new coal plants will be built before 2000.  However, slow demand growth and the huge investment in existing plants will keep coal in its dominant position.<p>
	The large investment in existing plants will also make nuclear power an important source of electricity through 2010.  In recent years, the performance of nuclear power plants has improved substantially, and two units now under construction are expected to become operable in the near term.  As a result, nuclear generation increases through 2006.  After 2006, however, nuclear generation is expected to decline as older units are retired.<p>
	In percentage terms, generation from gas-fired power plants shows the largest increase in the forecast.  As a result, by 2010, gas-fired generation by utilities, nonutilities, and cogenerators overtakes nuclear power as the nations second largest source of electricity.  Generation from oil-fired plants remains fairly small throughout the forecast. The future for natural gas in electricity generation is bright.  Gas-fired generation is expected to increase by over 60%.  Increased use of gas by utilities, nonutilities, and cogenerators is projected to raise its share of total generation to 18% by 2010.  New combustion turbine and combined-cycle plants, with efficiencies approaching 50%, make gas-fired plants competitive with other resource options.  Their high efficiencies relative to other resource options, such as conventional coal-fired power plants (around 35%), partially offset their higher fuel costs.  Only after 2005 do rising gas prices begin to make gas-fired plants less economical.<p>
	Financially, combustion turbines and combined-cycle plants are attractive because of their modularity and relatively low capital costs.  Unlike traditional steam plants, the per-kilowatt costs and thermal efficiencies of small turbine and combined-cycle plants are similar to those for larger plants.  Thus, it is economical to add them in small increments, reducing the financial burden on the utility or nonutility and allowing capacity to be added slowly as demand grows.<p>
	Gas-fired plants are also attractive for environmental reasons, since gas produces much lower carbon and sulfur emissions during combustion than do coal and oil.  Because sulfur dioxide emissions from gas-fired plants are near zero, there is no need for operators to purchase the emission allowances required for coal- and oil-fired plants.<p>
	In response, utilities and nonutilities have begun taking steps to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions below the established ceilings.  Relatively "dirty" plants must take action by 1995, while other affected plants have until 2000.  The goal is to reduce annual emissions below 9 million short tons, compared with 14.8 million in 1993.<p>
	In each phase, affected facilities are issued annual permits, or allowances, to emit a fixed amount of sulfur dioxide in the permit year or any year thereafter.  Each operator must ensure that there are sufficient allowances on hand to cover the years emissions.  Compliance options include fuel switching (to lower sulfur fuels) or blending, purchasing allowances, and installing flue gas desulfurization equipment (scrubbers).  Utilities have reported plans to switch or blend fuels at most of their units affected by Phase I.  They have already begun actions to modify older plants that burn bituminous coal to enable them to burn lower sulfur subbituminous coal.  For other affected units, utilities have reported plans to purchase allowances and add scrubbers.  After 2000, as the restrictions tighten, more operators are expected to use scrubber retrofits to stay within compliance limits.<p>
	This forecast assumes that all nuclear units will operate to the end of their current license terms, with 19 units (13.7 gigawatts) retiring by 2010.  Two units under construction, Watts Bar 1 and 2, are assumed to be completed by 1997, and no newly ordered plants become operational during the forecast period.  Given these assumptions, 93 nuclear units are projected to produce 16% of total electricity generation in 2010.<p>
	Because the average age of nuclear units is currently less than 20 years, the performance of older reactors is not well established.  By 2010 most operable units will have been in service for more than 20 years; however, their expected lifetimes are uncertain.  The early retirements of Yankee Rowe and San Onofre 1 in 1992 and Trojan in 1993 occurred because the utilities faced costly repairs when future competitiveness was uncertain.  Also, the lack of a permanent waste repository may require increased on-site spent fuel storage capability for continued operation at some units.<p>
	The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has recognized that nuclear reactors can operate safely beyond the initial license period.  There is a process in place for utilities to extend their operating licenses for up to 20 years past the current 40-year license term.  Also, two advanced designs have recently received Final Design Approval, which, under the new streamlined Design Certification Process, will allow future orders of the same type to be placed without a complete design safety review each time.<p>
	Two alternative cases were developed to show the effects of different operating lifetime assumptions on total nuclear capacity.  In the low nuclear case, all units were assumed to be retired 5 years before their license expiration dates (52 units between 1993 and 2010).  In the high nuclear case, 5 additional years of operation were assumed (only 2 units retiring by 2010).  In the low case, new coal-fired, combined-cycle, and combustion turbine units would replace the retiring nuclear units.  Assuming an average unit size of 300 megawatts, approximately 88 additional unplanned fossil-fueled units would be built.  In the high case, new builds of all plant types would be reduced slightly, as the additional power supplied by nuclear units reduces the need for new capacity by 12 gigawatts.<p>
	As a result of new build decisions, the consumption of various fuels is affected in the alternate cases.  In the low nuclear case, consumption of oil and natural gas increases by 0.8 quadrillion Btu and coal by 0.9 quadrillion Btu relative to the reference case, resulting in an additional 35 million metric tons of carbon emissions, or 6% higher than in the reference case.  Additionally, the utility price of coal increases by $1.26 per short ton and the price of natural gas by $0.15 per thousand cubic feet.  In the high nuclear case, consumption of fossil fuels by electric generators decreases by 0.5 quadrillion Btu, and carbon emissions are reduced by 11 million metric tons, from 584 million metric tons in the reference case to 573 million metric tons.
<p><p>
<b>Electricity Renewables</b><p>
	Hydropower, used primarily for baseload generation, now generates as much electricity as about 100 medium-sized (500 megawatt) coal plants.  According to the reported plans of electric utilities, hydroelectric generation will grow slightly (about 0.6% annually) through 2010, mainly as a result of turbine repowering.  New hydropower developments will face increased environmental constraints, and Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) relicensing requirements will offset capacity increases in many cases.<p>
	FERC now considers relicensing of hydroelectric plants on a "cumulative impacts" basis, weighing the environmental and water use impacts of existing and proposed projects on an entire river basin and modifying existing licenses when it finds the cumulative negative impacts of all dams in a given river basin unacceptable.  In May 1994, the U.S. Supreme Court held that states may impose conditions on hydroelectric operations, such as minimum stream flow requirements, as part of their authority under the Clean Water Act of 1977.  That interpretation could limit hydroelectric generation at both existing and proposed projects as states require FERC to impose license conditions that operators release water over spillways instead of through turbines.<p>
	Because of hydropowers zero fuel cost, it is used by electricity producers whenever available.  However, variations in precipitation can limit its availability, and generation from the same installed capacity can vary by 5% or more from one year to another as a result of variations in annual water flows.<p>
	Much of the wind energy market before 2000 will result from legislated set-asides, which add about a gigawatt of capacity, bringing the total to 3 gigawatts in 2000.  Strong growth is expected, especially after 2005, as improved technology, higher fuel prices, increased capacity needs, and externality costs combine to make wind energy more attractive.<p>
	Currently exploitable geothermal resources (hot water and steam) are limited to the western U.S., where capacity from geothermal plants is projected to grow by about 1.5 gigawatts by 2010.  Most of the expected growth occurs after 2005 as demand for new capacity begins to grow.<p>
	Municipal solid waste (MSW) generation capacity is projected to grow at a rate just over 4% a year.  MSW plants serve a dual purposethey are a source of baseload generation, and they provide a means for the disposal of MSW.  Legal issues could affect the use of MSW as an energy source, with plants seeking to obtain guaranteed fuel supplies through local ordinances that direct the flow of waste.  Environmental issues could also have adverse effects on MSW plants.<p>
	Generation from biomass (wood) is projected to grow only slightly before 2005, because new competitive biomass technologies are as yet unproven and conventional fuel prices remain relatively low.  After 2005, however, the market for biomass energy begins to grow, driven by expected technology enhancements, slightly higher prices for conventional fuels, and increased need for new capacity.
<p><p>
<b>Stable Prices</b><p>
	Between 1994 and 2010, average electricity prices are expected to remain nearly unchanged, rising by a scant 0.4 cents per kWh.  Although residential prices rise slightly more, the average household electric bill increases by only $3 to $4 (1993 dollars) per month by 2010.  Rising natural gas prices place upward pressure on electricity prices, but stable coal prices, slowing expenditures on new and existing plants, and steady operations and maintenance costs nearly offset their impact.<p>
	From 1993 to 2010, natural gas prices to electric generators rise by 45%, from $2.63 to $3.82 per thousand cubic feet.  Over the same period, utilities and nonutilities (including cogenerators) will increase their generation from natural gas by 49 and 78%, respectively.  By 2010, purchases of natural gas are expected to account for 35% of total utility fossil fuel expenditures, up from 23% in 1993 (excluding purchases by cogenerators).  Dependence on natural gas plants increases because of their relatively low construction costs, high efficiencies, and low sulfur and carbon emissions.  These factors partially offset their higher fuel costs relative to those of coal plants.<p>
	Coal prices to electric utilities are projected to increase very little, rising by only 8% between 1994 and 2010.  Large domestic coal reserves and improvements in mining productivity combine to keep coal prices stable.  Because coal plants provide over half the electricity generated, stable coal prices contribute to stable electricity prices.<p>
	Utility capital costsassociated with recovery of investments in power plants and transmission and distribution facilities (including annual depreciation expenses, return on investment, and taxes)are expected to grow more slowly than electricity sales, reducing their impact on electricity prices.  <p>
	In contrast, purchases of power from wholesale suppliers are expected to grow in importance.  Factors contributing to these trends include the abundant generating capacity that exists today, increasing reliance on economical wholesale suppliers for new resources as needed, and construction of relatively inexpensive natural gas combustion turbine and combined-cycle plants.<p>
	Most regions of the country have sufficient capacity in place to meet expected demand growth for many years.  As a result, growth in generating capacity will lag sales growth for the next decade or so, before picking up when existing capacity is fully utilized.  From 1993 through 2010, generating capacity is expected to grow at an annual rate of only 0.6%, while electricity sales are expected to grow by 1.1% a year.<p>
	The need for utilities to make capital investments should also be reduced in two other ways.  First, when new generating resources are needed, utilities are expected, in large part, to look to wholesale suppliers.  Thus, the suppliers will make the needed capital investments.  Second, building natural gas combustion turbine and combined-cycle plants, which are less expensive to build than other generating options, reduces capital requirements.
<p><p>
<b>Future Challenges</b><p>
	Among the issues facing the industrywhich could significantly affect the outlook for the futureare the continued development of integrated resource planning (IRP) and demand-side management (DSM) programs by utilities, recent legislation affecting nonutility generators, new environmental regulations, the emergence of new electrical generating technologies, changes in nuclear plant refurbishment and retirement options, as well as state policies that affect the overall electric power market.<p>
	Many utilities have developed IRP programs to evaluate the resource options available to meet the demand for electricity.  These programs attempt to make all options equally accessible and allow for the participation of all interested stakeholders in the evaluation of both the costs and the benefits.  <p>
	In some cases, utilities and their public utility commissions (PUCs) have attempted to adjust for factors not normally captured in traditional cost-benefit comparisons, such as including emission adders to account for environmental externalities associated with particular technologies or evaluating the impacts on the local economy of choosing one technology over another.<p>
	Utility investments in DSM programs have also increased dramatically during the 1990s.  Utilities report that DSM programs reduced their peak demand by 17.7 gigawatts in 1992, and they reported plans to continue investing heavily in DSM programs through 2000.  With the passage of EPACT, however, utility DSM programs may be co-opted by the Acts stringent appliance efficiency standards as consumers purchase new appliances.  <p>
	The future of utility programs targeted at the same appliances is therefore ambiguous.  The new standards may lead utilities to refocus their programs on other areas, and continued technological development may create new opportunities for DSM programs.<p>
	EPACT also contains provisions with potentially significant impacts on the development of nonutility generators and the flow of electricity trade.  EPACT creates a class of generators, referred to as exempt wholesale generators (EWGs), which can develop non-rate-based generating systems and market the power from them to utilities.  EPACT also guarantees EWGs greater access to utility transmission systems.  These provisions will lead to an increase in nonutility generation and, to some degree, a restructuring of the electricity industry.<p>
	The possibility of new environmental legislation and the continued development of advanced generating technologies also present challenges for the future.  While the CCAP primarily involves voluntary compliance, more stringent carbon reduction regulations are possible if the current approach does not achieve the desired reductions.  Efforts to develop generating technologies with reduced environmental impacts are under way.  New technologies, particularly for generation from renewable fuels, might plan an important role in reducing the emissions associated with electricity generation.<p>
	In the area of nuclear power, the Advanced Light-Water Reactor Programa joint initiative by DOE and the nuclear supply industryis a current priority.  The goal of the program is to develop a standardized nuclear plant design for commercial orders.  Four plant types are involved, two "evolutionary" and two "midsized."  The current schedule calls for design certification in 1996 and 1997, respectively.  <p>
	It is still unlikely, however, that any new orders for nuclear plants will be placed until a number of difficult issues are satisfactorily resolved: concerns about disposal of radioactive waste; public concerns with safety; concerns about economic and financial risks; uncertainty about future power plant performance; and uncertainty in the licensing and regulatory processes.<p>
	At the federal and state levels, initiatives that will change the way electric power is marketed are being proposed and implemented.  Their goal is to lower the cost of electricity to all classes of consumers through increased competition in the electric power industry.  The initiatives will grant utilities the flexibility to compete for market share, ensure nonutilities a fair opportunity to compete, and give consumers direct access to electricity markets.  There is still much uncertainty about how effective such measures will be in achieving lower costs for consumers.  In many cases, the initiatives introduce potential problems, such as increased risk, higher cost of capital, conflict between state and federal authority, multiple ownership of transmission systems, and cost allocation.<p><p>

<h2>Cogeneration Facilities
Will Burn Bagasse 
</h2><br>
<h3>Taken together, two plants will be the worlds largest.</h3>

</center>
<hr>
Bechtel is building two cogen-
		eration facilities as biomass 
		power plants for U.S. Generating and Flo-Sun, Inc.  One is called Okeelanta and the other Osceola.  For feedstock, they will rely in part on bagasse, a waste residue left after sugar cane is processed.  Taken together, the power stations rising near the shore of Lake Okeechobee will amount to the largest bagasse-burning cogeneration facilities in the world.<p>
	Even during construction, the facilities have begun to attract international attention.  "We have already received calls from officials in a number of other countries that are sugar producers and who are exploring the possibility of doing something similar," says Bob Casamento, business development manager for Bechtel Power Corp.
<p><p>
<b>Biomass Picture</b><p>
	The World Energy Council has projected a doubling of global electricity use to 23,000 terawatt-hours in 2020 from 11,600 terawatt-hours in 1990.  (One terawatt equals a million megawatts.)  The challenge will be to generate that power in the most environmentally benign manner possible.  And one of the best ways to accomplish that appears to be biomass.<p>
	By definition, biomass is any organic matter available on a renewable basis for conversion to energy.  Included are forest residues, agricultural crops and waste, wood scraps, animal wastes, aquatic plants, municipal solid waste, and tires.<p>
	"Biomass is clearly the leading renewable energy opportunity for the electric power sector for the next 5-10 years," says Ray Dracker, manager of renewable energy and energy storage for Bechtels R&D organization.<p>
	"It represents a significant opportunity for additional powerparticularly in Brazil, Mexico, Central America, Indonesia, Thailand, and India," adds Larry Papay, senior vice president and manager of R&D.  Papay recently accompanied U.S. Energy Secretary Hazel OLeary on a presidential mission, meeting with officials of Indias Ministry of Power to explore, among other energy options, the possibility of a bagasse plant in that country.<p>
	In all its formsfrom cattle dung to the burning of woodbiomass already provides a full third of the energy used by developing countries.  At the same time, it accounts for 6,000 megawatts of utility generation and 3,000 megawatts of private power generation in the U.S.  By comparison, coal-fired electric utility units account for 297,000 megawatts, roughly a quarter of total U.S. generating capacity.<p>
	Most industry observers agree that biomass power will have its greatest impact in tropical and subtropical countries where vegetation grows fastest and where electricity demand is increasing most rapidly.  In these areas, the technologys success has traditionally depended on subsidies.  Meanwhile, in such developed countries as Sweden and the U.S., biomass provides 10% and 4%, respectively, of their energy supplies.  A Department of Energy (DOE) forecast says the U.S. figure will likely increase to 8% by 2010.<p>
	Biomass electric power production has been limited to plants with access to a low-cost waste fuel stream derived from agricultural forest products and municipal waste industries.  Since the energy density of biomass fuel is relatively low, fuel can economically be transported only over a radius of some 50-100 miles (80-160 kilometers).<p>
	But the concept does make sense if used at the point of production.  And the numbers may be shifting in biomass favor.  A report by Shell recently indicated that efficient wood-pulp plants can power themselves by burning wood chips at a cost much the same as internationally traded coal.  And in a Brazilian study, scientists estimated that plant material could produce electricity at five or six cents per kilowatt hour (kWh), in line with coal-fired stations.<p>
	Partly because of such findings, a recent report by the U.K.s Royal Institute of International Affairs concludes that biomass "may be on the threshold of a new breakthrough as a fuel for advanced forms of electricity generation."<p>
	"There is a growing demand for this kind of technology, both within and outside the U.S., and we look upon it as a growth field," notes John Ferrell, acting director of the U.S. Department of Energys Biofield Systems Div.<p>
	Perhaps the most significant aspect of the biomass-to-energy equation is environmental.  Unlike coal, biomass provides energy with little or no net buildup of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.  (Although the burning of biomass does produce carbon dioxide, the amount is no more than that withdrawn from the atmosphere during the source materials growth cycle.)<p>
	In addition to its environmental advantages, biomass in the U.S. also has the potential to revitalize the rural sector of the economy.  "Principally, this is because it is a domestic natural resource that can be grown and harvested quite readily," explains Joanta Green, a biomass specialist in Bechtels R&D group.  "The biomass process creates new jobs in harvesting and transportation, as well as in the related industries of fertilizers, pesticides, and agricultural equipment."<p>
	Theres yet another plus in the biomass column.  In contrast to other renewables such as solar and wind, many forms of biomass energy come as an already-stored energy resource.  It can, therefore, be used as needed, rather than when available.  (Bagasse is an exception; it decomposes rapidly and loses its usefulness in a matter of months.)<p>
	Electrical energy is not the only product of biomass.  For example, ethanol derived from corn has long been added to gasoline.  Demand for such a product, while still fairly insignificant, is growing in the U.S., especially in cities with severe air pollution.  The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), in fact, recently ruled that as of Jan. 1, 1995, one third of all gasoline sold in the nations nine smoggiest cities must be made with corn-based ethanol additives.<p>
	So where are the best spots for producing biomass energy?  You need only look at a world map. Basically, such energy can be generated wherever plant material is harvested, processed, or used, and that means millions of locations around the world.  Fast-growing poplar, willow, and conifer trees, for example, are considered promising for biomass energy production in northern sections of the U.S. and Europe.  Robinia, cynara, and eucalyptus trees, as well as sweet sorghum, appear to have more potential in the warmer, southern regions of the U.S. and Europe.  At the same time, sugar cane, along with pine and eucalyptus, is suitable in the tropics and subtropics.<p>
	But far from only forested areas, biomass resources also exist in other forms, from logging slash and agricultural crop residues to stockyard manure and food processing wasteseven scraps from cabinet making.<p>
<p><p>
<b>Bechtels Involvement</b><p>
	Bechtel has been part of the biomass picture since 1975, when it provided consultation services to Pacific Gas and Electric Co. to plan and implement a project that would convert a combination of sewage sludge and solid waste to usable fuel gas.  Other studies followed, including one to develop a solid waste ammonia plant for Seattle, another to test an experimental DOE facility that converted wood chips to fuel oil near Albany.  Oregon, a third to explore the possibility of producing ethanol from almond hulls at a facility in Californias Central Valley, and a study of a proposal by Foster Farms to power a cogeneration plant by burning chicken litter.<p>
	By the 1980s, Bechtel biomass projects began to move past the study stage.  In 1985, the company helped rehabilitate and retrofit the McKay Bay waste-to-energy plant for Tampa.  As a result, what had been a decommissioned facility is now a fully operational, thousand-ton-per-day plant turning out 23 megawatts of power.  Four years later and across the Florida peninsula, Bechtel acted as full-service contractor for the construction of the 60-megawatt North County waste-to-energy plant near West Palm Beach.<p>
	As part of Bechtels current involvement with the two Florida cogeneration plants, the company is providing engineering, procurement, construction, and start-up testing services for the development of a solid waste disposal, as well as an electric and steam generating facility, that will burn bagasse and wood waste.  Steam produced by each facility will be used to operate sugar mills adjacent to both sites, and electrical energy produced will be sold to Florida Power & Light Co. under a purchase agreement.<p>
	The Okeelanta facility will be able to export 720,000 lbs./hr. of steam for use at a sugar mill, while generating 74.9 gross megawatts of power.  At Osceola, the comparable figures will be 500,000 lbs./hr. of steam for a sugar mill and 52 megawatts.<p>
	Both plants will be fueled by bagasse during a five-month grinding season that extends from October 15 to March 15, and both will use waste wood during the remaining months.  Construction at Okeelanta has been under way since January, with a completion date set for February 1996.  Work began at the Osceola facility in July, with operation set to begin in May 1996.<p>
	Looking to the future, Bechtel recently completed a study for the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) of what has become known as Whole Tree Energy technology.  The effort focuses on growing, harvesting, transporting, drying, and burning whole hardwood trees to fuel a 100-megawatt wood-burning energy plant that would produce low-cost electricity.  <p>
	Bechtel also just finished a study of a sustainable biomass-to-energy project for Pacific International Center for High Technology Research.  Contemplated is the construction of a 28.5-megawatt biomass gasification power plant on the northeast coast of the Big Island of Hawaii.<p>
	Whether a biomass power plant runs on the remnants of Hawaiian sugar cane or on pungent eucalyptus, it can impart a sweet flavor economically and environmentally to any number of kilowatts.<p><p>

<h3>Louis, Va Gager le Back Tank</h3>

</center>
<hr>
Thats Franglais for Louis go gage the back tank.
<p>
You know when you talk about energy youre playing with the big boys.  Who are they? The multinationals, the seven sisters, (or is that the description for ivyish coed colleges) the nuclear establishment, the huge utilities.  National boundaries, environmental issues, and even public responsibility often get placed on the back burner, as it were.  Nothing stops and should stop the even flow of energy (or how important a factor is energy in foreign or domestic policy making for that matter-another topic for another day).
<p>
Anyhow, I remember my first encounter with this attitude in a small way when I was working at a summer job while in college.  Actually, I was considered lucky to get a job at a major oil producers refinery tank farm measuring oil levels in huge high storage tanks. Once you learned how to scale the slippery, thin, exposed ladders to the top in the pouring rain and lower a plumb line till you heard the plop (or thought you heard the plop) it was easy.  But thats not the point.  One day I saw at least two other major oil company trucks pulling up to the filling station.  How could this be?  I asked my foreman, Camile "Dont we (not the royal we rather the submissive) only stock our specially formulated fuel which we advertise, or is it all the same no matter which truck carries it"?  His retort.  "Louis Va gager le back tank."  In other words do your little job; dont worry about the details. Besides, how do you know the fuel isnt different?  This is what happens in the real world, apparently.
<p>
And thats sort of what happens with big energy much of the time.  Dont worry about the details.  Let it flow.
<p>
Embargoes?  Well, we know that oil from Iran and even Iraq finds its way anywhere on the high seas.  Whats the word?  Fungibility?  Besides, the U.S. really needs a secure and continuing oil supply.  Blockade to Yugoslavia, Haiti?  All you need is a few vessels and trucks transferring oil in the dark (or in the day time for that matter).  Besides we have important national interests and allies.  Anyhow, how do we police all this, and is policing worth the price?  Nuclear contamination and waste disposal?  Just apply the old risk analysis calculations.  Same for EMI hazards and coal mining.  Gas or oil pipelines improperly built?  We all know that costs have to be contained.  Ethanol as a gasoline substitute or component?  We have to do something with our corn. Besides we have to deal with some important agricultural friends.
<p>
So look at the big picture.  Keep your eye on the prize or va gager le back tank.  Dont worry about the details.  Come to think of it, I wonder if Mr. Bronfman is now gaging the big back tanks in Hollywood.
<p>
<hr>
<b>And Its Time for a Change</b>
<p>
As you can see, Energy Magazine looks a little different.  Weve had the old look for - can you believe it - nineteen, almost twenty years.  We thought that wed improve on the graphics and make it more readable and more compelling.
<p>
Were also trying to add and/or improve its editorial content.  Although some of our faithful readers tell us its fine.  If you have any suggestions please send them to us.  Better still, were now establishing an editorial advisory board.  If youre interested in participating, please let us know.  And/or if you want to submit an article for consideration, let us know too.  Any interest, contact our managing editor, Eve Greenberg.
<p>
Hope to hear from you.

<h2>Still More Questions than 
Answers in Energy Policy
</h2><br>
<h3>Coordinate and integrate is the consensus at one meeting.</h3>

</center>
<hr>
Currently, there is no single 
		subject more evocative than 
		energy policy. The idea of mounting an international conference with such a theme was almost guaranteed to draw diverse opinion. And that is exactly what happened in London, England during November 1994 at a meeting convened by Chatham HouseThe Royal Institute of International Affairs (RIIA), an independent study group strongly supported by successive U.K. Governments.<p>
	On this occasion, RIIA was joined by the British Institute of Energy Economics and the International Assn. for Energy Economics. Some 250 delegates attended from 22 countries. The official subject was Emerging Policies for European Energy.<p>
	Perhaps strangely, agreement was not slow in arriving. Those who had tried and believed they had some success were soon repeating a theme: "Coordinate and integrate," they said. Two words echoed throughout the proceedings.<p>
	But is that enough for either a flexible or rigid policy, a formula for supply, use and price? For fuels: discovery, recovery, transport, marketing and sharing among those with diverse needs. To say nothing of the end resultprotection or pollution of the environment; disposal of the unwanted arisings, solid or gaseous.<p>
	Every attempt having been made to attract official government support from virtually every European country, the list of speakers was as impressive as that of those attending, equally representative of governments, industry, power production and distribution; fuels and nuclear interest; the European Commission and European Parliament. Japan showed interest by no equivalent from the U.S. The burden of addressing the conference was shared by 31 speakers, of whom 19 were invited from more distant interestsincluding Saudi Arabia, Russia and the Baltic States.<p>
	Energy policy, in the context of this discussion, split roughly into two: attempts to be all-embracing, and contributions from those who had more closely defined roles to exploit. The most definitive of the former came from Dr. Michael Grubb, head of the energy and environmental program of RIIA. <p>
	Even here, Dr. Grubb pinpointed climatic strategy. He explained that this, a serious problem, has characteristics and pressures addressing four main themes: development of the scientific debate since 1990when the Intergovernmental Panel (IPCC) produced its first assessment report; processes influencing events and discussion preceding the first meeting of the Berlin 95 Conference of Parties, in March 1995; national plans and the role of the European Union and its likely policies.<p>
	After discussing variations on the theme of simple policy guidance, he suggested, "...analyzing tends to show that we should neither panic nor do nothing, but rather chart a course of sustained effort while uncertainties are being resolved."<p>
	Quoting Domingo Jiminez-Beltran (Spain) the new Secretary-General of the European Environment Agency, he thought this was the first time a senior political figure in policy had called for such an approach: "The EU should...set concrete emission levels (requirements) for each member state...in principle, the country that pollutes the most, should reduce the most..."<p>
	As part of his conclusion, Dr. Grubb said, "...what European industry needs is a stable, market-oriented system that can both define the size of the carbon market and reveal the real value of CO2 constraint."<p>
	Dr. Kevin Leydon, Head of Division, Analysis and Forecasts (Dept. XVII, European Commission) spoke on "The Current European Energy Policy Agenda." His view spread consideration wider: 18 general considerations governing long-term energy perspectives. These he grouped into systems, interchanges, contradictions and strategic decisions; there were four facets to energy demand, several to supply trends, one each to imports, technology and market structure.<p>
	The body of Dr. Leydons paper was, perhaps unavoidably, devoted to questions, but on the subject of energy and the individual he was more positive: "In expressing his wishes... the energy user will demand a high quality, environmentally benign, energy product...an expectation of choice...diversity of energy types and services...an assumption that energy as a factor of production will be competitively priced so as to support economic growth and employment in Europe."<p>
	Dealing with the role of the Union, he said, "The more national energy policies are compatible with each other and consistent with common objectives, the less there is a need for harmonization initiativespolicy intervention can be minimized." He also spoke of establishing the necessary means of ensuring convergenceavoidance of contradiction between national and community policies.<p>
	Of those with specific sectarian interests, Angelo Camplani of Italys ENEL Spa spoke of his countrys changes under way, taking as his theme the impact on industry of change from state agency to private competitionand profit. Neatly summarized, he said "...government choices have had the better of competition, gains were mainly achieved by shareholders, the coal industry demise is being both impressive and disquieting, choice is being widened for some customers but advantages are deferred and uncertain, deregulation has become a non-transitional, complex regulation."<p>
	Possibly the broadest view was that by J.V. Mitchell of Chatham House with his paper asking, "What is the Energy Security Problem?" He said, "There is no possible scenario which excludes massive energy imports, to Europe, the U.S. and N.E. Africa; exports from the Middle East to the world oil market and inputs of gas from Russia to Europe." <p>
	Mitchell could scarcely have gone further from the theme of his colleague Dr. Grubb. But in doing so he introduced a vital consideration: policy implication of risky interdependence. He suggested, "A common approach to dealing with disruptions whether of oil or gas; avoiding pre-cyclical policies which tend to reduce oil consumption even when oil is available at low prices, and avoiding policies which prevent a commercial approach to investment in low cost oil producing areas."<p>
	On dealing with risk, Mr. Mitchell was able to cover oil, gas and nuclear comprehensively, global influence and European dependency. Of Russian nuclear, he said that fuel to replace it on shutdown would equal 24% of that countrys gas and oil exports and added, "The energy dimension of the risk of disruption of nuclear supply is large but not overwhelming."<p>
	The emphasis in this energy policy conference on environmental issues became a specialists viewpoint when Wolfgang Eisner of the European Commissions D.G. for Transport spoke. He related growth to an average annual increase over the last 20 years of 2.3% for goods, and 3.1% for passengersand all predictions pointing to a continuation of the trend, in general unaffected by the low or negative growth in some areas of recent years.<p>
	Conflict between transport and the environment he acknowledged and detailed, asking how mobility and health of the environment can be reconciled. Many similar questions were asked, with very few helpful answers.<p>
	Former U.K. Energy Minister and currently chairman of the House of Commons Foreign Affairs Select Committee, David Howell MP spoke at length on energy and enlargement in the European Union. He expressed concern over those countries free to make their own decisions, following "evaporation" of the Soviet Union.<p>
	This very wide-ranging paper dealt with third-party access to national electricity grids, which he said was a magnificent ambition but unobtainable. Less of a hopeless case, he wondered when, if ever, French electricity prices would be transparent, including electricity in Spain. He advocated proceeding very gradually, tempering ambitions with political wisdom. He confessed to being a gradualist.<p>
	On security, a subject of deep concern to a number of speakers, David Howell gave his definition: not ownership but diversity and lots of sources with flexible opportunity to switch between them. Finally, he pleaded for sensible economic running of energy policies, no subsidies and capital paid for at proper rates.<p>
	Tim Eggar, U.K. Minister for Energy and Industry, predictably stressed the success of Britains exposure of utilities to competition, improving their financial performance, lowering prices to consumers and increasing investment in generation by some three times since 1989. He quoted lower electricity prices as 20% cheaper than France, 30% cheaper than Germany.<p>
	The Minister appeared somewhat apprehensive of the E.U. school of thought, arguing that a shared perfect energy policy could be created from convergence of member states policies. He claimed that "...such a perfect policy cannot exist in practice."<p>
	An overview of the conference was produced by David Jones of the British Institute of Energy Economics, one of the three organizations responsible for this significant gathering. The others were the RIIA and the International Assn. for Energy Economics. Jones found himself largely reiterating the key questions being askedand for which there are as yet no answers. He said, "...unsurprisingly there was no consensus..." on what the answers should be. He said the next step is the debate which would center on the Commissions forthcoming Green Paper on energy policy and wide public discussion to which, he suggested, the three Institutes could contribute importantly.<p>

The conference proceedings are now complete with full versions of the papers as presented. Copies can be obtained from the Organizer, Julia Thomas, at the RIIA, 10 St. James Square, London, England SW1Y 4LE.

<h2>Theres No Payoff
in Fuel Cells
</h2><br>
<h3>The myth of economical systems has come and gone.</h3>

</center>
<hr>
Successful management of tech-
		nological programs is not 
		spending all the money allotted to a task but spending money only on meaningful work.  That is possible when one knows what has been done and found before.  Sometimes, a list of key problems is handed to management on a silver platter.  <p>
	Such is the case with Fuel CellsPower for the Future, by David R. Adams and eight other authors at the Graduate School of Business Administration of Harvard University.  The fact that this book was published in 1960 in no way diminishes its value today.  That is because not one of the key problems, identified there, has yet been solved.  That is also why the several expensive demonstration projects of fuel-cell systems here and abroad ended in predictable failures. The situation is much worse today, however. Even if the several key problems were completely solved, fuel cells could not possibly pay off.
<p><b>
Vehicle Propulsion Systems</b><p>
	A working fuel-cell system was first demonstrated in the 1950s, when an agricultural vehicle was propelled by one ostensibly run on a mixture of natural gas and hydrogen.  That was the original story, but it soon became evident that the natural gas simply went along for the ride, and that the only active fuel was hydrogen.  Ever since then, fuel-cell systems have been touted as "Modern, Advanced, Direct" (MAD) converters for delivering power.<p>
	Despite over 40 years of intense R&D activities all over the globe, the situation has not improved, and the only highly active fuel for fuel cells is hydrogen.  Whereas some activity has been noted for the lower-molecular-weight alcohols and some exotic fuels, their rates of reaction are so slow or their costs so high as to be of no practical consequence, except perhaps for specialty applications.  They are certainly not suitable for terrestrial propulsion.<p>
	Equally unchanged is the situation with respect to the oxidant.  Whereas it has been hoped that air would eventually be practical, its rate of reaction is far too slow and dilution due to nitrogen causes large losses of cell voltage.  Even the rate of reaction of pure oxygen is slow and loss of voltage, due to internal resistance, means high losses of efficiency.<p>
	No effective oxygen catalyst has been found in a century of effort.  That does not mean that it needs to remain that way, since there is no known theoretical reason for this situation.  Despite all fuel-cell propaganda, however, no one, nowhere has yet had the slightest idea of how to solve the basic problems of the cell itself, leaving ideas for systems totally hopeless except for special uses.<p>
	The only thing that is obvious is that new ideas are needed and basic research must be successful before any technical development might have a chance of success if fuel cells were commercially competitive, which they are not.  No wonder that administrators, who have more money to spend than useful ideas to spend it on, dont wish to know or understand that.<p>
<p><b>
Electrical Substations</b><p>
	Three reasons have been given for using fuel cells as generators of electricity in substations.<p>
	Efficiency is one.  Nowadays, however, high-temperature turbines can beat fuel cells easily, operating at well over 55% instead of the widely proposed 50% for fuel cells.  The latter must be run that way for economic reasons, the hardware being quite expensive.  Efficiency is defined here as electricity out divided by total energy into the generator and does not even consider the tremendous losses due to making (and perhaps storing) H2 and O2.  Now, if one would choose total energy systems (also known as cogeneration), one could utilize around 90% of the input energy (from natural gas and air), from turbines, thus making them unbeatable for efficiency.<p>
	The argument that fuel cells are noiseless is true but does not hold for substations that must contain pumps and blowers in addition to mere fuel-cell units.  That this is so, and that these auxiliaries are quite noisy in substations, was proven in New York City, where a fuel-cell substation had been installed.  The fuel-cell units never did work, but the auxiliaries were judged to be unacceptable for the neighborhood because of excessive noise.  One may find that such noises can be largely suppressed and kept within acceptable limits.  But that is equally true for turbines.<p>
	Another argument was that the fuel would be easier to transport and store for fuel-cell substations than for, e.g., coal-burning generators.  But why coal?  In any case, neither H2 nor O2 is easily supplied to or generated at substations.  On the other hand, turbines can be operated on pipeline gas and air, the first of which is already being supplied to many neighborhoods, while the second is obviously there.<p>
	Nor need fuels and air be purified in any way for use in turbines.  Even the odorizer of natural gas, which contains sulfur that is a poison for any known fuel catalyst in fuel cells, need not be removed before it enters a turbine.  Off-gases are removed in conventional ways.  Chances are that, except for the CO2 which we have to live with anyway, NOx and whatever other compounds one may object to can not only be removed in situ, but the absorbent, catalyst, or whatever can be regenerated on the spot, so that minimal costs would be incurred by transporting and using additional materials.
<p><p><b>
Will the Myth Die?</b><p>
	In brief, all fuel-cell systems built thus far must operate on hydrogen and oxygen, expensive reactants, inefficient to produce and hard to store in bulk.  Furthermore, the expensive systems, including auxiliaries, must be operated near the maximum power point, that is, at half the open-circuit voltage, i.e., at 50% electrical efficiency (which does not take into consideration major losses due to generation and special storage conditions of reactants).  That might have been tolerable a generation ago, when electric generating stations were working at about 35% electrical efficiency.<p>
	As optimistic as the authors of the 1960 book were about fuel cells, they realized that most commercial applications will be out of the question until air and not oxygen can be used and until effective hydrocarbon catalysts are found to obviate the need for hydrogen, an uneconomical fuel.  (There is no "Hydrogen Economy.")  At that time they had a right to hope that the several key problems might be solved.  Today, even their solutions would not justify any but the most specialized applications.<p>
	Fuel-cell systems, like Zeppelins and other dirigible balloons, are a great idea whose time has come and gone.  But as long as we have technologists with tunnel vision and technical writers who will translate their near-sighted ideas into beguiling prose, we shall continue to hear the fuel-cell myth and pay for it as well.

"There is laid up for me a crown of righteousness." 
<BR>
- 2 Timothy 4:8
</I></CENTER>
<BR>
Doubting one! thou hast often said, "I fear I shall never enter heaven." Fear not! all the people of God shall enter there. I love the quaint saying of a dying man, who exclaimed, "I have no fear of going home; I have sent all before me; God's finger is on the latch of my door, and I am ready for him to enter." "But," said one, "are you not afraid lest you should miss your inheritance?" "Nay," said he, "nay; there is one crown in heaven which the angel Gabriel could not wear, it will fit no head but mine. There is one throne in heaven which Paul the apostle could not fill; it was made for me, and I shall have it." O Christian, what a joyous thought! thy portion is secure; "there remaineth a rest." "But cannot I forfeit it?" No, it is entailed. If I be a child of God I shall not lose it. It is mine as securely as if I were there. Come with me, believer, and let us sit upon the top of Nebo, and view the goodly land, even Canaan. Seest thou that little river of death glistening in the sunlight, and across it dost thou see the pinnacles of the eternal city? Dost thou mark the pleasant country, and all its joyous inhabitants? Know, then, that if thou couldst fly across thou wouldst see written upon one of its many mansions, "This remaineth for such a one; preserved for him only. He shall be caught up to dwell for ever with God." Poor doubting one, see the fair inheritance; it is thine. If thou believest in the Lord Jesus, if thou hast repented of sin, if thou hast been renewed in heart, thou art one of the Lord's people, and there is a place reserved for thee, a crown laid up for thee, a harp specially provided for thee. No one else shall have thy portion, it is reserved in heaven for thee, and thou shalt have it ere long, for there shall be no vacant thrones in glory when all the chosen are gathered in.

"In my flesh shall I see God." 
<BR>
- Job 19:26
</I></CENTER>
<BR>
Mark the subject of Job's devout anticipation "I shall see God." He does not say, "I shall see the saints"-though doubtless that will be untold felicity-but, "I shall see God." It is not-"I shall see the pearly gates, I shall behold the walls of jasper, I shall gaze upon the crowns of gold," but "I shall see God." This is the sum and substance of heaven, this is the joyful hope of all believers. It is their delight to see him now in the ordinances by faith. They love to behold him in communion and in prayer; but there in heaven they shall have an open and unclouded vision, and thus seeing "him as he is," shall be made completely like him. Likeness to God-what can we wish for more? And a sight of God-what can we desire better? Some read the passage, "Yet, I shall see God in my flesh," and find here an allusion to Christ, as the "Word made flesh," and that glorious beholding of him which shall be the splendour of the latter days. Whether so or not it is certain that Christ shall be the object of our eternal vision; nor shall we ever want any joy beyond that of seeing him. Think not that this will be a narrow sphere for the mind to dwell in. It is but one source of delight, but that source is infinite. All his attributes shall be subjects for contemplation, and as he is infinite under each aspect, there is no fear of exhaustion. His works, his gifts, his love to us, and his glory in all his purposes, and in all his actions, these shall make a theme which will be ever new. The patriarch looked forward to this sight of God as a personal enjoyment. "Whom mine eye shall behold, and not another." Take realizing views of heaven's bliss; think what it will be to you. "Thine eyes shall see the King in his beauty." All earthly brightness fades and darkens as we gaze upon it, but here is a brightness which can never dim, a glory which can never fade-"I shall see God."

 <P> January 10, 1997 <CENTER><H3>Christians are praying for Muslims during Ramadan</H3></CENTER>  <P> <B>An estimated 10 million Christians around the world will pray for Muslims </B>during the Islamic holy month of Ramadan, which starts today.  Christians are asking God to reveal Himself more fully to the world's one billion Islamic believers, who will spend the month in a dawn-to-dusk fast and spiritual inventory.  During Ramadan, Muslims are forbidden to indulge in all sensual pleasures, including sex and listening to music.  Government offices and some private companies observe shorter working hours.  <BR><B>...&quot;We're not praying to Allah,&quot; </B>said Randy Sprinkle, a Southern Baptist prayer coordinator.  &quot;We're joining Muslims during that period as they seek God.&quot;  <BR><B>...This is a strategic time to pray for Muslims, Christian leaders say.  </B>Muslims have reportedly been experiencing dreams, visions, and angelic visitations; missionaries are increasingly being asked to interpret these signs.  Last year, thousands of North African Muslims wrote to a Christian radio service asking for information; many reported a similar dream in which Jesus appeared and told them, &quot;I am the way.&quot; <BR><B>...People praying for Muslims must put aside stereotypes of terrorists or extremists, </B>said Erich Bridges of the Southern Baptist Foreign Mission Board.  Muslims are &quot;overwhelmingly non-extremists, normal, family people who are trying to live their lives like we are,&quot; he told Mission News Network.  The majority Sunni sect of Islam dominates most Muslim countries.  The largest Shi'ite Muslim country is Iran. <BR><B>...Many of those praying during Ramadan will follow a printed daily guide</B> that focuses on a different  people group each day.  Half a million copies of the guide have been published in 30 languages, including Swahili and Chinese, according to organizers of  the 30 Days Muslim Prayer Focus, an interdenominational ministry begun in 1993 by Youth With A Mission.  The 30 Days effort has been endorsed by many Christian groups, such as Campus Crusade for Christ, Operation Mobilization, and the AD 2000 and Beyond Movement.  Prayer guides also are available for children. <BR><B>...Factors tending to increase Muslim openness to Christianity</B> include secularization of the Middle East, negative reaction among Muslims to Islamic radicals, work by Christian relief ministries to Muslims, and Muslim migration to more open areas, evangelical scholar Dudley Woodberry told Baptist Press.<B>  </B> <BR><B>...Ramadan celebrates God's delivery of the Koran, Islam's holy book</B>, to the prophet Mohammed nearly 1,400 years ago.  The Muslim world covers a broad arc that begins in northwest Africa, continues through Turkey, Iran, and the Indian subcontinent, and reaches as far as Indonesia, the most populous Islamic country.  Many Muslims also live elsewhere in the world, including Europe, North America, and Australia.  Muslims formally break the fast with Eid al-Fitr, which involves a religious feast and an exchange of gifts.     </TD>

<FONT SIZE=-1><I>[10-Jan-97 3:17 PM EST (2017 UTC)]</I> Hollywood Has Been Bringing Several Classic Novels And 
         Plays To The Silver Screen In The Past Couple Years: 
         Most Notably, The Works Of Jane Austen, William 
         Shakespeare And Henry James.  Recently, Yet Another 
         Classic Work Has Been Made Into A Film: Arthur Miller's 
         Play "The Crucible," Which Premiered 44 Years Ago 
         [Today/ This Week/ This Month] [1/22/53] In New York 
         City.  "The Crucible" Is Studied And Performed In 
         Thousands Of Classrooms And Theaters Around The World, 
         And The New Film May Bring An Even Greater Appreciation 
         Of Mr. Miller, Who Is Often Considered America's 
         Greatest Living Playwright.  The Movie Version Of  "The 
         Crucible," Directed By Nicholas Hytner, Opened In Most 
         Of The United States Late Last Month [12/96] And Stars 
         Daniel Day-Lewis, Winona Ryder, Paul Scofield, And Joan 
         Allen.  Several Critics Have Named "The Crucible" One Of
         The Best Films Of 1996 And Its Actors Have Been 
         Mentioned For Possible Academy Award Nominations And 
         Other Honors.  In This Report Written By Keming Kuo, We 
         Learn How Arthur Miller's Story Of Witchcraft And 
         Hysteria In Salem, Massachusetts Some 300 Years Ago Also
         Has An Underlying Message About A More Recent Historical

<B>One of the primary goals of GOSHEN is to be the most comprehensive index for Christian resources on the Internet. To facilitate this, we want to know where YOU are! If you are a church, Christian organization, or church-related business, you are online, and you are not linked already on GOSHEN, please fill out the form below. We'll be glad to enter you in our Internet directory and search engine.</B>
<P>
We <B>encourage</B> you to submit <B>all</B> the resources at your site that belong in categories on GOSHEN. You <B>do not</B> have to re-enter contact information if you are submitting multiple URLs. You <B>do</B> need to come back to this form each time, however and enter your other URLs. It is not necessary, though, to re-enter Org. Name or any other site info. If there is an e-mail associated with a resource, you are encouraged to submit it.
<P>
<B>If you are submitting an entry for a Church or Denomination</B>, please include location information (e.g. city, state, country, phone w/area code) in the description part of the submission.
<P>
<H2>Please Note!</H2>
Those organizations/individuals wishing to broaden their exposure should contact <A HREF="mailto:swike@goshen.net">Steve Wike</A> <B>INSTEAD</B> of submitting URLs to non-salient categories. Those doing "global" submissions, submissions to non-salient categories or appear to be making the directory function of GOSHEN useless, may not be entered into GOSHEN's database.

<BR>
 <P> January 10, 1997 <P> <B>Two hundred fifty cities have joined an anti-drug crusade</B> <B>called Turn Around America</B>.  Participants, many of whom are clergy or members of Christian churches, confront drug dealers by staging marches and vigils at crack houses and places in neighborhoods where dealers do business.   <BR><B>...The largest such group is in Cincinnati, </B>where Charlie Winburn, pastor of the nondenominational Ridge Acres Christian Center, leads residents into drug markets in their neighborhoods.  <BR><B>...Every week, 50-300 members wearing yellow shirts and white hard hats</B> march into three of the city's most notorious drug corners or crack houses chanting &quot;Up with hope, down with dope!&quot; Most marchers are members of churches or students from God's Bible School in nearby Mount Auburn, Ohio.  About 60% of the marchers are black, and the rest are white or members of ethnic minorities.  <BR><B>...&quot;We get in the drug dealers' faces and chant until they leave,&quot;</B> marcher David Collier told <I>Religion News Today</I>.   He is the legislative assistant for Winburn, who also is a city councilman.   When confronted, drug dealers either leave or &quot;do something stupid&quot; such as throw eggs, and are then arrested, Collier said.  <BR><B>...Cincinnati marchers have endured bad weather, being pelted with eggs</B> and bottles, slashed tires, death threats, and a lawsuit by the owner of a business targeted as the hub of drug activity.  But no marcher has been injured, said Collier, who has been on 44 such marches.  The result has been 47 arrests, which have put Cincinnati's formerly entrenched drug markets into disarray. <P> <B>Average tuition at schools </B>that belong to the <A HREF=http://www.cccu.org>Coalition for Christian Colleges and Universities </A> rose 7.1% to $10,293 this year.  According to a study, average tuition at the 90 CCCU schools is $2,530 below the average of  four-year private schools.  <P> <B>Five thousand Christians in Katmandu, Nepal, participated in a March for Jesus</B> recently.  They walked along main roads singing choruses and hymns, clapping, and dancing, according to Graham Kendrick, founder of the global March for Jesus.  They preached the gospel and distributed tracts and small booklets to people.  After the march, participants went to a stadium and worshipped. <P> <B>Asking teen-agers to help less fortunate people is the key to attracting them to church,</B> a survey shows.  Serving others appeals to 80% of teenagers polled by the Gallup organization's Princeton Religion Research Center.  In the survey, 20% of teenagers said they were already involved in church-sponsored activities to help less fortunate people; 60% said they would like to be involved. <P> <B>A three-time murderer who sought clemency after becoming a Christian was executed</B> in Alabama Jan. 10.  Billy Wayne Waldrop, 44, was pronounced dead at Holman Prison near Mobile.  &quot;He said he had God in his life, that he was ready to go,&quot; a prison officer told Reuter news service.  Members of an evangelical prison group had asked Gov. Fob James to grant a reprieve. <P> <B>Two of the three youths charged with painting racist messages on a black church</B> have asked for and received the congregation's forgiveness.  The teen-agers attended a service at Piney Grove AME Zion Church in Concord, N.C., to apologize. <BR><B>...&quot;It was stupidity,&quot;</B> said Michael McHone, 18, according to the Associated Press.  &quot;I feel so bad for what I've done to all of you nice people.&quot; The youths received embraces and greetings from the members and their pastor. <P> <B>Mormon leaders agreed to scale back their design for a temple</B> after residents of Belmont, Mass., complained about its impact on the neighborhood.  The decision came less than a month after the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints won approval from the town to build the $30-million temple with spires 76 to 139 feet high.  The decision to reduce the size of the building was made to create goodwill in the community, a church official said. <P> <B>Gaylord Entertainment Company completed its purchase of Word records and music</B> from Thomas Nelson.  Word is a contemporary Christian music company that has nine record labels, with performers such as Sandi Patty and Amy Grant.  Gaylord owns cable TV networks, the Grand Old Opry, radio stations, and television stations.  The purchase price was $100 million. <P>   <P> <B>The Catholic Church in England and Wales</B> is considering providing money  to women who have had affairs with priests, Reuter news service said.  The Catholic Bishops Conference set up a team of bishops and lay members to meet some of the women and consider ways to help them and their children.  The action follows a scandal over a bishop who ran off with a mother of three. <P> <B>Some 55% of female clergy</B> <B>say other clergywomen compete as well as cooperate</B> with one another, Hartford Seminary researchers found.  A reported 31% of the clergywomen said female clergy were cooperative but not competitive with one another, and 10% said the clergy were more competitive with one another than mutually supportive.  The survey did not examine competition among male clergy. <P> <B>A man tried to attack the patriarch of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church</B> with a sword Thursday but was shot dead, news reports said.   Police arrested the man who killed the would-be assassin of Patriarch Abune Paulso.  The attempted attack was carried out during prayers in St. Stephan's Church Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.    </TD>

<FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica" SIZE=-1>CHRISTIANS FOR ISRAEL is an international and non-political movement of Christians from all churches and denominations who see in the return of the Jewish people to Israel the fulfillment of biblical prophecy and who consider this return as one of the major signs of the times, pointing towards the imminent return of the Lord Jesus Christ, the Messiah of Israel, for the Church, for Israel and for the nations. Our message for the Church is to prepare for the coming of the Lord and to love their Jewish older brother in His Name, to stand in solidarity with the Jewish people and the State of Israel and to oppose anti-Semitism wherever it manifests itself, inside or outside the Christian churches, Islam, or in other religious and non-religious thinking. We pray for the peace of Jerusalem and try to help the Jewish people in a practical way, financially, morally and spiritually. The love for Israel and the Jewish people should visibly unite all Christians, who firmly believe in the Word of God, love the Church, are one in the Holy Spirit and prepare for the coming of the Lord.</FONT>

<FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica" SIZE=-1>A Basic View seeks to compare the thinking that America's founding fathers had and portrayed in the life they lived as compared to where America is today. History clearly demonstrates that the signers of the Declaration of Independence and the framers of our Constitution had a profound belief in an Almighty God and so wrote our laws and lived their lives under this reverence. Thus the name "Basic View," which indicates the foundation of our beginning.</FONT>

<FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica" SIZE=-1>Monthly newsletter and on-line resources which help to expose deception in Christian denominations. As we "contend for the faith," we should ever strive to do so without being meanspirited or unkind. We must "speak the truth in love." However, if we are "earnestly contending" it would be unrealistic not to expect at times to be misunderstood or even ridiculed. Love, indeed, means loving people enough to tell them the truth and to warn them of those who in the name of love pervert the truth. Accordingly, our compassion is mainly directed to the uninformed multitudes and young Christians who need to be protected from deceivers and dangerous leaders. Jesus had compassion on the multitudes, but publicly rebuked erroneous leaders.</FONT>

It is a lot of work -- as you know -- so I am seeking the Lord for His will in how to do it as well as what fruit comes from it. In the BELIEVER, I speak to Christians through the articles and also hope to interest others who might "surf" by. For that reason, I have also put a clear salvation "special message" as one of the sections. (For your information, I am also an ordained minister and have been involved in pastoring.

These are the themes that speak to our human and spiritual natures, such as Hope, Faith, Love, Evil, Justice, Prayer, Jesus, Forgiveness, and Grace. In the exploration of each theme, short, crisp features present a wide variety of engrossing material, illuminating the theme from different perspectives. There are apt quotations from the Hebrew scriptures and the New Testament, theologians, biblical scholars, saints and mystics, politicians, poets, writers, artists, scientists, doctors, psychologists, and historians. For background references, books, old and new, are summarized. Relevant passages are excerpted for your use. Everything in The Living Pulpit is written in clear, accessible language. We know how valuable your time is, so all our articles are short and to the point. Yet each issue is full of useful, interesting, stimulating material. You would have to read numerous separate journals, magazines, books, and sermons to get what you will find in just one issue of The Living Pulpit.</FONT>

         Place In Rio De Janeiro, Brazil.  But While The 
         Population Is Growing, Natural Resources Such As Marine 
         Fisheries And Forests Are Being Depleted.  Carbon 
         Dioxide In The Atmosphere Has Reached An All-Time High, 
         Which Some Say May Lead To Global Climate Change.  Voa's
         Zlatica Hoke Explains That There Are Plans For A March 
         Meeting In Rio To Look At Environment Progress Since The
         1992 Summit, Even As Two New Reports Offer An Assessment

<FONT SIZE=-1><I>[10-Jan-97 3:17 PM EST (2017 UTC)]</I> Hollywood Has Been Bringing Several Classic Novels And 
         Plays To The Silver Screen In The Past Couple Years: 
         Most Notably, The Works Of Jane Austen, William 
         Shakespeare And Henry James.  Recently, Yet Another 
         Classic Work Has Been Made Into A Film: Arthur Miller's 
         Play "The Crucible," Which Premiered 44 Years Ago 
         [Today/ This Week/ This Month] [1/22/53] In New York 
         City.  "The Crucible" Is Studied And Performed In 
         Thousands Of Classrooms And Theaters Around The World, 
         And The New Film May Bring An Even Greater Appreciation 
         Of Mr. Miller, Who Is Often Considered America's 
         Greatest Living Playwright.  The Movie Version Of  "The 
         Crucible," Directed By Nicholas Hytner, Opened In Most 
         Of The United States Late Last Month [12/96] And Stars 
         Daniel Day-Lewis, Winona Ryder, Paul Scofield, And Joan 
         Allen.  Several Critics Have Named "The Crucible" One Of
         The Best Films Of 1996 And Its Actors Have Been 
         Mentioned For Possible Academy Award Nominations And 
         Other Honors.  In This Report Written By Keming Kuo, We 
         Learn How Arthur Miller's Story Of Witchcraft And 
         Hysteria In Salem, Massachusetts Some 300 Years Ago Also
         Has An Underlying Message About A More Recent Historical

         [Today/ This Week/ This Month] [1/22/53] In New York 
         City.  "The Crucible" Is Studied And Performed In 
         Thousands Of Classrooms And Theaters Around The World, 
         And The New Film May Bring An Even Greater Appreciation 
         Of Mr. Miller, Who Is Often Considered America's

         Crucible," Directed By Nicholas Hytner, Opened In Most 
         Of The United States Late Last Month [12/96] And Stars 
         Daniel Day-Lewis, Winona Ryder, Paul Scofield, And Joan

         The Best Films Of 1996 And Its Actors Have Been 
         Mentioned For Possible Academy Award Nominations And 
         Other Honors.  In This Report Written By Keming Kuo, We

STAND UNTIL THE DOCKING TAKES PLACE. ///
<P>
 <B><BLOCKQUOTE>THE COUNTDOWN IS IN PROGRESS FOR THE LAUNCH OF THE U-S 
SPACE SHUTTLE "ATLANTIS" AND ITS RENDEZVOUS NEXT WEEK WITH THE 
RUSSIAN "MIR" SPACE STATION.  IT WILL BE THE FIFTH OF NINE 
PLANNED MEETINGS BETWEEN THE TWO ORBITERS.  V-O-A'S SCIENCE 
CORRESPONDENT DAVID MCALARY REPORTS THAT THE U-S TEAM AGAIN WILL 
LEAVE ONE OF ITS CREW MEMBERS BEHIND ON "MIR" FOR SEVERAL MONTHS 
OF SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH.
</B></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
 THE MAIN PURPOSE OF THE SHUTTLE FLIGHT IS TO REPLACE U-S 
ASTRONAUT JOHN BLAHA ['BLAH-HA] WITH ASTRONAUT JERRY LINENGER 
['LIH-NEN-JER].  DR. LINENGER, A PHYSICIAN, WILL REMAIN ON "MIR" 
FOR MORE THAN FOUR MONTHS, CONTINUING THE PERMANENT U-S PRESENCE 
ESTABLISHED BY SHANNON LUCID LAST MARCH AND CARRIED FORWARD BY 
JOHN BLAHA IN SEPTEMBER.
<P>
 THE ENTIRE SERIES OF DOCKINGS AND ASTRONAUT EXCHANGES IS GIVING 
THE U-S AND RUSSIAN SPACE AGENCIES PRACTICE WORKING TOGETHER TO 
BUILD AN INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION IN ORBIT BEGINNING LATE THIS
YEAR.
<P>
 THE U-S SPACE AGENCY OFFICIAL OVERSEEING THE U-S RESEARCH FOR THE
JOINT PROGRAM -- JOHN URI ['YOUR-EE] -- SAYS THE EXCHANGE WILL BE
REPEATED THREE MORE TIMES THROUGH 1998 AS THREE OTHER ASTRONAUTS 
TAKE TURNS LIVING ON THE RUSSIAN OUTPOST.
<P>
                           // URI ACT //
<P>
          WE'RE VERY EXCITED THAT WE'RE MOVING FROM ONE MISSION TO
         THE NEXT.  THE HANDOVER IS A SIGNIFICANT STEP TOWARD A 
         PERMANENT U-S PRESENCE IN SPACE.  FROM A RESEARCH 
         STANDPOINT, THAT ALLOWS US CONTINUED AND UNINTERRUPTED 
         USE OF ALL OF OUR FACILITIES TO CONTINUE A WELL BALANCED
         AND QUALITY RESEARCH PROGRAM, LAYING GOOD GROUNDWORK FOR
         THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION.
<P>
                           // END ACT //
<P>
 LIKE PREVIOUS DOCKINGS BETWEEN "ATLANTIS" AND "MIR, THIS ONE IS 
LARGELY AN EXERCISE IN TRANSFERRING THOUSANDS OF KILOGRAMS OF 
EQUIPMENT, SUPPLIES, FOOD, AND WATER TO THE RUSSIAN SPACE 
STATION.  THE SHUTTLE IS ALSO CARRYING MATERIALS FOR DR. LINENGER
TO CONTINUE U-S BIOMEDICAL EXPERIMENTS, AND WILL RETURN JOHN 
BLAHA'S EXPERIMENTS AND SOME RUSSIAN HARDWARE TO EARTH.
<P>
 DR. LINENGER'S EXPERIMENT SCHEDULE IS CROWDED.  HE WILL PERFORM 
NEARLY 80 TESTS DURING HIS SOJOURN ON "MIR" -- MANY MORE THAN HIS
PREDECESSORS.  THE HEAD OF THE U-S SPACE AGENCY'S ORBITAL 
RESEARCH PROGRAM -- ARNOLD NICOGOSSIAN -- DESCRIBES IT AS A 
PREVIEW OF WORK THAT WILL TAKE PLACE ABOARD THE INTERNATIONAL 
SPACE STATION.
<P>
                         // NICOGOSSIAN //
<P>
          THAT DEMONSTRATES WHAT AN INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION 
         CAN DO BECAUSE IT'S TRULY AN INTERNATIONAL GROUP OF 
         SCIENTISTS WHO GOT TOGETHER TO PUT THE PROGRAM 
         [TOGETHER], WHICH INCLUDES FRANCE, GERMANY, RUSSIA, THE 
         UNITED STATES, HUNGARY, AND CANADA.  BECAUSE IT'S A 
         PLATFORM WHICH CAN STAY LONG DURATION IN ORBIT, WE CAN 
         DO ALL KINDS OF SCIENCE.
<P>
                           // END ACT //
<P>
 CONSTRUCTION OF THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION IS TO BEGIN IN 
NOVEMBER WITH THE LAUNCH OF A RUSSIAN-BUILT CORE MODULE.  A U-S 
SHUTTLE WILL DELIVER THE FIRST AMERICAN COMPONENT IN DECEMBER -- 
A PRESSURIZED MODULE WITH SIX HATCHES THAT WILL SERVE AS A SORT 
OF VESTIBULE TO THE OTHER MODULES.  BUT RUSSIAN BUDGET PROBLEMS 
WILL DELAY DELIVERY OF A SECOND RUSSIAN COMPONENT -- A COMMAND 
AND CONTROL CENTER CALLED THE SERVICE MODULE.
<P>
 NEWS REPORTS HAVE SUGGESTED IT WOULD BE SENT UP EIGHT MONTHS 
LATER THAN ITS ORIGINAL APRIL, 1998, DELIVERY DATE -- 
SIGNIFICANTLY DELAYING HUMAN HABITATION OF THE STATION.  BUT U-S 
AND RUSSIAN OFFICIALS INSIST THE OUTLOOK IS  NOT  SO BLEAK.
<P>
 THE U-S SPACE AGENCY'S ASSOCIATE ADMINISTRATOR FOR SPACE FLIGHT 
-- WILL TRAFTON -- SAYS THE RUSSIAN DELAY WILL BE ONLY ONE MONTH.
<P>
                         // TRAFTON ACT //
<P>
          WE HAVE RECEIVED ASSURANCES FROM THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF 
         THEIR GOVERNMENT THAT THE SERVICE MODULE WILL BE THERE, 
         ALBEIT LATE.  THE PARTNERSHIP IS HEALTHY.  WE EXPECT 
         THAT WHEN WE'RE DONE, THE SLIP IN THE SERVICE MODULE 
         WILL HAVE VERY LITTLE EFFECT ON THE ASSEMBLY SEQUENCE.
<P>
                           // END ACT //
<P>
 THE RUSSIAN SPACE AGENCY OFFICIAL IN CHARGE OF HUMAN SPACE FLIGHT
-- ALEXANDER BODVENKO -- SAYS HE EXPECTS THE RUSSIAN PARLIAMENT, 
THE DUMA, TO PROVIDE THE MONEY  FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO MEET ITS 
INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION COMMITMENTS.
<P>
                    // BODVENKO [IN RUSSIAN] //
<P>
          LATELY WE HAVE A LOT OF SUPPORT FROM THE GOVERNMENT TO 
         MAKE SURE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE ENOUGH FUNDS TO BE ABLE TO
         COMPLY WITH THE REQUIREMENTS. BY THE END OF THE MONTH, 
         WE EXPECT THE FINAL READINGS OF THE BUDGET TO TAKE PLACE
         IN THE STATE DUMA AND WE ARE QUITE CONFIDENT A POSITIVE 
         DECISION WILL BE MADE.
<P>
                           // END ACT //

 THE EMERGING MARKETS OF THE NEW EUROPE BEGAN 1997 WHERE 
THEY ENDED THE PREVIOUS YEAR. THERE WERE RECORD HIGHS IN BUDAPEST

 IN WARSAW POLISH STOCK PRICES GAINED SIX PERCENT ON THE WEEK TO 
CLOSE AT A 15 THOUSAND 419. THAT IS THE HIGHEST LEVEL FOR THE WIG
INDEX IN 33 MONTHS. IN BUDAPEST THE BUX INDEX TOUCHED ITS 14TH  
CONSECUTIVE ALL TIME HIGH THURSDAY. THE MARKET CLOSED AT 47 
HUNDRED 14. IN PRAGUE STOCK PRICES WERE UP A STRONG THREE PERCENT
WITH THE  PX 50 INDEX AT 558. BRATISLAVA WAS HIGHER AS WERE

BULGARIA'S PARLIAMENT FRIDAY, DEMANDING THAT THE RULING 
SOCIALISTS STEP DOWN IN THE FACE OF A SERIOUS ECONOMIC CRISIS.  
IT WAS THE FIFTH DAY THAT THOUSANDS PROTESTED IN THE BULGARIAN 
CAPITAL.  REPORTER KATYA KOSEVA IN SOFIA SPOKE WITH V-O-A ABOUT 
THE UNREST.
</B></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
 
<P>
 Q:  ARE THE DEMONSTRATORS STILL OCCUPYING THE BUILDING, AS FAR AS
YOU KNOW?
<P>
 A:  THE DEMONSTRATORS WERE PUSHED OUTSIDE.  THEY ARE STAYING 
AROUND THE BUILDING, BUT THE PROBLEM IS THAT THE MEETING IS 
ALLOWED TO RUN UNTIL TEN O'CLOCK, AND AFTER THAT, IT APPEARS THAT
POLICE WOULD TAKE ACTIVE MEASURES -- THAT IS, THE PEOPLE ARE 
AFRAID THERE MIGHT BE BLOOD SHED.  BUT AT THIS MOMENT, THERE IS 
NOTHING OF THE KIND.  
<P>
  I CAN TELL YOU THAT ABOUT 100 M-P'S, DEPUTIES (POLITICIANS) 
MIXED WITH THE PROTESTERS, AND THEY ARE STAYING AROUND THE 
PARLIAMENT.  NOT INSIDE, AROUND IT.  TO SHOW THAT THEY WOULD 
PREVENT STRONGER ACTIONS FROM THE POLICE.
<P>
 Q:  WE HAVE REPORTS THAT SOME OF THE DEMONSTRATORS SMASHED SOME 
EQUIPMENT AND SOME FURNITURE, AND THAT THEY SET A SMALL FIRE IN 
THE BUILDING.  WHAT CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT THAT?
<P>
 A:  EXACTLY.  ALMOST ALL THE WINDOWS OF THE PARLIAMENT WERE 
SMASHED BY HEAVY METAL OBJECTS AND SNOWBALLS.  AND THERE WERE 
DIFFERENT  PIECES OF FURNITURE AND TABLES INSIDE WHICH WERE SET 
ON FIRE.  BUT, THE FIRE WAS EXTINGUISHED, AND RIGHT NOW AS WE CAN
SEE FROM T-V REPORTS, THE PARLIAMENT INSIDE IS A MESS -- BECAUSE 
THE FIREMEN HAD TO TRY TO EXTINGUISH THE FIRE.  EVERYWHERE YOU 
CAN SEE TABLES AND SOFAS AND COMPUTERS AND BOOKSHELVES AND WORK 
NOOKS (DESKS) BARRICADING THE TWO OR THREE EXITS AND DOORS OF THE
PARLIAMENT.
<P>
 OUTRO:  THAT WAS REPORTER KATYA KOSEVA, IN SOFIA, BULGARIA, 
SPEAKING ABOUT THE LATEST ANTI-GOVERNMENT PROTESTS.

 <B><BLOCKQUOTE>SEVERAL FORMER MEMBERS OF THE U-S CONGRESS VISITED CUBA 
RECENTLY AND BRIEFED REPORTERS IN WASHINGTON FRIDAY ON THE OUT 
COME OF THEIR TRIP.  THE BI-PARTISAN GROUP SAID CUBAN LEADER 
FIDEL CASTRO IS USING THE RECENTLY PASSED HELMS-BURTON LAW AS 
PART OF A PROPAGANDA CAMPAIGN.  V-O-A'S IMANI CROSBY REPORTS:
</B></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
 THE FORMER CONGRESSMEN SAY PRESIDENT FIDEL CASTRO BLAMES  
THE HELMS-BURTON LEGISLATION AND THE 35-YEAR-OLD U-S TRADE 
EMBARGO FOR CUBA'S DEPRESSED ECONOMIC SITUATION.  
<P>
 THE HELMS-BURTON LAW SEEKS TO CURB ANY FOREIGN INVESTMENT IN CUBA
AND, AMONG OTHER THINGS, PENALIZES FOREIGN COMPANIES THAT DO 
BUSINESS IN CUBA.  FORMER WISCONSIN REPRESENTATIVE TOBY ROTH SAYS
THE LAW SHOULD REMAIN IN EFFECT, BUT COULD ALSO BE USED TO OPEN A
DIALOGUE BETWEEN WASHINGTON AND HAVANA. 
<P>
                         /// ROTH ACT. ///
<P>
           I THINK THERE IS ROOM -  I THINK WE SHOULD BE TALKING 
         WITH THE CUBANS, TRYING TO MAKE SOME CHANGES. I THINK IF
         THE CUBANS MAKE SOME CHANGES, THEN I THINK WE'RE GOING 
         TO MAKE SOME CHANGES.  
<P>
                          /// END ACT ///
<P>
 ONE PROVISION OF THE HELMS-BURTON ACT, KNOWN AS TITLE THREE, 
WOULD ALLOW U-S CITIZENS TO SUE FOREIGN BUSINESSES FOR USING 
PROPERTY IN CUBA THAT WAS SEIZED AND NATIONALIZED BY THE CASTRO 
GOVERNMENT.  FORMER ARIZONA SENATOR DENNIS DECONCINI SAYS THAT 
PROVISION ALSO PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR PRESIDENT CASTRO TO 
INITIATE A DIALOGUE WITH THE UNITED STATES:
<P>
                      /// DECONCINI ACT. ///
<P>
           IT WOULD BE A MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH THAT THEY  (ED. THE 
         CUBANS) ACKNOWLEDGE THE CONFISCATION, THAT THEY 
         ACKNOWLEDGE THERE IS A VALUE EVEN THOUGH IT'S DISPUTED, 
         AND THEY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THEY ARE PREPARED TO PAY BACK 
         IN SOME MANNER.
<P>
                         /// END ACT. ///
<P>
 THE HELMS-BURTON LAW HAS BEEN WIDELY CRITICIZED, NOT ONLY BY 
CUBA, BUT ALSO BY MANY U-S ALLIES, INCLUDING THE EUROPEAN UNION. 
THE E-U STRONGLY OBJECTS TO THE RESTRICTIONS UNDER HELMS-BURTON 
AND SAYS THE E-U  IS  TYING FUTURE ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE TO CUBA TO
IMPROVED HUMAN RIGHTS POLICIES IN THAT COUNTRY.  PRESIDENT 
CLINTON HAS THUS FAR SUSPENDED TITLE THREE OF THE HELMS-BURTON 
ACT, PARTLY DUE TO PRESSURE FROM U-S ALLIES.  (SIGNED)

AT THE WHITE HOUSE, MR. CLINTON SAYS HE WILL NOT BE DISTRACTED BY

 PRESIDENT CLINTON TOLD REPORTERS FRIDAY HE IS TOO BUSY 
WORKING ON THE NATION'S BUSINESS TO WORRY ABOUT THE SUPREME COURT
HEARING.
<P>
                          // CLINTON ACTUALITY //
<P>
          I DO NOT HAVE ANY CONTROL OVER WHAT ANYONE ELSE DOES, I 
         CAN ONLY CONTROL WHAT I DO.  IT IS NOT GOING TO CAUSE ME
         ANY DIFFICULTY, BECAUSE I AM GOING TO DO MY JOB.

<P>
 THE HIGH COURT HEARING STEMS FROM A SEXUAL HARASSMENT LAWSUIT 
FILED IN 1994 BY PAULA JONES, A FORMER ARKANSAS STATE EMPLOYEE 
WHO SAYS MR. CLINTON MADE UNWANTED SEXUAL ADVANCES TOWARD HER 
WHEN HE WAS ARKANSAS GOVERNOR.   MR. CLINTON DENIES THE CHARGES.
<P>
 MS. JONES HOPES THE SUPREME COURT WILL ALLOW A LOWER COURT TO 
HEAR HER CASE.
<P>
 BUT MR. CLINTON'S LAWYERS ARE EXPECTED TO ARGUE THAT THE 
PRESIDENT SHOULD BE IMMUNE FROM SUCH LAWSUITS UNTIL AFTER HE 
LEAVES OFFICE. THEY WILL LIKELY MAKE THE CASE THAT ALLOWING A 
PRESIDENT TO BE SUED FOR ACTS COMMITTED BEFORE HE ASSUMES OFFICE 
WOULD MAKE FUTURE PRESIDENTS OPEN TO DISTRACTING LAWSUITS -- 
WHETHER OR NOT THE CHARGES HAVE MERIT. 
<P>
 THE HIGH COURT IS EXPECTED TO RULE ON THE MATTER LATER IN THE 
YEAR. (SIGNED)

 THE DOW JONES INDUSTRIAL AVERAGE WILL START THE WEEK AT 67

PERCENT, LAST WEEK.
<P>
 <P>
 FOR THE PAST TWO WEEKS, STOCK PRICES HAVE FLUCTUATED WILDLY, 
SOMETIMES MOVING MORE THAN 50 POINTS, IN BOTH DIRECTIONS, WITHIN 
A FEW HOURS OF TRADING.  ANALYSTS SAY THAT HAPPENED BECAUSE MANY 
TRADERS STILL DO NOT HAVE GREAT CONFIDENCE IN THE DIRECTION OF 
THE U-S ECONOMY AND THE FUTURE OF INTEREST RATES THIS YEAR.
<P>
 <P>
 BUT LAST WEEK DID FEATURE RECORD HIGH CLOSINGS IN THE DOW JONES 
INDUSTRIAL AVERAGE IN FOUR OF THE FIVE TRADING SESSIONS. ANALYSTS
SAY THAT IS A GOOD OMEN, ESPECIALLY COMING IN EARLY JANUARY. 
HISTORICALLY, THE DIRECTION OF STOCK PRICES IN JANUARY SETS THE 
TONE FOR THE REST OF THE YEAR.
<P>
 <P>
 CORPORATE EARNINGS REPORTS FOR THE FOURTH-QUARTER OF LAST YEAR 
WILL START TO BE RELEASED THIS WEEK. ANALYSTS SAY IF THERE ARE 
MANY SURPRISES IN THOSE PROFIT STATEMENTS, THE VOLATILITY IN THE 
STOCK MARKET COULD WELL CONTINUE.(SIGNED)

HAS RESUMED DIRECT CONTACT WITH LEFTIST GUERRILLAS HOLDING 74 
HIGH-LEVEL HOSTAGES AT THE JAPANESE AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE IN 
LIMA SINCE DECEMBER 17TH.   WE HAVE DETAILS FROM V-O-A'S 
CORRESPONDENT GEORGE MEEK IN OUR SOUTH AMERICA BUREAU.

 <P>
 PRESIDENT FUJIMORI TOLD A LIMA RADIO STATION THAT HIS 
PERSONAL REPRESENTATIVE FOR THE HOSTAGE CRISIS, EDUCATION 
MINISTER DOMINGO PALERMO, SPOKE FOR THREE OR FOUR MINUTES BY RED 
CROSS WALKIE-TALKIE WITH THE GUERRILLA LEADER, NESTOR CERPA 
CARTOLINI.  MR. FUJIMORI SAID THE CORDIAL CONVERSATION RAISES 
HOPES FOR EARLY RESUMPTION OF FACE-TO-FACE TALKS AIMED AT ENDING 
THE CRISIS. 
<P>
 MR.PALERMO AND THE TUPAC AMARU LEADER HAVE HAD ONLY ONE 
FACE-TO-FACE MEETING, A THREE-HOUR CONVERSATION INSIDE THE 
JAPANESE AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE ON DECEMBER 28TH.  THERE WAS 
TENSION AT THE RESIDENCE EARLY FRIDAY WHEN THE GUERRILLAS FIRED 
SHOTS IN THE AIR. THE RED CROSS SAYS THERE WERE NO CASUALTIES. 
FOOD AND SUPPLIES WERE DELIVERED NORMALLY ON FRIDAY.
<P>
 PRESIDENT FUJIMORI HAS REFUSED THE REBELS' DEMAND FOR RELEASE OF 
THEIR IMPRISONED COMRADES.  HE HAS IMPLIED THAT IF THEY FREE THE 
REMAINING HOSTAGES THEY MIGHT BE ALLOWED TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY.  
<P>
                   // REST OPT FOR LONG VERSION //
<P>
 THE PRESIDENT OF PERU'S COUNCIL OF MINISTERS, ALBERTO PANDOLFI, 
SAID THURSDAY NIGHT THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS IN CONTACT WITH OTHER 
GOVERNMENTS THAT MIGHT OFFER A SAFE HAVEN TO THE GUERRILLAS. 
MR.PANDOLFI DID NOT SAY WHICH GOVERNMENTS ARE INVOLVED, BUT THERE
IS WIDE SPECULATION THAT ONE MAY BE CUBA, WHICH ACCEPTED 
COLOMBIAN M-19 GUERRILLAS AFTER A SIMILAR HOSTAGE INCIDENT 16 
YEARS AGO. MR. PANDOLFI DENIED MEDIA REPORTS THAT PRESIDENT 
FUJIMORI'S SECURITY ADVISOR, VLADIMIR MONTESINOS, MET WITH JAILED
LEADERS OF THE TUPAC AMARU MOVEMENT IN AN EFFORT TO RESOLVE THE 
CRISIS. 
<P>
 ABOUT 450 OF THE REBELS, INCLUDING THEIR LEADER, VICTOR POLAY, 
ARE IN PRISON.  A LIMA NEWSPAPER, EL COMERCIO, SAYS ACCORDING TO 
POLICE SOURCES THERE ARE MORE THAN 200 TUPAC AMARU GUERRILLAS 
STILL AT LARGE IN PERU, WITH HEADQUARTERS IN THE ANDEAN CITY OF 
HUANCAYO.  (SIGNED)

THE PRESIDENTIAL INAUGURATION OF CONSERVATIVE BUSINESSMAN ARNOLDO
ALEMAN.  THE LIBERAL ALLIANCE CANDIDATE DEFEATED SANDINISTA 
LEADER DANIEL ORTEGA IN A BITTERLY-CONTESTED ELECTION LAST 
OCTOBER. BUT CRITICS ARE STILL QUESTIONING THE LEGITIMACY OF THE 
ELECTION.   V-O-A'S CANDACE WILLIAMS REPORTS.
</B></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
 THE NEW NICARAGUAN PRESIDENT, ARNOLDO ALEMAN, CAPTURED 51 
PERCENT OF THE VOTE IN THE OCTOBER 20TH ELECTION.  HIS SANDINISTA
CHALLENGER, DANIEL ORTEGA, WON 38 PERCENT.
<P>
 NICARAGUA'S SUPREME ELECTORAL COUNCIL DECLARED MR. ALEMAN THE 
WINNER AFTER MR. ORTEGA DEMANDED A RECOUNT.  MR. ORTEGA AND OTHER
HIGH-RANKING SANDINISTA OFFICIALS HAD ALLEGED WIDESPREAD 
IRREGULARITIES.
<P>
 THOSE SENTIMENTS WERE ECHOED FRIDAY BY  VILMA NUNEZ DE ESCORCIA, 
THE PRESIDENT OF THE NICARAGUAN CENTER FOR HUMAN RIGHTS.
<P>
 SPEAKING TO REPORTERS AT THE NATIONAL PRESS CLUB IN WASHINGTON,  
MS. NUNEZ SAID THE ELECTION DID  NOT  REFLECT THE WILL OF THE 
NICARAGUAN PEOPLE.
<P>
 MS.NUNEZ ALSO TOLD REPORTERS SHE HAS STATED HER CASE IN A 
COMPLAINT TO THE INTER-AMERICAN COMMISSION ON HUMAN RIGHTS 
<P>
                 //NUNEZ ACT, ESTABLISH AND FADE//
<P>
          WE CONSIDER THAT THESE ELECTIONS THAT TOOK PLACE DO  NOT
         FULFILL THE INTERNATIONAL REQUIREMENTS TO ENSURE THE 
         PEOPLE WERE ABLE TO FREELY EXPRESS THEIR POLITICAL WILL.
<P>
                            //END ACT//
<P>
 NICARAGUAN OFFICIALS SAID THAT WHILE INTERNATIONAL OBSERVERS 
ACKNOWLEDGED PROBLEMS WITH THE ELECTION, THE MONITORS CONCLUDED 
THE CONTEST WAS VALID.
<P>
 LAST YEAR, MS. NUNEZ UNSUCCESSFULLY RAN AGAINST MR. ORTEGA FOR 
THE SANDINISTA PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION.  SHE WAS THE FIRST WOMAN 
IN THE PARTY'S HISTORY TO SEEK THAT POSITION.(SIGNED)

WORKERS ESCALATED ON FRIDAY, DESPITE ASSURANCES BY PHYSICIANS 
THAT THEY WOULD RETURN TO HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOMS.  AS RAYMOND 
COLITT REPORTS FROM CARACAS, GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS SAY THE STRIKE 
HAS CAUSED THE DEATH OF MORE THAN 15 PATIENTS.  
</B></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
 FIFTEEN DAYS INTO A MEDICAL SECTOR STRIKE, THE 
CONFRONTATION BETWEEN PHYSICIANS AND THE GOVERNMENT APPEARS TO BE
HEIGHTENING, AS BOTH SIDES ARE TAKING LEGAL ACTION AGAINST EACH 
OTHER.  
<P>
 MEDICAL WORKERS TOOK GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS TO COURT, BLAMING THEM 
FOR A PERMANENT SHORTAGE OF MEDICAL SUPPLIES IN PUBLIC HOSPITALS.
THEY SAY MORE PATIENTS HAVE DIED FROM A LACK OF SUPPLIES THAN 
HAVE DIED AS A RESULT OF THE STRIKE.  
<P>
 THEIR ACCUSATIONS COME AFTER THE COUNTRY'S CHIEF PROSECUTOR 
ANNOUNCED CHARGES AGAINST THE LEADERS OF THE STRIKE, AND AGAINST 
SEVERAL PHYSICIANS WHO ABANDONED HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOMS.
<P>
 THE STRIKE BEGAN ON DECEMBER 27TH, WHEN PUBLIC MEDICAL WORKERS 
DEMANDED A WAGE INCREASE AS WELL AS MORE FUNDS FOR PUBLIC 
HOSPITALS.  SINCE THEN, IT HAS DEVELOPED INTO A NATIONWIDE 
PROTEST OVER THE COUNTRY'S DETERIORATING PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE.
<P>
 MEDICAL WORKERS INITIALLY DEMANDED AN INCREASE OF THEIR INCOME 
FROM AN AVERAGE OF 304 DOLLARS TO ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS, BUT HAVE 
SINCE LOWERED THEIR DEMANDS TO 735 DOLLARS.  // OPT //  
VENEZUELAN WORKERS HAVE SEEN THEIR AVERAGE INFLATION-ADJUSTED 
INCOME DROP TO ITS 1968 LEVEL. // END OPT //
<P>
 INTENT ON CUTTING ITS EXPENDITURES AND BRINGING DOWN INFLATION 
FROM LAST YEAR'S 103 PERCENT, THE GOVERNMENT SAYS IT LACK SUCH 
FUNDS.  PLANNING MINISTER TEODORO PETKOFF TOLD MEDICAL WORKERS 
THAT EVEN THE PRESIDENT OF THE COUNTRY ONLY EARNS THE EQUIVALENT 
OF 500 DOLLARS.  
<P>
 MR. PETKOFF ADDED THAT THE GOVERNMENT FISCAL DISCIPLINE THIS YEAR
WAS GOING TO CAUSE RENEWED CONFLICT WITH SEVERAL SECTORS OF 
SOCIETY.  LAST YEAR'S SPENDING CUTS PUSHED THE GOVERNMENT'S 
HEALTH BUDGET DOWN FROM 55 DOLLARS TO 33 DOLLARS PER CAPITA.

EFFORTS  TO RECOVER THE BODIES FROM THURSDAY'S COMMUTER PLANE 
CRASH NEAR THE CITY OF DETROIT.  ALL 29 PEOPLE ABOARD WERE KILLED
WHEN THEIR COMAIR  PLANE CRASHED WHILE APPROACHING A DETROIT 
AIRPORT.  MORE FROM V-O-A'S MICHAEL LELAND.
</B></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
 <P>
 <P>
 THE WEATHER IS SO BAD THAT NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION SAFETY 
BOARD SPOKESMAN JOHN HAMMERSCHMIDT SAYS HIS INVESTIGATORS CAN 
ONLY  REMAIN OUTSIDE FOR ABOUT 20-MINUTES AT A TIME.  AFTER THAT,
THEY NEED TO MOVE INDOORS TO WARM UP.  HE SAYS THE REAL WORK INTO
DETERMINING THE CAUSE OF THE CRASH WILL START ONCE ALL OF THE 
BODIES ARE REMOVED.
<P>
                     // HAMMERSCHMIDT ACT //  
<P>
          THE RECOVERY OF THE REMAINS IS THE TOP PRIORITY.  
         NATURALLY, OUR  CONDOLENCES GO OUT TO THE FAMILIES OF 
         THOSE WHO WERE ON BOARD THE AIRCRAFT AND THOSE LOVED 
         ONES OF THOSE WHO WERE ON BOARD.
<P>
                           // END ACT //
<P>
 SEVERAL FAMILY MEMBERS OF THE CRASH VICTIMS HAVE ARRIVED AT THE 
SITE.   MONROE COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH AUTHORITY DIRECTOR SHELDON 
ROSEN SAYS GRIEF COUNSELLING TEAMS HAVE BEEN FORMED TO MEET WITH 
THE FAMILIES.
<P>
                         // ROSEN ACT //  
<P>
          WE HAVE FOUR TEAMS AT THE HOTEL.  EACH TEAM IS MADE UP 
         OF ONE OF OUR  STAFF AND A CLERGYMAN TO SUPPORT THE 
         NEEDS OF THE FAMILY MEMBERS THAT HAVE ARRIVED.
<P>
                           //END ACT //
<P>
 THE COMAIR COMMUTER PLANE CRASHED THURSDAY AFTERNOON ABOUT 45  
KILOMETERS SOUTH OF DETROIT.  INVESTIGATORS SAY THEY ARE FOCUSING
ON SNOWY WEATHER CONDITIONS AND THE PLANE'S PROPELLERS IN THEIR 
SEARCH FOR A CAUSE.
<P>
                      // REST OPT FOR LONG //
<P>
 PROPELLER PROBLEMS HAVE BEEN BLAMED FOR TWO OF THE THREE FATAL  
CRASHES INVOLVING THIS TYPE OF PLANE IN THE UNITED STATES.  THE 
CRAFT  WAS A BRAZILIAN-MADE EMBRAER 120, WHICH SEATS 30 
PASSENGERS.  COMAIR  BOUGHT THE PLANE NEW IN 1992.  IT WAS LAST 
OVERHAULED ABOUT TWO MONTHS AGO.  AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS SAY THE
PILOT DID  NOT  INDICATE ANY TROUBLE IN THE MINUTES BEFORE THE 
PLANE WENT DOWN.
<P>
 THE CRASH HAS AGAIN RAISED THE ISSUE OF COMMUTER AIRLINE SAFETY 
IN  THE UNITED STATES.  MOST REGIONAL CARRIERS USE SMALL,  
PROPELLER-DRIVEN PLANES ON THEIR ROUTES, AND AIRLINE PASSENGER 
SAFETY  CONSULTANT DAVID STEMPLER SAYS THESE PLANES ARE INVOLVED 
IN MORE  ACCIDENTS THAN LARGER COMMERCIAL PLANES -- ESPECIALLY AT
NIGHT OR DURING BAD WEATHER.
<P>
                        // STEMPLER ACT //
<P>
          BACK IN 1994 I PUT OUT A STUDY WHICH BASICALLY TOLD 
         MEMBERS OF THE  INTERNATIONAL AIRLINE PASSENGERS 
         ASSOCIATION TO AVOID COMMUTER /  REGIONAL AIRPLANES WITH
         30 OR FEWER SEATS BECAUSE THEY HAD AN  ACCIDENT RECORD 
         WHICH IS SUBSTATIALLY HIGHER THAN FOR THE JETS AND THE 
         LARGER TURBO-PROP AIRPLANES.
<P>
                           // END ACT //
<P>
 COMAIR IS PART-OWNED BY DELTA AIRLINES AND CONNECTS DELTA FLIGHTS
IN  LARGER U-S CITIES WITH SMALLER AND MEDIUM-SIZED COMMUNITIES  
THROUGHOUT THE AMERICAN MIDWEST AND IN FLORIDA.  THIS IS ONLY THE
SECOND FATAL CRASH IN COMAIR HISTORY AND THE FIRST SINCE 1979.

 <B><BLOCKQUOTE>THE MAYOR OF NEW YORK CITY HAS LAUNCHED A NATIONAL 
CAMPAIGN TO FIGHT WHAT HE SAYS IS A WAVE OF ANTI-IMMIGRANT 
SENTIMENT IN THE UNITED STATES.  MAYOR RUDOLPH GIULIANI SAYS THE 
PURPOSE OF THE CAMPAIGN IS TO STOP THE PASSAGE OF PROPOSED 
LEGISLATION THAT WOULD DISCRIMINATE AGAINST IMMIGRANTS.  V-O-A'S 
MAX RUSTON REPORTS FROM OUR NEW YORK BUREAU.
</B></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
 DURING THE CAMPAIGN FOR THE U-S PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION LAST
YEAR, IMMIGRATION ISSUES PLAYED A MAJOR ROLE.  VOTERS EXPRESSED 
CONCERNS THAT TOO MANY IMMIGRANTS, MANY OF THEM ILLEGAL, WERE 
ENTERING THE UNITED STATES, TAKING JOBS AND GOVERNMENT WELFARE 
AND HEALTH CARE MONEY.  SOME MEMBERS OF U-S CONGRESS CALLED FOR 
NEW LEGISLATION TO CRACK DOWN ON ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION.  SOME 
CALLED FOR MEASURES TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF LEGAL IMMIGRANTS 
ALLOWED IN THE COUNTRY.
<P>
 TO CHANGE THIS NEGATIVE PERCEPTION OF IMMIGRANTS, NEW YORK MAYOR 
RUDOLPH GIULIANI HAS LAUNCHED A CAMPAIGN THAT WOULD LIKELY LOSE 
HIM VOTES IN MOST OTHER MAJOR AMERICAN CITIES.  HE HAS APPOINTED 
A 25 MEMBER COMMISSION, WHICH HE HOPES WILL CHANGE THE WAY THE 
ENTIRE NATION LOOKS AT IMMIGRANTS. 
<P>
                       /// GIULIANI ACT ///
<P>
          I AM VERY PLEASED TO ANNOUNCE TODAY THE ESTABLISHMENT OF
         THIS IMMIGRATION COALITION WHICH INCLUDES BUSINESS 
         LEADERS, POLITICAL LEADERS, COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS, 
         CELEBRITIES, AND ALL THOSE WHO NOT ONLY OPPOSE THE 
         ANTI-IMMIGRANT SENTIMENT GOING ON IN THE COUNTRY, BUT, 
         IN A POSITIVE WAY UNDERSTAND THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF 
         IMMIGRANTS.  BECAUSE THIS IS NOT A NEGATIVE THING, THIS 
         IS AN ENORMOUSLY POSITIVE THING.  IT IS, IN MY VIEW, THE
         KEY TO AMERICA'S SUCCESS, AND THE KEY TO NEW YORK CITY'S
         SUCCESS.
<P>
                          /// END ACT ///
<P>
 MANY FAMOUS IMMIGRANTS TO THE UNITED STATES ARE ON THE 
COMMISSION, INCLUDING FINANCIER GEORGE SOROS FROM HUNGARY, 
GUITARIST CARLOS SANTANA FROM MEXICO, ARCHITECT I-M PEI FROM 
CHINA AND ARTIST PETER MAX FROM GERMANY.
<P>
 IN ADDITION TO CHANGING THE NEGATIVE PERCEPTION SOME AMERICANS 
HAVE OF IMMIGRANTS, THE COALITION WILL PREPARE A REPORT FOR THE 
U-S CONGRESS AND THE PRESIDENT.  THE REPORT IS PART OF AN EFFORT 
TO STOP PROPOSED LEGISLATION THAT WOULD RESTRICT IMMIGRATION AND 
CUT EDUCATION, WELFARE AND MEDICAL BENEFITS TO SOME LEGAL AND 
ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS IN THE UNITED STATES.
<P>
 AUTHOR FRANK MCCOURT, WHO IMMIGRATED TO THE UNITED STATES FROM 
IRELAND AND TAUGHT FOR DECADES IN NEW YORK'S PUBLIC SCHOOL 
SYSTEM, IS AMONG THE MEMBERS OF THE COALITION AGAINST THE 
PROPOSED LEGISLATION.
<P>
                        /// MCCOURT ACT ///
<P>
          ALL I CAN SAY IS THAT THIS PARTICULAR LAW IS DENYING US 
         ENERGY AND TALENT OF UNIQUE KINDS, ALL KINDS.  I HAVE 
         CHINESE KIDS IN MY CLASSES, AFRICAN AMERICAN KIDS, 
         JEWISH KIDS, WHO MIGHT, IN OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES, HAVE 
         BEEN DECLARED ILLEGAL, ROBBING US OF THESE TALENTS AND 
         ENERGIES.
<P>
                          /// END ACT ///
<P>
 MAYOR GIULIANI SAYS THESE TALENTS AND ENERGIES PROVIDE A NET 
CONTRIBUTION TO THE U-S ECONOMY, ACTUALLY CREATING MORE JOBS AND 
IMPROVING FUTURE ECONOMIC PROSPECTS.  HIS CLAIMS ARE DISPUTED IN 
SOME OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY, WHERE PEOPLE SAY TOO MANY 
IMMIGRANTS RECEIVE GOVERNMENT WELFARE CHECKS AND RECEIVE OLD-AGE 
AND MEDICAL BENEFITS EVEN THOUGH THEY HAVE ONLY CONTRIBUTED TAXES
FOR A SHORT TIME.
<P>
 MR. GIULIANI SAYS HE DOES NOT WANT TO ENCOURAGE ILLEGAL 
IMMIGRANTS TO COME TO THE UNITED STATES.  BUT, HE SAYS THOSE WHO 
HAVE ARRIVED LEGALLY AND PAY TAXES SHOULD BE TREATED FAIRLY.  HE 
SAYS THE PROPOSED ANTI-IMMIGRANT LEGISLATION IS NOT FAIR.
<P>
                       /// GIULIANI ACT ///
<P>
          DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TAKES MONEY
         FROM THEM AT THE SAME LEVEL AND THEY ARE REQUIRED TO PAY
         THE SAME SET OF TAXES, NOW THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS 
         SAYING, IN THE WELFARE REFORM LEGISLATION AND THE 
         IMMIGRATION LEGISLATION, THAT IF THEY SHOULD HAVE 
         DIFFICULTIES, THE SAME DIFFICULTIES THAT CITIZENS HAVE, 
         THEY ARE TO BE CUT OFF FROM ANY HELP OR ANY BENEFITS.  
         NOW JUST FROM A BASIC SENSE OF FAIRNESS, AMERICAN 
         FAIRNESS, IF PEOPLE CONTRIBUTE IN THE SAME LEVELS TO A 
         PROGRAM, THEN PEOPLE SHOULD BE ENTITLED TO GET THE 
         BENEFITS OF THAT PROGRAM ON AN EQUAL BASIS.  
<P>
                          /// END ACT ///
<P>
 MR. GIULIANI SAYS HE PLANS ON WORKING TOGETHER WITH THE STATES OF
FLORIDA, TEXAS AND CALIFORNIA, AND MAJOR CITIES SUCH AS CHICAGO 
AND LOS ANGELES IN AN EFFORT TO CONVINCE OTHER PARTS OF THE 
NATION OF THE VALUE OF IMMIGRANTS.  HE SAYS THESE PLACES, ALONG 
WITH NEW YORK CITY, STAND TO LOSE THE MOST IF THE PROPOSED 
LEGISLATION PASSES.  THE MAYOR UNVEILED HIS PLANS AT A NEWS 
CONFERENCE ON ELLIS ISLAND, THE FORMER IMMIGRATION RECEPTION 
CENTER THAT HAS BEEN RESTORED AS A MUSEUM AND MONUMENT TO THE 
NATION'S IMMIGRANTS.  (SIGNED)

OFFICIALS OF CHARGES OF OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE INVOLVING THE 
ASSASSINATION OF A RIGHTIST SENATOR.  CORRESPONDENT GEORGE MEEK 
IN OUR SOUTH AMERICA BUREAU REPORTS THE CASE HAS SPARKED DEBATE 
ON THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE GOVERNMENT'S EFFORTS TO COMBAT 
TERRORISM. 
</B></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
 IN A UNANIMOUS DECISION, THE SUPREME COURT UPHELD THE 
DECISION OF AN APPEALS COURT THAT THERE IS  NO  EVIDENCE OF 
CRIMINAL ACTS BY THE ASSISTANT SECRETARY FOR REGIONAL 
DEVELOPMENT, MARCELO SCHILLING; THE CHIEF OF THE INVESTIGATIVE 
POLICE, NELSON MERY; AND TWO LOWER RANKING SECURITY OFFICIALS. 
<P>
 THE FOUR WERE ACCUSED OF BLOCKING EFFORTS TO DISCOVER WHO ORDERED
AND PLANNED THE ASSASSINATION OF SENATOR JAIME GUZMAN.  SENATOR 
GUZMAN, AN ADVISER TO CHILE'S FORMER MILITARY GOVERNMENT, WAS 
MURDERED IN APRIL, 1991, BY MEMBERS OF THE LEFTIST MANUEL 
RODRIGUEZ PATRIOTIC FRONT.  TWO OF THE ASSASSINS, SENTENCED TO 
LIFE IN PRISON, ESCAPED BY HELICOPTER LAST WEEK AND REMAIN AT 
LARGE. 
<P>
 THE JUDGE WHO ACCUSED THE FOUR OFFICIALS OF OBSTRUCTION OF 
JUSTICE, RAQUEL CAMPOSANO, SAID THEY WITHHELD A VIDEO AND OTHER 
EVIDENCE THAT WOULD HAVE SHED LIGHT ON THE PLANNING OF THE 
MURDER.  THE CASE WENT TO THE SUPREME COURT BECAUSE SENATOR 
GUZMAN'S FAMILY OPPOSED AN APPEALS COURT DECISION TWO WEEKS AGO 
TO CLEAR THE FOUR MEN.  THE FAMILY SAYS THE SUPREME COURT 
DECISION MAY MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND THE REAL CULPRITS IN THE 
ASSASSINATION.  
<P>
 CHILE'S CENTER-LEFT GOVERNMENT HAS ACCUSED RIGHTIST ELEMENTS OF 
USING THE OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE CASE TO DISCREDIT ITS EFFORTS TO
ERADICATE VESTIGES OF TERRORISM. (SIGNED)

 <B><BLOCKQUOTE>THERE ARE 450 MILLION MORE PEOPLE IN THE WORLD TODAY 
         THAN FIVE YEARS AGO WHEN THE 1992 EARTH SUMMIT TOOK 
         PLACE IN RIO DE JANEIRO, BRAZIL.  BUT WHILE THE 
         POPULATION IS GROWING, NATURAL RESOURCES SUCH AS MARINE 
         FISHERIES AND FORESTS ARE BEING DEPLETED.  CARBON 
         DIOXIDE IN THE ATMOSPHERE HAS REACHED AN ALL-TIME HIGH, 
         WHICH SOME SAY MAY LEAD TO GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE.  VOA'S
         ZLATICA HOKE EXPLAINS THAT THERE ARE PLANS FOR A MARCH 
         MEETING IN RIO TO LOOK AT ENVIRONMENT PROGRESS SINCE THE
         1992 SUMMIT, EVEN AS TWO NEW REPORTS OFFER AN ASSESSMENT
         OF THE WORLD ENVIRONMENT. 
</B></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
 FIVE YEARS AGO, TEN THOUSAND REPRESENTATIVES OF 
         GOVERNMENT, INDUSTRY, BUSINESS AND PRIVATE ORGANIZATIONS
         FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD GATHERED AT THE EARTH SUMMIT IN 
         RIO DE JANEIRO.  THEY PUT TOGETHER A PLAN CALLED "AGENDA
         21" FOR ENVIRONMENTAL RESTORATION, PRESERVATION, AND 
         SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT WITH THE GOAL OF HELPING TO PRESERVE 
         NATURAL RESOURCES AND BIODIVERSITY, PREVENTING CLIMATE 
         CHANGES AND GENERALLY IMPROVING HUMAN LIFE.  BUT EXPERTS
         ASSESSING THE RESULTS OF THE 1992 EARTH SUMMIT, SAY TOO 
         LITTLE HAS BEEN ACHIEVED.  
<P>
          MAURICE STRONG, CHAIRMAN OF THE EARTH COUNCIL, A PRIVATE
         INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION COMMITTED TO SUSTAINABLE 
         DEVELOPMENT, AND ADVISOR TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE WORLD 
         BANK, SAYS IN THE FIVE YEARS SINCE THE RIO SUMMIT 
         COUNTRIES HAVE PUT OFF SOLVING ENVIRONMENT AND OTHER 
         PROBLEMS.
<P>
 TAPE CUT ONE STRONG     :30
<P>
          "IF THERE HAS BEEN A QUIET INTER-REGNUM SINCE RIO IN 
         MANY RESPECTS, IN TERMS OF THE ENVIRONMENT AND 
         SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT, THERE HAS BEEN A TREMENDOUS 
         BUILD-UP OF ISSUES WHICH WILL CLEARLY BE SURFACING AS WE
         MOVE INTO THE NEXT CENTURY.  WE WILL BE EXPERIENCING 
         WHAT I HAVE OFTEN CALLED THE DEFERRED COSTS OF APATHY."
<P>
 ACCORDING TO THE EARTH COUNCIL, MORE THAN A HUNDRED 
         NATIONS ARE WORSE OFF TODAY THAN FIFTEEN YEARS AGO AND 
         MORE THAN A BILLION PEOPLE LIVE IN EXTREME POVERTY.  THE
         GAP BETWEEN THE RICHEST AND THE POOREST IS GROWING, 
         ACCORDING TO THE EARTH COUNCIL.  STATISTICS COMPILED BY 
         THE UNITED NATIONS DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM, THE WORLD BANK 
         AND THE WORLDWATCH INSTITUTE ALSO PRESENT A GRIM 
         PICTURE.  CHRISTOPHER FLAVIN IS ONE OF THE AUTHORS OF 
         THE STATE OF THE WORLD REPORT 1997, A YEARLY PUBLICATION
         OF THE WORLDWATCH INSTITUTE, AN INDEPENDENT 
         ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH ORGANIZATION IN WASHINGTON D.C.
<P>
          TREATIES SIGNED AT THE RIO SUMMIT, SAYS MR. FLAVIN, HAVE
         NOT MADE A DIFFERENCE IN PROTECTING THE STABILITY OF 
         GLOBAL CLIMATE AND BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY.  IN ITS 1997 
         REPORT, THE WORLDWATCH INSTITUTE DESCRIBES EIGHT 
         SO-CALLED "ENVIRONMENTAL HEAVYWEIGHTS" -- COUNTRIES THAT
         WORLDWATCH SAYS CONTRIBUTE MORE THAN ANY OTHERS TO THE 
         WORLD'S ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMS AND SOLUTIONS.  THE 
         COUNTRIES INCLUDE FOUR DEVELOPING NATIONS -- CHINA, 
         INDIA, INDONESIA AND BRAZIL AND FOUR INDUSTRIAL 
         COUNTRIES -- THE UNITED STATES, JAPAN, RUSSIA, AND 
         GERMANY.  CHRISTOPHER FLAVIN SAYS THAT WHAT HAPPENS IN 
         THOSE EIGHT COUNTRIES HAS WORLDWIDE IMPLICATIONS.
<P>
 TAPE CUT TWO FLAVIN        :20
<P>
          "JUST THESE EIGHT COUNTRIES ALONE REPRESENT 56 PERCENT 
         OF THE WORLD'S POPULATION, 59 PERCENT OF THE GROSS WORLD
         PRODUCT, 58 PERCENT OF CARBON DIOXIDE EMISSIONS, AND 53 
         PERCENT OF THE FORESTED AREA.  IN OTHER WORDS -- OVER 
         HALF AND IN SOME CASES CLOSE TO 60 PERCENT OF THE 
         TOTAL."
<P>
 A CONFERENCE -- THE "RIO-PLUS-FIVE FORUM" -- IS PLANNED 
         FOR RIO DE JANEIRO ON MARCH 13-19 TO LOOK AT PROGRESS 
         MADE SINCE THE 1992 RIO SUMMIT.  A REPORT BY THE EARTH 
         COUNCIL IN ADVANCE OF THE RIO MEETING SAYS THAT THE 
         WORLD IS FACING A SERIOUS SHORTAGE OF NATURAL RESOURCES.
         FOR EXAMPLE, THIRTEEN OF THE WORLD'S FIFTEEN LEADING 
         OCEANIC FISHERIES ARE IN DECLINE.  HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS 
         OF ACRES OF TROPICAL AND DECIDUOUS FORESTS ARE 
         DISAPPEARING EACH YEAR.  AND, ACCORDING TO THE REPORT, 
         ABOUT ONE BILLION PEOPLE LIVE WITHOUT CLEAN WATER.  
         MAURICE STRONG OF THE EARTH COUNCIL WARNS THAT A WATER 
         SHORTAGE MIGHT LEAD TO FUTURE CONFLICT. 
<P>
 TAPE CUT THREE STRONG         :36
<P>
          "I SEE THE WATER ISSUE EMERGING.  YOU KNOW WATER WAS ONE
         OF THE MOST ANCIENT SOURCES OF HUMAN CONFLICT.  IN THE 
         PERIOD AHEAD IT'S GOING TO RE-EMERGE AS A TREMENDOUS 
         SOURCE OF CONFLICT.  BECAUSE WATERWAYS DO LINK NATIONS 
         AND WHAT ONE NATION DOES, AFFECTS ITS NEIGHBORS.  AND 
         THERE IN THE MIDDLE EAST, YOU JUST WATCH -- MY VIEW IS 
         THAT WATER ISSUES ARE GOING TO ACTUALLY OVERTAKE OIL 
         ISSUES AS PRIMARY SOURCES OF CONFLICT IN THE MIDDLE 
         EAST.  THE SAME IS TRUE IN AFRICA." 
<P>
 (BEGIN OPT) ONE OF THE KEY ISSUES IN UPHOLDING THE 
         PLEDGES MADE AT THE 1992 RIO MEETING HAS BEEN FINANCING.
         IN THE PAST FIVE YEARS MOST GOVERNMENTS, INCLUDED THE 
         UNITED STATES, DECREASED AID TO PROGRAMS IMPLEMENTING 
         THE RIO AGREEMENTS.  MAURICE STRONG SAYS THE UNITED 
         STATES, THE TRADITIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL LEADER, HAS 
         FALTERED SINCE THE 1992 EARTH SUMMIT AND WILL HAVE TO 
         RE-ESTABLISHED ITS ENVIRONMENTAL LEADERSHIP.  HE 
         CAUTIONS THAT IF THE UNITED STATES GIVES LESS, OTHER 
         NATIONS WILL FOLLOW ITS EXAMPLE. (END OPT)
<P>
          ALTHOUGH REPORTS ABOUT THE STATE OF THE WORLD CAN BE 
         GLOOMY, HILARY FRENCH, ANOTHER OF THE AUTHORS OF THE 
         1997 WORLDWATCH STATE OF THE WORLD REPORT, SAYS THERE 
         ARE SUCCESS STORIES. 
<P>
 TAPE CUT  FOUR FRENCH         :28
<P>
          "ALTHOUGH PROGRESS AT THE INTERNATIONAL LEVEL HAS BEEN 
         DISAPPOINTINGLY SLOW WE'VE SEEN QUITE A BIT OF PROGRESS 
         ON THE NATIONAL AND THE LOCAL LEVEL IN COMING UP WITH 
         NATIONAL ACTION PLANS AND EVEN LOCAL AGENDA 21-S AIMED 
         AT PUTTING IN PLACE PROGRAMS TO IMPLEMENT RIO 
         COMMITMENTS AT THE NATIONAL AND THE LOCAL LEVEL.  AND 
         THE PERHAPS ONE OF THE MOST ENCOURAGING STATISTICS IS 
         THAT 15 HUNDRED CITIES IN 51 COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD 
         HAVE DEVELOPED LOCAL AGENDA 21-S IN RECENT YEARS."
<P>
 THE 1992 EARTH SUMMIT IN RIO DE JANEIRO WAS ONE OF THE 
         LARGEST GATHERINGS OF WORLD LEADERS WITH TEN THOUSAND 
         DELEGATES FROM NEARLY 180 NATIONS.  NOW, FIVE YEARS 
         LATER, THOSE PLANNING THE MARCH 13-19 RIO-PLUS-FIVE 
         FORUM ARE EXPECTING REPRESENTATIVES FROM 80 NATIONS AND 
         ABOUT 450 INDUSTRIAL AND NON-GOVERNMENT ORGANIZATIONS TO
         DISCUSS, AS MAURICE STRONG EXPLAINS IT, HOW TO PROCEED 
         "FROM AGENDA TO ACTION."

 <B><BLOCKQUOTE>WHAT INTERNATIONALLY TRADED COMMODITY SURPASSES OIL IN 
         BOTH SALES AND PROFIT MARGINS?  THE ANSWER IS ILLICIT 
         DRUGS, ACCORDING TO A REPORT BY FREEDOM HOUSE, A NEW 
         YORK-BASED ORGANIZATION THAT MONITORS HUMAN RIGHTS 
         AROUND THE WORLD.   ACCORDING TO THE FREEDOM HOUSE 
         STUDY, VOA'S LINDA CASHDAN REPORTS, TODAY'S DRUG 
         TRAFFICKERS MARKET THEIR PRODUCT WITH THE SAME DEGREE OF
         SOPHISTICATION AND EXPERTISE AS THE WORLD'S TOP 
         MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS.
</B></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
 THE FARMERS WHO GROW THE COCA PLANT FOR COCAINE IN SOUTH
         AMERICA AND THE POPPIES FOR HEROIN IN ASIA MAKE ONLY 
         SLIGHTLY MORE THAN THEY WOULD GROWING OTHER CROPS, SAYS 
         DOUGLAS PAYNE, ONE OF THE AUTHORS OF THE FREEDOM HOUSE 
         REPORT.  THE BIG MONEY IS RESERVED FOR THE CHIEF 
         EXECUTIVES OF THE DRUG TRADE, MR. PAYNE SAYS, WHO USE 
         THE PROFITS TO BUY OFF POLITICIANS AND FOR THEIR OWN 
         PERSONAL INVESTMENTS.  TO CAMOUFLAGE THEIR SOURCE, MR. 
         PAYNE SAYS, DRUG PROFITS ARE IMMEDIATELY "LAUNDERED" -- 
         PROCESSED THROUGH A GLOBAL SYSTEM THAT MAKES IT 
         IMPOSSIBLE FOR LAW EMFORCERS TO PROVE THE MONEY WAS 
         EARNED BY DRUG-DEALING.    
<P>
 <P>
          "DRUG TRADERS LAUNDER THEIR MONEY USING THE SAME 
         MECHANISMS THAT LEGITIMATE MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS 
         USE TO MOVE THEIR MONEY AROUND THE WORLD AND TO EVADE 
         TAXES.  THE PRINCIPLE STRUCTURE THAT ALLOWS THIS TO 
         HAPPEN IS THE ROUGHLY 50 BANKING HAVENS THAT SPAN THE 
         GLOBE IN THE PACIFIC, THE CARIBBEAN, HONG KONG, 
         SWITZERLAND.  THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS HAVE ON HAND THE SAME
         TYPES OF PROFESSIONAL MONEY LAUNDERERS AS ALL 
         CORPORATIONS HAVE -- TRAINED AT THE LONDON SCHOOL OF 
         ECONOMICS, HARVARD BUSINESS -- WHO ARE ABLE TO MOVE 
         MONEY THROUGH THE INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL SYSTEM AT THE 
         PRESS OF A (COMPUTER) KEY BOARD, AND, IN SO DOING, THE 
         MONEY CHANGES SHAPE, IT CHANGES APPEARANCE, AND ONCE IT 
         IS INSIDE THE BANKS' SECRECY HAVENS, LAW ENFORCEMENT CAN
         LO LONGER DETERMINE WHETHER THE MONEY IS FROM A 
         LEGITIMATE OR A NON LEGITIMATE SOURCE."
<P>
 IF INTERNATIONAL DRUG TRAFFICKERS HAVE PROFESSIONAL 
         MONEY LAUNDERERS, MR. PAYNE SAYS, THEY HAVE PROFESSIONAL
         MARKETERS AS WELL.  HE SAYS TODAY'S CRACK EPIDEMIC IN 
         U-S INNER CITIES STEMS FROM A MARKETING DECISION MADE BY
         COLOMBIAN TRAFFICKERS WHO REALIZED, IN THE LATE 1970S 
         AND EARLY 80S, THAT THE WEALTHY AMERICAN MARKET FOR 
         POWDERED COCAINE WAS WANING.  
<P>
 <P>
          "THEY REALIZED THERE WAS A MARKET FOR DRUGS IN THE INNER
         CITIES, AS WELL AS AMONG POOR PEOPLE IN RURAL AREAS, AND
         THEY REALIZED AT 100 DOLLARS A GRAM FOR POWDERED COCAINE
         THEY COULDN'T SELL IT.  THEY LITERALLY INVENTED CRACK.  
         THEY TEST MARKETED IT IN THE BAHAMAS IN THE EARLY 80S, 
         AND IT TOOK OFF LIKE WILDFIRE, AND THEN THEY QUICKLY 
         BEGAN ESTABLISHING CRACK DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS.  THEY 
         DID IT THROUGH DOMINICAN ORGANIZED CRIME RINGS IN NEW 
         YORK AND THE GANG STRUCTURES IN LOS ANGELES.  WHEN 
         YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A UNIT OF DRUG THAT'S ONLY ABOUT 
         FIVE DOLLARS, YOU'RE ABLE TO TAP INTO THE LOWER CLASS 
         MARKET."
<P>
 IS IT POSSIBLE TO LAUNCH A GLOBAL WAR AGAINST ILLICIT 
         DRUG TRAFFICKING?  MR. PAYNE IS NOT SO SURE.  THE 
         PROBLEM, HE SAYS, IS THAT THE VERY SAME CONDITIONS THAT 
         ARE CREATING A BOOM IN WORLD COMMERCE ARE ALSO 
         FACILITATING WORLD DRUG TRADE.
<P>
 <P>
          "IF YOU ASKED A DRUG TRAFFICKER NOW WHAT WOULD BE HIS 
         OPTIMUM CONDITIONS FOR OPERATING, HE WOULD TELL YOU 
         PROBLABLY A DEREGULATED  INTERNATIONAL FINANCE, FREER 
         TRADE, LOWER TARIFF BARRIERS AND A WEAK RULE OF LAW AND,
         PARTICULARLY ON THE LATTER, YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE 
         CONDITIONS THAT EXIST TODAY IN THE GLOBALIZED ECONOMY 
         WITH THE COUNTRIES HAVING A WEAK RULE OF LAW BEING THE 
         MAJORITY OF THE DEVELOPIJNG WORLD."
<P>
 IN ORDER FOR A GLOBAL EFFORT AGAINST DRUG TRADE TO BE 
         EFFECTIVE, MR. PAYNE SAYS, THERE MUST BE STRICTER 
         REGULATION OF BANK SECRECY RULES AND CONTROL OF OFFSHORE
         BANKING HAVENS.  RESTRICTIONS MUST BE PLACED ON THE 
         BORDER-ERASING TECHNOLOGY THAT EXISTS TODAY, AND ON 
         GLOBAL TRADE RULES.  THE GOVERNMENTS OF ARGENTINA, 
         BRAZIL, CHINA, GERMANY, INDIA, MEXICO, AND THE 
         NETHERLANDS MUST STOP LOOKING THE OTHER WAY AS THEIR 
         INDUSTRIES PROVIDE THE CHEMICALS NEEDED FOR THE 
         MANUFACTURE OF COCAINE.  DOUGLAS PAYNE, ONE OF THE 
         AUTHORS OF THE FREEDOM HOUSE REPORT SAYS THAT WITHOUT 
         NEW THINKING AND THE APPLICATIONS OF NEW APPROACHES THE 
         "BORDERLESS" WORLD IS GOING TO BECOME AN INCREASINGLY 
         LAWLESS WORLD.  (SIGNED)

 <B><BLOCKQUOTE>HOLLYWOOD HAS BEEN BRINGING SEVERAL CLASSIC NOVELS AND 
         PLAYS TO THE SILVER SCREEN IN THE PAST COUPLE YEARS: 
         MOST NOTABLY, THE WORKS OF JANE AUSTEN, WILLIAM 
         SHAKESPEARE AND HENRY JAMES.  RECENTLY, YET ANOTHER 
         CLASSIC WORK HAS BEEN MADE INTO A FILM: ARTHUR MILLER'S 
         PLAY "THE CRUCIBLE," WHICH PREMIERED 44 YEARS AGO 
         [TODAY/ THIS WEEK/ THIS MONTH] [1/22/53] IN NEW YORK 
         CITY.  "THE CRUCIBLE" IS STUDIED AND PERFORMED IN 
         THOUSANDS OF CLASSROOMS AND THEATERS AROUND THE WORLD, 
         AND THE NEW FILM MAY BRING AN EVEN GREATER APPRECIATION 
         OF MR. MILLER, WHO IS OFTEN CONSIDERED AMERICA'S 
         GREATEST LIVING PLAYWRIGHT.  THE MOVIE VERSION OF  "THE 
         CRUCIBLE," DIRECTED BY NICHOLAS HYTNER, OPENED IN MOST 
         OF THE UNITED STATES LATE LAST MONTH [12/96] AND STARS 
         DANIEL DAY-LEWIS, WINONA RYDER, PAUL SCOFIELD, AND JOAN 
         ALLEN.  SEVERAL CRITICS HAVE NAMED "THE CRUCIBLE" ONE OF
         THE BEST FILMS OF 1996 AND ITS ACTORS HAVE BEEN 
         MENTIONED FOR POSSIBLE ACADEMY AWARD NOMINATIONS AND 
         OTHER HONORS.  IN THIS REPORT WRITTEN BY KEMING KUO, WE 
         LEARN HOW ARTHUR MILLER'S STORY OF WITCHCRAFT AND 
         HYSTERIA IN SALEM, MASSACHUSETTS SOME 300 YEARS AGO ALSO
         HAS AN UNDERLYING MESSAGE ABOUT A MORE RECENT HISTORICAL
         EVENT.

          :02, IN FULL TO :14, THEN FADE UNDER TEXT: [TT -- :34]  
<P>
 "THE CRUCIBLE" CENTERS AROUND A FARMER, JOHN PROCTOR 
         [PORTRAYED IN THE FILM BY DANIEL DAY-LEWIS], AND A 
         TEENAGE GIRL, ABIGAIL WILLIAMS [PLAYED BY WINONA RYDER].
         THE TWO COMMIT ADULTERY, AND ABIGAIL JOINS A GROUP OF 
         OTHER GIRLS IN A FOREST RITUAL, TRYING TO KILL MR. 
         PROCTOR'S WIFE.  THEIR TOWN OF SALEM, MASSACHUSETTS IS 
         CONSUMED WITH THE CRIES OF WITCHCRAFT, MASS HYSTERIA, 
         AND ULTIMATELY, EXECUTIONS.  ALTHOUGH MR. MILLER'S PLAY 
         -- AND HIS SCREENPLAY FOR THE NEW MOVIE -- IS FICTIONAL,
         NEARLY 20 IN THE TOWN NEAR BOSTON WERE ACTUALLY HANGED 
         FOR ALLEGED "WITCHCRAFT" IN THE 1600S. 
<P>
          "THE CRUCIBLE" AND ITS PLAYWRIGHT HAVE ATTRACTED THE 
         INTEREST OF MANY STUDENTS AND SCHOLARS.  AMONG THE 
         LEADING EXPERTS ON MILLER'S WORK IS MATTHEW ROUDANE' 
         [RU-DAH-NAY], PROFESSOR OF ENGLISH AT GEORGIA STATE 
         UNIVERSITY IN ATLANTA.  AUTHOR OF 10 BOOKS ON AMERICAN 
         THEATER -- INCLUDING TWO ABOUT ARTHUR MILLER -- 
         PROFESSOR ROUDANE' HAS MET WITH MR. MILLER ON SEVERAL 
         OCCASIONS, INCLUDING THE PLAYWRIGHT'S 80TH BIRTHDAY 
         CELEBRATION IN 1995.  MR. ROUDANE', WHO WAS IN 
         WASHINGTON, D.C. RECENTLY TO JOIN THOUSANDS OF OTHER 
         SCHOLARS AT THE ANNUAL MODERN LANGUAGE ASSOCIATION 
         CONFERENCE, LIKES THE NEW FILM VERSION. 
<P>
          "IT CAUGHT THE SPIRIT OF THE PLAY.  THERE IS SOMETHING, 
         AT ONCE, BEAUTIFUL ABOUT THE LANDSCAPE, BUT ALSO VERY 
         OPPRESSIVE ABOUT THE SET AND SETTING OF THE PLAY.  THE 
         FILM VERSION TAKES SOME LIBERTIES -- AT LEAST WITH THE 
         PERFORMANCES THAT I'VE SEEN -- MAYBE [BECAUSE OF] 
         LIMITATIONS OF SETS AND BUDGETS.  IT'S BEEN FAIRLY 
         CONFINED VISUALLY TO A STAGE AND WITH CHANGES TO THE 
         ROOMS, THINGS LIKE THAT.  YOU FEEL THE PRISON-LIKE SET. 
         THE FILM REPLICATES THAT WELL.  BUT ALSO, BECAUSE IT'S 
         FILM, YOU'RE ALSO OUT AT THE OCEAN'S EDGE AND YOU'RE IN 
         THE FOREST.  THE FILM ALLOWS YOU A LOT MORE LEEWAY, AND 
         OF COURSE, [THERE ARE] THE CLOSEUPS.  YOU CAN REALLY SEE
         THAT."   
<P>
 ON ITS SURFACE, "THE CRUCIBLE" AS A PLAY AND MOVIE IS AN
         EXCITING DRAMA ABOUT EARLY AMERICAN HISTORY.  BUT 
         PROFESSOR ROUDANE' NOTES THAT EVEN AT ITS DEBUT IN NEW 
         YORK CITY, THEATER AUDIENCES SAW THAT ARTHUR MILLER'S 
         PLAY HAD AN UNDERLYING MESSAGE.  
<P>
          "THREE YEARS LATER, IN 1956, MILLER WOULD BE BROUGHT 
         BEFORE THE HOUSE UN-AMERICAN ACTIVITIES COMMITTEE.  
         SUDDENLY HE WAS GOING THROUGH HIS OWN 'CRUCIBLE' IF YOU 
         WILL.  THERE WAS THAT KIND OF POLITICAL HYSTERIA WHICH 
         WAS BREWING AS HE WAS WRITING 'THE CRUCIBLE.'  [IT'S] 
         ART IMITATING LIFE, LIFE IMITATING ART.  SUDDENLY 'THE 
         CRUCIBLE' BECAME A HAUNTING METAPHOR FOR A KIND OF MASS 
         HYSTERIA, A POLITICAL OPPORTUNISM.  IT BECAME A METAPHOR
         FOR THOSE WHO ARE LOOKING OUT FOR THEMSELVES AND 
         FORGETTING ABOUT THE 'CAPITAL T': TRUTH."
<P>
 THE HOUSE UN-AMERICAN ACTIVITIES COMMITTEE WAS SET UP BY
         UNITED STATES SENATOR JOSEPH MCCARTHY, WHO USED THE 
         GROUP'S HEARINGS TO ACCUSE VARIOUS ARTISTS, OFFICIALS 
         AND OTHERS OF BEING, OR SYMPATHIZING WITH, COMMUNISTS.  
         THE ACCUSATIONS ROSE TO A HYSTERICAL LEVEL -- RESEMBLING
         THE STYLE OF THE SALEM WITCH TRIALS.  WHEN THE 
         ACCUSATIONS  WERE FOUND TO BE UNSUBSTANTIATED, JOE 
         MCCARTHY'S STATUS, LIKE THOSE OF THE EARLIER 
         WITCHHUNTERS, DECLINED.  A VICTIM OF MCCARTHY'S 
         HEARINGS, ARTHUR MILLER WAS INDICTED, BUT LATER CLEARED 
         OF ALL CHARGES.  AND AS MATTHEW ROUDANE' NOTES, LIKE THE
         HERO OF THE FICTIONAL "CRUCIBLE," PLAYWRIGHT MILLER 
         REFUSED TO GO ALONG WITH THE HYSTERIA OF THE TIME.
<P>
          "HE REFUSED TO NAME NAMES THOUGH.  HE, LIKE JOHN 
         PROCTOR, TOOK THE MORAL STAND AND SAID 'NO, IN THUNDER.'
         THIS WAS AT A TIME WHEN THE CONSERVATIVE AMBIENCE IN THE
         COUNTRY [WAS SUCH THAT] PEOPLE'S CAREERS WERE RUINED IN 
         AN INSTANT.  SO TO REFUSE TO NAME NAMES WAS BOTH AN 
         ETHICALLY RIGHT THING TO DO, BUT AT THE SAME TIME, AN 
         INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT THING TO DO."             
<P>
 IN ADDITION TO "THE CRUCIBLE," ARTHUR MILLER HAS WRITTEN
         OTHER PLAYS ABOUT SOCIAL CONFLICT, INCLUDING MOST 
         RECENTLY, "BROKEN GLASS," ABOUT THE NAZI HOLOCAUST, AND 
         THE 1949 "DEATH OF A SALESMAN," ABOUT WILLY LOMAN, WHO 
         HAS LOST THE KNACK OF SELLING HIMSELF AND THE PRODUCTS 
         HE REPRESENTS.  "SALESMAN" EARNED MILLER A PULITZER 
         PRIZE, AND HIS ENTIRE BODY OF WORK HAS LED MANY SCHOLARS
         -- INCLUDING PROFESSOR ROUDANE' -- TO CONSIDER HIM 
         AMERICA'S GREATEST LIVING PLAYWRIGHT. 
<P>
          "HE EXPLORES THE PUBLIC ISSUES OF A NATION AS REFLECTED 
         THROUGH THE PRIVATE ANXIETIES OF ["THE CRUCIBLE'S"] 
         'ABIGAIL' OR OF THE CITIZENS.  THERE'S A WONDERFUL 
         DIALECTIC IN MILLER'S THEATER OF THE PUBLIC AND THE 
         PRIVATE.  YOU CAN'T SEPARATE THE TWO.  WHEN YOU SEE 
         'DEATH OF A SALESMAN' OR 'THE CRUCIBLE,' OR 'BROKEN 
         GLASS,' THERE'S SOMETHING THAT'S AT ONCE, DEEPLY PUBLIC,
         BUT THERE'S ALSO SOMETHING DEEPLY PRIVATE AND PERSONAL 
         -- USUALLY IN MILLER'S WORKS, CONNECTED WITH GUILT, SIN,
         SHAME OR SOME PRIVATE BETRAYAL."
<P>
 [OPT] BUT ALTHOUGH MANY SCHOLARS RECOGNIZE ARTHUR 
         MILLER'S WRITING ACHIEVEMENTS, MATTHEW ROUDANE' NOTES 
         THAT MANY AMERICANS DON'T APPRECIATE THE PLAYWRIGHT AS 
         MUCH AS NON-AMERICANS.  PROFESSOR ROUDANE' SAYS THE 
         PLAYS "DEATH OF A SALESMAN" AND "THE CRUCIBLE" SEEM TO 
         BE EVEN MORE POPULAR OUTSIDE MILLER'S NATIVE COUNTRY.  
<P>
          "THERE HAS NEVER BEEN A TIME SINCE 1949 WHEN 'DEATH OF A
         SALESMAN' PREMIERED, WHEN THAT PLAY HAS NOT BEEN 
         PERFORMED PROFESSIONALLY SOMEWHERE IN THE WORLD EVERY 
         DAY.  'THE CRUCIBLE,' HAS BEEN TRANSLATED INTO NUMEROUS 
         LANGUAGES AND, AS MILLER ONCE TOLD ME, IT'S HIS 
         BEST-SELLING PAPERBACK VERSION OF ALL OF HIS PLAYS.  
         THAT SURPRISED ME, I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT 'SALESMAN' WOULD
         BE IT."  [END OPT]
<P>
 [OPT]  MR. ROUDANE' POINTS OUT THAT ARTHUR MILLER'S 
         COMPLEX TALE OF THE PITFALLS OF CAPITALISM AND 
         MATERIALISM AS PORTRAYED IN "DEATH OF A SALESMAN" SEEM 
         TO STRIKE A SPECIAL CHORD WITH AUDIENCES IN CHINA AND 
         THE FORMER SOVIET REPUBLICS.
<P>
          "WHEN THE 'SALESMAN' PLAYED IN BEIJING, CHINA, THE 
         CHINESE AUDIENCES WERE TRANSFIXED, EVEN THOUGH THE ART 
         OF SALESMANSHIP AS WE KNOW IT IN AMERICA, WAS SIMPLY AT 
         THAT TIME IN 1983, NOT PART OF THEIR CULTURAL 
         VOCABULARY.  YET CHINESE WOMEN WOULD COME UP TO MILLER 
         AFTER PERFORMANCES WEEPING, SAYING, 'THAT'S MY FAMILY.' 
         'SALESMAN' HAS PLAYED BEFORE ARCTIC VILLAGERS WHO 
         COULDN'T EVEN UNDERSTAND THE LANGUAGE AND WOULD COME 
         BACK TIME AND TIME AGAIN TO SEE IT.  HIS THEATER HAS 
         BEEN STAGED IN ARGENTINA, ISRAEL AND IS VERY POPULAR IN 
         WHAT USED TO BE THE SOVIET UNION."  [END OPT]
<P>
 PROFESSOR ROUDANE' SAYS MOVIE AND THEATER AUDIENCES COME
         AWAY FROM WATCHING MILLER'S WORKS WITH THE REALIZATION 
         THAT MOST EVERYONE, REGARDLESS OF CULTURE OR AGE, WANT 
         TO LEAVE AN IMPACT ON THE WORLD.  
<P>
          "HIS KEY CHARACTERS WANT TO LEAVE THEIR THUMBPRINTS ON 
         THE WORLD.  PROCTOR SAYS AT THE END OF THE FILM ["THE 
         CRUCIBLE"], 'YOU TOOK MY SOUL; AT LEAST LET ME KEEP MY 
         NAME.'  WILLY LOMAN [IN "SALESMAN"] SCREAMS BACK TO 
         BIFF, HIS SON, 'I AM NOT A DIME A DOZEN.  I'M WILLY 
         LOMAN.'  THESE ARE FLAWED CHARACTERS WHOSE INSECURITIES 
         FORCE THEM TO REDEFINE THEMSELVES IN WAYS I THINK REALLY
         WE ALL CAN RELATE TO.  IT'S THAT IMPULSE TO LEAVE ONE'S 
         THUMBPRINT ON THE WORLD."
<P>
 GEORGIA STATE UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR MATTHEW ROUDANE', A 
         LEADING SCHOLAR ON THE WORKS OF PLAYWRIGHT ARTHUR 
         MILLER.  PROFESSOR ROUDANE' SAYS THE NEW FILM BASED ON 
         MR. MILLER'S "THE CRUCIBLE" MAY DRAW WIDER INTEREST IN 
         THE CLASSIC 1953 PLAY, AS WELL AS HIS OTHER WORKS.

 <B><BLOCKQUOTE>IN THE 1960'S, NEW YORK'S THEATERS WERE FILLED WITH MANY 
NEW AND SUCCESSFUL MUSICALS.  SONGS FROM THOSE HIT SHOWS WERE 
RECENTLY (12-11) RECALLED AT A LIVELY CONCERT IN NEW YORK.  VOA'S
MARTIN BUSH REPORTS.    
</B></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
 THE VETERAN CONDUCTOR MAURICE LEVINE HAS BEEN THE WRITING 
AND DIRECTING AN ENTERTAINING SERIES OF PROGRAMS ABOUT THE 
BROADWAY MUSICAL FOR 27 YEARS.
<P>
 <P>
 "WE'RE IN THE SONG BUSINESS.  WE ENDEAVOR TO CATCH IN SONG THE 
ESSENCE OF A PARTICULAR DRAMATIC MOMENT.  NO SCENERY, NO 
COSTUMES, JUST YOUR IMAGINATION.  TO PARAPHRASE MR. SHAKESPEARE: 
IN THE WORLD OF 'LYRICS AND LYRICISTS,' 'THE SONG NOT THE PLAY IS
THE THING.'
<P>
 TEN MUSICALS OF THE 1960'S, EACH BASED ON A NOVEL OR A 
SHORT STORY, WERE THE FOCUS OF THIS PROGRAM.   ONE OF THE 
DECADE'S HUGE SUCCESSES WAS "CAMELOT," BASED ON T-H WHITE'S NOVEL
ABOUT ENGLAND'S MYTHICAL 12TH CENTURY RULER, KING ARTHUR.  THE 
SCORE OF "CAMELOT" WAS BY FREDERICK LOEWE, THE LYRICS BY THE LATE
ALAN J. LERNER,   ///BEGIN OPT///  WHO APPEARED ON FILM.
<P>
 <P>
 "BECAUSE CONTEMPORARY LIFE SEEMS INCONGRUOUS FOR A DRAMATIC 
THEATER, I USUALLY FIND MYSELF EITHER WRITING LONG AGO OR FAR 
AWAY OR BOTH.  I SUPPOSE I'M MORE INTERESTED IN THE DREAMS OF MAN
WHICH ARE ETERNAL THAN THE TEMPORARY PERVISIONS OF THOSE DREAMS 
THAT WE CALL REALITY."   ///END OPT///
<P>
 MUSICAL "CAMELOT."  ESTABLISH 30 SECONDS, THEN FADE OUT.
<P>
 THE NARRATOR OF THE EVENING, THE ACTOR WERNER KLEMPERER,  
SAID THE BROADWAY MUSICAL THEATER OF THE 1960'S WAS LARGELY A 
PLACE OF ESCAPE FROM THE TEMPER OF THE TIME.  
<P>
 <P>
 "THAT OUTSIDE WORLD WAS GOING THROUGH THE MOST TURBULENT DECADE 
OF THE CENTURY.  IT WAS A DECADE OF ASSASSINATIONS, COMMUNES, 
FLOWER CHILDREN, HIPPIES, THE SHOOTING AT KENT STATE UNIVERSITY, 
THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT, AND THE DIVISIVE VIETNAM WAR.  WAS ANY
OF THIS REFLECTED IN THE BROADWAY MUSICAL THEATER OF THE 1960'S? 
WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE MUSICAL "HAIR" IN 1968 -- WHICH BROUGHT
THE REBELIOUS YOUTH CULTURE ONTO THE MUSICAL STAGE -- THE ANSWER 
TO THAT QUESTION IS NO.  WAS THE BROADWAY MUSICAL THEATER IN SOME
WAY NEGLIGENT OR INSENSITIVE?   I DON'T THINK SO.  HISTORICALLY 
THE BROADWAY BOOK MUSICAL, BY ITS VERY NATURE HAS NOT BEEN A 
VEHICLE FOR TOPICAL COMMENT AND PROTEST." 
<P>
 SOME THEATER HISTORIANS SAY THE SO-CALLED BRITISH 
"INVASION" OF THE BROADWAY STAGE BEGAN IN 1963, WHEN A MUSICAL 
BASED ON CHARLES DICKENS' VICTORIAN NOVEL "OLIVER TWIST" ARRIVED 
IN NEW YORK AFTER A LONG RUN IN LONDON.  LIONEL BART WROTE THE 
SCORE, THE LYRICS AND THE LIBRETTO, GIVING THE ILL-FATED HEROINE 
THIS POIGNANT SONG.
<P>
 ME."  ESTABLISH 13 SECONDS, THEN FADE UNDER AND OUT.
<P>
 THE BIGGEST HIT OF THE DECADE OF THE 1960'S WAS "FIDDLER 
ON THE ROOF," A MUSICAL ADAPTATION OF A SHORT STORY BY SHOLOM 
ALEICHEM.  IT IS ABOUT A MIDDLE-AGED JEWISH MILKMAN AND HIS 
BELOVED FAMILY LIVING IN A TINY TOWN IN EASTERN EUROPE.  
<P>
 NARRATOR WERNER KLEMPERER SAYS THE SHOW'S APPEAL IS UNIVERSAL, 
THAT SOMEWHERE ON THIS EARTH -- 33 YEARS AFTER ITS BROADWAY DEBUT
IN 1964 -- AT LEAST ONE PRODUCTION OF "FIDDLER ON THE ROOF" IS 
STILL RUNNING.  THE MUSIC WAS WRITTEN BY JERRY BOCK, THE LYRICS 
BY SHELDON HARNICK.
<P>
 <P>
 "AS SHELDON HARNICK ONCE SAID OF HIMSELF: 'BY THE TIME OF 
"FIDDLER ON THE ROOF," 'I KNEW WHO I WAS, WHO SHOLOM ALEICHEM'S 
PEOPLE WERE, AND I KNEW WHERE OUR LIVES TOUCHED.'" 
<P>
 MATCHMAKER"   ESTABLISH 23 SECONDS, THEN FADE UNDER AND HOLD.
<P>
 THE RETROSPECTIVE LOOK AT THE BROADWAY MUSICALS OF THE 
1960'S TOOK PLACE AT NEW YORK'S 92ND STREET YOUNG MEN'S AND 
WOMEN'S HEBREW ASSOCIATION AS PART OF ITS "LYRICS AND LYRICISTS" 
SERIES.  THE SERIES DIRECTOR MAURICE LEVINE CREDITS THE SUCCESS 
OF THE HIT MUSICALS OF THE 1960'S TO THE COMPOSERS, LYRICISTS AND
LIBRETTISTS OF THE ERA AS WELL AS TO THE "CREATIVE LITERARY 
PEOPLE" WHOSE WORKS THEY ADAPTED.    (SIGNED)

          THE TREND TOWARD CUSTOMIZED CLOTHING,
<P>
          NEW WAYS TO SPEND VACATIONS,
<P>
          AND, THE GENDER GAP IN CHESS.

                               JEANS
<P>
 SEVERAL AMERICAN COMPANIES ARE CHANGING THE WAY THEY 
         MARKET THEIR PRODUCTS.  THE CHRISTIAN SCIENCE MONITOR 
         REPORTS THAT "IN AN ERA WHEN SHOPPERS INCREASINGLY WANT 
         MORE FOR LESS, A SMALL BUT GROWING NUMBER OF RETAILERS 
         ARE ROLLING OUT EVERYTHING FROM JEANS TO COSMETICS MADE 
         TO CONSUMERS' SPECIFICATIONS.  AND THEY'RE DOING IT 
         ALMOST AS QUICKLY AND COST-EFFECTIVELY AS THEY CAN 
         MASS-PRODUCE."
<P>
          THE NEWSPAPER SAYS THAT ONE OF THE PIONEERS IS LEVI 
         STRAUSS, THE CALIFORNIA-BASED MANUFACTURER OF JEANS.  
         ACCORDING TO THE COMPANY, IT IS SOMETIMES DIFFICULT TO 
         FIND PANTS THAT FIT CORRECTLY.  IN FACT, LEVI'S 
         ESTIMATES THAT "WOMEN TRY ON 15 TO 20 PAIRS OF JEANS 
         BEFORE BUYING A NEW PAIR."  NOW, THERE IS AN OPTION.  A 
         SALES CLERK TAKES FOUR BASIC MEASUREMENTS AND ENTERS THE
         INFORMATION INTO A COMPUTER.   THE DEVICE COMES UP WITH 
         "A PROTOTYPE JEAN FOR THE CUSTOMER TO TRY ON."  AFTER 
         SELECTING THE COLOR, AN ORDER IS ELECTRONICALLY SENT TO 
         THE LEVI FACTORY.   WITHIN TWO WEEKS THE FINISHED 
         PRODUCT IS SENT TO THE CUSTOMER.  LEVIS INTENDS TO OFFER
         THE SERVICE TO MEN TOO.
<P>
          CUSTOM FOOT, A CONNECTICUT COMPANY OFFERS MEN AND WOMEN 
         150 DIFFERENT SHOE STYLES,INCLUDING SANDALS, LOAFERS, 
         WINGTIPS AND PUMPS.  A COMPUTER-SCANNING DEVICE 
         "GENERATES 13 MEASUREMENTS FOR EACH FOOT."  THE DATA IS 
         TRANSMITTED TO FACTORIES IN ITALY AND CUSTOM SHOES ARE 
         RETURNED THREE TO FOUR WEEKS LATER.
<P>
          IT DOESN'T TAKE MUCH TIME FOR GARDEN BOTANIKA, A BATH 
         AND BODY PRODUCTS STORE BASED IN REDMOND, WASHINGTON, TO
         PREPARE CUSTOMIZED ORDERS FOR ITS CUSTOMERS.  GARDEN 
         BOTANIKA SELLS PERFUMES, SHAMPOOS, AND BATH GELS.  
         SHOPPERS "CAN SELECT FROM MORE THAN 50 DIFFERENT SCENTS 
         -- EVERYTHING FROM MANGO TO MUSK AND HAVE THEIR PRODUCTS
         MADE ON THE SPOT."  SHELLEY LYNCH, THE MARKETING 
         MANAGER, SAYS THAT "IT'S NOT SOMETHING PEOPLE ALWAYS 
         HAVE A LOT OF TIME FOR."
<P>
          (///OPT///) B. JOSEPH PINE, PRESIDENT OF STRATEGIC 
         HORIZONS, A CLEVELAND, OHIO, CONSULTING FIRM, TOLD THE 
         MONITOR THAT CUSTOMIZED PRODUCTS OFFER A NUMBER OF 
         ADVANTAGES INCLUDING THE FACT THAT BECAUSE PRODUCTS ARE 
         SOLD BEFORE THEY ARE MADE, INVENTORY COSTS ARE 
         DRAMATICALLY REDUCED.  MR. PINE BELIEVES THAT AS 
         CONSUMERS GET USED "TO GETTING EXACTLY WHAT THEY WANT 
         FROM CERTAIN RETAILERS...THEY WILL STOP PUTTING UP WITH 
         STANDARDIZED OFF-THE-RACK GOODS FROM OTHER COMPANIES."

                             VACATIONS
<P>
 FOR MANY AMERICANS, TAKING A VACATION MEANS THAT THEY 
         HAVE TIME TO TAKE IT EASY AND RELAX.  BUT, REPORTS THE 
         CHICAGO TRIBUNE, THE CONCEPT OF TAKING A HOLIDAY MAY BE 
         CHANGING.  THE NEWSPAPER SAYS THAT "TO A GROWING NUMBER 
         OF PEOPLE, A VACATION IS A CHANCE TO STIMULATE, NOT 
         DISCONNECT THE BRAIN.  FOR EXAMPLE, JUDITH STEIN, A 
         RETIRED HIGH SCHOOL TEACHER, TOLD THE NEWSPAPER THAT THE
         PERFECT VACATION "IS LIKE THE ONE SHE TOOK IN NOVEMBER, 
         WHEN SHE AND A DOZEN OR SO OTHER PEOPLE TOURED GREECE 
         WITH A UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO SCHOLAR WHO ASSIGNED BOOKS 
         (AND) GAVE LECTURES ON MYCENAEAN MIGRATION AND LED 
         DISCUSSION GROUPS."  MS. STEIN SAYS THAT "GETTING A TAN 
         IS JUST NOT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IN MY LIFE."
<P>
          DUNCAN BEARDSLEY OF STANFORD UNIVERSITY'S TRAVEL/STUDY 
         PROGRAM, SAYS THAT "AFTER YOU HAVE GONE OUT ON THE BEACH
         AND DONE NOTHING, YOU REALIZE THERE IS MORE TO DO WITH 
         YOUR VACATION."  STANFORD, WHICH IS LOCATED IN 
         CALIFORNIA, NOW OFFERS MORE THAN 40 ANNUAL SCHOLARLY 
         EXCURSIONS.
<P>
          SHAWN FLAHERTY, OF THE TRAVEL INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION OF 
         AMERICA, ATTRIBUTES THE RAPID GROWTH OF EDUCATIONAL 
         HOLIDAYS TO A COLLEGE-EDUCATED POPULATION THAT -- IN HIS
         WORDS -- "WANT TO LEARN SOMETHING WHEN THEY TRAVEL."
<P>
          (///OPT///) SOME VACATIONERS ENROLL IN AN ELDERHOSTEL.  
         THESE ARE FACILITIES WHERE OLDER AMERICANS ENROLL IN 
         COLLEGE COURSES AND OTHER RESIDENTIAL LEARNING 
         EXPERIENCES.  ACCORDING TO CADY GOLDFIELD, AN OFFICIAL 
         WITH THE BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS-BASED GROUP, ELDERHOSTEL 
         MEMBERSHIP "HAS INCREASED FROM ABOUT 20,000 IN 1980 TO 
         APPROXIMATELY 350,000 LAST YEAR. (///END OPT///)

                               CHESS
<P>
 THE NEW YORK TIMES NOTES THAT WHILE THE GAME OF CHESS 
         HAS BECOME MORE POPULAR IN RECENT YEARS, ITS RANKS ARE 
         GROWING -- BUT WITH FEW WOMEN.  FOR EXAMPLE, THE 
         MANHATTAN CHESS CLUB HAS 225 MEMBERS -- 213 OF THEM ARE 
         MEN.  A FEW MONTHS AGO THE CLUB SENT SPECIAL INVITATIONS
         TO 60 WOMEN TO ATTEND AN EVENT.  ONLY SIX SHOWED UP.
<P>
          THE NEWSPAPER SAYS THAT "FOR CLUB OFFICIALS, IT WAS A 
         DISAPPOINTING BUT NOT SURPRISING TURNOUT."  NINA KRAMER,
         A WRITER AND BOARD MEMBER OF THE MANHATTAN CLUB, SAYS 
         THAT SHE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND THE GENDER GAP, SAYING THAT 
         SHE THINKS THAT "IN THIS DAY AND AGE, IT WOULD BE 
         SOMETHING WOMEN ARE INCREASINGLY ATTRACTED TO."
<P>
          STEVE IMMITT IS TOURNAMENT DIRECTOR OF THE MARSHALL 
         CHESS CLUB, ANOTHER NEW YORK CHESS ORGANIZATION.  MR. 
         IMMITT SAYS THAT "THE RULE OF THUMB IS, IF YOU'RE 
         RUNNING AN UNDER-13 TOURNAMENT, IT'S HALF AND HALF, BOYS
         AND GIRLS.  BY JUNIOR HIGH, THERE'S A TREMENDOUS 
         FALLOFF, AND THE ONLY GIRLS LEFT ARE ONES WHO ARE VERY 
         GOOD.  WHY?," HE ADDS: "THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION."
<P>
          SUSAN POLGER IS A CHAMPION CHESS PLAYER FROM HUNGARY WHO
         NOW LIVES IN THE UNITED STATES.  SHE TOLD THE TIMES THAT
         "IT'S NOT THAT THE MEN WERE PESSIMISTIC OR AGAINST US.  
         THEY JUST BELIEVED IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE.  THEY THOUGHT WE 
         WERE NUTS."  
<P>
          GARY KASPAROV, THE WORLD CHAMPION, SAYS THAT "WITHOUT 
         GOING INTO THE MAJOR DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE SEXES, WE 
         FIRST HAVE TO REGARD THE TRADITIONS.  WE ARE ONLY 
         TALKING ABOUT 25 TO 30 YEARS OF WOMEN PLAYING CHESS 
         ACTIVELY, VERSUS 2,000 YEARS FOR MEN."

         HARVESTS IN 1996, BUT THE SMALLEST PLANTINGS OF WINTER 
         WHEAT IN 20 YEARS...FARM ANALYSTS CONTINUE TO ASSESS THE
         DAMAGE FROM A WEEK OF MASSIVE FLOODING IN CALIFORNIA AND
         SEVERAL OTHER WESTERN STATES...THE U-S AGRICULTURE 
         SECRETARY ANNOUNCES A NEW PLAN TO HELP BOLSTER SAGGING 
         U-S DAIRY PRICES...WHILE A MEDICAL GROUP URGES INCREASED
         MILK CONSUMPTION TO COMBAT A SERIOUS BONE DISEASE.  
         VOA'S ROB SIVAK HAS DETAILS IN THIS WEEK'S EDITION OF 
         THE U-S AGRICULTURAL ROUNDUP:
</B></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
 AMERICAN FARMERS SOWED JUST UNDER 20 MILLION HECTARES OF
         WINTER WHEAT LAST FALL, THE SMALLEST TOTAL SINCE 1978.  
         ACCORDING TO THE DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE'S ANNUAL CROP
         PRODUCTION REPORT, ISSUED FRIDAY MORNING, THE SMALLER 
         WHEAT PLANTINGS SUGGEST CONTINUED TIGHT SUPPLIES OF U-S 
         WHEAT FOR AT LEAST ANOTHER YEAR. BUT THE NEW REPORT SAYS
         LAST YEAR'S MAIZE AND SOYBEAN CROPS WERE PRETTY GOOD. 
         THE U-S MAIZE HARVEST WAS UP 24 PERCENT FROM LAST YEAR'S
         DISMAL CROP, AND IS THE THIRD LARGEST MAIZE HARVEST IN 
         U-S HISTORY. THE SOYBEAN HARVEST WAS UP 9 PERCENT FROM 
         THE PREVIOUS YEAR AND WEIGHED IN AS THE SECOND BIGGEST 
         CROP ON RECORD.  BUT U-S-D-A AND PRIVATE ANALYSTS SAY 
         THAT BOTH CROPS WILL BARELY SATISFY THE BURGEONING 
         DEMAND AT HOME AND ABROAD FOR U-S GRAINS AND OILSEEDS.
<P>
                              *  *  *
<P>
          FLOOD WATERS ARE RECEDING IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA AND 
         SEVERAL OTHER PACIFIC NORTHWESTERN U-S STATES A WEEK 
         AFTER TORRENTIAL RAINS AND MELTING SNOWS FORCED RIVERS 
         AND RESERVOIRS TO SPILL THEIR BANKS. THE FLOODING CAUSED
         MASSIVE PROPERTY DAMAGE -- WELL OVER A BILLION DOLLARS 
         BY EARLY ESTIMATES. BUT EXPERTS SAY IT IS STILL TOO SOON
         TO ACCURATELY ASSESS THE IMPACT ON THE REGION'S FARMING,
         ESPECIALLY IN CALIFORNIA -- WHERE FOOD PRODUCTION IS A 
         22 BILLION DOLLAR A YEAR INDUSTRY.
<P>
          THE FLOODING IN CALIFORNIA CLEARLY TOOK A HEAVY TOLL ON 
         FARM HOMES, BARNS AND EQUIPMENT. SUPPLIES OF FEED, 
         FERTILIZER AND AGRICULTURAL CHEMICALS WERE DESTROYED, 
         AND DAIRY FARMERS IN PARTICULAR WERE HARD HIT.  MANY 
         LOST COWS IN THE FLOOD, AND MOST HAVE SCRAMBLED TO FIND 
         NEIGHBORS WITH UNDAMAGED FACILITIES TO CONTINUE MILKING 
         THEIR SURVIVING COWS. CALIFORNIA IS THE NATION'S LARGEST
         DAIRY PRODUCER, AND INDUSTRY EXPERTS ESTIMATE THE FLOOD 
         HAS DISRUPTED OPERATIONS FOR ABOUT FIVE PERCENT OF THE 
         STATE'S DAIRY FARMERS.
<P>
          MOST OF CALIFORNIA'S VEGETABLE, RICE AND COTTON FIELDS 
         ARE UNPLANTED AT THIS TIME OF YEAR, AND THE STATE'S 
         FAMOUS VINEYARDS AND FRUIT ORCHARDS -- WHOSE CROPS ARE 
         DORMANT FOR THE WINTER -- CAN TOLERATE A LIMITED 
         SOAKING. BUT THERE ARE SERIOUS CONCERNS THAT THE FLOODS 
         MIGHT HAVE WASHED AWAY 60 THOUSAND HECTARES OF THE 
         STATE'S RECENTLY-PLANTED WINTER WHEAT. AND ACCORDING TO 
         CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU SPOKESMAN DAVID KRANZ, THERE ARE 
         WORRIES, TOO, ABOUT WHEN FARMERS MIGHT BE ABLE TO PLANT 
         NEW CROPS IN THEIR FLOOD SOAKED FIELDS:
<P>
 <P>
          "IF YOU ARE A FARMER THAT JUST HAS OPEN GROUND, THIS IS 
         THE TIME OF YEAR WHERE YOU WOULD BE GETTING YOUR GROUND 
         READY TO PLANT. AND SOME OF THE FARMERS HAVE ALREADY 
         INVESTED THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS IN PREPARING THEIR SOIL 
         AND DOING THOSE PRE-PLANTING ACTIVITIES. EVEN IF THE 
         CROP HAD NOT BEEN PLANTED, THEY ARE NOW GOING TO HAVE TO
         GO BACK, IF THEIR LAND WAS FLOODED AND DAMAGED, THEY ARE
         NOW GOING TO HAVE TO GO BACK AND DO THAT ALL OVER AGAIN,
         AND ABSORB THE COST OF DOING IT."
<P>
 AND MR. KRANZ SAYS CALIFORNIA FARMERS ARE ALSO GOING TO 
         BE RACING THE CALENDAR:
<P>
 <P>
          "WITH THE VAST AMOUNTS OF WATER THAT SOME OF THESE 
         FIELDS ARE HOLDING RIGHT NOW, IT IS NOT CERTAIN WHETHER 
         THE FARMERS WILL BE ABLE TO GET IN AND DO THEIR 
         PREPARATION WORK AND BE ABLE TO PLANT THEIR CROPS IN A 
         TIMELY MANNER. THAT IS WHY WE SAY THAT THE CROP DAMAGE 
         THAT WE CAN SEE AT THIS POINT IS RELATIVELY MINOR, 
         BECAUSE OF THE TIMING, BUT THERE ARE ALL SORTS OF LONG 
         TERM RAMIFICATIONS THAT AT THIS TIME WE CAN'T PREDICT, 
         THAT MAY DISRUPT THE CYCLES LATER ON IN THE SPRING."
<P>
 MR. FRANZ SAYS FARMERS WHO DO NOT HAVE SPECIAL 
         GOVERNMENT-SUBSIDIZED FLOOD INSURANCE MAY FACE HUGE 
         LOSSES. FLOOD DAMAGE IS NOT COVERED BY STANDARD CROP 
         INSURANCE POLICIES, AND THE U-S CONGRESS IN RECENT YEARS
         HAS RESISTED OFFERING FARMERS BOTH INSURANCE SUBSIDIES 
         AND DISASTER AID. THE CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU SPOKESMAN 
         BELIEVES TOTAL LOSSES FROM THIS WINTER'S FLOODING WILL 
         LIKELY TOP THE 650 MILLION-DOLLARS-WORTH OF DAMAGE 
         CAUSED BY FLOODS IN MARCH OF 1995.
<P>
                              *  *  *

          U-S SECRETARY OF AGRICULTURE DAN GLICKMAN, SPEAKING 
         TUESDAY AT THE ANNUAL MEETING OF THE AMERICAN FARM 
         BUREAU FEDERATION IN NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE, ANNOUNCED A 
         NEW FEDERAL EFFORT TO HELP STRUGGLING U-S DAIRY FARMERS,
         WHO MR. GLICKMAN SAID ARE FACING A TOUGH SITUATION: 
<P>
 <P>
          "OUR DAIRY FARMERS CANNOT AFFORD TO MILK, FEED, OR EVEN 
         SELL THEIR COWS."
<P>
 WHOLESALE MILK AND CHEESE PRICES IN THE U-S HAVE PLUNGED
         25 PERCENT IN RECENT MONTHS -- AFTER SOARING EARLIER 
         LAST YEAR. AND DAIRY PRODUCERS HAVE ENDURED BOTH RISING 
         FEED COSTS AND LOWER CATTLE PRICES WHEN THEY'VE TRIED TO
         SELL OFF PART OF THEIR HERDS. THE FINANCIAL SQUEEZE HAS 
         FORCED HUNDREDS OF SMALL- AND MEDIUM-SIZED U-S DAIRY 
         OPERATIONS OUT OF BUSINESS IN THE PAST FEW MONTHS, AND 
         LED TO CALLS BY THE DAIRY INDUSTRY FOR SOME TYPE OF 
         GOVERNMENT INTERVENTION.
<P>
          IN HIS ADDRESS TO THE FARM BUREAU MEETING, SECRETARY 
         GLICKMAN OUTLINED THE GOVERNMENT'S NEW FOUR-POINT DAIRY 
         ASSISTANCE PLAN. MR. GLICKMAN SAID THE PLAN WOULD 
         UTILIZE AN EXISTING FEDERAL SUBSIDY SCHEME KNOWN AS THE 
         DAIRY EXPORT INCENTIVES PROGRAM, OR "DEIP," TO PROMOTE 
         EXPANDED GLOBAL SALES OF BUTTERFAT AND OTHER U-S DAIRY 
         PRODUCTS:
<P>
 <P>
          "WE HAVE ALSO STEPPED UP OUR DEIP SALES ACTIVITY FOR 
         NON-FAT DRY MILK, AND BEGINNING THIS MONTH WE WILL START
         COLLECTING DATA FOR A NATIONAL SURVEY OF CHEDDAR CHEESE 
         PRICES RECEIVED BY MANUFACTURING PLANTS. THIS IS IN 
         RESPONSE TO CONCERNS ABOUT THE ACCURACY OF REPORTED 
         PRICES. WE WILL ALSO PURCHASE ABOUT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS
         WORTH OF CHEESE FOR USE IN DOMESTIC FOOD ASSISTANCE 
         PROGRAMS AND THAT IS IN ADDITION TO ACCELERATED SCHOOL 
         LUNCH PURCHASES ALREADY UNDERWAY."
<P>
 AND MR. GLICKMAN SAID THE U-S-D-A WILL ALSO WORK WITH 
         PRIVATE CHARITIES AND FOOD RELIEF ORGANIZATIONS TO 
         INCREASE THE FLOW OF DAIRY PRODUCTS IN THEIR 
         INTERNATIONAL FOOD ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS.
<P>
          THE AGRICULTURE SECRETARY TOLD THE FARM BUREAU DELEGATES
         IN NASHVILLE OF HIS FRUSTRATION IN DEALING WITH THE 
         PROBLEMS IN THE U-S DAIRY INDUSTRY. HE NOTED THAT THE 
         1996 FARM BILL PREVENTS HIM FROM RAISING FEDERAL SUPPORT
         PRICES FOR MILK, WHICH ARE BEING PHASED OUT, AND HE 
         WARNED THAT TINKERING WITH THE GOVERNMENT'S COMPLEX 
         SYSTEM OF REGIONAL MARKETING SCHEMES COULD HURT MILK 
         SALES NATIONALLY:
<P>
 <P>
          "WHY? BECAUSE IT IS A REGIONAL PROGRAM. WHAT IS GOOD FOR
         THE UPPER MIDWEST MAY NOT BE GOOD FOR CALIFORNIA, OR MAY
         BE VERY HARMFUL FOR THE NORTHEAST OR IT IS INCONSISTENT 
         WITH WHAT THE SOUTHEAST HAS TO DO. SINCE DAIRY IS A 
         PERISHABLE TYPE COMMODITY IT IS DIFFERENT FROM THE 
         OTHERS -- CORN AND SOYBEANS AND WHEAT AND COTTON AND THE
         OTHERS. SO IT HAS BEEN MOST DIFFICULT TO GET CONSENSUS 
         ON NATIONAL DAIRY POLICY."
<P>
 MR. GLICKMAN SAID THE BEST HOPE FOR HELPING DAIRY 
         FARMERS IS THROUGH SALES-GENERATED INCREASES IN INCOME, 
         AND NOT THROUGH HEAVY-HANDED FEDERAL MANIPULATION OF THE
         DAIRY MARKET.
<P>
                              *  *  *
<P>
          U-S DAIRY FARMERS MIGHT HAVE BEEN ENCOURAGED TO HEAR 
         THIS WEEK'S CALL BY A GROUP OF MEDICAL EXPERTS INVOLVED 
         IN FIGHTING OSTEOPOROSIS AND OTHER DEGENERATIVE BONE 
         DISEASES. AT A WASHINGTON NEWS CONFERENCE, 
         REPRESENTATIVES OF THE NATIONAL OSTEOPOROSIS FOUNDATION 
         URGED ALL ADULT AMERICANS TO START DRINKING MORE MILK --
         AT LEAST THREE GLASSES PER DAY -- IN ORDER TO BOOST 
         THEIR DAILY CALCIUM INTAKE TO AT LEAST 1000 MILLIGRAMS 
         AND WARD OFF THE CRIPPLING EFFECTS OF OSTEOPOROSIS. 
         FOUNDATION SPOKESMAN KURT GRETZER:
<P>
 <P>
          "IT SEEMS LIKE A BOWL OF BREAKFAST IN THE MORNING WITH 
         MILK IS ABOUT AS FAR AS PEOPLE GET TODAY. WHETHER THEY 
         ARE WORRIED ABOUT CALORIES OR FAT, OR ARE NOT AWARE OF 
         THE FACT THAT THEIR BODIES STILL DO NEED CALCIUM, MOST 
         AMERICANS SIMPLY ARE  N O T  DRINKING THEIR MILK."
<P>
 MR. GRETZER CITED RECENT SURVEYS SHOWING THAT AVERAGE 
         DAILY MILK CONSUMPTION IN THE UNITED STATES IS 
         DECLINING, AND IS NOW TOO LOW TO PROVIDE THE RECOMMENDED
         LEVELS OF CALCIUM AND VITAMIN D. HE SAID RESEARCH HAS 
         SHOWN THAT BOTH NUTRIENTS CAN PLAY IMPORTANT ROLES NOT 
         ONLY IN PREVENTING OSTEOPOROSIS BUT ALSO ORAL BONE LOSS 
         AND COLON CANCER. SOME HEALTH EXPERTS HAVE QUESTIONED, 
         HOWEVER, WHETHER COW'S MILK IS THE BEST GENERAL SOURCE 
         FOR THESE NUTRIENTS, GIVEN THE ALLERGIC AND IMMUNE 
         SYSTEM PROBLEMS MANY PEOPLE EXPERIENCE AFTER DRINKING 
         MILK.
<P>
          THE OSTEOPOROSIS FOUNDATION'S NEW HEALTH CAMPAIGN -- 
         WHICH URGES AMERICANS TO "DRINK THREE" (GLASSES OF MILK,
         THAT IS) -- WILL BUILD ON THE DAIRY INDUSTRY'S OWN 
         STEPPED-UP CAMPAIGN TO PROMOTE MILK DRINKING. DURING THE
         PAST TWO YEARS, THE CAMPAIGN HAS ENLISTED NATIONAL 
         CELEBRITIES TO APPEAR IN POSTERS AND TELEVISION SPOTS 
         WITH PROMINENT MILK "MOUSTACHES" ON THEIR UPPER LIPS.

 I HAD NO PROBLEM IN THE SUMMER BUT IN THE WINTER, THE DAYS ARE SO

SHE NOT ONLY BOUGHT HER OWN LIGHT BOX FOR USE AT HOME, SHE 
STARTED HER OWN BUSINESS PROVIDING LIGHT BOXES FOR PEOPLE 
DIAGNOSED WITH SEASONAL DEPRESSION.  SHE SAYS HER PRODUCTS ARE 
FAVORED BY BOTH PHYSICIANS AND INSURANCE COMPANIES.
<P>
 <P>
 <P>
 <P>
 <P>
 <P>
 <P>
 <P>
 FOR THIS TYPE OF DEPRESSION, FOR WINTER DEPRESSION, LIGHT THERAPY
IS THE PREFERRED METHOD OF TREATMENT, ACCORDING TO THE PHYSICIANS
DIAGNOSTIC HANDBOOK.  SO INSURANCE COMPANIES LOOK AT THAT AND 
THEY THINK WE ARE GIVING THEM THE BEST TREATMENT AND ALSO IT IS 
LESS EXPENSIVE FOR THE INSURANCE COMPANIES BECAUSE YOU CAN 
PURCHASE A LIGHT BOX FOR A LOT LESS THAN EVEN SIX MONTHS OF 
ANTI-DEPRESSANT (DRUGS).  (OPT)  FOR OTHER TYPES OF DEPRESSION, 
THE STUDIES DO NOT SUPPORT THE USE OF LIGHT THERAPY BUT FOR 
SEASONAL DEPRESSION IT WORKS MAYBE 80 TO 90 PERCENT OF THE TIME, 
DEPENDING ON WHICH STUDY YOU LOOK AT. (END OPT)
<P>
 <P>
 <P>
 PART OF SHERRIE BAXTER'S MOTIVATION IN STARTING HER OWN 
COMPANY, ENVIRO-MED, WAS TO HELP OTHERS TO ESCAPE THE DARK MOOD 
SLUMPS THAT SHE HAD SUFFERED.
<P>
 <P>
 <P>
 <P>
 <P>
 <P>
 ELEVEN YEARS AGO WHEN I WENT THROUGH THE STUDY, THIS MADE A HUGE 
DIFFERENCE FOR ME.  I SAY IT BASICALLY GAVE FOUR TO FIVE MONTHS 
OUT OF EACH YEAR BACK TO ME.  IT WAS VERY SIGNIFICANT.  THERE 
WERE A COUPLE OF COMPANIES THEN SELLING LIGHTS FOR 600 DOLLARS OR
MORE. I THOUGHT THAT WAS TOO MUCH.  SO, I LOOKED INTO IT AND 
THOUGHT THAT SINCE IT HELPED ME SO MUCH I WOULD TRY TO MAKE A 
PRODUCT THAT WAS A LITTLE MORE AFFORDABLE AND TRY TO USE THE BEST
TECHNOLOGY OUT THERE TO MATCH THE RESEARCH. 
<P>
 <P>
 <P>
 THE ENVIRO-MED COMPANY PRODUCTS, MARKETED AS BIOLIGHT BOXES,
SELL FOR AS LITTLE AS 299 DOLLARS AND PROVIDE 10 THOUSAND LUX, 
WHICH IS 20 TIMES GREATER THAN THE BRIGHTNESS OF ORDINARY INDOOR
<P>
 LIGHTING.  EXPOSURE TO THIS LIGHT FOR ABOUT 45 MINUTES A DAY 
HELPS ADJUST THE BODY'S CIRCADIAN RHYTHM, WHICH IS BASICALLY THE 
BODY'S INTERNAL CLOCK.  
<P>
 <P>
 <P>
      (OPT) SHERRIE BAXTER SAYS HER COMPANY'S PRODUCTS ARE ALL 
GUARANTEED AND CAN BE RETURNED IF THEY FAIL TO ALLEVIATE A 
CUSTOMER'S DEPRESSION.  BUT SHE SAYS THE REAL JOY IN THIS 
BUSINESS COMES FROM THE MANY CASES WHERE THE BIOLIGHT HAS MADE A 
DIFFERENCE. 
<P>
 <P>
 <P>
 <P>
 <P>
 <P>
 PEOPLE PAY THEIR 299 FOR THE LIGHT AND IF IT DOES NOT WORK, OF 
COURSE WE KNOW WITH OUR GUARANTEE AND WE GET LESS THAN SEVEN 
PERCENT OF THEM BACK.  BUT WHEN PEOPLE HAVE PAID FOR IT AND IT IS
WORKING FOR THEM, THEORETICALLY, WE WOULD NEVER HAVE TO HEAR FROM
THEM AGAIN, BUT WHEN THEY GO TO THE TROUBLE TO CALL BACK AND 
SAY,"SHERRIE, THIS HAS CHANGED MY LIFE, I JUST WANT TO THANK 
YOU!"  THAT IS ONE OF THE REASONS I AM DOING THIS. (END OPT)
<P>
 <P>
 <P>
 SHERRIE BAXTER SAYS HER BUSINESS HAS TRIPLED WITHIN THE LAST
YEAR AND THAT SHE EXPECTS IT TO GROW EVEN MORE AS DOCTORS, 
INSURANCE COMPANIES AND VICTIMS OF SEASONAL DEPRESSION BECOME 
MORE AWARE OF THE LIGHT THERAPY SOLUTION.  (SIGNED).

         MONITORING AN EXPONENTIAL INCREASE IN BIZARRE 
         DEFORMITIES AMONG AMPHIBIANS IN THE STATE'S WETLANDS. 
<P>
          WHILE MINNESOTA'S NEIGHBOR, WISCONSIN, HAS NOT SEEN 
         NEARLY AS MANY SUCH CASES, ZOOLOGIST GARY CASPER OF THE 
         MILWAUKEE PUBLIC MUSEUM IS CONCERNED:
<P>
 <P>
          "WHEN YOU FIND A FROG WITH FIVE OR SEVEN LEGS IT'S KIND 
         OF HARD TO NOT NOTICE IT..... THE NUMBER OF DEFORMITIES 
         WE'VE SEEN REPORTED IN THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS IS 
         UNPRECEDENTED.  NEVER BEFORE HAS THERE BEEN SUCH A SURGE
         IN DEFORMED FROGS, AND IT SUGGESTS THAT THERE IS  SOME 
         ENVIRONMENTAL FACTOR CAUSING IT."
<P>
 GARY CASPER HEADS THE GREAT LAKES DECLINING AMPHIBIANS 
         WORKING GROUP -- PART OF A GLOBAL TASK FORCE ON 
         DECLINING AMPHIBIAN POPULATIONS.  THE GROUP HAS BEEN 
         KEEPING TABS ON (MONITORING) WHAT IS NOW CLEARLY A 
         WORLDWIDE SHRINKAGE IN THE NUMBERS OF FROGS, TOADS AND 
         SIMILAR SPECIES:
<P>
 <P>
          "THAT'S BECOME VERY CLEAR IN THE LAST TEN YEARS.  FOR A 
         WHILE MANY PEOPLE THOUGHT THAT THE DECLINES MIGHT JUST 
         BE ANOMALIES OR NATURAL CYCLES.  BUT SINCE SURVEY WORK 
         HAS BEGUN AND PEOPLE HAVE STARTED COMPARING DATA FROM 
         TODAY WITH HISTORIC DATA THAT WAS AVAILABLE, IT'S BECOME
         VERY CLEAR THAT THERE DEFINITELY IS A DECLINE GOING ON 
         THAT IS BEYOND ANY SORT OF NORMAL, NATURAL FLUCTUATION."
<P>
 WHETHER MINNESOTA'S FROG DEFORMITIES ARE PART OF THE 
         GLOBAL TREND OR A SEPARATE PROBLEM IS OPEN TO DEBATE.  
         BUT THE FACT THAT THERE IS A PROBLEM BECAME STRIKINGLY 
         CLEAR IN AUGUST OF 1995.  IT WAS THEN THAT A GROUP OF 
         SCHOOLCHILDREN ON A NATURE HIKE IN THE SOUTHERN PART OF 
         THE STATE FOUND A DEFORMED FROG -- THEN ANOTHER, AND 
         ANOTHER, AND STILL OTHERS.  THEIR TEACHER CALLED JUDY 
         HELGEN:
<P>
 <P>
          "....AND MY STUDENT ASSISTANT WENT DOWN THAT DAY AND 
         COLLECTED (SAMPLES) AND CAME BACK AND SAID 'YOU'VE GOT 
         TO GET DOWN THERE.'  HE SAID 30 TO 40 PERCENT OF THE 
         FROGS HE'D COLLECTED WERE ABNORMAL. AND WE WENT BACK THE
         FOLLOWING FRIDAY AND COLLECTED A WHOLE LOT OF DEFORMED 
         FROGS.  THAT'S WHEN I TOOK THE PHOTOGRAPHS THAT WE'VE 
         BEEN ABLE TO CIRCULATE.  AND THE CONCERN JUST KIND OF 
         STEPPED UP EVERY TIME WE GOT ANOTHER REPORT."
<P>
 SOON THE CALLS STARTED COMING FROM ALL OVER THE STATE.  
         BIOLOGIST JUDY HELGEN SAYS FOLLOWUP INVESTIGATIONS 
         SHOWED DEFORMITY RATES AS HIGH AS 40 TO 60 PERCENT OR 
         GREATER IN SOME HABITATS, WHERE ORDINARILY ONE MIGHT 
         EXPECT ONE PERCENT OR LESS OF THE FROGS TO SHOW 
         ABNORMALITIES.  DOCTOR HELGEN SAYS SOME OF THESE LIMB 
         ABNORMALITIES WERE TRULY HORRENDOUS:
<P>
 CUT FIVE  --  HELGEN: (:46)
<P>
          "I THINK IT PROBABLY LOOKS A LITTLE BIT LIKE SOME OF THE
         THALIDOMIDE LIMBS IN HUMANS IN THAT THEY WERE SHORTENED 
         AND CONTORTED.  OFTEN THE FOOT ISN'T COMPLETELY 
         DEVELOPED, FOR INSTANCE. WE'VE SEEN VERY THIN, 
         EMACIATED, PARALYZED LEGS, OR ONE OF THEM BEING VERY 
         THIN AND EMACIATED.  WE'VE SEEN SOME WITH A MISSING EYE 
         AND SOME WITH THE TADPOLE TAIL STILL BEING PRESENT WHEN 
         YOU THINK IT SHOULD ALREADY HAVE BEEN RESORBED.  AS THEY
         GO THROUGH METAMORPHOSIS THEY RESORB THE MATERIAL IN THE
         TAIL.  AND PRESUMABLY THAT'S USED TO BUILD THE YOUNG 
         ADULT FROG." 
<P>
 IN SOME TRULY BIZARRE CASES, A MISSING EYE WAS ACTUALLY 
         FOUND -- IN THE ANIMAL'S THROAT.  THE MILWAUKEE PUBLIC 
         MUSEUM'S GARY CASPER:
<P>
 <P>
          "OBVIOUSLY A FROG WITH ONLY ONE LEG OR WITH EIGHT LEGS 
         OR WITH AN EYE IN ITS THROAT IS PROBABLY NOT GOING TO 
         LIVE TOO LONG.  IT'S NOT TERRIBLY WELL ADAPTED." 
<P>
 AND THAT, SAYS JUDY HELGEN, IS THE BIG CONCERN: DEFORMED
         FROGS DON'T SURVIVE TO REPRODUCE:
<P>
 <P>
          "THERE HAS TO BE EXTRAORDINARILY HIGH MORTALITY BECAUSE 
         WE'VE SEEN VERY FEW SECOND YEAR FROGS GOING BACK TO 
         AREAS.  IT HAS BEEN A BIG FIND TO FIND A SECOND YEAR 
         FROG.  IT'S PROBABLY LIKE THREE OR FOUR THAT WE HAVE 
         FOUND IN ALL THE HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF FROGS THAT 
         WE'VE LOOKED AT.  SO THE POINT THERE IS THAT ALL THOSE 
         FROGS THAT ARE ABNORMAL ARE NOT MAKING IT."
<P>
 WHILE MINNESOTA SO FAR IS CLEARLY THE "HOT SPOT" FOR 
         FROG DEFORMITIES, THEY'RE SHOWING UP TO A LESSER DEGREE 
         IN OTHER U.S. STATES, INCLUDING WISCONSIN, IOWA, 
         MISSOURI, SOUTH DAKOTA AND VERMONT, AS WELL AS IN THE 
         CANADIAN PROVINCE OF QUEBEC.  BEYOND NORTH AMERICA, 
         THERE HAVE BEEN REPORTS OF FROG DEFORMITIES IN DENMARK, 
         FRANCE, GREAT BRITAIN AND AUSTRALIA.
<P>
          /// OPT /// GARY CASPER SEES IT AS ANOTHER DEPRESSING 
         EXAMPLE OF THE GLOBAL DECLINE IN BIODIVERSITY -- 
         SOMETHING AFFECTING MORE THAN FROGS:
<P>
 <P>
          "ONE OF THE THINGS THAT KIND OF SCARES PEOPLE IS THE 
         PREDICTION YEARS AGO THAT THE BIODIVERSITY CRISIS IS 
         GOING TO COME TO A HEAD IN SUCH A MANNER THAT A 
         THRESHHOLD WILL BE REACHED, AND SENSITIVE INDICATOR 
         SPECIES WILL SUDDENLY START TO DECLINE, BASED ON A 
         COMBINATION OF STRESSORS IN THEIR ENVIRONMENT THAT HAVE 
         SUDDENLY PASSED THE THRESHOLD THAT THE POPULATION CAN NO
         LONGER WITHSTAND.
<P>
          "IT'S KIND OF SCARY TO THINK THAT THE FROGS MIGHT BE 
         DOING JUST THAT.  THE WHOLE BIODIVERSITY CRISIS IS KIND 
         OF INTERTWINED WITH THIS BECAUSE THE HABITAT LOSSES 
         WORLDWIDE ARE AFFECTING MANY, MANY PLANTS AND ANIMALS, 
         NOT JUST FROGS. BUT FROGS ARE A LITTLE MORE SENSITIVE TO
         ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGES THAN OTHER ANIMALS AND PLANTS 
         BECAUSE OF THEIR COMPLEX LIFE CYCLES. /// END OPT ///  
<P>
          STOP ABRUPTLY WHERE INDICATED
<P>
 IN THE EARLY 1960'S RACHEL CARSON'S BOOK, "SILENT 
         SPRING," DESCRIBED HOW PESTICIDES WERE DECIMATING BIRD 
         POPULATIONS. ARE WE NOW HEADED FOR "A SILENCE OF THE 
         FROGS?"  (STOP FROG TAPE -- NARRATOR PAUSE)  IT'S A 
         FRIGHTENING QUESTION, BECAUSE SCIENTISTS CONSIDER FROGS 
         TO BE AN "INDICATOR" SPECIES -- THE WETLANDS VERSION OF 
         THE CANARY IN THE COAL MINE-- SENSITIVE DETECTORS OF 
         POISONS THAT MIGHT SOON AFFECT LARGER SPECIES, INCLUDING
         OURSELVES.  KATHY CONVERSE IS A WILDLIFE DISEASE 
         SPECIALIST AT THE NATIONAL WILDLIFE HEALTH CENTER IN 
         MADISON, WISCONSIN:
<P>
 <P>
          "THEY HAVE VERY THIN SKIN AND THE FACT THAT THEY HAVE 
         VERY THIN SKIN AND THE FACT THAT THEY ABSORB WATER AND 
         NUTRIENTS DIRECTLY THROUGH THEIR SKIN, THEY HAVE A 
         LITTLE BIT LESS PROTECTION.  IF THERE WAS SOMETHING 
         PRESENT IN THE WATER OR MUD, THEY DON'T HAVE AS MUCH 
         PROTECTION AS IF THEY HAD HAIR OR FUR OR FEATHERS TO 
         PROTECT THEM."
<P>
 AND THERE'S YET ANOTHER FACTOR THAT PUTS FROGS ON THE 
         FRONT LINES IN ANY ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE.  GARY CASPER:
<P>
 <P>
          "AMPHIBIANS ARE KIND OF UNIQUE IN THAT NO MATER WHAT 
         BIOME THEY'RE IN, THEY'RE ALMOST ALWAYS AN INDICATOR 
         SPECIES BECAUSE OF THEIR COMPLEX LIFE CYCLES WHERE THEY 
         REQUIRE MULTIPLE HABITATS DURING THE COURSE OF THEIR 
         AMPHIBIOUS LIFE CYCLE FROM EGG TO TADPOLE TO ADULT FROG.
         BECAUSE THEY UNDERGO THESE DRASTIC PHYSICAL CHANGES 
         WHERE THEY CHANGE THEIR BODY FORMS AND METHOD OF 
         RESPIRATION, THAT'S FAIRLY UNIQUE TOO AND MAKES THEM 
         VERY SUSCEPTIBLE TO ENVIRONMENTAL STRESSORS DURING THAT 
         TIME OF CHANGE."
<P>
 SO WHAT IS CAUSING THESE DEFORMITIES IN MINNESOTA'S FROG
         POPULATION?  LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL ACTIVIST TRACY FREDIN 
         (PRON: FRUH-DEEN) SAYS IT SHOULD BE OBVIOUS:
<P>
 <P>
          "I GET A LOT OF CALLS FROM FOLKS SAYING: 'GOSH, I GUESS 
         WE KIND OF KNOW WHAT IT IS, IT MUST BE THE CHEMICALS.'  
         WE HAVE BEEN USING A LOT OF PESTICIDES AND CHEMICALS 
         OVER THE MANY YEARS AND FROM WHAT I  GET FROM WHEN I 
         TALK TO PEOPLE IS THAT WHILE SCIENTISTS MAY HAVE A HARD 
         TIME PROVING EXACTLY WHAT'S CAUSING IT, IT DOESN'T TAKE 
         A ROCKET SCIENTIST TO LOOK AT ALL THE THINGS THAT WE'RE 
         PUTTING INTO THE ENVIRONMENT AND THINKING THAT WE'RE 
         HAVING SOME KIND OF NEGATIVE IMPACT."
<P>
 KATHY CONVERSE OF THE NATIONAL WILDLIFE HEALTH CENTER 
         LAB IN MADISON SAYS CHEMICAL CONTAMINANTS ARE AMONG A 
         NUMBER OF SUSPECT FACTORS BEING INVESTIGATED:
<P>
 <P>
          "WE KNOW THAT WHATEVER IS OCCURRING.... WE DON'T FEEL 
         THAT IT'S CAUSED BY TRAUMA.  AT THIS POINT WE HAVE NOT 
         BEEN ABLE TO DOCUMENT THAT IT'S BEEN CAUSED BY A 
         BACTERIUM OR A VIRUS OR A PARASITE. IT DOES APPEAR THAT 
         WHATEVER IS HAPPENING IS HAPPENING AT THE POINT OF 
         TADPOLE DEVELOPMENT WHEN THE FRONT LEGS AND THE BACK 
         LEGS AND THE EYE AT THE POINT AT WHICH THEY ARE ALL 
         DEVELOPING.  SOMETHING IS OCCURRING TO DISRUPT THE 
         NORMAL PATTERN OF DEVELOPMENT."
<P>
 ONE HYPOTHESIS DISCUSSED AT A SCIENTIFIC MEETING LAST 
         SEPTEMBER IN DULUTH, MINNESOTA, INVOLVED A SPECIES OF 
         FLUKE -- A PARASITIC FLATWORM THAT INFECTS TADPOLES.  
         GARY CASPER:
<P>
 <P>
          "THERE IS A TREMATODE THAT WILL EMBED ITSELF IN A LARVAL
         AMPHIBIAN -- A TADPOLE -- AND CAN INTERFERE WITH THE 
         LIMB BUD DEVELOPMENT.  LITTLE CYSTS WILL GET INTO THE 
         LIMB BUD.  THAT MECHANISM HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED IN THE 
         LAB NOW AND IT CERTAINLY CAN CAUSE AT LEAST SOME OF THE 
         DEFORMITIES WE'RE SEEING.  IT IS PROBABLY HAPPENING IN 
         WILD POPULATIONS. BUT THE FEELING AT THE MEETING WAS 
         THAT THIS CAN'T EXPLAIN ALL THE DEFORMITIES WE'RE SEEING
         OR EVEN ALL THE TYPES OF DEFORMITIES WE'RE SEEING."
<P>
 THE MINNESOTA POLLUTION CONTROL AGENCY'S JUDY HELGEN 
         SAYS THERE ARE TWO THINGS WRONG WITH THE FLUKE 
         HYPOTHESIS:  ONE IS THAT ONLY SOME OF THE FROGS WITH LEG
         DEFORMITIES HAVE FLATWORM CYSTS BLOCKING THEIR LIMB 
         BUDS. SO THERE MUST BE ANOTHER FACTOR INVOLVED IN THE 
         REMAINING FROGS.  ALSO, AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE FLUKE'S
         LIFE CYCLE IS LIVED OUT IN THE SNAIL, IN WHICH IT GROWS 
         TO A CERTAIN SIZE BEFORE IT EMERGES TO INFECT THE 
         TADPOLE.  SO HAVE THEY SEEN MORE THAN THE USUAL NUMBER 
         OF SNAILS LATELY?  DOCTOR HELGEN SAYS NO:
<P>
 <P>
          "WE DO WETLANDS BIOLOGICAL MONITORING, AND SO WE'RE VERY
         AWARE OF THE INVERTEBRATES IN THE WETLANDS, AND WE NEVER
         SAW ANYTHING EXTRAORDINARY.  IN FACT, IN A COUPLE OF THE
         SITES IT WAS HARD TO FIND SNAILS, SO WE DON'T THINK 
         THERE IS A BIG BLOOM OF SNAILS AND THEREFORE A LOT OF 
         INFECTION.
<P>
          "THEY (THE SNAIL AND ITS TADPOLE HOSTS) HAVE BEEN 
         TOGETHER FOR MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF YEARS.  SO WHY IN 
         THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS WOULD YOU HAVE THEM BECOME 
         DETRIMENTAL TO SIX SPECIES OF FROGS IS HARD TO EXPLAIN. 
         AND THERE IS SOME VERY BASIC RESEARCH THAT NEEDS TO BE 
         DONE." 
<P>
 AMONG THE STUDIES BEING DONE ARE THOSE INVOLVING 
         LABORATORY EXPOSURE OF TADPOLES IN VARIOUS STAGES OF 
         DEVELOPMENT TO THE PARASITE. ANOTHER POSSIBLE 
         EXPLANATION FOR FROG DEFORMITIES DISCUSSED AT THE 
         SEPTEMBER MEETING WAS INCREASED UV-B EXPOSURE -- A 
         FACTOR OFTEN CITED IN THE GLOBAL DECLINE OF AMPHIBIAN 
         POPULATIONS.  INTENSITY OF UV-B -- THE ULTRAVIOLET RAYS 
         FROM THE SUN THAT CAUSE SUNBURN AND SKIN CANCER -- MAY 
         BE INCREASING DUE TO THINNING OF THE EARTH'S PROTECTIVE 
         OZONE LAYER. KATHY CONVERSE SAYS IT'S DOUBTFUL THAT UV-B
         ALONE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DEFORMITIES:
<P>
 <P>
          "THE CONSENSUS THAT CAME FROM MOST OF THE PEOPLE THERE 
         WAS THAT THEY FELT THAT IF IT WAS A UV FACTOR OR AN ACID
         RAIN FACTOR, WE SHOULD BE SEEING (DEFORMED) FROGS PRETTY
         WELL DISTRIBUTED THROUGHOUT MOST OF THE NORTHERN STATES 
         -- SOUTHERN CANADA AND NORTHERN UNITED STATES, FOR 
         EXAMPLE -- ALL THE WAY THROUGH NEW ENGLAND, NEW YORK, 
         WITH A BROAD SWEEP ALL THE WAY ACROSS THE COUNTRY.
<P>
          "AT THIS POINT WE DON'T SEEM TO BE SEEING THAT TYPE OF A
         DISTRIBUTION.  EVEN WITHIN MINNESOTA THERE ARE AREAS 
         WHERE THEY DON'T HAVE DEFORMED FROGS.  AND IF IT WAS UV 
         LIGHT OR ACID PRECIPITATION YOU WOULD EXPECT TO SEE (THE
         DEFORMITIES) A LITTLE BIT MORE BROADLY DISTRIBUTED." 
<P>
 SO FAR, THE RESEARCHERS HAVE LITTLE OR NO DATA ON FROG 
         DEFORMITIES IN THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE. IF ULTRAVIOLET 
         RADIATION WERE A MAJOR FACTOR, ONE WOULD EXPECT 
         DEFORMITIES TO BE GREATEST IN NUMBER WHERE THE 
         UV-BLOCKING OZONE LAYER IS THE MOST DAMAGED.  SO THE 
         RESEARCH FOCUS IS PRIMARILY ON POTENTIAL CHEMICAL 
         CULPRITS, AS JUDY HELGEN EXPLAINS:
<P>
 <P>
          "WE WOULD BE LOOKING AT ANY ORGANICS, AND IN PARTICULAR 
         PESTICIDES, HERBICIDES, INSECTICIDES, FUNGICIDES. AND 
         HEAVY METALS, TOO.  WE STILL WANT TO LOOK AT THE THOUGHT
         OF WHETHER THERE IS SOME GEOLOGICAL DIFFERENCE -- ARE 
         SOME OF THE AREAS HIGHER IN PARTICULAR METALS, AND IS 
         THEIR CHEMISTRY SUCH THAT THESE MIGHT BE MORE MOBILIZED 
         AND MORE AVAILABLE TO THE ANIMALS.  SO WE ARE DOING SOME
         MEASUREMENTS ON SEDIMENT CHEMISTRY, IN PARTICULAR 
         LOOKING FOR BOTH PESTICIDES AND METALS AVAILABILITY."
<P>
 ALL OF THE RESEARCHERS STRESSED THE POSSIBILITY OF 
         SYNERGY -- THAT ONE OR MORE FACTORS MIGHT INTERACT 
         TOGETHER TO CREATE THE PROBLEM.  ACID RAIN, FOR EXAMPLE,
         MIGHT CAUSE TOXIC MINERALS TO LEACH OUT OF ROCKS OR 
         SEDIMENTS. COMPLICATING MATTERS YET FURTHER IS THE ISSUE
         OF TIMING.  THE FACTOR -- OR FACTORS -- WOULD HAVE TO 
         HAVE BEEN PRESENT IN THE WATER AT THE PRECISE TIME IN 
         THE FROG'S DEVELOPMENT WHERE THEY WOULD CAUSE THE 
         OBSERVED DEFORMITY.  JUDY HELGEN:
<P>
 <P>
          "THE EXPOSURE TIME COULD BE FOR A DAY OR A WEEK AT A 
         CERTAIN CRITICAL DEVELOPMENT STAGE.  SO WHATEVER IT WAS 
         THAT CAUSED IT MIGHT NOT EVEN BE THERE MOST OF THE TIME 
         IT COULD BE SOMETHING THAT'S APPLIED, IT DEGRADES PRETTY
         QUICKLY, BUT IT'S DONE THE DAMAGE TO THE FROGS BECAUSE 
         THE FROGS WERE THERE IN THE WATER, THERE WAS A RAINFALL 
         AT THE RIGHT TIME, IT WASHED INTO THE WETLAND AND IT HIT
         THEM RIGHT AT THE TIME OF THE EARLY LIMB DEVELOPMENT. 
<P>
          /// OPT /// "THE THING THAT WE'RE TRYING TO GET FUNDING 
         FOR NOW IS TO HAVE ANOTHER FIELD SEASON AND THIS TIME TO

 IN THE MEANTIME, VOLUNTEERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF 
         MINNESOTA ARE HELPING RESEARCHERS KEEP TABS ON (MONITOR)
         FROG POPULATIONS -- SURVEYING THEIR SIZE AND THEIR 
         DEFORMITIES.  PART OF THIS EFFORT IS COORDINATED THROUGH
         "A THOUSAND FRIENDS OF FROGS" -- A PROJECT OF THE CENTER

          "I THINK (IT'S) THE IDEA THAT FROGS ARE A GREAT METAPHOR

         IF THIS IS HAPPENING TO FROGS -- AND IT'S PRETTY GRAPHIC
         IF YOU CAN SEE A NUMBER OF LEGS STICKING OUT OR EYES IN 
         THE WRONG PLACE OR LACK OF LEGS, IT CATCHES PEOPLE'S 
         ATTENTION.  I THINK THEY SAY THIS COULD BE HAPPENING TO 
         OUR KIDS OR US NEXT.  SO THERE HAVE BEEN GOOD SUPPORTS

 WHILE POTENTIAL HUMAN IMPACTS ARE IMPOSSIBLE TO ASSESS 
         GIVEN THE PAUCITY OF DATA SO FAR, RESEARCHERS LIKE KATHY
         CONVERSE AT THE NATIONAL WILDLIFE HEALTH CENTER ARE 
         CONCERNED ABOUT THE IMPLICATIONS FOR OUR OWN SPECIES 
         POSED BY AMPHIBIAN DEFORMITIES AND POPULATION DECLINES:
<P>

          "PERSONALLY BECAUSE I WORK WITH WILDLIFE I HAVE GREAT 
         CONCERNS WHEN ANY POPULATION ISN'T ABLE TO SURVIVE, WHEN
         WHAT THEY NEED FOR SURVIVAL ARE THE BASIC ELEMENTS THAT 
         WE NEED FOR SURVIVAL ALSO.  SO IF IT'S FACTORS SUCH AS 
         PESTICIDE APPLICATIONS, AGRICULTURAL RUNOFF, I THINK 
         THOSE ARE AREAS THAT WE NEED TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT.  IF 
         IT'S OVERALL DECREASE IN WATER QUALITY AND QUANTITY, 
         OVERALL CHANGE IN AIR TEMPERATURE OR WATER TEMPERATURE, 
         I THINK THAT WE JUST HAVE A SPECIES INCREDIBLY SENSITIVE
         TO THOSE FACTORS.  AND I CERTAINLY WITHOUT QUESTION 
         THINK WE NEED TO TAKE IT AS A WARNING AND LOOK MORE 
         INTENSELY INTO THOSE FACTORS THAT MAY BE AFFECTING 
         AMPHIBIANS."

 <B><BLOCKQUOTE>FOR MANY WEEKS, MIDDLE EAST NEGOTIATORS HAVE BEEN SAYING
         AGREEMENT BETWEEN ISRAEL AND THE PALESTINIANS ON ISRAELI
         WITHDRAWAL FROM HEBRON IS NEAR.  THE PARTIES SAY THEY 
         HAVE A DEAL ON THE TERMS FOR PALESTINIAN RULE OF THE 
         LAST MAJOR WEST BANK CITY TO SEE ISRAELI TROOPS 
         WITHDRAW.  HOWEVER, THE PALESTINIANS HAVE BEEN HOLDING 
         OUT FOR AN ISRAELI COMMITMENT TO FURTHER WEST BANK 
         WITHDRAWALS ONCE MOST ISRAELI TROOPS ARE OUT OF HEBRON. 
         NOW ISRAEL SAYS IT WANTS TO DELAY ITS PROMISED PULLOUT 
         FROM OTHER WEST BANK AREAS FOR TWO YEARS.  PALESTINIAN 
         OFFICIALS BLASTED THE ISRAELI PROPOSAL SAYING IT 
         VIOLATED COMMITMENTS ALREADY MADE BY ISRAEL UNDER 
         PREVIOUS AGREEMENTS WITH THE PALESTINIANS.  BUT FOR 
         ISRAEL'S PRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, THE HEBRON 
         ACCORDS COULD SPELL POLITICAL DISASTER.  AS VOA'S 
         ________EXPLAINS THE ISRAELI LEADER'S NEGOTIATING STANCE
         IS SEVERELY LIMITED BY THE IDEOLOGICAL BATTLES INSIDE 
         HIS OWN RULING COALITION.
</B></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
 THE ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER IS BESIEGED BY PRESSURE BOTH 
         INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE JEWISH STATE.  THE UNITED STATES 
         AND THE BROADER INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY WANT ISRAEL TO 
         IMPLEMENT THE AGREEMENTS THAT WERE SIGNED IN WASHINGTON 
         IN SEPTEMBER 1995, INCLUDING THE REDEPLOYMENT FROM 
         HEBRON.  BUT ACCORDING TO BERNARD REICH OF GEORGE 
         WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY, MUCH STRONGER PRESSURE COMES FROM
         INSIDE ISRAEL.
<P>
 <P>
          "[BEGIN OPT] CLEARLY, THERE ARE THOSE WHO BELIEVE AS 
         INTERNATIONAL PRESSURE SUGGESTS THAT ISRAEL SIMPLY OUGHT
         TO IMPLEMENT WHAT HAD BEEN AGREED TO BY THE RABIN/PERES 
         TEAM, THAT IN FACT WITHDRAWAL IS OVERDUE AND THAT IT 
         WOULD NOT BE A GOOD IDEA TO FURTHER COMPLICATE THE PEACE
         PROCESS BY SEEKING CHANGES IN THE EXISTING AGREEMENT. 
         [END OPT]  HE HAS A CABINET WHICH INCLUDES A LARGE 
         NUMBER OF MINISTERS WHO HAVE MADE CLEAR THEIR OWN VIEWS 
         THAT ISRAEL SECURITY IS THE TOP PRIORITY, THAT THE 
         AGREEMENT ON HEBRON HAD GIVEN AWAY TOO MUCH, THAT THE 
         OTHER ELEMENTS OF THE AGREEMENT ALSO SHOULD BE 
         REARRANGED SO THAT ISRAEL'S SECURITY POSITION WOULD BE 
         SUSTAINED."  
<P>
 THE EXACT DIVISION WITHIN THE KNESSET, ISRAEL'S CABINET,
         ON THE ISSUE OF HEBRON IS NOT PRECISELY CLEAR.  BUT MOST
         OBSERVERS SAY THE CABINET IS PROBABLY EVENLY DIVIDED 
         BETWEEN THOSE WHO WANT TO MOVE MORE QUICKLY ON 
         REDEPLOYMENT AND THOSE WHO WISH TO GO SLOWLY.
<P>
          PALESTINIAN LEADER YASSER ARAFAT HAS WARNED THAT THE 
         MIDDLE EAST PEACE PROCESS IS IN DANGER OF COLLAPSE AND 
         HE BLAMES THE ISRAELI GOVERNMENT.  SPEAKING IN PARIS 
         [FRIDAY, JANUARY 10], MR. ARAFAT ACCUSED PRIME MINISTER 
         NETANYAHU OF FOOT-DRAGGING IN IMPLEMENTING EXISTING 
         PEACE AGREEMENTS.
<P>
          MR. NETANYAHU WAS ELECTED ON A PLATFORM THAT SAID 
         ISRAELI SECURITY WOULD COME BEFORE PEACE, AND REJECTS 
         THE LAND FOR PEACE FORMULA WHICH UNDERPINS THE OSLO 
         AGREEMENTS -- THE BLUEPRINT FOR THE PEACE PROCESS 
         BETWEEN ISRAEL AND ITS ARAB NEIGHBORS.  CEDING 80 
         PERCENT OF HEBRON TO THE PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY WHERE 34 
         JEWISH SETTLER FAMILIES LIVE AMONG 130 THOUSAND 
         PALESTINIANS WOULD BE A MONUMENTAL STEP FOR ANY ISRAELI 
         GOVERNMENT.  BUT AS PROFESSOR REICH EXPLAINS,  MR. 
         NETANYAHU'S POSITION IN THE GOVERNMENT IS MORE SECURE 
         THAN HIS PREDECESSORS. 
<P>
 <P>
          "[MR.] NETANYAHU'S POLITICAL POSITION IS STRENGTHENED 
         BECAUSE OF THE NEW ELECTORAL LAW WHICH GIVES THE PRIME 
         MINISTER A SEPARATE MANDATE, A MANDATE FROM THE PEOPLE 
         RATHER THAN A MANDATE FROM THE PARLIAMENT ITSELF. AND IN
         THAT SENSE HE IS STRONGER THAN ANY OF HIS PREDECESSORS. 
         [BEGIN OPT] NEVERTHELESS, HE HAS TO GOVERN, AND TO 
         GOVERN HE NEEDS TO HAVE A CABINET THAT WILL SUPPORT HIS 
         POSITIONS AND THAT WILL IMPLEMENT HIS POLICIES, AND HE 
         NEEDS TO BE ABLE TO SECURE A MAJORITY WITHIN THE PARTY 
         ITSELF.  IT'S ENTIRELY POSSIBLE THAT HE COULD BE 
         WEAKENED IN TERMS OF FUTURE NO CONFIDENCE VOTES ON 
         RELATED ISSUES, AND YOU MAY WELL HAVE AN ODD COALITION 
         OF MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT THAT COULD IN FACT FORCE THE 
         GOVERNMENT OUT AND FORCE NEW ELECTIONS. [END OPT]" 
<P>
 TO KEEP HIS COALITION TOGETHER, MR. NETANYAHU WILL BE 
         UNDER PRESSURE TO BALANCE WITHDRAWAL FROM HEBRON WITH 
         CONCESSIONS TO THE RIGHT. PROFESSOR REICH SAYS THE 
         ISRAELI LEADER WILL HAVE TO ASK THE PALESTINIANS AND THE
         INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY FOR UNDERSTANDING. 
<P>
 <P>
          "WHAT I THINK HE'S GOING TO HAVE TO DO IS REACH THE 
         AGREEMENT ON REDEPLOYMENT OF ISRAELI FORCES, TRY TO GET 
         SOME CONCESSIONS FROM THE PALESTINIAN SIDE ON THE 
         TIMETABLE ISSUE AND HOPE THAT THE PALESTINIANS RECOGNIZE
         THE POLITICAL REALITY AND POLITICAL PREFERENCE ARE NOT 
         NECESSARILY THE SAME THING.  HE WILL HAVE TO GET AN 
         UNDERSTANDING FROM THE UNITED STATES ABOUT THE LIMITS OF
         HIS ABILITY TO MANEUVER AND I THINK ULTIMATELY HE'S 
         GOING TO HAVE TO CONVINCE THE MEMBERS OF HIS OWN PARTY 
         AND ALLIED PARTIES THAT THERE IS A NEED TO SUPPORT A 
         PRIME MINISTER RATHER THAN FORCE NEW ELECTIONS OR CHANGE
         THE GOVERNMENT EVEN IF THEY NEED TO MAKE SOME 
         CONCESSIONS." 
<P>
 LAST WEEK, PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU FACED A 
         NO-CONFIDENCE VOTE IN THE KNESSET OVER THE WITHDRAWAL.  
         THE MOTION WAS DEFEATED BECAUSE THE PRO-OSLO ACCORD 
         LABOR BLOC DECIDED IT WOULD RATHER SEE THE POSSIBILITY 
         OF THE HEBRON AGREEMENT BEING IMPLEMENTED THAN TOPPLE 
         THE GOVERNMENT.  ACCORDING TO SOME OBSERVERS, IF MR. 
         NETANYAHU'S POLITICAL FORTUNES BEGIN TO FADE IN THE WAKE
         OF AN AGREEMENT WITH THE PALESTINIANS, HE COULD TRY FOR 
         A NATIONAL UNITY COALITION WITH THE LABOR PARTY OF 
         FORMER PRIME MINISTER SHIMON PERES WHOM HE DEFEATED IN 
         ELECTIONS LAST JUNE.  (SIGNED)

 <B><BLOCKQUOTE>A NEW PROSECUTOR IN THE MIDWESTERN U-S STATE OF MICHIGAN 
SAYS HE IS DROPPING CRIMINAL CHARGES AGAINST SO-CALLED SUICIDE 
DOCTOR JACK KEVORKIAN.  AS V-O-A'S MICHAEL LELAND REPORTS, DR. 
KEVORKIAN HAD BEEN CHARGED IN CONNECTION WITH 10 SUICIDES HE HAS 
ATTENDED IN THE PAST YEAR.  
</B></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
 OAKLAND COUNTY PROSECUTOR DAVID GORCYCA WAS ELECTED TO 
OFFICE A FEW MONTHS AGO AFTER A CAMPAIGN IN WHICH HE ACCUSED HIS 
PREDECESSOR RICHARD THOMPSON OF WASTING TAXPAYERS' MONEY 
PROSECUTING DR. KEVORKIAN FOR VIOLATING MICHIGAN'S ASSISTED 
SUICIDE LAWS.  
<P>
 DR. KEVORKIAN'S ATTORNEY, GEOFFREY FEIGER, SAYS HE IS GLAD TO SEE
THE CHARGES DROPPED.
<P>
                         // FEIGER ACT //
<P>
          I AGREE WITH PROSECUTOR GORCYCA THAT FORMER PROSECUTOR 
         DID VIRTUALLY EVERYTHING WITH REGARD TO DR. KEVORKIAN 
         --NOT  ONLY IN HASTE BUT IN MALEVOLENCE AND IN AN 
         ATTEMPT TO CREATE HIS OWN SET OF LAWS AND MORALITY.
<P>
                           // END ACT //
<P>
 MR. THOMPSON SAYS HE IS DISAPPOINTED BUT  NOT  SURPRISED THE 
CHARGES HAVE BEEN DROPPED.  HE SAYS MR. GORCYCA'S MOVE IS BASED 
MORE ON  POLITICS THAN ON THE LAW.  DR. KEVORKIAN HAS BEEN 
BROUGHT TO TRIAL THREE TIMES FOR VIOLATING MICHIGAN'S ASSISTED 
SUICIDE LAWS, AND ACQUITTED EACH TIME.  HE STILL FACES CRIMINAL 
CHARGES FOR ASSISTING IN A SUICIDE IN A WESTERN MICHIGAN COUNTY. 
<P>
 MR. GORCYCA IS CALLING ON STATE LAWMAKERS TO PASS A CLEARLY 
ENFORCEABLE LAW CONTROLLING ASSISTED SUICIDE.   (SIGNED)

 <B><BLOCKQUOTE>BURMESE HUMAN RIGHTS LEADER AND NOBEL PEACE PRIZE WINNER
AUNG  SAN SUU KYI FRIDAY RECEIVED AN HONORARY DEGREE AT PRAGUE'S 
CHARLES  UNIVERSITY. V-O-A'S BARRY WOOD REPORTS THERE IS A 
SPECIAL BOND  BETWEEN MS. SUU KYI AND CZECH PRESIDENT VACLAV 
HAVEL SINCE HE NOMINATED HER TO RECEIVE THE NOBEL PEACE PRIZE IN 
1991. 
</B></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
 <P>
 <P>
 THE AWARD CEREMONY COINCIDED WITH THE 20TH ANNIVERSARY OF
THE SIGNING OF CHARTER 77, THE PLEA FOR HUMAN RIGHTS SIGNED BY 
HUNDREDS  OF CZECH AND SLOVAK DISSIDENTS DURING THE LATE 1970S 
AND EARLY 80S.  SINCE MS. SUU KYI IS NOT PERMITTED TO TRAVEL THE 
AWARD WAS RECEIVED BY HER HUSBAND, MICHAEL ARIS.  IN A MESSAGE 
READ BY HER HUSBAND THE  BURMESE DISSIDENT SAID SHE AND HER 
COMPATRIOTS WERE INSPIRED BY CHARTER 77 AND MR. HAVEL'S 
COURAGEOUS STAND AGAINST TOTALITARIANISM.  SHE SAID THE BURMESE 
STRUGGLE FOR DEMOCRACY WILL CONTINUE. SHE SAID  AN IDEA WHOSE 
TIME HAS COME CAN NOT BE CRUSHED. MS. SUU KYI'S  NATIONAL LEAGUE 
FOR DEMOCRACY WAS VICTORIOUS IN 1990 ELECTIONS IN BURMA, BUT THE 
RULING MILITARY GOVERNMENT REJECTED THE RESULTS.
<P>
 AT A RELATED CONFERENCE ON HUMAN RIGHTS IN BURMA, SPEAKERS CALLED
FOR TOUGHER INTERNATIONAL ACTION AGAINST THE BURMESE AUTHORITIES.
EMMA BONINO, THE EUROPEAN UNION HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSIONER, SAID 
THE WORLD COMMUNITY MUST DO MORE THAN ISSUE STATEMENTS. MS. 
BONINO OUTLINED SPECIFIC MEASURES THAT SHE HOPES THE 15 EUROPEAN 
UNION NATIONS WILL IMPLEMENT NEXT MONTH.
<P>
                          //BONINO ACT//
<P>
          IN THE NEXT MONTH THE FIRST POLITICAL STEP CAN BE TAKEN,
         THIS TIME  FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION. THE COMMISSIONERS 
         MADE THE PROPOSAL TO  WITHDRAW PREFERENTIAL TRADE 
         TREATMENT (FOR BURMA), WHICH IS NOT A  MAJOR AMOUNT OF 
         MONEY BUT IN ANY CASE IT IS 30 MILLION DOLLARS  
         (ANNUALLY). BUT APART FROM THAT IT IS THE FIRST 
         POLITICAL STEP FROM  A POLITICAL BODY. THIS PROPOSAL 
         GOES TO THE 15 MINISTERS (FROM E-U COUNTRIES) FEBRUARY 
         17TH. AND TO ADOPT IT THE APPROVAL MUST BE  UNANIMOUS. 
         ARE WE IN A POSITION, IN ONE MONTH'S TIME, TO LOBBY IN 
         EUROPEAN CAPITALS, FOR INSTANCE?
<P>
                            //END ACT//
<P>
 ANOTHER SPEAKER, CONFERENCE SPONSOR GEORGE SOROS, CALLED FOR 
FOREIGN COMPANIES TO WITHDRAW FROM BURMA AND TO AVOID 
PARTICIPATION IN LARGE INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS FAVORED BY THE 
AUTHORITIES.
<P>
 OTHER SPEAKERS LIKENED THE SITUATION IN BURMA TO OTHER REPRESSIVE
SOCIETIES.  NIGERIA, BELARUS, NORTH KOREA, CUBA AND SERBIA WERE 
MENTIONED SPECIFICALLY. 
<P>
 CZECH PRESIDENT HAVEL, RECOVERING FROM CANCER SURGERY, WAS UNABLE
TO ATTEND THE CEREMONY. BUT IN A MESSAGE TO THE CONFERENCE MR. 
HAVEL PROMISED SOLIDARITY AND STEPPED UP SUPPORT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
IN BURMA. (SIGNED)

<P>
 <B><BLOCKQUOTE>MANY AMERICAN BUSINESS LEADERS NOW BELIEVE THAT, IN 
ADDITION TO GOOD QUALITY PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, THEY MUST ALSO 
HAVE EXTENSIVE INFORMATION TO BE SUCCESSFUL.  IN NEW YORK, VOA 
CORRESPONDENT BRECK ARDERY REPORTS ON THE GROWING INTEREST IN 
WHAT IS BEING CALLED "BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE."
</B></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
 BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE HAS EXISTED IN SOME FORM EVER SINCE 
BUSINESS BEGAN.  BUT, IN RECENT YEARS, A GROWING NUMBER OF 
CONSULTANTS AND BUSINESS PROFESSORS HAVE BEEN ATTEMPTING TO 
FORMALLY DEFINE WHAT BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE IS, HOW IT IS GATHERED
AND, MOST IMPORTANT, HOW IT IS USED.
<P>
 DAVID HARKLEROAD, PRESIDENT OF THE FUTURES GROUP CONSULTING FIRM,
SAYS THE TERM "BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE" DOES  NOT  IMPLY ESPIONAGE 
OR ANY UNETHICAL BEHAVIOR.
<P>
                        // HARKLEROAD ACT //
<P>
          WE DEFINE IT SIMPLY AS ACTIONABLE INFORMATION.  THAT IS 
         INFORMATION THAT, IF I GIVE TO A DECISION MAKER, THEY 
         CAN ACTUALLY DO SOMETHING WITH IT.  A MORE FORMAL 
         DEFINITION IS UP-TO-DATE, VALIDATED INFORMATION THAT 
         COMPELS ACTION AND IS IN THE HANDS OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE 
         BOTH THE AUTHORITY AND RESPONSIBILITY TO DO SOMETHING 
         ABOUT IT.
<P>
                           // END ACT //
<P>
 INTERNAL INTELLIGENCE -- INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT IS HAPPENING 
INSIDE YOUR OWN COMPANY -- IS USUALLY EASY TO OBTAIN.  CORPORATE 
LEADERS WHO DO  NOT  KNOW WHAT IS GOING ON IN THEIR OWN COMPANIES
PROBABLY SHOULD  NOT  HAVE THEIR JOBS.  BUT MR. HARKLEROAD SAYS 
EXTERNAL INTELLIGENCE IS SOMETIMES HARDER TO GATHER AND 
INTERPRET:  INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT THE COMPETITION IS DOING, HOW 
THE MARKET IS CHANGING AND HOW A COMPANY IS PERCEIVED BY 
POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS. 
<P>
 MR. HARKLEROAD SAYS CULTURAL AND POLITICAL TRENDS CAN ALSO HAVE 
GREAT IMPLICATIONS FOR BUSINESS, ESPECIALLY, HE SAYS, FOR U-S 
COMPANIES DOING BUSINESS IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS.
<P>
                        // HARKLEROAD ACT //
<P>
          WE AS AMERICANS TEND TO BE RATHER INSULAR IN THE WAY WE 
         LOOK AT THE WORLD.  WE TEND TO THINK THE REST OF THE 
         WORLD SIMPLY WANTS TO BE AMERICANS WHEN THEY GROW UP.  I
         HAVE LIVED OVERSEAS FOR 10 YEARS AND I CAN SAY THAT IS  
         NOT  THE CASE.  IN MANY CASES, THE KNOWLEDGE THAT MOST 
         PURELY AMERICAN COMPANIES HAVE OF THEIR FOREIGN 
         COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENTS IS APPALLINGLY LOW.
<P>
                           // END ACT //
<P>
 MR. HARKLEROAD SAYS A CLASSIC EXAMPLE OF THE LACK OF BUSINESS 
INTELLIGENCE WAS THE EFFORT FOR MANY YEARS BY AMERICAN AUTO 
COMPANIES TO SELL VEHICLES IN JAPAN.  HE SAYS THE U-S FIRMS 
THOUGHT THEY COULD SELL LEFT-HAND DRIVE AUTOS THERE, EVEN THOUGH 
THE JAPANESE DRIVE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROAD.  THAT MISTAKE, 
HE SAYS, WAS  NOT  CAUSED BY A LACK OF INFORMATION BUT BY THE 
INABILITY TO ACT ON THE INFORMATION.
<P>
 CONSULTANT DAVID HARKLEROAD SAYS THAT ALTHOUGH MOST AMERICAN 
BUSINESS LEADERS NOW UNDERSTAND THE CONCEPT OF EFFECTIVE 
INTELLIGENCE, SOME INDUSTRY GROUPS ARE BETTER AT IT THAN OTHERS.
<P>
                        // HARKLEROAD ACT //
<P>
          THEY ARE USUALLY BETTER IN THE MORE COMPETITIVE 
         INDUSTRIES SUCH AS TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND AEROSPACE AND 
         THE CHEMICAL INDUSTRIES.  ALL SEEM TO RECOGNIZE THE 
         VALUE OF GOOD INTELLIGENCE ALTHOUGH THEY MAY  NOT  
         ALWAYS HAVE THE BEST CAPABILITIES.  THE PHARMACEUTICAL 
         INDUSTRY IS ANOTHER EXAMPLE IN WHICH VIRTUALLY ALL THE 
         MAJOR COMPANIES HAVE GOOD INTELLIGENCE CAPABILITIES.  
         AMONG THOSE WHO DO  NOT  HAVE GOOD CAPABILITIES IS THE 
         UTILITY INDUSTRY, PARTICULARLY IN THIS COUNTRY, THEY 
         HAVE BEEN REGULATED FOR SO LONG THAT THEY HAVE  NOT  
         REALLY SEEN THE NEED FOR CREATING THE INTELLIGENCE 
         CAPABILITY.
<P>
                            // END ACT //
<P>
 MR. HARKLEROAD SAYS THE AWARENESS OF THE NEED FOR BUSINESS 
INTELLIGENCE IS GROWING.  HE CITES THE 30 PERCENT INCREASE IN 
MEMBERSHIP IN THE SOCIETY OF INTELLIGENCE PROFESSIONALS LAST YEAR
AND THE FACT THAT MANY BUSINESS SCHOOLS ARE NOW OFFERING 
INTELLIGENCE COURSES.  IN A HIGHLY COMPETITIVE BUSINESS 
ENVIRONMENT, MR. HARKLEROAD SAYS, GOOD INTELLIGENCE CAN OFTEN BE 
THE KEY TO SUCCESS.  (SIGNED)

SAYS HE IS DROPPING CRIMINAL CHARGES AGAINST SO-CALLED SUICIDE 
DOCTOR JACK KEVORKIAN.  DR. KEVORKIAN HAD BEEN CHARGED IN 
CONNECTION WITH 10 SUICIDES HE HAS ATTENDED THIS YEAR.  MORE FROM
VOA'S MICHAEL LELAND. 
</B></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
 OAKLAND COUNTY PROSECUTOR DAVID GORCYCA WAS ELECTED TO 
OFFICE A FEW MONTHS AGO AFTER A CAMPAIGN IN WHICH HE ACCUSED HIS 
PREDECESSOR RICHARD THOMPSON OF WASTING TAXPAYERS' MONEY 
PROSECUTING DR. KEVORKIAN FOR VIOLATING MICHIGAN'S ASSISTED 
SUICIDE LAWS.  
<P>
 DR. KEVORKIAN'S ATTORNEY, GEOFFREY FEIGER, SAYS HE IS GLAD TO SEE
THE CHARGES DROPPED.
<P>
                         // FEIGER ACT //
<P>
          I AGREE WITH PROSECUTOR GORCYCA THAT FORMER PROSECUTOR 
         DID VIRTUALLY EVERYTHING WITH REGARD TO DR. KEVORKIAN 
         --NOT  ONLY IN HASTE BUT IN MALEVOLENCE AND IN AN 
         ATTEMPT TO CREATE HIS OWN SET OF LAWS AND MORALITY.
<P>
                           // END ACT //
<P>
 MR. THOMPSON SAYS HE IS DISAPPOINTED BUT  NOT  SURPRISED THE 
CHARGES HAVE BEEN DROPPED.  HE SAYS MR. GORCYCA'S MOVE IS BASED 
MORE ON  POLITICS THAN ON THE LAW.  DR. KEVORKIAN HAS BEEN 
BROUGHT TO TRIAL THREE TIMES FOR VIOLATING MICHIGAN'S ASSISTED 
SUICIDE LAWS, AND ACQUITTED EACH TIME.  HE STILL FACES CRIMINAL 
CHARGES FOR ASSISTING IN A SUICIDE IN A WESTERN MICHIGAN COUNTY. 
<P>
 MR. GORCYCA IS CALLING ON STATE LAWMAKERS TO PASS A CLEARLY 
ENFORCEABLE LAW CONTROLLING ASSISTED SUICIDE.   (SIGNED)

 <B><BLOCKQUOTE>THE TEAMS THAT WILL COMPETE IN THE U-S NATIONAL FOOTBALL 
LEAGUE'S (NFL) SUPER BOWL WILL BE DETERMINED SUNDAY IN THE 
CONFERENCE CHAMPIONSHIP GAMES.  V-O-A SPORTS EDITOR PARKE BREWER 
REPORTS.
</B></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
 THE GREEN BAY PACKERS HOST THE NATIONAL CONFERENCE TITLE 
GAME AGAINST THE CAROLINA PANTHERS.  GREEN BAY IS LED BY 
QUARTERBACK BRETT FAVRE (FARV), THE N-F-L'S MOST VALUABLE PLAYER.
THE PACKERS ARE LOOKING FOR THEIR FIRST SUPER BOWL BERTH SINCE 
1968 AGAINST A CAROLINA TEAM THAT IS IN ONLY ITS SECOND YEAR IN 
THE LEAGUE.
<P>
 CAROLINA EARNED THE RIGHT TO FACE GREEN BAY BY KNOCKING OFF THE 
REIGNING SUPER BOWL CHAMPION DALLAS COWBOYS LAST SUNDAY.
<P>
 ANOTHER SECOND YEAR EXPANSION TEAM, THE JACKSONVILLE JAGUARS, IS 
PLAYING IN THE AMERICAN CONFERENCE TITLE GAME AGAINST THE HOST 
NEW ENGLAND PATRIOTS.  THE JAGUARS BARELY MADE THE PLAYOFFS, BUT 
HAVE SCORED UPSET WINS OVER BOTH BUFFALO AND DENVER ON THE ROAD, 
TO PUT THEMSELVES ONE WIN AWAY FROM A SUPER BOWL APPEARANCE.
<P>
 NEW ENGLAND'S BRUCE ARMSTRONG SAYS HE AND HIS PATRIOT TEAMMATES 
KNOW JACKSONVILLE WILL COME IN CONFIDENT AFTER THEIR TWO ROAD 
PLAYOFF VICTORIES.
<P>
                        // ARMSTRONG ACT //
<P>
          I'M SURE THEY'RE  NOT  DOWN THERE (IN FLORIDA) SHAKING 
         IN THEIR BOOTS, THINKING THAT THEY CAN'T COME IN HERE 
         AND WIN.  SO OUR GOAL IS TO THINK THE SAME THING.  WE 
         NEED TO BEAT THIS TEAM IN ORDER TO ACHEIVE OUR GOAL, 
         WHICH TO GET TO THE SUPER BOWL.
<P>
                           // END ACT //
<P>
 THE WINNERS OF SUNDAY'S GAMES WILL PLAY IN THE SUPER BOWL 
CHAMPIONSHIP JANUARY 26TH IN NEW ORLEANS.  (SIGEND)

 <B><BLOCKQUOTE>THE BIG STOCK MARKETS IN WESTERN EUROPE FRIDAY CLOSED 
DOWN, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF FRANKFURT -- WHICH ROSE IN THE WAKE 
OF DISAPPOINTING NEWS ON THE GERMAN ECONOMY.  MORE FROM V-O-A'S 
PAUL FRANCUCH IN OUR LONDON OFFICE.
</B></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
 WHILE GERMANY'S ECONOMIC NEWS WAS DISAPPOINTING, THE NEWS 
FROM WASHINGTON WAS THE AMERICAN ECONOMY WAS GAINING STRENGTH.  
WHILE THAT'S GOOD NEWS FOR MOST PEOPLE, INVESTORS ON WALL STREET 
IN NEW YORK SEE A STRONG ECONOMY BEING ONE WHICH RAISES FEARS OF 
HIGHER INFLATION.  THAT SPARKED INVESTORS TO SELL STOCKS, AND THE
DROP MAY HAVE PROMPTED INVESTORS IN LONDON AND PARIS TO SELL AS 
WELL.
<P>
 THE "FINANCIAL TIMES" INDEX OF 100 LEADING BRITISH SHARES LOST 
JUST OVER 30 POINTS FRIDAY.  THE FRENCH "CAC 40" INDEX SHED 
21-AND-A-HALF POINTS.  SIGNS OF A CONTINUING SLUGGISH ECONOMY IN 
GERMANY, HOWEVER, SUGGESTED TO SOME INVESTORS THAT INTEREST RATES
THERE WOULD FALL.  THAT ENCOURAGING SIGN MAY HAVE PROMPTED THE 
FRANKFURT "DAX 30" INDEX TO GAIN ALMOST 41 POINTS FOR THE DAY.
<P>
 THE DOLLAR FRIDAY HIT ITS HIGHEST LEVEL IN ALMOST TWO-AND-A-HALF 
YEARS AGAINST THE MARK.  GOLD GAINED MORE THAN THREE DOLLARS AN 
OUNCE IN THE LONDON FIX, CLOSING AT 359-DOLLARS-FIVE CENTS.

 <B><BLOCKQUOTE>DOCTORS SAY RUSSIAN PRESIDENT BORIS YELTSIN, NOW 
HOSPITALIZED WITH PNEUMONIA, IS BREATHING MORE EASILY.  THE SAME,
UNFORTUNATELY, CANNOT BE SAID FOR MOST RUSSIANS.  FROM MOSCOW, 
V-O-A'S ELIZABETH ARROTT REPORTS THE CONTINUING SAGA OF MR. 
YELTSIN'S ILL HEALTH APPEARS TO BE TAKING ITS TOLL ON THE 
COUNTRY.  
</B></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
 A MOSCOW PHARMACY IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FLU SEASON -- ONE 
WOULD THINK IT TO BE A LIKELY SPOT TO FIND PEOPLE SYMPATHETIC TO 
THE AILING PRESIDENT.  
<P>
 NOT  SO.  YEVGENIE, A 46-YEAR-OLD SECURITY GUARD, IS TIRED OF 
HEARING ABOUT MR. YELTSIN AND HIS BAD HEALTH. 
<P>
         /// YEVGENIE ACT -- IN RUSSIAN, AND FADE ... ///
<P>
 "IN ANY CIVILIZED COUNTRY," SAYS YEVGENIE, "A MAN AS SICK AS 
YELTSIN WOULD QUIT."
<P>
 HIS REACTION IS QUITE TYPICAL.  FOR YEARS, RUSSIANS HAVE HAD TO 
WORRY ABOUT MR. YELTSIN'S HEALTH -- NOW ABOUT HIS LUNGS, BEFORE 
THAT HIS ABOUT HEART, AND BECAUSE OF PERSISTENT REPORTS OF HEAVY 
DRINKING, ALWAYS ABOUT HIS LIVER.
<P>
 SUCH HEALTH OBSESSIONS BY THE PUBLIC OVER THEIR POLITICAL LEADERS
ARE ALL TOO REMINISCENT OF SOVIET TIMES, COMPLAIN MUSCOVITES, 
REFERRING TO THE LATER COMMUNIST YEARS, WHEN THE KREMLIN WAS 
PERCEIVED AS BEING RUN BY A SERIES OF DODDERING -- AND IN ONE 
CASE, SENILE -- LEADERS.
<P>
 YURI, A RETIRED STATE EMPLOYEE, SAYS MR. YELTSIN SHOULD  NOT  
HAVE RISKED BEING GROUPED WITH THOSE MEN.
<P>
           /// YURI ACT -- IN RUSSIAN, AND FADE ... ///
<P>
 "HE SHOULD  NOT  HAVE RUN FOR A SECOND TERM," SAYS YURI, AS HE 
MAKES HIS WAY INTO THE PHARMACY.  YURI SAYS THE PRESIDENT, 
RE-ELECTED LAST JULY, SHOULD HAVE STAYED IN BED AND TAKEN CARE OF
HIMSELF. 
<P>
 YURI IS CONFIDENT THAT IF MR. YELTSIN WERE TO RESIGN, THERE WOULD
BE  NO  GRAB FOR POWER.  HIS PREFERENCE FOR A NEW PRESIDENT IS 
COMMUNIST GENNADY ZYUGANOV, BUT HE SAYS ANYBODY WOULD BE A BETTER
LEADER THAN MR. YELTSIN -- ANYBODY, HE SAYS, EXCEPT PRESIDENTIAL 
HOPEFUL ALEXANDER LEBED.
<P>
 GENERAL LEBED, RUSSIA'S FORMER SECURITY CHIEF, LIVES  NOT  FAR 
FROM HERE.  THE POPULAR, FIERY POLITICIAN HAS MADE THE MOST 
NOTABLE ATTEMPT TO GAIN POLITICAL ADVANTAGE IN THE WAKE OF MR. 
YELTSIN'S ILL HEALTH.  GENERAL LEBED SAYS THE LATEST ILLNESS MAY 
BE A PROBLEM FOR MR. YELTSIN, BUT IT IS A TRAGEDY FOR THE NATION.
<P>
                  /// LEBED ACT -- IN RUSSIAN ///
<P>
 GENERAL LEBED TOLD HIS SUPPORTERS FRIDAY HE PLANS ON MAKING HIS 
PARTY THE RULING PARTY.  AND, IN THE RHETORIC THAT PEOPLE LIKE 
YURI AT THE PHARMACY FIND UNCOMFORTABLE, GENERAL LEBED VOWED TO 
SHAKE-UP WHAT HE CALLS THE "MANGY COUNTRY" AND FIND FOR RUSSIA 
ITS "LODESTAR," OR DIRECTION.
<P>
 TO SOME, HOWEVER, SUCH TALK OF WHAT RUSSIA NEEDS NEXT IS 
PREMATURE.  IRINA, A 55-YEAR-OLD BUSINESSWOMAN BUYING MEDICINE 
FOR HER NEIGHBOR, THINKS EVERYTHING WILL BE FINE, BOTH FOR MR. 
YELTSIN AND THE COUNTRY.  A WELL-DRESSED WOMAN, SHE SAYS MR. 
YELTSIN'S ECONOMIC REFORM PROGRAMS SHOULD BE GIVEN MORE OF A 
CHANCE. 
<P>
           /// IRINA ACT -- IN RUSSIAN, AND FADE ... ///
<P>
 "IT'S STUPID TO SAY THAT IF YELTSIN IS ILL THERE IS  NO  ONE 
RUNNING THE COUNTRY," SHE ARGUES.  "IT TAKES A WHOLE GROUP OF 
PEOPLE TO KEEP THE NATION GOING.  WE HAVE SOME STABILITY NOW," 
IRINA SAYS, "AND ONE MAN IS JUST  NOT  SO IMPORTANT." (SIGNED)

 <B><BLOCKQUOTE>SEVERAL AMERICAN MUSLIM ORGANIZATIONS HAVE MARKED THE 
OPENING OF THE RAMADAN FAST (TODAY/FRIDAY) BY LAUNCHING AN 
ISLAMIC EDUCATION CAMPAIGN.  V-O-A'S DON HENRY REPORTS THE 
COUNCIL ON AMERICAN ISLAMIC RELATIONS WILL DISTRIBUTE THOUSANDS 
OF BOOKLETS INFORMING EMPLOYERS ABOUT THE RELIGIOUS PRACTICES OF 
MUSLIM WORKERS, TO TRY TO HEAD OFF MISUNDERSTANDINGS IN THE WORK 
PLACE.
</B></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
 THE COUNCIL AND SEVERAL OTHER MUSLIM GROUPS HAVE BEEN 
GETTING A GROWING, IF RELATIVELY SMALL, NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS THE 
PAST TWO YEARS OF DISCRIMINATION AGAINST MUSLIMS IN THE AMERICAN 
WORK FORCE. 
<P>
 MORE THAN 80 CASES WERE REPORTED LAST YEAR, AND COUNCIL SPOKESMAN
IBRAHIM HOOPER SAYS MOST DERIVE FROM LACK OF KNOWLEDGE ABOUT 
MUSLIM RELIGIOUS BELIEFS, AND  NOT  FROM ANTI-MUSLIM BIAS.  HE 
SAYS A TYPICAL EXAMPLE IS A FEMALE WORKER BEING TOLD SHE MAY  NOT
WEAR A HEAD SCARF ON THE JOB. 
<P>
                       // OPT HOOPER ACT //
<P>
           IT IS MORE IGNORANCE THAN ACTUAL HOSTILITY; VERY FEW 
         CASES WHERE YOU CAN SEE ACTUAL MALICE THERE. 
<P>
                           // END ACT //
<P>
 HOWEVER, THE COUNCIL'S EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, NIHAD AWAD, SAYS THERE
ARE SOME CASES IN WHICH MALICE IS OBVIOUS, AND THE COUNCIL HAS A 
STANDARD RESPONSE TO THAT. 
<P>
                          // AWAD ACT //
<P>
          WE TRY TO FIRST OF ALL EDUCATE THEM ABOUT THE NEED TO BE
         TOLERANT, TO ACCOMMODATE THEIR MUSLIM EMPLOYEES LIKE 
         (THEY WOULD) OTHERS.  AND IF THEY SHOW HOSTILITY, WE 
         THINK THAT WE SHOULD BE BRING IT TO THE PUBLIC. 
<P>
                           // END ACT //
<P>
 PUBLICITY ABOUT JOB ACTIONS AGAINST MUSLIMS WORKERS BECAUSE OF 
THEIR DRESS OR OTHER RELIGIOUS PRACTICES USUALLY HAS RESULTED IN 
A QUICK COMPROMISE SOLUTION, SUCH AS COORDINATING THE COLOR OF A 
HEAD SCARF WITH THE COMPANY'S UNIFORM.
<P>
 DESPITE LOCAL AND AT TIMES NATIONAL NEWS MEDIA ATTENTION TO THESE
CASES, THE AMERICAN MUSLIM COUNCIL CONTINUES TO GET CALLS FROM 
MUSLIMS ASKING ABOUT EMPLOYMENT RIGHTS.
<P>
 THUS, THE COUNCIL AND SEVERAL OTHER MUSLIM GROUPS HAVE JUST 
PUBLISHED A BOOKLET THAT IS BEING SENT TO SEVERAL THOUSAND 
COMPANIES, COMMUNITY LEARNING CENTERS, LIBRARIES AND OTHER 
GATHERING PLACES. 
<P>
 ATTORNEY MARTIN MC MANN OF WASHINGTON, WHO HAS REPRESENTED 
MUSLIMS IN SEVERAL LABOR DISPUTES, BELIEVES THE INFORMATION 
PAMPHLET WILL HEAD OFF A LOT OF THE MISUNDERSTANDINGS THAT OCCUR 
BETWEEN EMPLOYERS AND MUSLIM WORKERS.
<P>
                         // MC MANN ACT //
<P>
          THE REASON I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT IS THAT AS WE GET
         INTO THESE CASES AND DISCUSS THINGS WITH THE EMPLOYER, 
         AND TYPICALLY A LAW FIRM GETS INVOLVED, YOU FIND OUT 
         THAT A LOT OF IT IS MISINFORMATION.  HAD THIS PAMPHLET 
         BEEN OUT THERE, WE PROBABLY NEVER WOULD HAVE GOT TO THE 
         STAGE OF HAVING LAWYERS TALK TO EACH OTHER AND PERHAPS 
         THREATEN LITIGATION. 
<P>
                           // END ACT //
<P>
 AMERICAN MUSLIM OFFICIALS EMPHASIZE THAT THE BOOKLET DOES  NOT  
TRY TO RECRUIT READERS TO ISLAM.  THEY SAY IT IS THE FIRST IN A 
SERIES OF INFORMATIONAL PAMPHLETS AND POSTER DISPLAYS AIMED AT 
EDUCATING THE AMERICAN PUBLIC ABOUT A VARIETY OF MUSLIM PRACTICES
AND TRADITIONS.  
<P>
 THE NEXT BOOKLETS IN THE SERIES WILL BE TARGETED AT THE HEALTH 
CARE AND TEACHING PROFESSIONS.  (SIGNED)

 <B><BLOCKQUOTE>ON THURSDAY (EDS: JAN. 9), EGYPTIAN PRESIDENT HOSNI 
MUBARAK INAUGURATED AN AMBITIOUS 25-YEAR DEVELOPMENT PROJECT IN 
SOUTHERN EGYPT DESIGNED TO RECLAIM A MILLION HECTARES OF DESERT 
LAND WEST OF THE NILE RIVER.  V-O-A CORRESPONDENT LAURIE KASSMAN 
VISITED THE AREA CALLED "TOSHKA," AND FILED THIS REPORT.
</B></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
 MOST OF EGYPT'S 63-MILLION INHABITANTS ARE SQUEEZED INTO A
NARROW STRIP OF LAND ALONG THE NILE RIVER -- ABOUT FOUR PERCENT 
OF EGYPT'S TOTAL LAND MASS.  THE POPULATION IS EXPECTED TO 
SURPASS 80-MILLION BY THE TURN OF THE CENTURY.    
<P>
 CANALS AND IRRIGATION PROGRAMS HAVE STRETCHED THE FERTILE NILE 
VALLEY TO ITS LIMITS.  SO, PRESIDENT HOSNI MUBARAK HAS LAUNCHED 
WHAT HE CALLS THE "NEW VALLEY" PROJECT TO DIG A CANAL THAT  WILL 
EXTEND THE NILE INTO EGYPT'S WESTERN DESSERT AND THAT, THE 
EGYPTIAN LEADER HOPES, WILL CREATE A NEW LIVING AND WORKING SPACE
FOR AN EXPLODING POPULATION.
<P>
 THE FIRST STAGE REQUIRES BUILDING A PUMPING STATION AT TOSHKA, ON
THE WESTERN BANK OF LAKE NASSER, WHICH WAS CREATED BY THE ASWAN 
DAM.  A CANAL WILL EXTEND 67-KILOMETERS, CARRYING WATER INTO THE 
DESERT TO AN AREA EGYPTIAN EXPERTS SAY COULD BE CULTIVATED, IF 
WATER WERE AVAILABLE.  THE INITIAL FARMLAND COULD COVER 200 
THOUSAND HECTARES. 
<P>
 THEN THE CANAL WOULD CONTINUE, HEADING NORTH ABOUT 300 KILOMETERS
TO WHAT CALLED THE "PARIS OASIS."  IN ALL, THE CANAL WILL STRETCH
800 KILOMETERS, LINKING SEVERAL OASES IN THE WESTERN DESERT AND 
EXPANDING EGYPT'S ARABLE LAND BY MORE THAN ONE MILLION HECTARES. 
<P>
 SPEAKING THROUGH AN INTERPRETER, PRESIDENT MUBARAK CALLED THE 
PROJECT A BRIDGE TO THE FUTURE.
<P>
                   // MUBARAK TRANSLATOR ACT //
<P>
          (FUTURE NEEDS HAVE) DICTATED THE START OF THIS GIGANTIC 
         PROJECT ... IT BECAME ... INEVITABLE THAT WE MOVE 
         OUTSIDE THE NARROW (NILE) VALLEY THAT WE LIVED ON FOR 
         MANY CENTURIES (BUT HAVE)  NOT  (THOUGHT) OF MOVING 
         OUTSIDE (OF) UNTIL ... OVER-POPULATION BECAME (SUCH) A 
         BURDEN ... THAT (EGYPT) COULD  NOT  (CARRY OUT ITS) 
         AMBITIONS ... FOR A BETTER FUTURE.
<P>
                           // END ACT //
<P>
 THE NEW VALLEY PROJECT IS EXPECTED TO TAKE ABOUT 25 YEARS TO 
COMPLETE.  ITS ESTIMATED COST IS ABOUT 30-BILLION DOLLARS.  THE 
GOVERNMENT CAN AFFORD ONLY SIX-BILLION OF THAT TOTAL.  EGYPT'S 
PRIME MINISTER SAYS OUTSIDE INVESTORS WILL HAVE TO PROVIDE THE 
REST.  
<P>
 CIVIL ENGINEER BAYOUMI ATTIA IS UNDER-SECRETARY OF PLANNING FOR 
EGYPT'S WATERWORKS MINISTRY.  HE SAYS THE CANAL PROJECT IS 
EXPECTED TO UNDERGO VARIOUS CHANGES AS THE CONCEPT IS TRANSFORMED
INTO REALITY.
<P>
                          // ATTIA ACT //
<P>
          WE SHOULD HAVE SOME PILOT AREAS AND SOME EXPERIMENTS TO 
         SEE HOW IT WILL GO AND THEN WE CAN ADAPT AND THEN WE CAN
         HAVE A LEARNING CURVE AND SEE HOW WE CAN DO IT.
<P>
                           // END ACT //
<P>
 THE INAUGURATION OF THE NEW VALLEY PROJECT WAS MORE CEREMONY THAN
SUBSTANCE.  THE PUMPING STATION CONSTRUCTION CONTRACT HAS NOT 
BEEN AWARDED YET.  THE PUMPING STATION HAS  NOT  EVEN BEEN 
DESIGNED.  ONLY A FEW METERS OF THE INITIAL 67 KILOMETERS OF THE 
CANAL HAVE BEEN DUG. 
<P>
 CRITICS SAY THE AMBITIOUS PROJECT TO "MAKE THE DESERT BLOOM" 
COSTS FAR TOO MUCH.  THEY ARGUE THE MONEY WOULD BE BETTER SPENT 
RELOCATING PEOPLE AND INDUSTRY OUT OF THE NILE VALLEY.  HOUSES 
AND FACTORIES THEN COULD BE REPLACED BY RECLAIMING WHAT WAS ONCE 
FERTILE FARMLAND.
<P>
 BUT THE GOVERNMENT SAYS IT IS TIME TO CREATE A NEW VALLEY AND 
RECLAIM THE DESERT INSTEAD.  (SIGNED)

 <B><BLOCKQUOTE>PRESIDENT CLINTON IS REITERATING HIS APPEAL TO THE 
AMERICAN BUSINESS COMMUNITY TO HELP PROVIDE JOBS TO FORMER 
RECIPIENTS OF FEDERAL WELFARE BENEFITS.  A WELFARE REFORM LAW 
ENACTED LAST YEAR REQUIRES ABLE-BODIED RECIPIENTS TO GET A JOB 
AFTER TWO YEARS, ENDING THE 60-YEAR FEDERAL GUARANTEE OF 
UNLIMITED AID.  WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT DAVID BORGIDA REPORTS 
WELFARE REFORM IS THE LATEST ISSUE THE PRESIDENT IS HIGHLIGHTING 
IN ADVANCE OF HIS JANUARY 20TH INAUGURATION.
</B></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
 JUST IN CASE THE REPUBLICAN-CONTROLLED CONGRESS HAS ANY 
DOUBTS ABOUT THE PRESIDENT'S SECOND-TERM AGENDA, HE IS OUTLINING 
HIS PRIORITIES ON AN ALMOST DAILY BASIS.  THURSDAY HE PRESSED HIS
CASE FOR THE IMPORTANCE OF ENCOURAGING YOUNG PEOPLE TO FURTHER 
THEIR EDUCATION.  BEFORE THAT, HE MADE A CASE FOR THE IMPORTANCE 
OF IMPROVING RACE RELATIONS.
<P>
 FRIDAY THE TOPIC OF THE DAY WAS WELFARE REFORM, WITH THE 
PRESIDENT HOSTING A GROUP OF BUSINESS LEADERS AT THE WHITE HOUSE.
<P>
 WITH THE NEW WELFARE LAW IN PLACE, HE INSISTS SERIOUS REFORM CAN 
ONLY OCCUR IF THE NATION'S PRIVATE SECTOR HELPS OUT.
<P>
                         // CLINTON ACT //
<P>
          WELFARE REFORM NOW MUST GO ON TO THE NEXT STEP, AND IT 
         CANNOT SUCCEED BY GOVERNMENT ACTION ALONE.  THERE CANNOT
         BE IN OUR EFFORTS TO BALANCE THE BUDGET ENOUGH MONEY TO 
         HAVE SOME BIG PUBLIC WORKS PROGRAM HERE TO PUT EVERYONE 
         TO WORK WHO IS REQUIRED TO MOVE INTO THE WORK FORCE 
         WITHIN TWO YEARS.  SO WELFARE REFORM, IF IT'S GOING TO 
         WORK, WILL HAVE TO HAVE THE LEADERSHIP OF THE PRIVATE 
         SECTOR IN TURNING WELFARE CHECKS INTO PAYCHECKS.
<P>
                           // END ACT //
<P>
 THE PRESIDENT IS CONSIDERING INCENTIVES IN HIS NEXT BUDGET PLAN 
THAT WOULD MAKE IT MORE ATTRACTIVE FOR BUSINESS LEADERS TO HIRE 
FORMER WELFARE RECIPIENTS.
<P>
 HE IS ENCOURAGED BY WHAT HE IS SEEING IN THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY  
ALREADY.  ONE OF THE BUSINESS LEADERS ATTENDING THE WHITE HOUSE 
EVENT FRIDAY WAS RACHEL HUBKA, HEAD OF A CHICAGO-BASED COMPANY 
CALLED RACHEL'S BUS COMPANY.  SIX YEARS AGO SHE BEGAN THE COMPANY
IN ONE OF CHICAGO'S POOREST NEIGHBORHOODS, AND NOW SHE EMPLOYS 
100 PEOPLE, MANY FORMER WELFARE RECIPIENTS.
<P>
 PRESIDENT CLINTON USED THE WHITE HOUSE EVENT TO TOUT ONE OF HIS 
ADMINISTRATION'S ECONOMIC ACHIEVEMENTS, THE CREATION OF MORE THAN
11 MILLION NEW JOBS OVER FOUR YEARS.  HE SAID IT IS THE FIRST 
TIME THAT SO MANY JOBS WERE CREATED DURING A FOUR-YEAR 
ADMINISTRATION.
<P>
 THE PRESIDENT IS EXPECTED TO OFFICIALLY PRESENT HIS VISION AND 
AGENDA FOR A SECOND TERM IN HIS INAUGURAL ADDRESS JANUARY 20TH, 
WITH MORE DETAILS TO BE PROVIDED IN HIS STATE OF THE UNION 
ADDRESS FEBRUARY FOURTH.  HE FORMALLY SUBMITS HIS NEXT BUDGET 
OUTLINE TWO DAYS LATER.  (SIGNED)

 <B><BLOCKQUOTE>THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF GEORGIA HAS ASSURED THE 
UNITED STATES THAT A GEORGIAN DIPLOMAT WILL REMAIN IN THIS 
COUNTRY TO FACE CHARGES RESULTING FROM A FATAL CAR ACCIDENT IN 
WASHINGTON.  RON PEMSTEIN REPORTS FROM THE STATE DEPARTMENT ON AN
UNUSUAL DIPLOMATIC OFFER.
</B></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
 MOST GOVERNMENTS WILL WITHDRAW A DIPLOMAT BEFORE ALLOWING 
THEIR IMMUNITY TO BE WAIVED SO THEY MAY FACE TRIAL IN A FOREIGN 
COURT.  IN THIS CASE, GEORGIAN PRESIDENT EDUARD SHEVARDNADZE HAS 
TOLD THE UNITED STATES THAT GEORGIA IS PREPARED TO WAIVE THE 
DIPLOMATIC IMMUNITY OF DIPLOMAT GUEORGUI MAKHARADZE AND TO HAVE 
HIM REMAIN IN WASHINGTON WHILE THE CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION 
CONTINUES.
<P>
 THE ANNOUNCEMENT IN TBILISI REVERSES AN EARLIER INDICATION FROM 
GEORGIA THAT MR. MAKHARADZE WILL RETURN HOME RATHER THAN FACE 
CHARGES RANGING FROM NEGLIGENT HOMICIDE TO SECOND DEGREE MURDER. 
THE UNITED STATES ATTORNEY STILL MUST SEEK A FORMAL INDICTMENT.  
WASHINGTON POLICE SAY MR. MAKHARADZE, THE SECOND RANKING DIPLOMAT
IN THE GEORGIAN EMBASSY, WAS DRIVING AT 130 KILOMETERS A HOUR IN 
THE CITY CENTER AND APPARENTLY WAS INTOXICATED.  IN THE RESULTING
ACCIDENT, A 16 YEAR OLD WOMAN WAS KILLED. 
<P>
 STATE DEPARTMENT SPOKESMAN NICHOLAS BURNS PRAISES THE GEORGIAN 
PRESIDENT FOR ALLOWING THE AMERICAN LEGAL SYSTEM TO PROCEED.
<P>
                         /// BURNS ACT ///
<P>
          THE UNITED STATES VERY MUCH WELCOMES THIS STEP BY 
         CHAIRMAN SHEVARDNADZE.  IT'S A COURAGEOUS STEP.  IT'S 
         HIGHLY UNUSUAL IN MODERN DIPLOMACY TO SEE A HEAD OF 
         STATE TAKE SUCH A RESPONSIBLE AND COURAGEOUS POSITION.  
         IT IS OUR FULL EXPECTATION AND OUR FULL ASSURANCE FROM 
         THE GEORGIAN GOVERNMENT THAT MR. MAKHARADZE WILL NOW 
         REMAIN IN THE UNITED STATES DURING THE INVESTIGATORY 
         PERIOD.
<P>
                           ///END ACT///
<P>
 THE GEORGIAN PRESIDENT SAYS THE DIPLOMAT'S IMMUNITY WILL BE 
LIFTED UNLESS THE TWO GOVERNMENTS REACH A DIFFERENT DECISION.  
U-S OFFICIALS DO  NOT  KNOW HOW TO INTERPRET THIS LANGUAGE.  ONE 
OFFICIAL SAYS THE GEORGIAN GOVERNMENT MAY BE TRYING TO KEEP ITS 
OPTIONS OPEN OR THE GOVERNMENT IN TBILISI MAY BE SPLIT ABOUT HOW 
TO HANDLE THE CASE. 
<P>
 THE UNITED STATES FORMALLY REQUESTED A WAIVER OF MR. MAKHARADZE'S
DIPLOMATIC IMMUNITY THURSDAY, IN ADVANCE OF THE FORMAL CHARGES 
BEING BROUGHT AGAINST HIM.  THE GEORGIAN AMBASSADOR WAS INFORMED 
OF THIS AFTER THE UNITED STATES WAS TOLD IN TBILISI THAT MR. 
MAKHARADZE WOULD LEAVE THE COUNTRY RATHER THAN GO TO TRIAL. 
<P>
 SECRETARY OF STATE WARREN CHRISTOPHER WROTE A LETTER TO PRESIDENT
SHEVARDNADZE URGING HIM TO HAVE MR. MAKHARADZE REMAIN AND TO 
WAIVE HIS DIPLOMATIC IMMUNITY.  THERE IS  NO  NEED TO LIFT THE 
DIPLOMATIC IMMUNITY UNTIL CHARGES ARE FILED AND MR. MAKHARADZE IS
SENT TO TRIAL.  
<P>
 IN HIS LETTER, MR. CHRISTOPHER TOLD THE GEORGIAN LEADER HOW 
SERIOUSLY THE UNITED STATES TAKES THIS CRIMINAL CASE.  FOR NOW, 
THE GEORGIAN LEADER INDICATES HE UNDERSTANDS THAT POSITION.

 <B><BLOCKQUOTE>THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL TRIBUNAL FOR RWANDA HEARD FROM
ITS FIRST WITNESS TODAY (FRIDAY).  AS V-O-A'S SCOTT STEARNS 
REPORTS, THE TRIAL HAS NOW BEEN ADJOURNED UNTIL MONDAY. 
</B></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
 JEAN-PAUL AKAYESU IS FACING CHARGES OF CRIMES AGAINST 
HUMANITY, MURDER, TORTURE AND INCITEMENT TO VIOLENCE IN THE 
DEATHS OF MORE THAN TWO-THOUSAND PEOPLE IN THE TOWN OF TABA.  THE
FORMER MAYOR SAYS HE IS  NOT  GUILTY OF THE CRIMES CARRIED OUT 
DURING THE 1994 KILLING OF ETHNIC TUTSI AND MODERATE HUTU.
<P>
 THE TRIBUNAL'S FIRST WITNESS WAS THE COMMUNAL ACCOUNTANT FOR 
TABA.  KNOWN IN COURT ONLY AS "WITNESS K," SHE SAYS SHE HAS KNOWN
MR. AKAYESU FOR AT LEAST 18 YEARS SINCE HE WAS AN INSPECTOR AT 
HER PRIMARY SCHOOL. 
<P>
 SHE SAYS PEOPLE FROM THE CAPITAL BEGAN ARRIVING IN TABA ON APRIL 
SEVENTH -- ONE DAY AFTER PRESIDENT JUVENAL HABYARIMANA'S PLANE 
WAS SHOT DOWN AND THE 1994 GENOCIDE BEGAN.
<P>
 PEOPLE FLEEING KIGALI TOLD HER MEMBERS OF THE EXTREMIST 
INTERHAMWE MILITIA WERE KILLING ETHNIC TUTSI AND HUTU WHO DID  
NOT  AGREE WITH THE RULING PARTY.  INTERHAMWE CAME PRIMARILY FROM
THE RULING PARTY YOUTH WING.  
<P>
 // OPT //  THE WITNESS SAYS SHE WAS TOO AFRAID TO GO TO WORK THAT
DAY, AND REFUSED A CAR SENT BY MR. AKAYESU TO BRING HER TO THE 
OFFICE.  HE LATER SENT A NOTE SAYING HE WOULD GUARANTEE HER 
SAFETY AND NEEDED HER AT THE OFFICE TO PAY COMMUNAL WORKERS.  SHE
ARRIVED, PAID THE WORKERS, AND WENT HOME.  FOR THE NEXT WEEK, SHE
SAYS THINGS WERE CALM IN TABA, BECAUSE MR. AKAYESU CALLED A 
MEETING TO RENOUNCE ETHNIC VIOLENCE.  // END OPT //
<P>
 THE WITNESS SAYS MR. AKAYESU SENT FOR HER APRIL 17TH, AND ASKED 
HER TO COME THE NEXT DAY TO EXPLAIN WHY SHE HAD  NOT  BEEN TO 
WORK.  WHEN SHE ARRIVED, SHE WAS TOLD MR. AKAYESU LEFT TABA FOR A
MEETING IN GITARAMA. 
<P>
 IT WAS AT THIS MEETING THAT THE PROSECUTION ALLEGES SENIOR 
OFFICIALS IN THE NEW INTERIM GOVERNMENT CONVINCED MR. AKAYESU TO 
JOIN THE GENOCIDE.  WHEN SHE RETURNED THE FOLLOWING DAY, APRIL 
19TH, YOUNG MEN ARMED WITH MACHETTES, LONG KNIVES, AND CLUBS WITH
NAILS WERE SURROUNDING THE COMMUNAL OFFICE.  SHE SAYS MR AKAYESU 
WAS A MAJOR PLAYER IN THE GENOCIDE IN TABA, USING HIS INFLUENCE 
TO CONVINCE YOUNG HUTU THAT THEY SHOULD KILL ALL TUTSI AND 
TUTSI-SYMPATHISERS. 
<P>
 THE TRIAL FINALLY GOT UNDERWAY THURSDAY AFTER REPEATED DELAYS, AS
DEFENSE ATTORNEYS ASKED FOR MORE TIME TO PREPARE THEIR CASE. 
<P>
 <P>
 <P>
 <P>
 MR. AKAYESU IS ON HIS THIRD SET OF LAWYERS, AND FRIDAY ASKED TO 
CHANGE THEM AGAIN.
<P>
 TRIBUNAL PRESIDENT KAMA SAID HE WOULD CONSIDER THE REQUEST, BUT 
FOR NOW THE TRIAL WILL CONTINUE.
<P>
         // OPT // LAITY KAMA ACT IN FRENCH, THEN FADE //
<P>
 MR. KAMA SAYS THE TRIBUNAL UNDERSTANDS THE IMPATIENCE OF THE 
RWANDAN PEOPLE, BUT THE JUDGES MUST ENSURE THEY TAKE THE TIME 
NECESSARY TO BRING ABOUT EQUITABLE JUSTICE.  HE SAYS EACH TIME 
MR. AKAYESU HAS ASKED FOR NEW LAWYERS, THE TRIBUNAL HAS GRANTED 
POSTPONEMENTS TO ALLOW THE NEW ATTORNEYS TIME TO MEET WITH THEIR 
CLIENT AND FAMILIARIZE THEMSELVES WITH THE CHARGES AGAINST HIM.  
// END OPT //
<P>
 IT IS UNCLEAR HOW THIS LATEST REQUEST FOR NEW LAWYERS WILL AFFECT
THE TRIAL SCHEDULE.  THERE ARE ALREADY A NUMBER OF OTHER 
DEFENDENTS SCHEDULED TO APPEAR BEFORE THE TRIBUNAL IN TANZANIA. 
<P>
 RWANDA'S OWN GENOCIDE TRIALS BEGAN LAST MONTH AND HAVE ALREADY 
HANDED DOWN TWO DEATH SENTENCES NOW ON APPEAL.  UNLIKE THE 
RWANDAN TRIALS, THE INTERNATIONAL TRIBUNAL'S STIFFEST SENTENCE IS
LIFE IN PRISON.  (SIGNED)

 <B><BLOCKQUOTE>NEAR THE MIDWESTERN CITY OF DETROIT, THE BODIES OF 29 
PEOPLE KILLED IN A COMMUTER AIRLINE CRASH THURSDAY AFTERNOON ARE 
BEING RECOVERED.  THE PLANE WENT DOWN SHORTLY BEFORE DUSK ABOUT 
45 KILOMETERS SOUTH OF THE CITY.  V-O-A'S MICHAEL LELAND REPORTS 
FEDERAL INVESTIGATORS HAVE ARRIVED AND HAVE BEGUN LOOKING FOR THE
CAUSE OF THE CRASH. 
</B></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
 THE CRASH OF THE COMAIR PLANE CAME AS THE CREW WAS MAKING 
ITS APPROACH TO DETROIT'S METRO AIRPORT.  IT HAD BEEN SNOWING FOR
MOST OF THE DAY AND VISIBILITY AT THE TIME WAS REPORTEDLY ONLY 
ABOUT A KILOMETER.  INVESTIGATORS SAY THEY DO  NOT  KNOW YET IF 
WEATHER PLAYED A ROLE.  COMAIR VICE PRESIDENT CHARLES CURRAN SAYS
AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS RECEIVED  NO  INDICATION OF PROBLEMS IN 
THE MINUTES BEFORE THE CRASH. 
<P>
                        /// CURRAN ACT ///
<P>
          OUR PEOPLE HAVE TALKED TO DETROIT METRO (AIRPORT) 
         APPROACH CONTROL.  THEY INDICATED THAT EVERYTHING SEEMED
         TO BE FINE.  THEY HAVE GONE THROUGH THE TAPES.  THEY 
         MADE REGULAR CONTACT WITH THE AIRCRAFT.  THEY CLEARED 
         THE AIRCRAFT TO RUNWAY THREE.  THE CAPTAIN RESPONDED AND
         ACCEPTED THAT RUNWAY, AND THEN CONTACT WAS LOST ALL 
         RELATIVELY IN THE SAME AMOUNT OF TIME. 
<P>
                          /// END ACT ///
<P>
 A DETROIT NEWSPAPER QUOTES INVESTIGATORS AS SAYING THEY WILL 
FOCUS ON WEATHER CONDITIONS AND THE PLANE'S PROPELLERS AS THEY 
LOOK FOR THE CAUSE.  THE PLANE WAS A BRAZILIAN-MADE EMBRAER 120. 
THIS TYPE OF PLANE HAS BEEN INVOLVED IN THREE FATAL CRASHES IN 
THE UNITED STATES SINCE 1991.  
<P>
                      // REST OPT FOR LONG //
<P>
 TWO OF THOSE CRASHES WERE BLAMED ON PROBLEMS WITH THE EMBRAER'S 
PROPELLERS; THE OTHER WAS CAUSED BY A MISSING PART IN THE PLANE'S
TAIL SECTION.  
<P>
 COMAIR BOUGHT THIS PLANE NEW IN 1992.  SINCE THEN IT HAS HAD  NO 
SERIOUS MAINTENENCE PROBLEMS, ALTHOUGH THE CINCINNATI ENQUIRER  
NEWSPAPER REPORTS SERVICE RECORDS INDICATE IT HAD BEEN PULLED 
FROM SERVICE 22 TIMES SINCE 1992 FOR MAINTENANCE WORK.  THE PLANE
HAD ITS LAST MAJOR EVALUATION LESS THAN TWO MONTHS AGO.  COMAIR 
IS BASED IN CINCINNATI. 
<P>
 THE CRASH HAS AGAIN RAISED THE ISSUE OF COMMUTER AIRLINE SAFETY 
IN THE UNITED STATES.  MOST REGIONAL CARRIERS USE SMALL,  
PROPELLER-DRIVEN PLANES ON THEIR ROUTES, AND AIRLINE PASSENGER 
SAFETY CONSULTANT DAVID STEMPLER SAYS THESE PLANES ARE INVOLVED 
IN MORE ACCIDENTS THAN LARGER COMMERCIAL PLANES -- ESPECIALLY AT 
NIGHT OR DURING BAD WEATHER.
<P>
                       /// STEMPLER ACT ///
<P>
          BACK IN 1994, I PUT OUT A STUDY WHICH BASICALLY TOLD 
         MEMBERS OF THE INTERNATIONAL AIRLINE PASSENGERS 
         ASSOCIATION TO AVOID COMMUTER/REGIONAL AIRPLANES WITH 30
         OR FEWER SEATS BECAUSE THEY HAD AN ACCIDENT RECORD WHICH
         IS SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER THAN FOR THE JETS AND THE LARGER
         TURBO-PROP AIRPLANES.
<P>
                          /// END ACT ///
<P>
 COMAIR IS PART-OWNED BY DELTA AIRLINES AND CONNECTS DELTA FLIGHTS
IN LARGER U-S CITIES WITH SMALLER AND MEDIUM-SIZED COMMUNITIES 
THROUGHOUT THE AMERICAN MIDWEST AND IN FLORIDA.  THIS IS ONLY THE
SECOND FATAL CRASH IN COMAIR HISTORY AND THE FIRST SINCE 1979.

CHARGES RESULTING FROM A FATAL CAR ACCIDENT IN WASHINGTON.  RON 
PEMSTEIN REPORTS FROM THE STATE DEPARTMENT.

<P>
 GEORGIAN PRESIDENT EDUARD SHEVARDNADZE HAS TOLD THE UNITED
STATES THAT GEORGIA IS PREPARED TO WAIVE THE DIPLOMATIC IMMUNITY 
OF DIPLOMAT GUEORGUI MAKHARADZE AND TO HAVE HIM REMAIN IN 
WASHINGTON WHILE THE INVESTIGATION CONTINUES.
<P>
 THE ANNOUNCEMENT IN TBILISI REVERSES AN EARLIER STATEMENT FROM 
GEORGIA THAT MR. MAKHARADZE WILL RETURN HOME RATHER THAN FACE 
CHARGES RANGING FROM NEGLIGENT HOMICIDE TO SECOND DEGREE MURDER. 
THE CHARGES RESULTED FROM AN ACCIDENT LAST WEEK IN WASHINGTON 
THAT KILLED A 16-YEAR-OLD WOMAN.
<P>
 STATE DEPARTMENT SPOKESMAN NICHOLAS BURNS PRAISED THE GEORGIAN 
PRESIDENT FOR ALLOWING THE AMERICAN LEGAL SYSTEM TO PROCEED.
<P>
                          // BURNS ACT //
<P>
          THE UNITED STATES VERY MUCH WELCOMES THIS STEP BY 
         CHAIRMAN SHEVARDNADZE.  IT'S A COURAGEOUS STEP.  IT'S 
         HIGHLY UNUSUAL IN MODERN DIPLOMACY TO SEE A HEAD OF 
         STATE TAKE SUCH A RESPONSIBLE AND COURAGEOUS POSITION.
<P>
                           // END ACT //
<P>
 THE GEORGIAN PRESIDENT SAYS THE DIPLOMAT'S IMMUNITY WILL BE 
LIFTED UNLESS THE TWO GOVERNMENTS REACH A DIFFERENT DECISION.

MUSLIM HOLY MONTH, RAMADAN AND JUST ONE DAY AFTER A BOMB ATTACK 
IN TEL AVIV.  AT THE SAME TIME, EFFORTS TO FORGE THE NEXT 
ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN PEACE ACCORD CONTINUED.  V-O-A'S AL PESSIN 
REPORTS FROM JERUSALEM.  
</B></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
 ISRAELI SECURITY FORCES SET UP ROADBLOCKS AND CHECKED 
PEOPLE ON THE STREETS OF TEL AVIV AND JERUSALEM, PARTICULARLY 
PALESTINIANS MAKING THEIR WAY TO ISLAM'S THIRD-HOLIEST SHRINE, 
AL-AQSA MOSQUE, IN JERUSALEM'S OLD CITY. 
<P>
 AT THE MOSQUE'S MID-DAY PRAYERS ON THE FIRST FRIDAY OF RAMADAN --
BROADCAST WORLDWIDE -- THE PREACHER SHARPLY CRITICIZED ISRAEL AND
ACCUSED JEWISH EXTREMISTS OF PLANNING TO DESTROY THE MOSQUE -- A 
MOVE HE SAID WOULD LEAD TO ISRAEL'S DESTRUCTION.  THE 70-THOUSAND
MUSLIMS IN THE MOSQUE AND OUTSIDE ON ITS PLAZA SHOUTED THEIR 
APPROVAL.  
<P>
 IN THE AUTONOMOUS WEST BANK CITY OF NABLUS, 15-THOUSAND PEOPLE 
ATTENDED A RALLY CALLED BY THE MILITANT PALESTINIAN GROUP HAMAS, 
WHERE SPEAKERS CALLED FOR A MAJOR ATTACK ON ISRAELI SETTLERS.  IN
HEBRON, THE SUBJECT OF THE CURRENT ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN TALKS, 
PALESTINIANS THREW STONES AT ISRAELI SETTLERS AFTER MID-DAY 
PRAYERS AT THE CAVE OF THE PATRIARCHS.  
<P>
 ISRAEL ALWAYS INCREASES SECURITY DURING MUSLIM AND JEWISH 
HOLIDAYS, BUT FRIDAY IT WAS PARTICULARLY TIGHT BECAUSE OF TWO 
EXPLOSIONS IN TEL AVIV THURSDAY EVENING WHICH INJURED MORE THAN 
TEN PEOPLE.  TEL AVIV'S MAYOR, RONI MILO, SAYS IT WAS PROBABLY A 
TERRORIST ATTACK. 
<P>
                          // MILO ACT // 
<P>
          THE FACT THAT WE HAD TWO EXPLOSIONS IN A SHORT TIME 
         BETWEEN THEM SHOWS IT WAS PROBABLY A TERRORIST ACTION, 
         AND I WILL JUST SAY WE ARE LUCKY IT WAS  NOT  IN THE 
         MIDDLE OF THE DAY.
<P>
                          // END ACT // 
<P>
 POLICE SAY THE EXPLOSIONS WERE CAUSED BY TWO RELATIVELY WEAK PIPE
BOMBS, FILLED WITH NAILS.  ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN 
NETANYAHU SAYS IF THE EVIDENCE SHOWS THE BOMBS WERE PLANTED BY 
TERRORISTS BASED IN AUTONOMOUS PALESTINIAN AREAS, THE PEACE TALKS
COULD BE FURTHER DELAYED. 
<P>
                       // NETANYAHU ACT // 
<P>
             FROM ALL APPARENT SIGNS, THIS SEEMS TO BE A TERRORIST
            ATTACK.  WE ARE GOING TO PURSUE THESE TERRORISTS IN 
            THE COURSE OF THE WAR WE CONDUCT AGAINST TERRORISM IN
            GENERAL.  IF IT TURNS OUT THE TERRORISTS CAME FROM 
            THE AREAS CONTROLLED BY THE PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY, WE
            WILL  NOT  TREAT THIS AS BUSINESS AS USUAL. 
<P>
                           // END ACT //
<P>
 (OPT)  MR. NETANYAHU CRITICIZED HIS PREDECESSORS FOR CONTINUING  
PEACE TALKS IN SPITE OF TERRORIST ATTACKS, AND SAYS HE WILL  NOT 
DO THE SAME.   
<P>
                  (OPT) // 2ND NETANYAHU ACT // 
<P>
          WE ARE  NOT  PREPARED TO ACCEPT, AS A MATTER OF COURSE, 
         THE KIND OF REPEATED TERRORIST ATTACKS IN OUR MAJOR 
         CITIES AND CONTINUE WITH BUSINESS AS USUAL.  WE CAN  NOT
         HAVE PEACE IF PEOPLE CAN  NOT  WALK THE STREETS OF TEL 
         AVIV SAFELY.  AND WE WANT TO HAVE A REAL PEACE, WHERE 
         PEOPLE ARE SAFE.  THIS IS WHAT WE WILL INSIST UPON. 
<P>
                      // END ACT // (END OPT)
<P>
 THE CURRENT U-S MEDIATED TALKS ARE AIMED AT DETERMINING HOW MR. 
NETANYAHU'S GOVERNMENT WILL IMPLEMENT THE PEACE ACCORDS SIGNED BY
HIS PREDECESSORS -- AGREEMENTS HE SAYS ARE TERRIBLY FLAWED.  
<P>
 OFFICIALS SAY AGREEMENT HAS BEEN REACHED FOR SECURITY 
ARRANGEMENTS IN HEBRON AFTER ISRAEL WITHDRAWS FROM MOST OF THE 
CITY.  THEY SAY THE CURRENT TALKS ARE STUCK ON WHAT WILL COME 
AFTERWARD -- HOW LONG IT WILL TAKE ISRAEL TO MAKE FURTHER 
WITHDRAWALS ON THE WEST BANK WHICH HAD BEEN PROMISED FOR THIS 
SEPTEMBER.  IN SPITE OF THURSDAY'S BOMBINGS AND FRIDAY'S TENSION,
THE SENIOR U-S MIDDLE EAST MEDIATOR, DENNIS ROSS, CONTINUED HIS 
MEETINGS WITH BOTH ISRAELI AND PALESTINIAN OFFICIALS.  (SIGNED)

 <B><BLOCKQUOTE>THE NEWLY ELECTED U-S CONGRESS IS STARTING ITS WORK IN AN
ATMOSPHERE FAR DIFFERENT FROM THE ONE PREVAILING FOR MUCH OF THE 
LAST SESSION.  THOUGH REPUBLICANS STILL HOLD A MAJORITY, THEIR 
POSITION IS WEAKER THAN BEFORE -- AND AT LEAST FOR NOW, THE 
PARTIES SAY THEY HOPE TO WORK WITH INSTEAD OF AGAINST EACH OTHER.
SENATE CORRESPONDENT DAVID SWAN HAS DETAILS.
</B></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
 // BEGIN WITH ACT -- ROBIN CARLE, CLERK OF THE HOUSE //
<P>
          THE HOUSE WILL BE IN ORDER. (GAVEL SOUNDS).  THE HOUSE 
         WILL BE IN ORDER.
<P>
                           // END ACT //
<P>
 WHEN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES CAME INTO SESSION, MEMBERS 
FOUND THE LANDSCAPE HAD SHIFTED DRAMATICALLY SINCE THE LAST 
CONGRESS OPENED IN 1995.  THEN, REPUBLICANS HAD JUST WON CONTROL 
WITH A WAVE OF YOUNG CONSERVATIVES LEADING THE CHARGE.  THE 
COMBATIVE NEW SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE, NEWT GINGRICH, CAME TO 
SYMBOLIZE THE UPHEAVAL, AS HE AND HIS COLLEAGUES WORKED DAY AND 
NIGHT TO TURN THEIR CAMPAIGN PROMISES INTO LAW.  THEY WERE SO 
STRONG THAT PRESIDENT CLINTON HAD TO TELL VOTERS HE WAS STILL 
RELEVANT.
<P>
 NOW, THE PRESIDENT HAS WON A NEW TERM AND THE SPEAKER IS UNDER 
THE CLOUD OF AN ETHICS INVESTIGATION.  PUBLIC OPINION POLLS 
SUGGEST MOST AMERICANS WANT A NEW SPEAKER BUT HE AND HIS PARTY 
STARTED LOSING SUPPORT LONG AGO, WHEN A BITTER BUDGET CRISIS SHUT
DOWN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.  LAST WEEK THE HOUSE OF 
REPRESENTATIVES NARROWLY VOTED TO KEEP MR. GINGRICH AS SPEAKER, 
AND INSTEAD OF CELEBRATING HIS SECOND TERM HE APOLOGIZED FOR MUCH
OF HIS FIRST.
<P>
                        // GINGRICH ACT //
<P>
          TO THE DEGREE I WAS TOO BRASH, TOO SELF-CONFIDENT OR TOO
         PUSHY, I APOLOGIZE.  TO WHATEVER DEGREE IN ANY WAY THAT 
         I HAVE BROUGHT CONTROVERSY OR INAPPROPRIATE ATTENTION TO
         THE HOUSE, I APOLOGIZE.  IT  IS MY INTENTION TO DO 
         EVERYTHING I CAN TO WORK WITH EVERY MEMBER OF THIS 
         CONGRESS.
<P>
                           // END ACT //
<P>
 THE ETHICS CASE IS  NOT  SETTLED AND OBSERVERS SAY IT IS  NOT  
CLEAR HOW MUCH IT MIGHT WEAKEN THE SPEAKER'S POWER.  BUT 
REPUBLICANS ARE  NOT  THE ONLY ONES WITH A NEW, SOMEWHAT 
CHASTENED ATTITUDE.
<P>
 THE HUGE DEMOCRATIC LOSSES IN THE 1994 CONGRESSIONAL ELECTION 
WERE SEEN AS A REJECTION OF THE PRESIDENT, ESPECIALLY HIS LIBERAL
VIEWS.  MR. CLINTON SAVED HIS POLITICAL LIFE BY REDEFINING 
HIMSELF AS A CENTRIST -- AND NOW OTHER DEMOCRATS ARE EMBRACING 
THE SAME LABEL.  SENATE MINORITY LEADER TOM DASCHLE IS CALLING 
FOR MODERATION AND COMPROMISE WITH REPUBLICANS, SAYING THIS 
APPROACH BROUGHT RESULTS LAST YEAR AND SHOULD WORK AGAIN.
<P>
                         // DASCHLE ACT //
<P>
          WE WERE EFFECTIVE BECAUSE WE WERE ABLE TO COME TO THE 
         MIDDLE AND DEMONSTRATE THAT BY BEING PART OF THE MIDDLE,
         REPUBLICANS COULD JOIN US THERE COMFORTABLY.  WE WANT TO
         PROVIDE PROPOSALS THAT WILL BE VIEWED AS MODERATE, 
         SENSIBLE, CENTRIST PROPOSALS THAT ALLOW REPUBLICANS AND 
         DEMOCRATS, CONSERVATIVES AND LIBERALS TO WORK TOGETHER 
         TO FIND WAYS AT WHICH TO MOVE OUR AGENDA FORWARD.
<P>
                           // END ACT //
<P>
 THE AGENDA INCLUDES MANY OF THE SAME ISSUES THAT DOMINATED THE 
LAST SESSION -- EDUCATION, TAX CUTS, AND DOING AWAY WITH DEFICIT 
SPENDING.  THE PARTIES PLAN TO RESUME THE BALANCED-BUDGET 
DISCUSSIONS THAT BROKE DOWN LAST YEAR.  CONGRESS MAY ALSO TAKE UP
A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT REQURING BALANCED BUDGETS.
<P>
 BUT WHILE REPUBLICANS SAY THEY HOPE TO WORK WITH THE 
ADMINISTRATION, THEY ALSO SAY COMPROMISE HAS ITS LIMITS.  SENATE 
BUDGET COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN PETE DOMINICI MAKES IT CLEAR HE IS 
SKEPTICAL ABOUT THE BUDGET THE WHITE HOUSE MAY PROPOSE.
<P>
                        // DOMINICI ACT //
<P>
          THIS IS THE BUDGET PLAN AS YOU KNOW THAT WILL TAKE US 
         ACROSS THE BRIDGE INTO THE NEXT CENTURY.  IT SHOULD BE A
         SOLID BRIDGE, A STURDY BRIDGE,  NOT  ONE WITH WEAK 
         SPOTS, SLICK ROADS, SECRET COMPARTMENTS OR TRAP DOORS.
<P>
                           // END ACT //
<P>
 THE COOPERATIVE SPIRIT MAY ALSO BE TESTED BY THE GINGRICH ETHICS 
CASE AND A SIMILAR MATTER AFFECTING DEMOCRATS -- THE PROBE INTO 
QUESTIONABLE CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS RECEIVED BY THE PARTY LAST 
YEAR.  ALL SIDES AGREE IT WILL BE HARD TO RESOLVE THESE 
POTENTIALLY EXPLOSIVE ISSUES AND  NOT  ALLOW THE POLITICAL 
FALLOUT TO SPILL OVER INTO THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS.  (SIGNED)

 // EDITORS, PLEASE NOTE: THIS IS PERISHABLE MATERIAL AND BECOMES 
      DATED AFTER 10 P-M  E-S-T  ON FRIDAY JANUARY 10TH //
<P>
 <B><BLOCKQUOTE>ON WEDNESDAY, THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT HEARD 
         ARGUMENTS ON WHETHER AMERICANS HAVE A CONSTITUTIONAL 
         RIGHT TO MEDICALLY ASSISTED SUICIDE IF THEY ARE 
         TERMINALLY ILL.   
         
         SEVERAL NEWSPAPERS OFFER THEIR OPINION ON TODAY'S 
         EDITORIAL PAGES.  THERE ARE OTHER TOPICS AS WELL, 
         INCLUDING THE ISSUE OF DIPLOMATIC IMMUNITY.  
         
         0NOW, HERE WITH SOME QUOTES IS ____________________ AND 
         TODAY'S EDITORIAL DIGEST.
</B></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
 THE SUPREME COURT SESSION LASTED APPROXIMATELY TWO 
         HOURS.  THE LOS ANGELES TIMES NOTES THAT "JUSTICE AFTER 
         JUSTICE ASKED QUESTIONS THAT STRONGLY SUGGESTED THAT THE
         COURT WILL REVERSE TWO LOWER COURT DECISIONS UPHOLDING 
         PHYSICIAN-ASSISTED SUICIDES.  SUCH A REVERSAL WOULD 
         LEAVE THE MATTER TO BE DECIDED BY INDIVIDUAL STATES."  
<P>
 VOICE:   "BUT HOWEVER THE COURT RULES IN THESE CASES -- THE 
         DECISION IS EXPECTED BY EARLY SUMMER -- TWO THINGS ARE 
         ALREADY EVIDENT.  FIRST, THE ISSUE OF WHETHER TERMINALLY
         ILL PATIENTS SHOULD BE GRANTED ASSISTANCE IN ENDING 
         THEIR LIVES IS PAINFUL AND FRAUGHT WITH COMPLEX AND 
         LEGITIMATE LEGAL CONCERNS.  QUESTIONS ABOUT WHO SHOULD 
         HAVE THE RIGHT AND WHO SHOULD NOT PREOCCUPIED THE 
         JUSTICES, AS DID CONCERNS ABOUT THE ROLE OF PHYSICIANS 
         IN ASSISTING PATIENTS WHO WISH TO DIE.... SECOND, THE 
         VERY REAL SUFFERING THAT LED DOCTORS AND TERMINALLY ILL 
         PATIENTS TO CHALLENGE CRIMINAL PROHIBITIONS AGAINST 
         ASSISTED SUICIDE IN THE STATES OF WASHINGTON AND NEW 
         YORK ARE IN NO SMALL MEASURE A RESULT OF THE 
         EXTRAORDINARY ADVANCES IN MEDICAL SCIENCE THAT HAVE 
         OCCURRED IN RECENT DECADE.... REGARDLESS OF HOW THE HIGH
         COURT RULES, THE ANGUISHED SUFFERING OF TERMINALLY ILL 
         PATIENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES -- AND OF AMERICANS OVER THE
         QUESTION OF ASSISTED SUICIDE -- IS UNLIKELY TO END ANY 
         TIME SOON."
<P>
 ON ITS EDITORIAL PAGE, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL SAYS THAT
         EVEN BEFORE THE COURT ANNOUNCES ITS DECISION "IT IS 
         ALREADY CLEAR THAT EUTHANASIA -- AND THE MORAL DILEMMAS 
         IT RAISES -- IS DESTINED TO SHADOW THE DYING DAYS OF 
         THIS CENTURY NOT JUST IN THE UNITED STATES BUT AROUND 
         THE WORLD."
<P>
 VOICE:   "THE WORD 'SHADOW' IS APT HERE, BECAUSE NO MATTER HOW 
         MOVINGLY AND COMPASSIONATELY ADVOCATES PUT THEIR CASE 
         FOR ASSISTED SUICIDE, THE DARK SIDE OF THE DEBATE 
         INEVITABLY SURFACES.  FOR INSTANCE, IN PUBLIC OPINION 
         POLLS ALMOST ANYWHERE ON EARTH, A MAJORITY OF 
         RESPONDENTS ROUTINELY ANSWERS IN THE AFFIRMATIVE WHEN 
         ASKED WHETHER A TERMINALLY ILL PERSON HAS A RIGHT 'TO 
         DIE WITH DIGNITY' AT A TIME OF THEIR OWN CHOOSING.  BUT 
         WHEN THE MOMENT FOR ACTION COMES, MANY RECOIL FROM THE 
         DEED AND SHUDDER AT ITS IMPLICATIONS."
<P>
 AND, TODAY'S EDITION OF THE BOSTON GLOBE URGES MORE 
         SUPPORT FOR THOSE TERMINALLY ILL.
<P>
 VOICE:   "...THE SAME PEOPLE WHO PROLONG LIFE OFTEN UNWITTINGLY 
         CONSPIRE TO MAKE THE LAST DAYS MORE DIFFICULT THAN THEY 
         NEED BE.  THIS WEEK A COALITION OF 40 HEALTH AND 
         RELIGIOUS GROUPS DEVISED 10 PRINCIPLES TO GUIDE CARE FOR
         THE DYING.  THEY EMPHASIZE THE NEED FOR THE PHYSICIANS, 
         NURSES AND OTHER CAREGIVERS TO COMMUNICATE WITH PATIENTS
         AND FAMILY MEMBERS TO ENSURE THAT MEDICAL TREATMENT 
         PROMOTES PHYSICAL AND EMOTIONAL WELL-BEING WHILE 
         ENCOURAGING A HIGH QUALITY OF LIFE.  CONTROLLING PAIN 
         AND RESPECTING THE PATIENT'S AUTONOMY ARE AMONG THE 
         PRINCIPLES.  MANY OF THESE GROUPS OPPOSE ASSISTED 
         SUICIDE WHICH WAS ARGUED BEFORE THE SUPREME COURT THIS 
         WEEK.  MOST PEOPLE, NO MATTER WHAT THEIR AGE OR 
         CONDITION, DO NOT WANT TO KILL THEMSELVES.  WHATEVER AN 
         INDIVIDUAL'S DECISION, IT MAKES SENSE TO MAKE THE 
         PROCESS OF DYING MORE HUMANE FOR EVERYONE."
<P>
 LAST MONTH, TWO DIPLOMATS FROM THE RUSSIAN AND BELARUS 
         MISSIONS TO THE UNITED NATIONS GOT INTO AN ARGUMENT WITH
         SOME NEW YORK POLICE OFFICERS WHO WERE TICKETING THE CAR
         FOR ILLEGAL PARKING.  NEW YORK'S NEWSDAY OFFERS THIS 
         VIEW:
<P>
 VOICE:   "MAYOR GUILIANI DEMANDED THE ENVOYS' RECALL OR EXPULSION
         AS WELL AS APOLOGIES AND PAYMENT BY THE TWO MISSIONS FOR
         HUNDREDS OF OUTSTANDING PARKING SUMMONSES.  THE FOREIGN 
         GOVERNMENTS COMPLAINED THAT THE POLICE ROUGHED UP THEIR 
         GUYS.  THE DIPLOMATIC SCOFFLAW PROBLEM IS CHRONIC IN NEW
         YORK, AND MORE NATIONS OUGHT TO EMULATE BRITAIN AND 
         CANADA, WHICH PAY THEIR FINES.  A GEORGIAN DIPLOMAT'S 
         ALLEGED OFFENSE IN WASHINGTON LAST WEEK IS MORE 
         GRIEVOUS.  THE CAR HE WAS DRIVING STARTED A CHAIN 
         ACCIDENT THAT RESULTED IN THE DEATH OF A 16-YEAR OLD 
         MARYLAND GIRL.  SPEEDING AND ALCOHOL MAY HAVE 
         CONTRIBUTED.  NORMALLY A DIPLOMAT WOULD BE RECALLED OR 
         EXPELLED FOR SUCH AN OFFENSE, BUT IN THIS CASE 
         WASHINGTON WANTS GEORGIA TO WAIVE IMMUNITY SO THE MAN 
         CAN STAND TRIAL."
<P>
 AN EDITORIAL IN THE USA TODAY NEWSPAPER ARGUES THAT IN 
         LIGHT OF RECENT CRIMES -- INCLUDING THE TRAFFIC DEATH OF
         JOVIANE WALTRICK, IN WASHINGTON, "IT'S TEMPTING TO PULL 
         THE RUG OUT FROM UNDER DIPLOMATS."
<P>
 VOICE:   "IF A COUNTRY REFUSES TO WAIVE IMMUNITY AND THE CRIME IS
         SERIOUS, THE STATE DEPARTMENT ASKS THE DIPLOMAT TO LEAVE
         -- IN A HURRY.  THE RUSSIANS DID THAT IN 1993 WHEN A 
         U.S. DIPLOMAT STRUCK A MOTHER AND HER TWO DAUGHTERS AS 
         THEY CROSSED A STREET, KILLING THE 11-YEAR OLD GIRL.  
         BANISHMENT MAY NOT SEEM ENOUGH TO THOSE VICTIMIZED BY 
         RECKLESS ACTS OF DIPLOMATS.  BUT IT IS VITAL INSURANCE 
         FOR U.S. DIPLOMATS OVERSEAS WHO WOULD BE AT THE MERCY OF
         THEIR HOST COUNTRIES WITHOUT IT.  JUST LAST YEAR, ROBIN 
         MEYER, A U.S. HUMAN RIGHTS OFFICER IN HAVANA WAS ACCUSED
         BY CUBAN AUTHORITIES OF 'SUBVERSIVE' ACTIVITIES, SUCH AS
         PROVIDING HISTORY BOOKS TO HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVISTS AND 
         JOURNALISTS.  MEYER WAS EXPELLED, BUT HAD THERE BEEN NO 
         DIPLOMATIC IMMUNITY SHE COULD HAVE FACED A CUBAN TRIAL 
         ON TRUMPED-UP CHARGES.  THAT TRADEOFF GIVES NO SOLACE TO
         THE FAMILY OF YOUNG JOVIANE, BUT IT IS THE UNAVOIDABLE 
         PRICE OF ASSURING THAT OUR DIPLOMATS CAN SERVE ABROAD 
         FREE OF INTIMIDATION."
<P>
 VIOLETA CHAMORRO BECOMES THE FIRST FREELY ELECTED 
         PRESIDENT OF NICARAGUA TO BE SUCCEEDED BY ANOTHER.  HER 
         SUCCESSOR IS ARNOLDO ALEMAN.  THE MIAMI HERALD OFFERS 
         THESE WORDS:
<P>
 VOICE:   "...DO?NA VIOLETA, AS SHE IS AFFECTIONATELY KNOWN, CAN 
         CLAIM A FAIR NUMBER OF ACCOMPLISHMENTS DURING SIX YEARS 
         IN OFFICE.... MRS. CHAMORRO HAS CRITICS ENOUGH, WHO GIVE
         FAIR REASONS FOR THEIR DISCONTENT.   SHE WAS NOT AN 
         ENERGETIC LEADER, THEY SAY; SHE WAS INSECURE, AWKWARD IN
         PUBLIC, AND SOMETIMES ALOOF IN MANNER; SHE WAS TOO 
         DEPENDENT ON HER SON-IN-LAW, ANTONIO LACAYO, HER CHIEF 
         OF STAFF; SHE LEAVES A STILL-WEAK ECONOMY.  BUT IN FACT 
         PRESIDENT CHAMORRO IN 1990 INHERITED A COUNTRY THAT WAS 
         CLOSE TO BANKRUPT AND NEARLY UNGOVERNABLE, REELING FROM 
         YEARS OF WAR AND POOR PLANNING.  SHE WAS ELECTED NOT 
         BECAUSE OF HER TRAINING OR POLITICAL EXPERIENCE BUT 
         BECAUSE SHE WAS A SYMBOL -- OF HEALING, OF GENTLENESS, 
         OF HOPE -- A NEEDED ANTIDOTE TO WAR.... TODAY ALL 
         NICARAGUANS LIVE AND WORK TOGETHER -- CONTENTIOUSLY 
         SOMETIMES, IN LIVELY DISAGREEMENT -- BUT TOGETHER AND AT
         PEACE.  IN LARGE MEASURE, THEY HAVE DO?NA VIOLETA TO 
         THANK FOR THAT."
<P>
 AN EDITORIAL IN THE CHRISTIAN SCIENCE MONITOR MAKES THE 
         POINT THAT A RECENT SURVEY FINDS THAT THE AMERICAN 
         PUBLIC BELIEVES THAT PRESIDENT BILL CLINTON AND HOUSE 
         SPEAKER NEWT GRINGRICH ARE NOT HONEST.  AN EVEN GREATER 
         MAJORITY OF THOSE POLLED "SAY THE TWO ARE NO LESS HONEST
         THAN OTHER OFFICIALS."  THE NEWSPAPER ASKS THIS 
         QUESTION:
<P>
 VOICE:   "IS THERE A WAY THAT REELECTED PRESIDENT CLINTON AND 
         REELECTED SPEAKER GINGRICH CAN SOMEHOW JUSTIFY THE 
         SUPPORT OF THOSE WHO VOTED FOR THEM AND LIFT THE 
         PUBLIC'S PERCEPTION OF THE INTEGRITY OF THEIR 
         REPRESENTATIVES IN GENERAL?  THE SHORT ANSWER IS TO 
         COOPERATE FULLY AND UNGRUDGINGLY AND UNEVASIVELY WITH 
         THE ONGOING INVESTIGATIONS OF ETHICAL AND LEGAL 
         QUESTIONS."
<P>
 AND, THE PORTLAND (MAINE) PRESS HERALD REMINDS READERS 
         THAT TONIGHT MARKS THE BEGINNING OF RAMADAN, "THE 
         HOLIEST MONTH IN THE MUSLIM CALENDAR."
<P>
 VOICE:   "WITH THE MUSLIM POPULATION OF BOTH PORTLAND AND THE 
         NATION GROWING, AMERICANS OF ALL FAITHS SHOULD BE 
         FAMILIAR WITH THE BELIEFS AND PRACTICES OF ISLAM.  MANY 
         OF THEM AREN'T ALL THAT DIFFERENT FROM CHRISTIAN OR 
         JEWISH PRACTICES.... ISLAM IS A MONOTHEISTIC RELIGION 
         FIRST PREACHED BY THE PROPHET MOHAMMED TO ARABS IN THE 
         7TH CENTURY.  TODAY THE FAITH HAS MORE THAN A BILLION 
         FOLLOWERS, MOST CONCENTRATED IN NORTH AFRICA, THE 
         MIDEAST AND SOUTHERN ASIA, WITH SEVERAL HUNDRED THOUSAND
         BELIEVERS IN THE UNITED STATES.  TODAY WE CAN CALL SOME 
         OF THOSE PEOPLE OUR FELLOW PORTLANDERS -- AN IMPORTANT 
         PART OF THE AMERICAN MOSAIC."
<P>
 AND WITH THAT FROM THE PORTLAND PRESS HERALD WE CONCLUDE
         THIS BRIEF REVIEW OF EDITORIALS FROM TODAY'S U-S PRESS.

WOULD ATTACK ANY MISSILE SYSTEMS THE GREEK CYPRIOT GOVERNMENT 
MIGHT DEPLOY ON THE DIVIDED ISLAND OF CYPRUS.  AMBERIN ZAMAN 
REPORTS FROM ANKARA.
</B></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
 TURKISH FOREIGN MINISTER TANSU CILLER TOLD REPORTERS  
TURKEY WOULD HIT THE MISSILES, SHOULD THEY BE DEPLOYED.  SHE WAS 
REFERRING TO RUSSIAN MADE S-300 SURFACE-TO-AIR MISSILES PURCHASED
BY THE GREEK CYPRIOT GOVERNMENT FROM MOSCOW LAST WEEK TO BOOST 
ITS DEFENSIVE CAPABILITY.
<P>
 THE MULTI MILLION DOLLAR DEAL HAS SPARKED A WAR OF WORDS AMONG 
TURKEY, GREECE, CYPRUS AND RUSSIA.  THE PURCHASE ALSO TRIGGERED 
CALLS FROM WASHINGTON AND EUROPE TO WARN AGAINST RAISING TENSIONS
ON THE DIVIDED ISLAND.
<P>
 MRS. CILLER'S COMMENTS FOLLOW EARLIER WARNINGS BY TURKEY'S 
DEFENSE MINISTER TURHAN TAYAN THAT TURKEY WOULD -- IN HIS WORDS 
-- DO EVERYTHING NECESSARY TO PREVENT THE DEPLOYMENT OF THE 
MISSILES, WHICH HE DESCRIBED AS UNDERMINING PEACE IN THE REGION.
<P>
 ADDING PRESSURE ON THE GREEK CYPRIOT GOVERNMENT, TURKISH CYPRIOT 
LEADER RAUF DENKTASH THREATENED FRIDAY TO TAKE OVER VAROSHA, A 
TURKISH HELD SEASIDE RESORT, THAT HAS REMAINED  NO MAN'S LAND 
SINCE THE ISLAND WAS DIVIDED IN 1974.  THE BULK OF THE PROPERTY 
THERE IS OWNED BY GREEK CYPRIOTS.  
<P>
 // OPT //  THE RESORT, NOW A GHOST TOWN, HAS REMAINED UNDER THE 
CONTROL OF THE TURKISH ARMED FORCES, WHICH INTERVENED ON BEHALF 
OF THE TURKISH CYPRIOTS IN 1974 FOLLOWING A COUP ATTEMPT BY GREEK
CYPRIOT NATIONALISTS AIMED AT JOINING THE ISLAND WITH GREECE. // 
END OPT //
<P>
 MR. DENKTASH WENT ON TO SAY HIS ADMINISTRATION WAS SUSPENDING ITS
APPROVAL OF A UNITED NATIONS INITIATIVE TO REVIVE PEACE TALKS 
BETWEEN THE TWO COMMUNITIES, WHICH HAVE REMAINED SUSPENDED SINCE 
1994.  HE SAID THE GREEK SIDE'S DETERMINATION TO PURSUE THE 
MISSILE PURCHASE SHOWED -- IN HIS WORDS -- THE GREEK CYPRIOTS 
WERE  NOT  IN FAVOR OF A SETTLEMENT BUT IN FAVOR OF WAR.
<P>
 EARLIER, WASHINGTON URGED THE GREEK CYPRIOT GOVERNMENT TO CANCEL 
THE DEAL AND IS TO SEND AN ENVOY TO THE ISLAND OVER THE WEEKED IN
ORDER TO REDUCE MOUNTING TENSIONS BETWEEN THE SIDES. AT THE SAME 
TIME, WASHINGTON HAS WARNED TURKEY AGAINST ANY MILITARY ACTION 
AGAINST THE GREEK CYPRIOTS.
<P>
 THE CYPRUS ISSUE IS WIDELY VIEWED AS A POTENTIAL TRIGGER FOR WAR 
BETWEEN TURKEY AND GREECE.  THE TWO NATO MEMBERS ARE ALSO AT 
LOGGERHEADS ABOUT TERRITORIAL LIMITS IN THE AEGEAN SEA AND THE 
USE OF AIRSPACE OVER ITS WATERS.   (SIGNED)

 <B><BLOCKQUOTE>ONE YEAR AGO TODAY (FRIDAY), A TOWN IN CENTRAL CHINA 
PASSED THE COUNTRY'S FIRST RULES AGAINST SPOUSAL ABUSE AND 
WIFE-BEATING.  VOA'S STEPHANIE HO REPORTS FROM BEIJING, DOMESTIC 
VIOLENCE IS  NO  LONGER AN IGNORED PHENOMENON IN MODERN CHINA AND
HAS INCREASINGLY BECOME A TOPIC FOR CHINESE MEDIA.
</B></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
 IN DECEMBER, A PEKING OPERA ACTOR IN THE COASTAL PORT OF 
SHANGHAI WAS ARRESTED FOR BITING OFF HIS WIFE'S NOSE IN COURT 
DURING A DIVORCE HEARING.
<P>
 A YEAR EARLIER, A WOMAN IN THE CENTRAL TOWN OF CHANGSHA DIED 
AFTER HER HUSBAND THREW HER OUT THE WINDOW OF THEIR SIXTH-FLOOR 
APARTMENT, WHILE ANOTHER CHANGSHA HUSBAND SMASHED HIS WIFE ON THE
HEAD WITH A HAMMER DURING AN ARGUMENT IN 1992.
<P>
 VIOLENT ACTS SUCH AS THESE PROMPTED THE CHANGSHA GOVERNMENT LAST 
YEAR TO IMPLEMENT THE COUNTRY'S FIRST SET OF RULES TO 
SPECIFICALLY ADDRESS THE PROBLEM OF FAMILY VIOLENCE AND SPOUSAL 
ABUSE.
<P>
 UNDER THE CHANGSHA RULES, PUBLIC PROSECUTORS ARE ENCOURAGED TO 
PERMIT THE ARREST OF FAMILY MEMBERS INVOLVED IN INSTANCES OF 
DOMESTIC ABUSE.   PREVIOUSLY, A CHANGSHA WOMEN'S FEDERATION 
OFFICIAL SAYS, CRIMINAL PROCEDURES AGAINST VIOLENT SPOUSES WERE 
AVOIDED UNDER THE PRETEXT THAT THE ABUSIVE BEHAVIOR WAS MERELY 
PART OF FAMILY QUARRELS.
<P>
 IN A RECENT INTERVIEW IN BEIJING, CUI KEPING, OF THE ALL-CHINA 
WOMEN'S FEDERATION, SAID FAMILY VIOLENCE HAS LONG BEEN A PROBLEM 
IN CHINA -- WHERE WOMEN HAVE TRADITIONALLY BEEN CONSIDERED 
INFERIOR TO MEN.
<P>
                       // CUI CHINESE ACT //
<P>
 MS. CUI SAYS ALTHOUGH THE FEDERATION HAS  NO  STATISTICS ON 
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IN CHINA, MOST REPORTED CASES INVOLVE MEN 
BEATING THEIR WIVES.
<P>
 SHE SAYS IN THE PAST THE PROBLEM WAS GIVEN LITTLE ATTENTION 
BECAUSE CHINESE MEN FELT THAT BEATING THEIR WIVES WAS ACCEPTABLE 
AND  NOT  AGAINST THE LAW.  MS. CUI SAYS WOMEN WERE AFRAID OF 
REPORTING THE ABUSE BECAUSE THEY DID  NOT  WANT TO LOSE FACE -- A
TERM USED TO MEAN TARNISHING THEIR REPUTATION.
<P>
 MS. CUI SAYS ECONOMIC REFORMS HAVE SPED UP THE PACE OF PEOPLE'S 
LIVES.  THE STRESS HAS LED TO MORE SPOUSAL ABUSE.  SHE SAYS MANY 
MEN WORK OUT THEIR EMOTIONAL TENSION BY BEATING THEIR WIVES 
BECAUSE THEY HAVE  NOWHERE  ELSE TO CHANNEL THEIR FRUSTRATION.
<P>
 MS. CUI ADDS THAT ANOTHER PROBLEM IS A LACK OF SOCIAL AWARENESS 
-- ESPECIALLY IN RURAL AREAS -- THAT WIFE-BEATING IS  NOT  
ACCEPTABLE BEHAVIOR.
<P>
 MS. CUI SAYS THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT HAS BEGUN TO RECOGNIZE THE 
SERIOUSNESS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND IS LOOKING INTO WAYS TO DEAL
WITH IT.
<P>
 LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE ALSO STEPPING UP THEIR EFFORTS.  IN 
ADDITION TO CHANGSHA'S RULES AGAINST DOMESTIC VIOLENCE, SEVERAL 
CITIES -- INCLUDING SHANGHAI AND WUHAN -- HAVE RECENTLY SET UP 
SHELTERS FOR BATTERED WIVES, WHILE OTHER LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE 
ALSO BEGUN PROVIDING SPECIALIZED SERVICES FOR ABUSED WOMEN.

HOSPITALIZED WITH PNEUMONIA, IS FEELING A LITTLE BETTER (FRIDAY),
ALTHOUGH THERE HAS BEEN  NO  MAJOR CHANGE IN HIS CONDITION.  
V-O-A'S ELIZABETH ARROTT IN MOSCOW REPORTS, WITH THE PRESIDENT 
SICK, MANY RUSSIANS ARE WONDERING WHO IS RUNNING THE COUNTRY.
</B></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
 KREMLIN DOCTORS SAY MR. YELTSIN HAS BEGUN TO BREATHE MORE 
EASILY -- BUT CAUTION IT IS TOO SOON TO SPEAK OF A BREAKTHROUGH.
<P>
 DOCTOR SERGEI MIRONOV TOLD REPORTERS THE RUSSIAN LEADER WOULD  
PROBABLY SPEND THREE MORE DAYS IN THE HOSPITAL AND WOULD THEN 
NEED THREE WEEKS OF REST.  
<P>
 MR. YELTSIN WAS HOSPITALIZED WEDNESDAY WITH PNEUMONIA AND IS 
BEING TREATED WITH ANTIBIOTICS. 
<P>
 OFFICIALS ARE TRYING TO DOWNPLAY THE ILLNESS WHICH COMES JUST TWO
MONTHS AFTER THE PRESIDENT UNDERWENT HEART SURGERY.
<P>
 WHILE KREMLIN DOCTORS SAY THERE IS  NO  CONNECTION BETWEEN THE 
PNEUMONIA AND THE OPERATION, THE CONTINUING SAGA OF MR. YELTSIN'S
ILL HEALTH IS TAKING ITS TOLL ON THE COUNTRY.
<P>
 MR. YELTSIN SPENT SIX MONTHS LAST YEAR SIDELINED BY HIS HEART 
TROUBLES, AND HIS CONTINUED ABSENCES ARE REMINDING MANY RUSSIANS 
OF LEADERSHIP IN THE SOVIET ERA.
<P>
 FOR NEARLY A DECADE TOWARD THE END OF THE SOVIET PERIOD, SICKLY, 
AGED LEADERS -- MOST NOTABLY LEONID BREZHNEV -- RULED, OR AT 
LEAST TRIED TO.  SOME RUSSIANS ARE BEGINNING TO COMPARE MR. 
YELTSIN'S TERM TO MR. BREZHNEV'S, KNOWN AS THE ERA OF STAGNATION.

NOT  HAVE ENOUGH FOOD AFTER CROP AND LIVESTOCK DAMAGE CAUSED BY 
PROLONGED DROUGHT.  THE FOOD CRISIS IS WORRYING DONORS, AID 
AGENCIES AND KENYAN AUTHORITIES, WHO MET IN NAIROBI THIS WEEK TO 
ARRANGE A PLAN TO AVERT DISASTER.  SONYA LAURENCE GREEN REPORTS.
</B></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
 KENYA'S NORTHEASTERN AND EASTERN PROVINCES HAVE BEEN HIT 
BY A DROUGHT WHICH HAS LASTED OVER A YEAR NOW, THREATENING THE 
LOCAL POPULATIONS WITH STARVATION.  ALREADY, MALNUTRITION -- 
PARTICULARLY AMONG YOUNG CHILDREN -- HAS BEEN REPORTED.
<P>
 STARTING IN LATE 1995, THREE SUCCESSIVE RAINY SEASONS HAVE BEEN 
POOR.  WHAT THIS MEANS IS THAT CROPS HAVE FAILED TO THRIVE, AND 
LIVESTOCK HAVE SUFFERED AS WELL.  
<P>
 // OPT // ADDED TO THOSE PROBLEMS, A SHORTAGE OF MAIZE IN KENYA 
AND A HIGH IMPORT DUTY ON OUTSIDE SUPPLIES MEANS THAT PRICES FOR 
MAIZE MEAL -- A STAPLE FOOD -- HAVE ALMOST DOUBLED IN THE PAST 
YEAR ALONE.  HALF A MILLION POOR PEOPLE IN KENYA'S MARGINAL ARID 
AREAS, THEREFORE, HAVE  NOT  GOT ENOUGH TO EAT. // END OPT //
<P>
 IN 1992 AND 1993 WHEN A SIMILAR DROUGHT LED TO WIDESPREAD FAMINE 
IN NORTHERN KENYA AND NEIGHBORING SOMALIA, HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS 
OF PEOPLE DIED.  THIS TIME, AID AGENCIES AND DONORS HAVE KEPT A 
CLOSE WATCH ON THE PROBLEM -- USING SATELLITE IMAGES AND LOCAL 
ASSESSMENTS -- AND HAVE A PLAN TO NIP THE CRISIS IN THE BUD (CUT 
THE CRISIS SHORT).  THE UNITED NATIONS' WORLD FOOD PROGRAM (WFP) 
REGIONAL MANAGER FOR THE HORN OF AFRICA, MIKE SACKETT, EXPLAINS.
<P>
                        // SACKETT ACT // 
<P>
          W-F-P (THE WORLD FOOD PROGRAM), IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE 
         VARIOUS N-G-OS (NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS) IN THAT 
         AREA AND THE GOVERNMENT, HAVE BEEN IN A STATE OF WHAT I 
         WOULD CALL DROUGHT PREPAREDNESS. IN OTHER WORDS, MAKING 
         ASSESSMENTS, ANALYZING THE SITUATION, AND BEEN READY 
         WITH RESPONSES.  AND I THINK WE NOW HAVE MOVED INTO THE 
         NEXT MODE FROM DROUGHT PREPAREDNESS WHICH IS TO A 
         RESPONSE SITUATION.
<P>
                           // END ACT //
<P>
 MR. SACKETT SAYS THE W-F-P AND OTHER AID AGENCIES PLAN TO 
DISTRIBUTE 25-THOUSAND TONS OF MAIZE, BEANS AND VEGETABLE OIL 
THROUGH A PROGRAM FOR SCHOOL CHILDREN IN KENYA'S EASTERN 
PROVINCE, AND THOSE HIT BY DROUGHT IN NORTHEASTERN PROVINCE.
<P>
                    // SECOND SACKETT ACT //  
<P>
          WHAT THE N-G-O'S AND THE W-F-P ARE TRYING TO DO IS TO 
         PROVIDE A SMALL AMOUNT OF HIGHLY TARGETED FOOD TO THE 
         MOST VULNERABLE PEOPLE WHO DO  NOT  HAVE THE PURCHASING 
         POWER TO MEET THEIR FOOD NEEDS THROUGH THE COMMERCIAL 
         SECTOR.  SO, IN FACT, TWO THINGS SHOULD BE HAPPENING 
         SIDE BY SIDE -- THERE SHOULD BEGIN TO BE A SIGNIFICANT 
         FLOW OF COMMERCIAL IMPORTS INTO KENYA, AND THERE SHOULD 
         ALSO BE THESE RATHER WELL-TARGETED INTERVENTIONS.
<P>
                           // END ACT //
<P>
 KENYA'S GOVERNMENT FORMALLY ASKED FOR HELP EARLIER THIS WEEK, AND
A GROUP OF DONORS, AID AGENCIES AND KENYAN OFFICIALS MET IN 
NAIROBI THURSDAY TO TALK ABOUT THE DROUGHT AND CHART A SOLUTION. 
MR. SACKETT SAYS THE W-F-P HAS LAUNCHED AN APPEAL FOR 
12-POINT-FOUR MILLION DOLLARS TO HELP FUND THE RELIEF PLAN, WHICH
WILL ASSIST DROUGHT VICTIMS UNTIL THE NEXT RAINY SEASON -- DUE IN
APRIL.  (SIGNED)

INVESTIGATION INTO THE WRECK OF A RUSSIAN OIL TANKER WHICH IS 
CAUSING ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE IN JAPAN.  V-O-A'S ELIZABETH ARROTT 
IN MOSCOW HAS DETAILS.
</B></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
 FEDERAL AND LOCAL OFFICIALS IN RUSSIA ARE PURSUING THE 
CASE OF THE OIL TANKER "NAKHODKA," WHICH BROKE APART EARLIER THIS
MONTH AND CONTINUES TO SPILL OIL ALONG THE COAST OF JAPAN.
<P>
 THE INTERFAX NEWS AGENCY SAYS INVESTIGATORS WILL QUESTION THE 
OWNERS OF THE SHIP AND THE SURVIVING CREW MEMBERS.
<P>
 THE OIL SPILL RESULTING FROM THE SHIPWRECK IS AMONG THE WORST TO 
EVER HIT JAPAN.  JAPANESE AUTHORITIES SAY MORE THAN 70 SEPARATE 
OIL SLICKS HAVE WASHED ASHORE OR ARE HEADING TOWARD THE COAST.
<P>
 THE OIL IS POSING A THREAT TO SEVERAL OF THE NATION'S NUCLEAR 
REACTORS WHICH USE SEA WATER IN THEIR COOLING SYSTEMS.  WHILE 
AUTHORITIES SAY THE DANGER IS SLIGHT, NUCLEAR POWER PLANT WORKERS
FRIDAY ERECTED SPECIAL UNDERWATER BARRIERS TO KEEP THE OIL FROM 
POSSIBLY INTERFERING WITH THE WORKING OF THE PLANTS. 
<P>
 JAPAN'S FISHERIES AGENCY SAYS THE OIL IS ALSO AFFECTING SOME OF 
THE NATION'S MOST FERTILE FISHING AREAS AS WELL AS SEVERAL 
TOURIST SPOTS.  (SIGNED)

VOLKSWAGEN SOARED TO RECORD HIGHS FRIDAY AFTER THE COMPANY 
SETTLED ITS LONG-RUNNING DISPUTE WITH AUTO GIANT, GENERAL MOTORS.
FROM BONN, VOA'S KYLE KING REPORTS. 
</B></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
 STOCK ANALYSTS EXPRESSED CONFIDENCE THAT VOLKSWAGEN SHARES
WOULD CONTINUE THE UPWARD MARCH THEY BEGAN AFTER THE DEAL WITH 
GENERAL MOTORS WAS ANNOUNCED ON THURSDAY. 
<P>
 VOLKSWAGEN AND GENERAL MOTORS HAD BEEN LOCKED IN A BITTER DISPUTE
OVER ALLEGATIONS THAT FORMER G-M MANAGER JOSE IGNACIO LOPEZ STOLE
COMPANY SECRETS WHEN HE QUIT THE AMERICAN CAR COMPANY AND WENT TO
WORK FOR V-W IN 1993. 
<P>
 THE SETTLEMENT ANNOUNCED THURSDAY CALLS FOR V-W TO RETRACT SOME 
STATEMENTS IT HAD MADE, PAY G-M 100-MILLION DOLLARS AND BUY ABOUT
ONE-BILLION DOLLARS OF PARTS FROM GENERAL MOTORS. 
<P>
 MARKET ANALYSTS SAY THE DEAL WILL SAVE BOTH COMPANIES VALUABLE 
TIME AND MONEY THAT CAN BE BETTER SPEND ON MAKING CARS.  IT ALSO 
REMOVES THE UNCERTAINTY THAT HAD SURROUNDED VOLKSWAGEN. 
<P>
 GERMAN ANALYSTS SAY V-W IS NOW WELL POSITIONED TO EXPAND IN 
EMERGING MARKETS IN ASIA AND SOUTH AMERICA, AS WELL AS INCREASE 
PRODUCTION IN EUROPE.  (SIGNED)

BUT THAT THERE WAS  NO  MAJOR CHANGE IN HIS CONDITION.  VOA'S 
ELIZABETH ARROTT IN MOSCOW REPORTS THAT WITH THE PRESIDENT SICK, 
MANY RUSSIANS ARE WONDERING WHO'S RUNNING THE COUNTRY?
</B></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
 KREMLIN DOCTORS SAY MR. YELTSIN HAS BEGUN TO BREATHE MORE 
EASILY, BUT CAUTION IT IS TOO SOON TO SPEAK OF HIS RECOVERY 
PROGNOSIS.
<P>
 MR. YELTSIN WAS HOSPITALIZED WEDNESDAY WITH PNEUMONIA AND IS 
BEING TREATED WITH ANTIBIOTICS.  OFFICIALS ARE TRYING TO DOWNPLAY
THE ILLNESS, WHICH COMES JUST TWO MONTHS AFTER THE RUSSIAN LEADER
UNDERWENT HEART SURGERY.
<P>
 WHILE KREMLIN DOCTORS SAY THERE IS  NO  CONNECTION BETWEEN THE 
PNEUMONIA AND THE SURGERY, THE CONTINUING SAGA OF MR. YELTSIN'S 
ILL HEALTH IS TAKING ITS TOLL ON THE COUNTRY.  MR. YELTSIN SPENT 
SIX MONTHS LAST YEAR SIDELINED BY HIS HEART TROUBLES, AND HIS 
CONTINUED ABSENCES ARE REMINDING MANY RUSSIANS OF LEADERSHIP 
DURING THE SOVIET ERA.
<P>
 FOR NEARLY A DECADE BEFORE THE END OF THE SOVIET PERIOD, SICKLY, 
AGED LEADERS -- MOST NOTABLY LEONID BREZHNEV -- RULED OR AT LEAST
TRIED TO.  WITH MR. YELTSIN UNABLE TO HAVE UNDERTAKEN ANY MAJOR 
INITIATIVES FOR MORE THAN HALF A YEAR, COMPARISONS ARE BEING MADE
TO THE BREZHNEV ERA, KNOWN UNOFFICIALLY AS "THE TIME OF 
STAGNATION."  (SIGNED)

CAIRO THE AIRLINE NOW CONSISTS OF TWO FOKKER-50 (TWIN TURBOPROP) 
AIRCRAFT.  FLIGHTS TO GAZA AND THE WEST BANK ARE STILL ON HOLD 
UNTIL AN AGREEMENT IS REACHED BETWEEN ISRAEL AND THE PALESTINIANS
ON MANAGING AN AIRPORT IN GAZA.
</B></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
 THE PILOT OF THE FIRST AIRLINER TO TAKE OFF DESCRIBED THE 
HISTORIC FLIGHT AS A "DREAM COME TRUE."  THE PASSENGERS ON BOARD 
FELT THE SAME WAY. 
<P>
 THE TWO 50-SEATER AIRPLANES OF THE NEW FLEET HAVE "PALESTINIAN 
AIRWAYS" PAINTED ON THE SIDE, ALONG WITH THE RED, GREEN AND BLACK
STRIPES OF THE PALESTINIAN FLAG.
<P>
 THE TWO PLANES WILL MAKE FIVE MORE FLIGHTS BETWEEN PORT SAID AND 
JEDDAH DURING THE NEXT FEW DAYS TO CARRY MUSLIM PILGRIMS ON THEIR
WAY TO THE MUSLIM HOLY CITY OF MECCA. 
<P>
 FAYEZ ZAIDAN, WHO IS IN CHARGE OF THE AIRLINE, HAD HOPED THE 
INAUGURAL FLIGHT WOULD BE FROM CAIRO TO GAZA'S INTERNATIONAL 
AIRPORT.  THE AIRPORT IS STILL UNDER CONSTRUCTION AND SHOULD BE 
FINISHED BY APRIL.
<P>
 BUT THE AGREEMENT BETWEEN ISRAEL AND THE PALESTINIANS ON THE 
MANAGEMENT AND SECURITY OF THE AIRPORT IS STILL UNDER 
NEGOTIATION.
<P>
 MR. ZAIDAN HAS BEEN INVOLVED WITH THE NEGOTIATIONS SINCE THE 
START AND SAYS A KEY STUMBLING BLOCK HAS BEEN ISRAELI INSISTENCE 
ON RUNNING THE AIRPORT AND ITS SECURITY.  MR. ZAIDAN SAYS THE 
PALESTINIANS MUST RUN THE AIRPORT, BUT THEY ARE WILLING TO SET UP
A LIAISON COMMITTEE TO LET ISRAEL MONITOR SECURITY.
<P>
 BUSINESSMEN IN GAZA SAY THE AIRPORT WOULD LET THEM GET AROUND 
ISRAEL'S FREQUENT CLOSURES OF THE PALESTINIAN SELF-RULE AREAS AND
THE BUREAUCRATIC DELAYS OF SHIPPING PRODUCTS THROUGH ISRAEL'S 
AIRPORT.  (SIGNED)

GUERRILLAS HOLDING HOSTAGES AT THE JAPANESE AMBASSADOR'S 
RESIDENCE IN LIMA, PERU.  THERE ARE  NO  REPORTS OF INJURIES.  WE
HAVE DETAILS FROM CORRESPONDENT GEORGE MEEK IN OUR SOUTH AMERICA 
BUREAU.
</B></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
 POLICE SAY THE TUPAC AMARU REBELS APPARENTLY FIRED 
AUTOMATIC WEAPONS INTO THE AIR DURING EARLY MORNING HOURS FOR THE
SECOND TIME THIS WEEK.  POLICE SURROUNDING THE RESIDENCE WENT ON 
MAXIMUM ALERT, BUT DID  NOT  FIRE.  TELEVISION CAMERAS WITH 
INFRARED LENSES EARLIER HAD DETECTED REBELS MOVING ABOUT IN THE 
COURTYARD OF THE RESIDENCE. 
<P>
 THE PRESIDENT OF PERU'S COUNCIL OF MINISTERS, ALBERTO PANDOLFI, 
SAID THURSDAY NIGHT THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS IN CONTACT WITH OTHER 
GOVERNMENTS THAT MIGHT OFFER A SAFE HAVEN TO THE GUERRILLAS IF 
THEY RELEASE THEIR REMAINING 74 HOSTAGES UNHARMED.  MR. PANDOLFI 
DID  NOT  SAY WHICH GOVERNMENTS ARE INVOLVED, BUT THERE IS WIDE 
SPECULATION THAT ONE MAY BE CUBA, WHICH ACCEPTED COLOMBIAN M-19 
GUERRILLAS AFTER A SIMILAR HOSTAGE INCIDENT 16 YEARS AGO. 
<P>
 MR. PANDOLFI DENIED MEDIA REPORTS THAT PRESIDENT ALBERTO 
FUJIMORI'S SECURITY ADVISOR, VLADIMIR MONTESINOS, MET WITH JAILED
LEADERS OF THE TUPAC AMARU MOVEMENT IN AN EFFORT TO RESOLVE THE 
CRISIS. 
<P>
 THE GUERRILLAS PUT A SIGN IN THE WINDOW OF THE JAPANESE RESIDENCE
TO DENY AN ALLEGATION BY PRESIDENT FUJIMORI THAT THEY WANT RANSOM
FOR THE JAPANESE BUSINESS EXECUTIVES THEY ARE HOLDING.  THE SIGN 
SAID:  DON'T LIE, MR. FUJIMORI -- WE DON'T CARE ABOUT MONEY.  THE
SIGN REPEATS THE REBELS' DEMAND FOR RELEASE OF THEIR IMPRISONED 
COMRADES, WHO NUMBER ABOUT 450.
<P>
 ANOTHER SIGN POSTED BY THE REBELS SAYS THEY EXPLAINED WHY THEY 
ARE HOLDING JAPANESE DIPLOMATS AND BUSINESS EXECUTIVES IN AN 
INTERVIEW TUESDAY WITH TWO JOURNALISTS FROM THE JAPANESE 
TELEVISION CHANNEL ASAHI, WHO BROKE THROUGH POLICE LINES TO ENTER
THE RESIDENCE. 
<P>
 THE TWO JOURNALISTS WERE ARRESTED WHEN THEY CAME OUT AND ARE 
STILL IN CUSTODY.  THEIR FILM HAS BEEN CONFISCATED.  THE FOREIGN 
CORRESPONDENTS' ASSOCIATION IN LIMA HAS DEMANDED THE RELEASE OF 
THE JOURNALISTS, AND CRITICIZED THE PERUVIAN GOVERNMENT FOR 
FAILING TO PROVIDE ANY OFFICIAL CHANNEL FOR INFORMATION ON THE 
HOSTAGE CRISIS.  THE ASSOCIATION SAYS PERU'S OMBUDSMAN HAS 
VISITED THE ASAHI JOURNALISTS AND REPORTS THEY HAVE BEEN WELL 
TREATED. 
<P>
 PRESIDENT FUJIMORI HAS DENIED MEDIA REPORTS THAT HIS FOREIGN 
MINISTER AND AGRICULTURE MINISTER, WHO ARE AMONG THE HOSTAGES, 
MIGHT  NOT  RETURN TO THEIR POSTS BECAUSE OF THE TRAUMA SUFFERED 
IN CAPTIVITY.  HE SAYS THEIR JOBS ARE WAITING FOR THEM. 
<P>
 MR. FUJIMORI SAID PERU'S ECONOMY HAS  NOT  BEEN HURT BY THE 
HOSTAGE CRISIS, BECAUSE INVESTORS RECOGNIZE IT AS IN ISOLATED 
ACT.  HE SAID TOURISM TO PERU COULD SUFFER TEMPORARILY, BUT WILL 
RECOVER.  (SIGNED)

HOSTAGES AT THE JAPANESE AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE HAVE FIRED 
GUNSHOTS INTO THE AIR FOR THE SECOND TIME THIS WEEK, BUT THERE 
ARE  NO  REPORTS OF CASUALTIES.  WE HAVE DETAILS FROM 
CORRESPONDENT GEORGE MEEK IN OUR SOUTH AMERICA BUREAU.
</B></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
 POLICE AROUND THE JAPANESE AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE HUNKERED
DOWN (CROUCHED) WITH RIFLES POINTED TOWARD THE RESIDENCE 
FOLLOWING THE SHOTS, BUT DID  NOT  FIRE.  EARLIER,  TELEVISION 
CAMERAS WITH INFRARED LENSES REVEALED TWO OF THE TUPAC AMARU 
REBELS IN THE COURTYARD OF THE RESIDENCE. 
<P>
 THE REBELS HAVE BEEN HOLDING THE HOSTAGES SINCE DECEMBER 17TH TO 
DEMAND RELEASE OF IMPRISONED COMRADES, SOMETHING THE PERUVIAN 
GOVERNMENT HAS REFUSED TO CONSIDER.  THE GUERRILLAS ORIGINALLY 
SEIZED MORE THAN 500 HOSTAGES, BUT SINCE THEN HAVE RELEASED ALL 
BUT 74.
<P>
 THE PRESIDENT OF PERU'S COUNCIL OF MINISTERS, ALBERTO PANDOLFI, 
SAID THURSDAY NIGHT THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS IN CONTACT WITH OTHER 
COUNTRIES THAT MIGHT ACCEPT THE REBELS AS A WAY OF ENDING THE 
CRISIS.  HE DID  NOT  SPECIFY WHICH COUNTRIES, BUT IT IS WIDELY 
SPECULATED THAT CUBA IS AMONG THEM.  (SIGNED)

EXCHANGE WENT INTO A TAILSPIN ON FRIDAY.  THOMAS CALDWELL REPORTS
FROM TOKYO, THE MARKET HIT ITS LOWEST LEVEL IN 17 MONTHS.  
</B></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
 THE FIRST BUSINESS WEEK OF THE NEW YEAR WAS A GRIM ONE FOR
THE TOKYO STOCK EXCHANGE.  THE NIKKEI STOCK AVERAGE, THE KEY 
MARKET INDEX MADE UP OF 225 LEADING STOCKS, FELL TO ITS LOWEST 
LEVEL SINCE AUGUST 1995.  THE NIKKEI FELL TWO THOUSAND-142 POINTS
DURING THE WEEK, DOWN NEARLY 11 PERCENT IN VALUE.
<P>
 THE MARKET CLOSED 770 POINTS LOWER ON FRIDAY, ALONE,  ABOUT FOUR 
AND A QUARTER PERCENT LOWER THAN THE PREVIOUS DAY.  THE INDEX HAD
BEEN DOWN MORE THAN 900 POINTS, DURING THE TRADING SESSION BEFORE
IT RECOVERED SOME OF ITS LOSSES.  STOCK INDEX FUTURES TIED TO THE
NIKKEI AVERAGE FELL TO THE DAILY DOWN LIMIT OF ONE THOUSAND.
<P>
 MARKET ANALYSTS BLAMED THE PLUMMET PARTLY ON CONCERNS THE 
GOVERNMENT IS  NOT  DOING ENOUGH TO REVIVE THE SAGGING JAPANESE 
ECONOMY.  THERE IS ALSO GROWING CONCERN OVER THE THE CONDITION OF
JAPANESE BANKS, WHICH ARE STILL TRYING TO RECOVER FROM THE BAD 
DEBTS RUN UP DURING THE SPECULATIVE PERIOD OF THE 1980'S KNOWN AS
THE "BUBBLE ECONOMY."   OF THE 10 MOST ACTIVE STOCKS DURING 
FRIDAY'S SESSION, FIVE WERE BANKS.  
<P>
 FOLLOWING THE MARKET'S CLOSE FOR THE WEEK, JAPANESE CHIEF CABINET
SECRETARY SEIROKU KAJIYAMA SAID THERE IS  NO  QUICK FIX FOR 
FALLING STOCK PRICES.  HE SAYS IT IS NECESSARY TO BOLSTER THE 
NATION'S ECONOMIC FUNDAMENTALS IN ORDER TO CORRECT THE DOWNWARD 
TREND OF THE JAPANESE STOCK MARKET.  BUT MR. KAJIYAMA DID  NOT  
ANNOUNCE THE GOVERNMENT WAS PLANNING ANY NEW MEASURES.  (SIGNED)

CONTINUING AROUND THE NORTHERN TOWN OF PARANTHAN, WHICH WAS 
ATTACKED BY A LARGE FORCE OF REBELS ON THURSDAY MORNING.  DEFENSE
OFFICIALS SAY AT LEAST 60 SOLDIERS HAVE BEEN KILLED IN THE 
FIGHTING.  LEADERS OF THE TAMIL TIGER REBEL GROUP HAVE REJECTED 
GOVERNMENT CLAIMS THAT MORE THAN 500 REBELS HAVE BEEN KILLED OR 
INJURED.  FROM COLOMBO, MATTHEW CHANCE REPORTS.
</B></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
 DEFENSE OFFICIALS SAY WAR PLANES ARE FLYING MORE BATTLE 
SORTIES OVER NORTHERN SRI LANKA, ATTACKING REBEL POSITIONS.  
GROUND TROOPS, BACKED BY TANKS AND HELICOPTER GUNSHIPS ARE SAID 
TO BE CLEARING THE AREA AROUND PARANTHAN, WHERE MUCH OF THE 
FIGHTING HAS BEEN CONCENTRATED. 
<P>
 THE REBELS ARE NOW REPORTED TO HAVE PULLED OUT OF THE AREA.  AN 
ARMY SPOKESMAN SAYS TROOPS ARE PURSUING THEIR ATTACKERS. 
UNOFFICIAL REPORTS SAY THE REBELS OVERRAN THE ARMY GARRISON AT 
PARANTHAN.
<P>
 ONE REPORT IN A TAMIL TIGER NEWSPAPER CIRCULATING IN THE NORTH 
SAYS THE REBELS MAY HAVE SEIZED UP TO 15 HEAVY ARTILLERY PIECES 
WITH AMMUNITION.  THAT HAS BEEN DENIED BY THE GOVERNMENT. A 
SPOKESMAN SAID THE GUNS -- WHICH COST ABOUT 60 THOUSAND DOLLARS 
EACH -- HAD BEEN DESTROYED BEFORE THE TIGERS COULD REACH THEM.
<P>
 WHAT IS KNOWN IS THAT THE TIGERS USED ARTILLERY PIECES SEIZED IN 
EARLIER RAIDS TO DEVASTATING EFFECT IN THE LATEST ATTACK.
<P>
 TROOP DEFENSES AT PARANTHAN AND ELEPHANT PASS ARMY CAMPS ARE 
REPORTED TO HAVE BEEN POUNDED BY ARTILLERY BEFORE SQUADS OF 
SUICIDE BOMBERS WERE SENT IN HUMAN WAVES TO PENETRATE ARMY LINES.
<P>
 ON TOP OF THE GOVERNMENT'S OWN LOSES, OFFICIALS SAY AT LEAST 500 
TAMIL TIGER REBELS WERE KILLED OR INJURED IN THE FIGHTING.  THE 
REBELS DENY SUCH HEAVY LOSSES.
<P>
 SPEAKING FROM THE LONDON OFFICE OF THE TAMIL TIGERS, A REBEL 
SPOKESMAN SAID THE SRI LANKAN GOVERNMENT MAY HAVE INFLATED TIGER 
CASUALTIES TO BOOST FLAGGING ARMY MORALE.
<P>
 THERE HAS BEEN LITTLE WORD FROM THE TIGERS ON THE BATTLE ITSELF 
-- ALTHOUGH CLANDESTINE REPORTS ON THE REBELS' VOICE OF THE 
TIGERS RADIO STATION HAVE CALLED IT A SUCCESS, SAYING HUNDREDS OF
GOVERNMENT TROOPS WERE KILLED.
<P>
 THE FIGHTING IN NORTHERN SRI LANKA COMES AS THE COUNTRY'S BITTER 
CIVIL WAR ENTERS ITS 14TH YEAR.  ETHNIC TAMIL REBELS ARE 
DEMANDING A SEPARATE TAMIL STATE IN THE NORTH AND EAST OF THE 
COUNTRY.  (SIGNED)

 <B><BLOCKQUOTE>A COURT IN SEOUL FRIDAY ISSUED ARREST WARRANTS FOR SEVEN 
SOUTH KOREAN LABOR UNION LEADERS ACCUSED OF LEADING A NATIONWIDE 
GENERAL STRIKE.  SHIN NA REPORTS FROM SEOUL ON THE LABOR UNREST. 
</B></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
 THE WARRANTS WERE ISSUED FOR LEADERS OF THE UNAUTHORIZED 
KOREAN CONFEDERATION OF TRADE UNIONS, WHO ARE TAKING REFUGE IN A 
ROMAN CATHOLIC CATHEDRAL IN SEOUL.  PROVINCIAL COURTS ALSO ISSUED
ARREST WARRANTS FOR 13 OTHER UNION MEMBERS ELSEWHERE IN THE 
COUNTRY.  
<P>
 THE ACTION AGAINST THE UNIONIST CAME AS  MORE THAN 200 THOUSAND 
WORKERS ACROSS THE COUNTRY STAYED OFF THEIR JOBS IN THE THIRD 
WEEK OF A NATIONWIDE GENERAL STRIKE.  AT A HYUNDAI FACTORY IN THE
SOUTHEAST CITY OF ULSAN A WORKER WAS BADLY BURNED DURING A CLASH 
WITH POLICE.  UNION SPOKESMEN SAY THE MAN, WHO IS IN CRITICAL 
CONDITION, SET HIMSELF ON FIRE.  HYUNDAI SPOKESMEN SAY THE INJURY
WAS ACCIDENTAL.
<P>
 UNIONS ARE PROTESTING AGAINST A NEW LABOR LAW THAT GRANTS 
EMPLOYERS GREATER FREEDOM TO LAY OFF EMPLOYEES AND REPLACE 
STRIKING WORKERS.  WORKERS NATIONWIDE BEGAN A GENERAL STRIKE 
DECEMBER 26TH AFTER THE RULING PARTY PASSED THE CONTROVERSIAL 
BILL IN A SECRET SESSION OF THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY. 
<P>
 THE LABOR MINISTER DEFENDED THE LAW FRIDAY, SAYING IT WAS 
NECESSARY TO MEET GLOBAL CHANGES AND HELP THE COUNTRY OUT OF ITS 
CURRENT ECONOMIC SLUMP.  HE WARNED STRIKING WORKERS THAT THEY 
WILL BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE BY LAW FOR CONDUCTING THE ILLEGAL 
STRIKES.  
<P>
 OPINION POLLS PUBLISHED FRIDAY SHOW THE MAJORITY OF SOUTH KOREANS
ARE AGAINST THE NEW LABOR LAW.  ONE POLL CONDUCTED IN PUSAN, 
PRESIDENT KIM YOUNG-SAM'S HOMETOWN AND STRONGHOLD, SHOWED 75 
PERCENT OF THOSE SURVEYED THINK THE STRIKES AGAINST THE LABOR LAW
ARE JUSTIFIED. 
<P>
 THE KOREAN CONFEDERATION OF TRADE UNIONS, THE COUNTRY'S SECOND 
LARGEST UMBRELLA LABOR BODY, HAS THREATENED TO SPREAD THE STRIKE 
INTO THE PUBLIC SECTOR, INCLUDING SUBWAY AND TELEPHONE COMPANY 
WORKERS, IF THE LABOR LAW IS  NOT  REPEALED BY JANUARY 14.  THE 
OFFICIALLY RECOGNIZED FEDERATION OF KOREAN TRADE UNIONS, THE 
LARGEST NATIONWIDE LABOR BODY, WHICH HAS SUSPENDED ITS STRIKE 
ACTION, SAID THURSDAY IT WILL JOIN THE GENERAL STRIKE JANUARY 
15TH, IF THE LABOR LAW IS  NOT  REPEALED. 
<P>
 SOUTH KOREAN TRADE UNIONS ARE SEEKING SOLIDARITY WITH UNIONS 
WORLDWIDE.  A DELEGATION FROM THE INTERNATIONAL CONFEDERATION OF 
FREE TRADE UNIONS IS DUE TO ARRIVE SATURDAY TO SUPPORT THE 
STRIKE.  LABOR UNIONISTS IN MANILA AND SYDNEY PICKETED OUTSIDE 
THE SOUTH KOREAN MISSIONS IN THOSE COUNTRIES IN SUPPORT OF THE 
SOUTH KOREAN WORKERS.   (SIGNED)

 <B><BLOCKQUOTE>HONG KONG'S GOVERNMENT SAYS IT IS CRACKING DOWN ON SALES 
OF PIRATED COMPUTER SOFTWARE PRODUCTS. VOA HONG KONG 
CORRESPONDENT CHRIS SIMKINS REPORTS THE MOVE COMES AS NEW 
LEGISLATION TAKES EFFECT TO STRENGTHEN THE TERRITORY'S 
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LAWS.     
</B></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
 HONG KONG'S INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY DEPARTMENT SAYS IT WANTS
TO CLEAN UP THE TERRITORY'S TARNISHED IMAGE AS A HAVEN FOR 
CRIMINALS SELLING PIRATED MUSIC AND COMPUTER SOFTWARE COMPACT 
DISCS.  THE GOVERNMENT AGENCY HAS DRAFTED NEW COPYRIGHT AND 
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LEGISLATION IT HOPES,  IF ADOPTED BY 
LAWMAKERS, WILL HELP DRAMATICALLY CURB THE ILLEGAL ACTIVITY.  
STEPHEN SELBY, DIRECTOR OF THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY DEPARTMENT, 
SAYS IF THE NEW LAWS PROVE TO BE INEFFECTIVE WITHIN A YEAR THE 
GOVERNMENT WILL TAKE FURTHER ACTION.  
<P>
                         /// SELBY ACT ///
<P>
          WE WILL INTRODUCE LEGISLATIVE CHANGES TO ALLOW US TO 
         APPLY FOR A CLOSURE ORDER AGAINST ANY PREMISES WHICH HAS
         BEEN USED FOR THE SALE OF INFRINGING ARTICLES. THE 
         EFFECT OF SUCH A CLOSURE ORDER WOULD BE THAT IT WOULD  
         NOT BE POSSIBLE TO DO ANY BUSINESS WHATSOEVER ON THE 
         PREMISES OR EVEN TO LIVE IN IT. THIS WOULD BE SIMILAR TO
         THE CASE WHERE PREMISES ARE USED FOR THE SALE OF DRUGS 
         OR FOR PROSTITUTION.  
<P>
                          /// END ACT ///
<P>
 /// OPT /// MR. SELBY SAYS CATCHING THE COUNTERFEITERS IS A 
DIFFICULT TASK.  
<P>
                         /// SELBY ACT ///
<P>
          THERE IS A GREAT AMOUNT OF MATERIAL BEING ILLEGALLY 
         SMUGGLED INTO HONG KONG AND THAT STUFF IS FINDING ITS 
         WAY TO THE STREET LEVEL.  THE PEOPLE INVOLVED AT THE 
         STREET LEVEL IN OUR ESTIMATION ARE NOT ONE MASSIVE 
         UNDERWORLD ORGANIZATION,  IT IS EXTREMELY FRAGMENTED BUT
         THEY ARE EXTREMELY CANNY. (CLEVER)
<P>
                     /// END ACT / END OPT ///
<P>
 CUSTOMS AGENTS SAY COUNTERFEITERS PRODUCE MILLIONS OF COPIES OF 
SOFTWARE IN CHINA FOR SALE IN HONG KONG.  DESPITE THE WIDESPREAD 
PROBLEM, MR. SELBY PRAISES  THE TERRITORY'S ENFORCEMENT EFFORT, 
WHICH HE SAYS HAS HELPED LEAD TO THE CONVICTIONS OF MORE THAN 60 
PEOPLE LAST YEAR -- COMPARED WITH JUST 18 IN 1995. (SIGNED)

<b><i>Dear Parents, Staff and Students,</i></b><p>
<u>Christmas</u><p>
<u></u>Following Scholars' Day on Saturday the school will go into recess for
Christmas until the first day of Term 1 - 28th January 1997.<p>
<p>
As we approach this season of goodwill it is a delight to see young people
within the school reflecting the values upon which the school is based.  I was
delighted to be present when 45 Year 11 pupils received their First Aid
Certificates from the Regional Director of the Queensland Ambulance Brigade.
Incidentally, two of our pupils Leanne Hammond and Sam Dowdeswell achieved the
perfect score - 100%.  All these students are now in a position where they are
confident and competent enough to offer help and assistance to others who are
in need.<p>
<p>
In another effort, members of Mr. de Boer's Year 10 Andrews House have raised
over $1,300 for the benefit of Tjandamurra O'Shane who is recovering in the
Royal Children's Hospital Burns Unit.  The gift was handed over to Tjandamurra
and the Burns Unit during a visit to the hospital by members of the group who
raised the money.<p>
<p>
I take this opportunity to add my best wishes to all for a happy and safe
holiday at this time of special goodwill and Christian fellowship.<p>

thank the members of the committee who have given freely of their time and
energy to make this a very productive year. <p>
<p>
To all the parents and friends of the Somerset family, thank you for your
support as volunteers in the canteen and Somerset Shop and at the various
functions we have had over the year.  Thanks also for your contributions to our
fundraising efforts this year.<p>
<p>
We wish you all a Merry Christmas and an enjoyable holiday break ready for yet
another busy year at Somerset College.<p>

<b></b>Last Thursday evening saw the annual Carols Service and I
hope all families enjoyed sharing this special evening with the wider College
community.  Thanks and congratulations are extended to all children who
participated in the more formal proceedings.<p>
<p>
On Saturday evening, Mr. Schriek held her annual Dance Concert.  I was
delighted to have compered this wonderful evening and impressed by the standard
of dance presented, and the obvious commitment that is being made by these
girls and boys.  I congratulate each child for their efforts and pay special
tribute to Mrs. Schriek for her hard work in choreography and dedication to the
children under her care.<p>
<p>
On Wednesday, parents, families and friends were treated to the Lower Primary's
Annual Christmas Concert.  Carols from the Preschoolers, Divine Wombats from
Year 1, Rockin' Reindeers from Year 2 and a Christmas Dragon provided by Year
3, combined with a special visit from that fellow dressed in red, ensured that
a wonderful concert in the Christmas spirit was presented.<p>
<p>
Congratulations to Mrs. Lamb and the staff of the Lower Primary for efforts in
the organisation and preparation of this special event.<p>
<p>
On Wednesday, some 366 children from primary schools around the Coast, visited
Somerset to compete in the final round of Inter School Chess.  A new Australian
record was set by having the most players in the one venue at the same time,
and I extend congratulations to Mr. Gardiner for his enthusiasm and
encouragement of this worthwhile project.<p>
<p>
Somerset was represented by 44 children and the team of Damon Jackson, Chris
Page, Robert Kingston and Rhys Rakauskas were the Team Champions and overall
winners on the day.  The B Team were winners of the A Grade section - a
wonderful effort.  Damon Jackson was awarded Individual Champion.  I
congratulate these students and all those who competed so admirably for the
College.<p>
<p>
The focus of the past few days has undoubtedly been Scholars' Day preparation.
I look forward to sharing my first official Scholars' Day with the Junior
School and remind parents that the ceremony begins at 10.00a.m.<p>
<p>
Staffing for 1997 has been finalised and I am pleased to provide below, teacher
placements for the year.  You will notice a new teacher, by the name of Mrs.
Carrie Smith.  Mrs. Smith joins us from Mackay and has had many years
experience in Grades throughout primary school.  I know that Mrs. Smith has
much to offer the children of the Junior School and I look forward to the
contributions she will make.<p>

receive a letter advising them of class placements, before Christmas.<p>
<p>
I would like to take this opportunity of thanking the Somerset Family for
making my family and Ime feel so welcome to the school this year.  We have all
had a wonderful year and we wish you all a very happy, safe and holy Christmas,
and look forward to the 1997 school year with eager anticipation.<p>

<b></b>The staff would like to express their pleasure with the way
the students approached their end-of-semester exams.  In general they displayed
an appreciation of the behaviour expected during examinations and private study
sessions.<p>
<p>
Parents are reminded of the invitation, which exists at all times, to make
appointments to discuss a student's progress with the Headmaster, the Deputy
Head, the Dean of Studies, the House Tutor or an individual subject teacher.<p>
<p>
As usual, I have determined the top fifteen students in each year and they are
listed below.  We extend to them our congratulations.  However, the staff are
also aware of many students who do not appear on this list, but nevertheless
deserve our congratulations for a personal best effort in these examinations.
The most any of us ever expect of a student is that they should try to do the
best they can.  The top fifteen are determined on the basis of the aggregate of
standardized scores for all subjects in Years 8 - 10 and for the best five
subjects in Year 11 and 12.<p>

<b><cite><A NAME="5">YEAR 10 ANDREWS GARAGE SALE SUCCESS REPORT</A> ....<A HREF="#TOC">back to index</A> </cite></b><p>
<b></b>Last Saturday, Year 10 Andrews held their Garage Sale in
the front carpark to raise money for Tjandamurra O'Shane and the Royal
Children's Hospital Burns Unit.  The day started when the first carload of
customers arrived at 5.00a.m., before we had even begun to set up for the day.
Many customers followed, most earlier than the suggested 6.00a.m. start, to
grab some bargains and try to persuade us into lowering our prices.<p>
<p>
The support that we received from everyone was enormous and without it we could
not have reached our total figure of a very impressive $1,300.00.  On behalf of
everyone involved in the Garage Sale, I would like to thank all of those people
who donated goods and also those who came and bought something at the Garage
Sale.  Without your contributions, we would not have been able to raise this
much needed money for Tjandamurra and the Burns Unit.  <p>
<p>
I would also like to take this opportunity to thank the companies who sponsored
us - McDonalds Elanora, McDonalds Mermaid Beach, Kmart Elanora, McDonalds
Mermaid Beach, Kmart Robina and the Gold Coast Bulletin for their generous
donations.  Most importantly, a very big thank you must go to Mr. de Boer for
all of his hard work and help in running the Garage Sale and Mr. Trethewey for
his help on Saturday.<p>
<p>
Mr. de Boer, Jenny Corkery, Shelley Herd, Genevieve Bax and I will be
travelling to Brisbane on Thursday to present half the raised money to the
Burns Unit and the other half to a representative of Tjandamurra.  To all those
people who contributed in any way to our Garage Sale, thank you once again.<p>

<b></b>Auxiliary supporters will recall the tremendous prizes
donated by Robina Town Centre and other Gold Coast businesses, which we raffled
at the recent Melbourne Cup Lunch.  You will also recall that the Auxiliary is
a non-fundraising group, however, due to the wonderful generosity of those
businesses, the opportunity to hold the raffle was too good to miss.
Consequently, at the end of the Auxiliary's 1995 and 1996 term, the sum of
$1425 excess funds are held.<p>
<p>
The Committee has decided to use those funds for the purchase of redwood
seating, which will eventually be housed at the new swimming pool complex and
shade trees to be planted where needed.<p>
<p>
Once again, we thank all the parents who have supported the Parents' Auxiliary
over the past two years and we look forward to seeing you again in the new
year.  Happy Holidays!!<p>

<b></b>The Year 8 Luncheon was held last Friday in the Great Hall.
It was a time to reflect over the events of the first year of High School.<p>
<p>
James Brown was a very competent Master of Ceremonies and kept everything
running smoothly, as well as on time.  A very good Year 8 Report was given by
Andre Dauwalder and Sharon Malecki proposed the Toast to the school.  It was an
opportunity for many students to be involved, to contemplate the past year's
progress as well as enjoy their lunch.  It also gave the chance for the Year
8s, as a Year Group, to say thank you to their Tutors who have guided and cared
for them on this foundation year.  As well, students said thank you to those
students and staff who have made our school what it is today.  Our School
Captain, Tim Pearson, was the guest speaker.  His address encouraged students
to strive for their best and explore all opportunities presented to them.<p>
<p>
Of course, the function would not have been able to take place without the
assistance of Mesdames Dauwalder, Hamilton, Brown, Fowdh and Affleck.  To these
ladies we all say, thank you.<p>

<b></b>In an attempt to help the Year 7 students understand the
real meaning of Christmas, I read them a poem at a special Chapel service this
week.  It had been a favourite of many children when it was published in one of
the school readers years ago.  In the poem "The Fire at Ross' Farm", Henry
Lawson tells of the bitterness that was felt between a squatter and a selector
in the early days of Australian settlement.  One would fill up the other's
wells with rubbish but then would find baits had been laid to poison his dogs
in retaliation.  Came a bushfire and it seemed as if one would lose his ready
to harvest crop, the only thing that would financially carry him through the
next year.<p>
<p>
Just as it seemed that the fire would take all with it, his enemy, together
with a dozen farmhands, appeared on the scene and saved the day.  The poem
finished with<p>
  " ... two grimy hands together joined<p>
  And it was Christmas Day."<p>
<p>
Forgiveness is the bottom line of Christianity, and Christmas.  God being
willing to send forth his Son to forgive people, and for them in turn to
forgive others.  Sometimes that is hard, especially when some terrible wrong
has been committed.  But with God's help it is possible.  Children will have
their fights and disagreements - but notice how quickly they are ready to
forgive and forget.  That is why Jesus used them as models for adults to
emulate.  So trusting.  So loving.  So forgiving.  <p>
<p>
May the Christ-child bless you all this Christmas and in the days that lie
ahead.,<p>

<b></b>Somerset College set an Australian record for the most
participants at one venue on one day when 366 students from 26 State and
Independent schools attended the Gold Coast Primary Schools Finals Day.<p>
<p>
The Somerset No. 1 Team of Chris Page, Damon Jackson, Rhys Rakauskas and Robert
Kingston easily won the grand final against the teams from St. Kevin's, Benowa
and Emmanuel.  They therefore regained the trophy won by St. Kevin's last year
and built upon their win in the Queensland Primary Schools Event earlier in the
year.  Damon Jackson continued his excellent recent form by winning the
individual championship with Rhys Rakauskas second.  The Somerset number two
team comprising on this occasion Mitchell Carey, James Littlejohn, Finley
Taylor and Rhett Parker won the A grade competition which was a very fine
result.<p>
<p>
The Gold Coast Chess Club held its Masters Finals Day and Club Championship
presentations last Sunday.  Damon Jackson won his rating group in the Masters
whilst Chris Page aged 9 drew with David Smerdon aged 12 who has just returned
from the World Under 12 Championships with an equal 10th position.  Matt Sonter
is the Under 18 Club Champion, Chris Page Under 16, Rhys Rakauskas Under 13 and
Mitchell Carey Under 10 Club Champion for 1996.<p>

In Somerset College Chess Laver House took out primary house Chess whilst Chris
Page won the top of the ladder trophy and Richard Laufer the ladder climber
trophy.<p>
<p>
We now wish our students well at the Australian Junior Championships in Perth
in January and hope that a number of other young Somerset players will aspire
to reach a high level in their chess.<p>

<H2>1997 Somerset Celebration of Literature<BR>
13 th  - 16 th  March 1997</H2>
<H3>Contacts:<BR>

<HR>
The 1997 "Somerset Celebration of Literature" will be a cultural feast of reading writing books and people.  This exciting festival has been heralded as "...a highlight in the Literary Calendar..."
<P>
In this our fourth Celebration we present prominent  Australian and overseas writers.  The four day programme provides stimulating sessions which will appeal to a wide range of audiences from young students to mature adults.
<P>
You are invited to join us in the discussions, debates, lectures and informal talks that will fill the programme.  And there is more, much more.  The atmosphere will be enhanced by marquees and music, food and wine.  Book buying and book signing in the specially presented bookshop are both interesting and socially  pleasing activities.
<P>
<H3>THE DR. COLLEEN MCCULLOUGH LECTURE SERIES.</H3>
The celebrated author draws upon her impressive academic background and literary talents to present three outstanding lectures.  These will be open to everyone on Thursday and Friday.
To our delight Dr. McCullough is our guest speaker at the Literary Dinner to be held on Friday night.  A dinner not to be missed.

<H3>BREAKFAST WITH THE WRITERS</H3>
If it is true that we show our true colours before breakfast, then don't miss the opportunity to see the true colours of our writers on this year's programme.  Meet the author of the current novel you have embarked upon  over a coffee and croissant.
<P>
This week-end is designed to satisfy all the senses from breakfast, through to a  feast for the ears on Saturday evening with our <B>MASTER MUSICIANS SERIES</B> performance being staged on Saturday evening.  Pure enchantment will emanate from this Chamber Concert beginning at 5.30pm with a Schubert String Quintet in C.  This will be followed by a selection of Waltzes for piano for four hands by Johannes Brahms and after an interval, where we will offer our guests complimentary wine, the evening will conclude with the Carnival of the Animals.  This unforgettable work by Saint-Saens was originally written for a private function , as the composer did not allow its publication, except for the famous cello solo of "The Swan".  It was only after his death that the public heard the whole work and fell in love with it. 
This combination of literature and music is natural and one we feel can only bring warmth to the heart and soul of all whom join us.

<H1>SOMERSET COLLEGE <BR>
UNIVERSITY STUDIES PROGRAMME
</H1>
</center>
 Somerset College participates in the Open learning Tutorial Assistance Programme  in conjunction with Griffith University (Queensland) and  Monash University (Victoria).  The scheme involves the provision of  tutorials in a variety of first year university subjects for selected students enrolling in these subjects through Open Learning Australia.   The subjects currently being studied are within the Business and Arts areas. Subjects on offer this year are Philosophy, Psychology and Marketing. In addition to these subjects, the College hopes to offer Modern Standard Chinese(Mandarin), French in Action, German, Greek, Indonesian Studies, Italian,  Introductory Japanese and Spanish in 1997. These languages will be offered subject  to sufficient numbers and the availability of tutors.   Other subjects will be added in the future particularly in the areas of maths and science.
 <P>
Students  enrol in  1-4 subjects  ( 4 subjects per semester equals a full time tertiary load).   Each subject  involves a two hour lecture/tutorial once a week.   Assessment is through the Open University and consists of assignments and a final exam. The programme operates in the evenings (5.00PM- 9.00PM).   Tutors are all well qualified in their disclipines and are approved by the Universities offering the subjects through Open Learning Australia.
<P>
All Open Learning subjects offered under this programme are accredited University subjects, carrying with them the guarantee of credit transfer among all participating Universities.  Students have the option of transferring from the Open Learning Programme, to a University, (subject to meeting entry requirements) or completing their degree entirely as an Open University student.  The College undertakes to counsel its students as to the avenues available to them, depending on their courses and progress.
<P>
 The programme suits those who:
<P>
<UL>
<Li> did not obtain a place at a University, or the University of their choice, but have the ability to undertake tertiary studies;
<Li>would  like to study under the Open Learning system, but feel in need of support and stimulation of tutors and fellow students to ensure them of success;
<Li>would like to stay on the Gold coast, at least initially;
<Li>would like to work at a full or part time job and study at night.
<Li>able  students in years 11 and 12  at Somerset College are also given access to this programme with  notable success.
</UL>
<P>
The current cost for participating  students  will  be the $322 Open Learning Resource Fee/ unit (which covers  print materials) and tuition charge of $200 per unit.  The cost of any prescribed texts must be added to this.
<P>
The selection of applicants will be based on the evidence provided by the applicant of: motivation, ability and suitability.  Applicants must provide documentation and/or references supporting their application and be willing to attend an interview, and an acceptance test if required.
<P>
Those interested should obtain and  complete an application form from the school and   mail, FAX, Email or hand deliver to the school.  An interview will then be arranged, and notification of acceptance, or otherwise will follow as soon as possible.

<H1>SOMERSET COLLEGE JUNIOR SCHOOL</H1>
</center>

Situated on the beautiful Gold Coast, about one hour south of Brisbane, Somerset College Junior School is a co-educational, day school for children from Preschool 
(aged approx. 5 years) to Grade Seven (aged approx. 12 years).
<P>
We have two streams at each level, except Grade Seven, where we accept around thirty new students each year, forming a third class.  This provides a transition into our Senior School, beginning at Grade Eight.
<P>
We are a very happy school, with a group of overly dedicated, enthusiastic teachers and 
around five hundred, energetic children.
<P>
Preschool to Grade Seven, all have email access, and these addresses can be found on our <A HREF="http://somerset.qld.edu.au/email.html">Home Page</A>, under the staff headings - I know students would love to hear from you, if you would like to correspond!
<P>
As Term Four begins, a number of classes have established their own home pages and these can also be found on our <A HREF="http://somerset.qld.edu.au/email.html">Home Page</A> - so please have a look.  We would love to hear comments back from you.
<P>
Last Term finished in a hectic way - a number of Year 6 and 7 students travelled to Cairns and stayed with students from Trinity Anglican School.  We visited Moore Reef, Kuranda and the Tjapukai Dance Theatre in Smithfield (and much, much more!!) - if you get up that way, each venue is well worth seeing.  Whilst this trip was voluntary, the other students were treated to a week of activities at school, including a visit from the R.A.A.F Dog Squad, which proved to be a most informative afternoon.  Numerous other activites were also undertaken.
<P>
Year 5 returned from their camp during the same week - check their home page for further information.
<P>
As the Junior School becomes more proficient in creating our Home Pages, it is hoped that every class will publish themselves through our site.
It would be especially great to hear from some other Primary schools - what are you doing with the Net - any good ideas you'd like to share?? Just let us know.

<h2>The Chaplaincy Team</h2>
The Rev John Donnell........................Uniting Church<p>
The Rev Geoff Beel...........................Anglican Church<p>
<hr>
<p>
<p>
Somerset College is a non-denominational school in the main-stream Christian tradition.  <p>
<p>
<h2>Pastoral Care</h2>
Pastoral care in the school is considered to be a high priority.  The two Chaplains  have among their
responsibilities the pastoral oversight of the school community.  This not only involves students, but
also their families. As in the traditional parish, there are those who are sick or sad, lonely or confused,
or seeking counseling among other things for baptism, confirmation or weddings.<p>
<p>
<h2>Worship<i></h2>
</i>Worship is part of the school experience for its members.  <p>
There are two occasions each year when the whole school family meets for worship: the Annual
Family Service usually held at the end of February, and "Carols in the Quad" held in the last few
weeks of the school year.<p>
Each student attends either a Junior School or Senior School Chapel each week and in addition each
House in the secondary school has a Chapel to commence the day on one morning of each week.<p>
Family House Chapels are held for each of the five Houses each semester. <p>
A Service of Holy Communion is held in the Chapel at 8 am on the first Thursday of each month
in school term time.<p>
<p>
<h2>Service</h2>
The school takes pride in the contribution made by students to the community at large.  Among the
groups that have benefitted are Red Cross, World Vision, Community Aid Abroad and Care Flight
Helicopter.<p>
<p>
<h2>Teaching</h2>
<p>
The Chaplains are also substantially involved in the <a href="R_ED.HTM">Religious Education Program</a> throughout the
school.<p>

</CENTER>
There have been two great decades for the establishment of independent schools in Australia.  However, they are separated by a century.  More AHISA schools were founded in the 1880's (33) and the 1980's (38) than any other decade in Australia's history.  Altogether there are around 280 schools whose Heads are members of the Association of Head of Independent Schools in Australia (AHISA).<BR>
Somerset, established in 1983, is part of this tradition and has quickly developed to play its full role in this country's proud tradition of excellent education in both the state and private sectors.<BR>
As we approach the new millennium it is just as well to reflect on the time scales involved in education.<BR>
Pupils entering school in 1997 will not matriculate until the year 2010 and they will work and raise families during the first half of the next century.  I have not the slightest doubt that Somerset will continue to provide first rate education throughout that century and well into the future.<BR>
So you can see that those with the responsibility for the welfare of schools have to be planning well ahead.  I think that Somerset has been particularly fortunate to have a school community which shares a vision for the future of the school and have been prepared to get behind the school with encouragement and to provide financial support.<BR>
No better illustration of this would be found than in the Olympic pool project, which has only been made possible by the fundraising, and by the cooperation of all sections of the school community - the School Council, the Foundation, the P&F, the Old Students Association and individuals from the school community.<BR>
Both the pool and the new west wing of the quad will be completed during 1997.<BR>
This represents the largest development phase of the school's history and will have a significant impact on the overall appearance and provisions of resources.  It is a very exciting time.<BR>
Another Somerset milestone for 1997 will be the Ten Year Reunion for the matriculating class of 1987.  Their plans for a 'Back to Somerset Weekend' are already well advanced.  There are many staff who taught these men and women, including some foundation staff who were the Year 8 teachers in 1983.<BR>
How the school has changed since then.  We never realised that the hardships of those days would be rewarded so fully.

Christmas is a time of giving and a time for reflection.
<P>
The Somerset family has undoubtedly reached a stage where giving in many different ways has reached a level of great pride to all of us.  I am not a believer in good things happening in sudden breakthroughs - more that they emerge as a series of small advances.  And so it is with philanthropy at Somerset - generosity has increased gradually but measurably over the last seven years or so.<BR>
As one of the main advocates of philanthropy at Somerset I would like to take this opportunity to thank all those involved with personal generosity in 1996.  Whether it be donations to the 2000 Club, Annual Giving Appeal, the supporting of charities by Somerset, or the volunteering of time and skills to the Foundation, P&F, Auxiliary, Former Students or various sections of the school, we all play a part in building this vital spirit.<BR>
On a personal basis, may I say that personal relationships formed with many of our supporters have added greatly to my enjoyment of my involvement at Somerset.<BR>
I hope and pray that philanthropy at Somerset will continue to grow as I believe that not only is it essential for the long term wellbeing of the school but also because it reflects true love for the school.<BR>
May I take this opportunity to thank the following supporters of the Foundation in 1996:

<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Reviewing Your Will</TITLE></HEAD>
<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"> 
<CENTER>
<H3 >Somerset <IMG SRC="http://somerset.qld.edu.au/somelogo.gif" HEIGHT=60 WIDTH=60> College<BR><A HREF="Lifetimes_Dec_1996.html">Lifetimes Dec 1996</A></H3><H1>Reviewing Your Will</H1>
</CENTER>
<BR>
It is important to review your Will on a regular basis (once every three to five years).  There can be many reasons which cause you (the Testator) to review your Will.  Some of the more common ones are as follows:-
<P>
1.	Marriage  It is not generally realised that if a person who has 	made a Will gets married then this revokes their Will unless the 	Will is made in contemplation of marriage.
<P>
2.	Divorce  A divorce doesn't automatically cancel a Will in most 	Australian States.  However in Queensland divorce has the effect 	of cancelling any benefits given in the will to the Testator's ex-	spouse.
<P>
3.	Death of a Beneficiary  If a beneficiary in a Will dies before the 	Testator and has been left a specific gift then you will need to 	make changes to the will to leave that possession or asset to 	someone else.  If you fail to do so and the Will does not have a 	general clause covering this circumstance then there will be an 	intestacy so far as that particular gift is concerned (i.e. that asset 	will be dealt with according to a fixed set of rules laid down by 	the Government and not according to your wishes).
<P>
4.	Death of an Executor  Quite often the Executor will die before the 	maker of the Will and if you have taken the precaution of 	appointing two Executors there will still be someone who can 	finalise your affairs in the event of your death (assuming that 	the second Executor does not also predecease you).  If you 	appoint one Executor however and you have not reviewed your 	Will regularly then a special application has to be made to a 	Court to appoint another person to finalise the Estate.  This can 	be a time consuming and costly affair.
<P>
5.	Inheritance  You may be left a hefty inheritance yourself which 	may change completely the way in which you wish to dispose of 	your Estate.  This would be a good time to review your Will.
<P>
6.	Further Children  Most people will want to make provision for all 	of their children in their Will and the birth of another child, 	whilst being a time of great celebration, should also be a time for 	reviewing your Will.
<P>
7.	De Facto Relationships  You may wish to make some specific 	provision for your new de facto spouse or, to the contrary, you 	may wish to specifically provide in your Will that they are not to 	share at all in your Estate.  In either case it is a time to review 	this very important document.
<P>
8.	Travel  Who knows what ills can befall you while you are 	travelling.  Before you leave town it would be a good idea to 	meet with your Solicitor to review your Will.
<P>
9.	Change of Laws  You should look to protect your hard earned 	assets from the clutches of the revenue authorities.  	Governments are always enacting new laws to take our hard 	earned money from us, even after our death, and a regular visit 	to your professional adviser will update you on any major 	changes and allow you to take what steps you are legally 	entitled to in order that you may minimise the effect of such 	changes upon your Estate.
<P>
When reviewing your Will you may also wish to make a bequest to Somerset College.  When dealing with bequests it is always helpful to remember the words of Lord Birkett of England who said, "When you have left someone a legacy in your Will, the only decent thing to do is die at once."

</CENTER>
Annaleise Grummit won't be 17 until April 1997, but already she's represented her country internationally and come home a winner.
<P>
Annaleise was one of only four Australian secondary students chosen for the International Chemistry Olympiad in Moscow in July. She was also the only girl, and the only student from Queensland.
<P>
When she got to Moscow she found there were 175 young chemistry enthusiasts from 45 nations, only 24 of them girls.
<P>
Undaunted by jetlag, poor food involving a lot of beetroot, a shabby hotel and a gruelling exam schedule, Annaleise powered on to win the bronze medal.
<P>
"The boys on our team soon found the only McDonald's in Moscow", said Annaleise, but it's more likely she owes her success to meticulous preparation and a sheer love of her subject, than to Big Macs.
<P>
Winning the bronze medal was the culmination of a process that had begun more than a year before, soon after Annaleise came to Somerset,  when she and 4 other Somerset students began special Chemistry tutorials with Deputy Head <A HREF="mailto:bgallus@somerset.qld.edu.au">Bev Gallus</A>, designed to prepare them for the qualifying exam in October.
<P>
"Annaleise is really a delight," said her tutor.  "You only have to explain something to her once and she understands it.
<P>
"She's a very talented student:  extremely focused and very hard working as well."
<P>
In the first round, Annaleise was one of only twenty students chosen from the 500 who sat the exam, to go to the Australian Chemistry Olympiad at Deakin University in Geelong  in January.
<P>
"I wasn't really expecting it.  It came as a great surprise," said Annaleise about her initial success.
<P>
During the Australian Olympiad the students sat for two practical exams, and in March, another two theoretical papers.  When the results came out, Annaleise had emerged as one of the best of the best in Australia, and went on to prove she's one of the best of the best in the world.
<P>
Travelling to Moscow Annaleise missed a couple of weeks' school, visited London and Cambridge as well as Russia.  In Moscow she went to the circus, the Kremlin, Red Square, an art gallery and a monastery. 
<P>
When she came home, she topped her year in English, Maths B, Maths C, Chemistry, and Physics, and was second by a whisker in Biology.  
<P>
With more achievement and travel behind her than many people experience in a lifetime, Annaleise is now ready for the next exciting phase.
<P>
"I'm doing a Bachelor of Science at the University of Sydney where they have an advanced Science program," said Annaleise.
<P>
"And after that I'm not really sure.  I'll see where that takes me, maybe research, or medicine, or maybe biochemistry.  I can't be bothered to stress about it."
<P>
It's a philosophy that's worked so far.  
<P>
In Moscow, Annaleise and her fellow Olympians had to sit for a continuous 5 hour Chemistry paper, oblivious of the distractions of international travel, dodgy nutrition, and a totally unfamiliar environment.  You get the feeling that after that, nothing will ever be hard for Annaleise again.      <BR>

</CENTER>
The hardest thing Kiah Wood had to face at the end of her final year's schooling, was choosing a future from the many options open to her.
<P>
She won a Vice Chancellor's Scholarship to Bond University and has decided to take on Arts/Law, but for Kiah Wood that won't be nearly enough.
<P>
"It'll be good because it's local, and because I can get through it faster and do some travelling.  Eventually I'd like to go further than that, study overseas maybe, and do some post graduate work."
<P>
In the past three years since she came to Somerset, Kiah has simultaneously completed her Senior studies and the first year of an Arts degree through open learning.  
<P>
She had been accelerated through her early schooling in Sydney, and again from years 9 to 11 at St Hilda's, so Kiah would have been graduating at the end of last year but for the decision to extend her studies by a year.
<P>
"It's been pretty hectic," was Kiah's mild description of the past 3 years,  in which she completed Psychology, Sociology, Commercial Law and History at University level,  topped the class in all her high school subjects, and performed the lead roles in consecutive Somerset musicals:  Florence in Chess, in 1995, and Eva Peron, in Evita.  
<P>
At the same time she's completed her 6th grade Music exam in classical singing. 
<P>
"A lot of those subjects, particularly drama and singing, are just fun to me," said Kiah, trying to minimise her outstanding success.
<P>
But according to her mother, Kiah showed signs of being an extraordinary student from her earliest years.
<P>
"She would debate with me from about the age of 3," laughed Coleen Wood.  "She loves to organise, she loves to direct, (in drama) and at Somerset she's just thrived."
<P>
During the holidays Kiah is working at Party World, often having to take on the role of a medieval princess, a job that involves both drama and music.
<P>
Later, she's off to Hamilton Island where the Somerset vocal quartet Vojazz has picked up a summer job.  
<P>
The future for Kiah remains unpredictable but it's bound to be triumphant:  she could end up the smartest girl on the musical stage, or the most musical lawyer in court:  The Singing Attorney perhaps?

<BR>
A look at Somerset's results in the "OP Stakes", a weight-for-age event.
<P>
The term "Overall Position" or "OP" first became part of the everyday vocabulary of students and parents in 1992.  This followed one of the recommendations of the Viviani Report, a review of tertiary entrance procedures in Queensland, which was completed in 1990.  The much maligned TE Score was quietly - or not so quietly - laid to rest, and the OP rose like a phoenix from the ashes.  Eligible students receive an OP in the range 1 to 25, the "best" OP of 1 being received by approximately 2% of students across the state.  The Board of Senior Secondary School Studies is responsible for determination of OPs from data obtained from schools, and from the Queensland Core Skills Test.  Figure 1 below shows the average OP distribution across the state over the last three years.
<P>
Figure 1	Average OP Distribution, State, 1992-1994
<P>
 
<P>
South Coast Educational Region is a convenient basis for comparison encompassing an area from the NSW border to the southern suburbs of Brisbane, and west to include Beaudesert.  In 1992 it contained a total of 31 secondary schools with Year 12 students.
<P>
The Somerset 1992 Seniors, a group of one hundred and six, set an almost insurmountable target for later groups when they recorded a total of nine OP1 results, or 8.5% (cf. 2% state-wide), a significantly better performance by that criterion than any other South Coast Region school, and seventh in Queensland.  Indeed, only one other school in the Region also recorded nine OP1 results, but that from a student body of nearly two hundred.  This group also set the standard in the "league tables" which compared percentages of students achieving OPs in bands 1 to 7.  At over 29%, the 1992 Seniors were equal first in the Region.
<P>
Publication of the "league tables" by newspapers, and the resultant "grading" of schools by criteria based on OP performance, saw the beginning of the debate which was to continue, at varying levels of intensity, up to the present day.  At the time of this first release, <A HREF="mailto:barnison@somerset.qld.edu.au">Barry Arnison</A> commented on the analysis:
<P>
"We are delighted to find ourselves at the top of the list of academic results for the (South Coast) Region . . . virtually all our students sit for an OP.  The only possible question is whether this type of analysis adequately reflects the whole range of extra curricular and caring activities that are so important in schools."<BR>
1993 saw the Somerset cohort of one hundred and ten students maintain the position of excellence established by the 1992 group in the Region, as Table 1 below shows.  In addition, they were ranked in the top twenty schools in the state.
<P>
Table 1	OP Analysis 1993
<P>
		% OP 1-7	% OP 1	% OP 19-25<BR>
     Somerset	37.3	6.4	10.0
<P>
By 1994, South Coast Region contained 35 schools with Year 12 students.  Somerset was "ranked" third.
<P>
Table 2	OP Analysis 1994
<P>
		% OP 1-7	% OP 1	% OP 19-25<BR>
     Somerset	30.7	4.3	11.3
<P>
By 1995, the critics of publication had triumphed, the data were exempted from the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act, and release of the data by the Board of Senior Secondary School Studies ceased.  Some schools were, on request, prepared to release the data pertaining to their own results, and these were published in the "The Weekend Independent" on April 19, 1996.  Somerset's results were consistent with the results of the preceding three years.
<P>
Table 3	OP Statistics 1995
<P>
		% OP 1-7	% OP 1	% OP 19-25<BR>
     Somerset	36.8	5.1	5.9
<P>
If OP "performance" is included as one of the factors to be considered in evaluating the worth of a school, then consistency of results over time may well be a more reliable indicator than "one-offs".  Here are Somerset's results, over the four year period.  The data are shown as a "cumulative distribution" adding percentages of successive bands to finally total 100%.
<P>
Figure 2	Cumulative Distribution 
<P>
 
<P>
The most important feature is the consistency of the results.  In particular, the percentages of students in OP bands 1-8, and the absence of students from the lowest two bands.<BR>
Let's now look at a comparison of our average compared to the State-wide figures, also averaged over the four year period.  Again, the consistency of results in the top bands and the relative paucity of results in bands 19-25 is apparent.
<P>
Figure 3	Average OP Distribution Somerset v Queensland
<P>
 
<P>
	Note:  Bands are paired - i.e. 1&2, 3&4, etc - except band 25.  I've "illegally" 	doubled it to retain relative parity with other combined bands.
<P>
Perhaps the most significant feature is the sudden variation in the comparison around band 12/13.  In bands 1-12 Somerset Seniors maintained a consistently higher percentage representation compared to the state average, while from band 13, the percentage was quite significantly lower.  This under-representation becomes particularly obvious below band 18 (and drops to zero in bands 24 & 25!).  Indeed, over the four year period in excess of 60% of our students have placed in the top 40% of the state compared with 26% in the lowest 40% of the state.
<P>
The consistency of Somerset's performance in the "OP Stakes" is reinforced when it is realised that we are the only school in the Region to have placed in the top three every year that results were released - in fact, no other school has even placed twice.  It's an enviable record.
<P>

Somerset primary school children had a brush with indigenous art when Aboriginal painter Biggibilla spent a week at the school as artist in residence.
<P>
With the help of students from across all grades, Biggibilla produced a mighty diptych, whose two panels each measured 2 metres by 1.4 metres.
<P>
The visit was facilitated by gallery owner Bruce Watling, who met Biggibilla, and knew of Somerset's interest in art.  
<P>
Biggibilla had taught art in Italy.  95 percent of his paintings are sold in Europe, but Bruce Watling thought it was time Australian children felt the benefit of Biggibilla's artistic vision.
<P>
"They learned a lot about aboriginal culture and about art," he said.  "It was a great hands on experience for them."
<P>
And for Biggibilla, who now lives at Mt Tamborine, the experience was equally rewarding.
<P>
"I look forward to showing my work, paintings and sculpture, to new people and passing on something of Aboriginal culture to them," he said.
<P>
"If I can do that, then I'm happy."
<P>
The painting Biggibilla created, with the help of his Somerset apprentices, has been donated to the school, and will eventually hang in one of its new buildings.<BR>

Multi-talented pair, Hayley Tarr and Simon Lu have this year represented Somerset College in the state wide 'Department of Education Competition', their talent gaining them second prize for their entry in 'An Export Challenge'.<BR>
In early September Hayley and Simon completed two essays, one in English and the other in Japanese, discussing the benefits of a Queensland product or tourist destination.  The competition called for the students to meet with a representative group of business people from a foreign country of their choice.  Hayley and Simon decided on the topic of the exportation of prawns from Queensland to Japan.<BR>
The pair made a fine team.  Hayley, a top student in English, prepared the English essay, while Simon who is outstanding in Japanese, a language he has studied since Year 7, wrote the Japanese version.<BR>
The purpose of the competition was to promote export awareness and to encourage the use of the students' language skills and cultural knowledge.  An opportunity was also provided to consider the roles of cultures and languages in international business.<BR>
On October 17, Hayley and Simon travelled to Brisbane where they were awarded their second prize of $75, a prize organised by the Department of Education in conjunction with International Business Week.  The presentation took place at the Sheraton Hotel where Hayley and Simon were invited to attend a seminar entitled Global Business Week.  A number of important speakers were involved including Mrs Barbara McGeoch who is a successful exporter and Dr Gary Chittick, researcher and lecturer in International Business at QUT.<BR>
Hayley and Simon have previously appeared in Somerset Lifetimes for their achievements in Westpac Maths and Science Competitions.  <BR>
How, I wonder, will they be representing Somerset College in the future?  Congratulations to you both on this fantastic effort.

</CENTER>
Somerset College seems to thrive on awards.  There are awards of all types given and received throughout the year, but one in particular seems to stand out and it isn't something that can be won.  It's all about spirit.  Peter Randell (Year 7) and Emma Dalton (Year 12) are two people who have shown they have more than their fair share and were therefore natural choices for the 'Spirit of Somerset' Award.<BR>
The Spirit of Somerset can mean several things.  Emma believes it is an award given to someone who works hard and makes the most out of everything while Peter says it is the spirit of the school itself and the people in it.  Either way, both are sure that it is important as it unites the school community and will always exist within the school and live on in our former students.<BR>
The qualifications for winning the Spirit of Somerset Award are not defined, although it has a lot to do with having the right attitude, extensive involvement in school and extra curricula activities and putting 100% effort into everything you do.  Emma is the Environment Group Coordinator and suspects that her success in expanding and increasing the school's awareness of the environment group contributed to her winning the award.  Peter, who does "ok in class", thinks that being polite to everyone and not causing trouble gave him the advantage.<BR>
Each year it is very hard to predict the recipients.  Emma and Peter were both quite surprised when their names were announced at the Founders Day Ceremony.  The only hint was the short description of the winner given beforehand.  The similarity to themselves and the person being described was a little more than coincidental!  Emma and especially Peter (who was hoping he would be considered) are very proud of their awards and happy to be recognised, but Peter knows, "it's okay to be proud, as long as you don't gloat .. but it is important to live up to it."<BR>
As Emma Dalton says, "The Spirit of Somerset is in everyone, it's just a matter of finding something you are interested in and doing the best you can."

</CENTER>
During the last week of Term 3, I had the good fortune to attend the Grade 10 camp in the Mount Barney National Park area.  I say good fortune because I really enjoy the camping experience.  There will be many who find the tents too flimsy, the ground too hard, the sun too hot, the food too bland and the company of young people too tiresome.  But I enjoy it!<BR>
My earliest recollection of camping was with my parents and brother and sisters.  We would adventurously set off in the old Standard Vanguard, towing a trailer containing a tent, stretchers, food and cooking gear and travel for two or three weeks pulling off to the side of the road to find a camp site at night - caravan parks were few and far between.  We explored much of south-eastern Australia in that way.  It was cramped in the car, the tent was of the old ridge-pole type and cooking was usually over an open fire.  I admire the tolerance and patience of my mother and father.  They were great times of discovery and learning,

For a school with such a short history, Somerset has done very well in the Queensland History Teachers Association History Competition.  Each year we have managed to win a least one of the sections between Years 8 and 12 in this prestigious statewide competition, and this year is no exception.  Graeme Cuthbert won the Year 11 section for Modern History and received $100, Leanne Hammond obtained a third in the Modern History section and received $35, and Esa Valttila, a Year 12 student, received a Highly Commended for his effort.<BR>
The students had to write an essay of approximately 1200 words on a hypothesis of their own design in either of the history fields.  The emphasis of this competition is on the student's ability to develop a well structured argument within the word limit and display good research skills.  Graeme hypothesised that 'The Russian peasantry, despite having a vast numerical majority, were actually of secondary importance during the transformation of Russia between the two World Wars'.  Leanne argued in her assignment that 'Stalin's achievements were limited and only obtained through great human cost, whereas the achievement of the post-Stalinist period until the 1970's were much more extensive and obtained at relatively little human cost'.  Esa hypothesised in his essay on 'the effects of the Vietnam war on the United States of America'.<BR>
Out of the 36 possible award places in the QHTA Competition, only four were filled by males.  <A HREF="mailto:rbeaumont@somerset.qld.edu.au">Roger Beaumont</A>-Wilkins, head of the History department, was not surprised at the lack of male representatives and said, "In recent years, a lot of energy and effort has gone into encouraging girls to take up science and maths options.  What has not been so publicly debated is the fact that boys don't feature very strongly in the humanities.  We should also be encouraging more boys to take up humanities subjects, because they're just as important if you're looking at a fully-rounded individual, if you're also looking at somebody who can understand the society they live in as opposed to knowing how the technical side functions."  He went on to say, "It's very pleasing to note that the only two male seniors who received recognition state wide, are both from Somerset."  Graeme and Esa did not believe that this History competition was indicative of any change in attitude from the boys, but thought the guys should 'get back up there'.<BR>
When asked about what they thought about their achievements, all said they were really pleased with what they had done.  Inspiration for these award-winning assignments seemed to come predominantly from their school history classes which demonstrates the good coverage of Somerset's history syllabus.<BR>
Thanks must go to <A HREF="mailto:rbeaumont@somerset.qld.edu.au">Roger Beaumont</A>-Wilkins for his help in the preparation for these assignments and congratulations to Graeme, Leanne and Esa for their hard work.  Next year Somerset will aim to continue its climb to the top in this competition and once again demonstrate our great depth of talent.

<BR>
The 15th of July 1996 saw the commencement of Somerset College's annual Science Week.  The week proved once again to be a great success and allowed the whole Somerset community the opportunity to focus on science and learn many new things about the fascinating applications of science in our world today.  The programme was designed to enthuse and to educate the students in all aspects of Science and, in this respect, it definitely exceeded all expectations.  Over the week, there were several visiting scientists who addressed audiences from the Preschool to up to Year 12 classes, with interesting, informative and often very entertaining presentations.  The students were involved in discussions, experiments and demonstrations with the visiting scientists which allowed them the opportunity to experience first-hand the wonders of Science and to learn from the experience of others.  Topics ranged from archaeology to electricity to worm farming, giving a very broad cross-section of many aspects of scientific work in our community.<BR>
The Scientist in Residence for Science Week 1996 was Sue Solomon.  Sue is an archaeologist and anthropologist whose expertise includes the analysis of animal manure from our archaeological past.  She spoke to students from Years 6 to 12 on various topics relating to archaeology including evolution and carbon dating techniques and also entertained her audiences with many fascinating tales of her time spent in the wilds of Africa.  The great contribution she made to the Somerset Science Week 1996 was invaluable and greatly appreciated by all who were able to hear her speak.  The students all benefited from her extensive experience in the field archaeology.<BR>
Professor Jack Kelly from the University of New South Wales brought the Australian Institute of Physics Annual Youth Lecture for 1996 to Somerset College during Science Week.  His lecture, entitled "Physicists Do Everything!", was a description of the ion implantation technique and its applications to many diverse areas of the world today.  He also concluded his presentation with a number of different physics demonstrations.  His lecture was interesting and very entertaining and was enjoyed immensely by all who attended.<BR>
Dennis Price from Tube Makers Australia, a local metalwork and foundry company from Currumbin, also led some of the Science week activities.  He spoke to a number of different year levels about metallurgy and his involvement in this industry, and gave some demonstrations of foundry and moulding equipment used at the foundry in Currumbin.<BR>
Another of the visiting scientists was geologist Simon Lang, from Queensland University of Technology.  Students from Years 10, 11 and 12 were privileged to hear from Dr Lang, who spoke about various different aspects of geology and the advantages of pursuing geology as a university subject and encouraging them to consider the possibility of geology as a future career.<BR>
Archaeologist Dr Eleanor Crosby was another of the visiting scientists.  A Somerset parent herself, Dr Crosby addressed a number of primary school classes on her work in this field.  She led the lower primary classes through practical activities involving 'hunting and gathering' skills - using digging sticks to uncover hidden 'minties' in the sand pit, weaving baskets and mats and throwing spears.  The students responded well to these 'hands-on' activities and learnt a lot about the work of an archaeologist through Dr Crosby's demonstrations.<BR>
Alistair Beer from SEQEB, addressed the Year 9 students on the subject of electricity.  He gave a very enlightening and enjoyable presentation, which was also invaluable in introducing the topic of electricity in the lead-up to their unit of study on this subject in Semester 2.<BR>
Another of the visiting scientists was one with whom Somerset College is not at all unfamiliar.  Former student, Phillipa Jones, now a final year undergraduate Science student at Griffith University, returned to Somerset for Science Week to present various demonstrations to students in the primary school.  Phillipa addressed students from Preschool to Year 7 with fun displays on how science relates to our everyday lives.  The older students were given the opportunity to construct their own parachutes which they then took for a test flight from the balcony of the science block - an activity thoroughly enjoyed by all.<BR>
Issues relating to worm farming and environmentally-friendly living were covered by Valerie Tancred.  Valerie, a local resident, runs a worm farm here on the Gold Coast.  She spoke to students of the primary school about worms and their benefit to the environment.  The students thoroughly enjoyed her presentation which was complimented by the involvement of these small and very slimy creatures.<BR>
The primary school students were also treated to practical science displays from Year 12 students.  About twenty Year 12 chemistry students visited different junior school classes, with displays from rat dissections to changing colours and smoke displays to eggs being mysteriously sucked through the narrow necks of milk bottles.  The younger students thoroughly enjoyed this and the seniors enjoyed sharing a little of their experience in the more interesting aspects of science.<BR>
During Science Week, students from Years 7 to 12 also competed in the RACI National Chemistry Quiz.  This is a competition in which students from all over Australia sit an exam and prizes are awarded in each year level according to merit.  Somerset achieved very high results this year with many high distinctions, distinctions and credits going to students in all year levels.<BR>
One outstanding performance, however, came from Mark Haron, a Year 7 student at Somerset College.  His exam was one hour in length and constituted 30 multiple choice questions.  Mark put in an excellent effort achieving 100% in his exam!  For this remarkable result, he was awarded a 'Plaque of Excellence'.  This really was a wonderful accomplishment since he only has two science lessons per week and was competing against students in Year 8, with a much broader knowledge of science than he and his classmates.  Well done, Mark!<BR>
The Somerset College Science Week 1996 was, overall, a great success.  The students from all year levels gained a much greater understanding of science and its practical applications through the opportunity provided for them to hear from people who are actually involved in science in the real world.  These visits from a wide variety of scientists sparked much interest among the students for the subject of science.  The influence these people have had on the lives of the students will be long-lasting and extremely beneficial as the young Einsteins of Somerset College nurture and develop this interest in the fascinating field of science.

</CENTER>
Somerset College almost scooped the pool when the awards were handed out by the Association of Development and Alumni Professionals in Education in September.
<P>
This year the Association's bi-annual conference was held at Bond, attracting more than 300 Development Officers from universities and private schools all over Australia.
<P>
Somerset won 3 of the 11 categories in which awards were made (open to universities and schools Australia wide), and were asked to accept a fourth, in  honour of the volunteers who do such a valiant job at many schools.  
<P>
The program for the Somerset Celebration of Literature was named as Best Special Events publication, and the award was accepted by layout artist Peter Sexty whose flair and originality made the program a small literary work of art.  
<P>
The school also won the award for Best Fundraising Campaign over $1million.  The citation was accepted by Linda Radford, Chairman of the Somerset 2000 Club, the driving force behind the fundraising push for the pool.
<P>
Somerset Lifetimes was recognised as the Best Alumni publication  in Australia and Karen Berkman accepted this award.  One of Somerset's most tireless workers, Lynn Tainton, accepted the Volunteers Award on behalf of the hundreds of volunteers who get big things done at so many schools.
<P>
Somerset's Development Officer, <A HREF="mailto:ggardiner@somerset.qld.edu.au">Graeme Gardiner</A>, who is responsible for all the areas in which the school was awarded, said he was extremely pleased to see the school's efforts recognised at ADAPE's answer to Hollywood's Oscars.

</CENTER>
A Somerset quartet who have spent 1996 singing at school functions will finish their senior year on a high note when they perform at Hamilton Island over Christmas.<BR>
The group, Vojazz, was formed earlier this year because background music was needed for a Somerset 2000 lunch and that performance has snowballed into a year of professional and amateur appearances.<BR>
Vojazz soprano Kiah Wood says the quartet was never really planned, it just came together.<BR>
"We didn't say 'We're going to form a quartet'.  It just happened.  It was convenient to get together."<BR>
Bass singer Tim Pearson recalls that their foundation was based on their being the only four singers left at Somerset from the Show Choir of 1995.  Kiah and Tim were joined by the other two remaining members, John Nicholson who sings tenor and Belinda Flindell, alto.<BR>
"We had the experience," he explains.<BR>
The rest, as they say, is history.  The group have become a firmly entrenched part of the Somerset culture, performing at the Literature Festival and subsequent 2000 Club functions.<BR>
"We became The Quartet," explains Kiah, who is quick to point out that the group is really made up of more than just the four students.<BR>
"(Director of Music) <A HREF="mailto:sroberts@somerset.qld.edu.au">Sue Roberts</A> is almost a part of it.  We get a lot of our music from her."  And what of next year, when they are no longer at Somerset?  "We'll just have to come back and raid her drawers," laughs Kiah.<BR>
The Hamilton Island job during Christmas is just one of the professional appearances the group are soon to make.  Following a performance at the ADAPE Conference this year, Vojazz was approached by a Brisbane agent to sing carols at Myer, where they will perform during the week before Christmas.  There's also a contract to perform in Vanuatu which is yet to be confirmed.<BR>
<A HREF="mailto:sroberts@somerset.qld.edu.au">Sue Roberts</A> says the professional jobs mean the students are now reaping some benefits after putting in so many years of singing for the school.<BR>
The singing includes lead roles in Evita and Chess, involvement in the Show Choir, membership of the boys and girls choirs and, of course, this year's work in Vojazz.  That, says <A HREF="mailto:sroberts@somerset.qld.edu.au">Sue Roberts</A>, amounts to between 5 and 15 hours of rehearsals per week.<BR>
Kiah is quick to point out that rehearsals are far from dull.<BR>
"Our rehearsals are so much fun.  We all enjoy it," she says.  "The longer we're together the better we get."<BR>
And Tim, who says he only took up music as a sixth subject, says it's a great way to wind down from physics or maths.<BR>
Tim says the Hamilton Island job came their way because the group can read the music for their four-part harmony and while Christmas will be the theme for the next few weeks, Vojazz has plenty of other material to draw from should the occasion demand it.<BR>
"We do anything and everything," explains Kiah.  "Forties, Fifties and Sixties music.  Pop, ballads, jazz.  One 2000 Club function had a beach theme so we did Beach Boys."<BR>
They are "a pretty versatile bunch," according to <A HREF="mailto:sroberts@somerset.qld.edu.au">Sue Roberts</A>.<BR>
And what of Vojazz once Hamilton Island is behind them?<BR>
Kiah and Tim would like the group to stay together but both are realistic that the new year will hold different directions for each group member.<BR>
"We'll have to see what the future brings," says Kiah.<BR>
Whatever their future, that 'fifth group member' <A HREF="mailto:sroberts@somerset.qld.edu.au">Sue Roberts</A> and guests at those school functions will be sorry to see the members of Vojazz go.

</CENTER>
The Somerset Junior Performing Arts Festival was held on the third weekend in July and proved to be another great success.  Over one thousand students from between Murwillumbah and Brisbane attended the two-day annual event, which was inaugurated four years ago.<BR>
Preparation for the event commenced months earlier, with venues and adjudicators needing to be organised, plus certificates and ribbons to be prepared.  However, there was no doubt that all the hard work had been well worth it once those involved saw the looks on the young performers' faces after having won a prize.<BR>
Co-ordinated by Helen Little and adjudicated by Josef Aronoff, <A HREF="mailto:sroberts@somerset.qld.edu.au">Sue Roberts</A>, Jenni Sknetker, Naomi Middlebrown and John Charlton, the Festival took place at five venues around Somerset College.<BR>
"It gives these kids a tremendous feeling of encouragement to know that all their hard work has been recognised," said Helen Little.  "After all, music should be fun and the aim of this festival is to provide an opportunity for young musicians to enjoy themselves and experience a sense of achievement, without competitiveness."<BR>
The adjudicators thoroughly enjoyed themselves as they handed out the many prizes - from the Preschooler who proudly wore his red ribbon pinned to his shirt all day, to the very successful Year 7 students who took out many prizes, to the high school students who came to help, it was a very satisfying two days for Helen Little and everyone involved.

</CENTER>
<BR>
The Junior School has had a very busy term in Public Speaking.<BR>
Firstly, the Annual Somerset Public Speaking Competition attracted forty keen participants from year 5, 6 and 7.  Their subject matter was both interesting and entertaining.  The standard exemplary and extremely difficult for our adjudicators to choose first place.<BR>
The winners were:<BR>
Year 5 - Jade Merlehan, Andrew Copperwaite<BR>
Year 6 - Alicia Blake<BR>
Year 7 - Mei-lin Robertson, Allison Weiss<BR>
The AB Paterson Public Speaking Competition followed giving 11 of our talented speakers an opportunity to compete in a large inter-school competition.<BR>
At the end of heat one our results reflected the high standard of our children with 9 out of the 11 contestants gaining a first or second place and qualifying for the semi finals.<BR>
Year 5 - Jade Merlehan 1st, Janessa Brown 2nd<BR>
Year 6 - Regis Broadway 1st, Deanna Watt 1st, Alicia Blake 2nd, Kirsty Burow 2nd<BR>
Year 7 - Mei-lin Robertson 2nd, Kate Dorrington 2nd, Matthew Lyon 2nd<BR>
The final results were outstanding.<BR>
Year 7 - Mei-lin Robertson 1st<BR>
Year 6 - Alicia Blake 2nd, Regis Broadway, 3rd<BR>
Our wealth of public speakers will certainly ensure excellence in many aspects of school life.

</CENTER>
Chess, Chess and more Chess!  Nineteen ninety six has certainly become one of the Gold Coast Chess Club's most successful years, with plenty of tournaments, Grandmaster visits and juniors' development.  The club has gone from strength to strength and now has approximately 90 members, a far cry from eight only five years ago.<BR>
The season began in January with the Gold Coast team, which was dominated by Somerset players, travelling to Sydney for the Australian Junior Championships.  Shortly afterwards Somerset had many teams participating in the Queensland High School Championships, with Somerset even entering a primary school team who proved themselves worthy of competing in the 'A' grade competition.  However the highlight of the year was the Somerset 'Chess Week' when four Grandmasters - Ian Rogers, Darryl Johansen (both from Australia), Lubomir Kavalek and Daniella Nutu-Gajic visited the Gold Coast and gave informative and entertaining lectures.  The first tournament during this week was the Gold Coast Open - a weekender attracting players from all over the country.  Next, the Queensland Junior Championship where Charles Pizzato took out the title; Chris Page and Mitchell Carey received first and second respectively in the Under 10 division.  The spotlight was also on the 'Young Guns Superblitz', where two Grandmasters challenged 15 year old Charles Pizzato and 11 year old David Smerdon to determine a lightning champion.  It was played under 'special' conditions which were especially suited for television viewing.  Ian Rogers emerged triumphant, however all four players displayed some exceptional chess with Smerdon and Pizzato each winning a game against their illustrious opponents.  Finally the Queensland Womens and Girls Championship was held at Australia Fair Shopping Centre.  The winners were WGM Daniella Nutu-Gajic and Jasmine Lauer-Smith, who are both from South Australia but unfortunately as non-Queensland residents were unable to claim the respective titles.  <BR>
In June the Somerset 'A Grade' team was successful in the Gold Coast High School competition winning the event and regaining the title from the highly acclaimed All Saints Anglican School team, who had previously been victorious.  Somerset were triumphant in the Queensland Primary Schools Competition and the Somerset 1 team displayed great talent in winning the event.  Chris Page, Damon Jackson, Robert Kingston and Rhys Rakauskas led all the way.  Mitchell Carey stepped in successfully when one of the players for the Somerset 1 team was ill.  The Somerset 2 team consisting of James Littlejohn, Mei-lin Robertson, Richard Laufer, Mitchell Carey and Jenny Chiu showed great fighting spirit to come second.  Both teams, as well as many other Gold Coast chess players, have been under the care of Andrew Allen - a very dedicated and hard working chess coach.  Andrew has worked wonders with the juniors and helped them to develop and expand their talents and determination for the game.<BR>
As the year draws to a close, many enthusiastic and budding chess players will be studying hard for another Junior Australian Championship, this time in Perth.  The team, led by <A HREF="mailto:ggardiner@somerset.qld.edu.au">Graeme Gardiner</A>, will spend two weeks on the West Coast mixing both chess and social events and amazingly Graeme has acquired a bus licence so he will be able to 'chaperone' the players around the city!  Finally, good luck to all involved in the Junior Australian Championships and keep a close watch on the chess scene as bigger and better things are planned for next year.

</CENTER>
My palms are clammy, my heart is racing as I hurry to the first class.  How could I be late - I'd left so much time and I want to make a good impression.<BR>
I open the door, and my worst fears are confirmed - the lesson has already started!  I glance around to find a spare place, give a tentative smile at a few familiar faces and slide self consciously into the nearest seat.<BR>
The teacher knows just how apprehensive we all feel and under her gentle guidance and inspiration we relax, feel secure, grow confident and even feel pleased we have chosen this course.  The afternoon drifts by, the sun dips down spilling into our classroom.  The years slip away and it is another hot afternoon, thousands of kilometres away and over a quarter a century ago.  A twelve year old girl daydreams out the window as a teacher explains the new decimal currency.<BR>
I am jolted back - Somerset College 1996.  We are all students again, mothers, grandmothers, doctors, lawyers, teachers and business women.  We are all there together to learn how we can help young Somerset students become better readers.  We have volunteered to be part of the "Support a Reader" programme.  Children who are having difficulty reading tend to read less and can quickly fall behind their peers.  The programme has been designed to establish a daily reading programme in a supportive environment.  The child is helped to become a more independent and proficient reader.  Improved reading skills will boost confidence, and promote their overall learning skills.<BR>
The weeks and the lessons fly by and under the tutelage of <A HREF="mailto:bmillican@somerset.qld.edu.au">Brenda Millican</A>, <A HREF="mailto:jrogers@somerset.qld.edu.au">Jenny Rogers</A>, Neill Whittington and Frances Corkery we are now brimming with helpful techniques to give and guide our young readers.  We learn how to encourage and inspire, how to listen and when to be silent.  Perhaps the most important thing we learn is what it is like to be a student again, we learn empathy.<BR>
Finally the big day arrives and it is time for us to go out into the classrooms and put our theories into practice.  Things don't always go according to plan.  During the programme we were informed that it is always helpful for the teacher to read a new book aloud before the student attempts it.  This allows the student to relax and become familiar with the content and help place any unfamiliar words into context.  This is great in theory, but none of the confident, brilliant 3R students I read with would have it that easy.  They preferred to launch into their books like a hungry person at a smorgasbord, devouring the pages and savouring the contents.  Over the months, 3R and I shared many literary feasts.  Some of the books were such a large helping that they had to be consumed over many weeks.  Others were a mere snack, and several were consumed in one sitting.<BR>
We laughed together over the antics of some very thin cats, fat pigs, hungry monsters, people from planet X, enormous crocodiles and a little brother who did not like having his hair cut.  My hour with 3R became one of the most enjoyable in my week.  There is nothing like sharing a good book with a new friend.  In addition to making good friends, I made a remarkable discovery.  Inside every student there is an enthusiastic successful reader, all they need is a supportive audience.<BR>
When I joined the Somerset family two years ago, I had only one child at the school - I now have hundreds.  So why don't you expand your family and join with me in the Support a Reader Programme in 1997. Oh, and the secret of Somerset ... They teach their parents well!!
<P>
<BR>
Happy reading,<BR>
Linda Radford.<BR>

</CENTER>
On Friday 13 September 250 children in Preschool, Years 1, 2 and 3 enjoyed a wonderful introduction to Spring by participating in the annual Beachathon.  The children, accompanied by 150 parents, grandparents and friends, trekked 5km along Burleigh Beach.  Gwen and John Fischer from the Spit Roast Company provided a delicious picnic lunch after the walk.  The day provided a great opportunity for children to enjoy the beach and sunshine and for parents to mix and meet other parents.  Close to $5000 was raised in sponsorship which is an outstanding achievement.  The winning class was Year 3R where thirty children raised a grand total of $900 in sponsorship.  What a mighty effort!  All these funds are used to purchase resources for the Lower Primary classes.

<BR>
Each year the children in Preschool, Years 1, 2 and 3 celebrate Book Week by dressing up as their favourite book character.  The day is a source of great excitement and enjoyment as the children parade in front of their parents.  The same old favourites appear each year including "Little Red Riding Hood" and "Hansel and Gretel", while this year Mr Maloney from "The Old Man and the Bear" and Moon Face from "The Faraway Tree" graced the stage also.<BR>
The lunch time party consisted of the favourite food of each of the characters.  Prune mice were happily consumed by a number of the Wicked Witches from the West!

<BR>
On Saturday 14 September approximately seventy Year 6 and 7 students boarded a Qantas flight for our week long trip to Carins.  Everyone was very excited and conversations were flowing easily.  We arrived in Carins, were met by our billets and left each other for their respective houses.  Sunday was a free day and our host families took us to a variety of interesting places in Cairns.<BR>
Monday we all went to school.  This was the first day of our competition.  The day was long and hot and we all participated in some form of sport, vying for the illusive TrinSet Trophy.  At the end of the day we returned to our host homes to prepare for a trip to the Great Barrier the following day.  On Tuesday at 8.00am we all met at the pier where the boat left for our trip to the Great Barrier Reef.  The trip took 2 hours and we stopped at a small island on the way where we were able to explore and go for a much needed swim.  We then made our way to Moore Reef.  Once there we spent the rest of the day snorkelling, which was wonderful.  Wednesday it was back to school for more sports, with us constantly trying our best.  That night we attended a Chapel Service held at school.  Thursday it was off to Tjapukai, an Aboriginal cultural centre where we learned how to take care of ourselves in the outback and listened to some fascinating folklore stories.  Friday we finished off the week with tabloid games, tests and quizzes.  That afternoon we discovered that Trinity had beaten us by only one game and they received the TrinSet Trophy.  Congratulations must go to Trinity Anglican College.<BR>
A fantastic time was had by all of us and we returned home on Saturday with many stories and great memories of our TrinSet experience.

</CENTER>
Wendesday 4 September was Somerset College's annual Community Awareness Day, organised by <A HREF="mailto:dstonier@somerset.qld.edu.au">Diana Stonier</A>.<BR>
Community Awareness Day is an important part of the Year 8 programme, with students spending the day giving service to the community.  Each House Group went to a different venue, either the Mudgeeraba Special School, Uniting Church, Pony Club, Nursing Home or the Neighbourhood Centre at Nerang.<BR>
Students were involved in a variety of activities, such as painting a shed, sorting clothes, helping to organise a concert or assisting the elderly.<BR>
However, the day held a few surprises as Chris Bamberry found out.  Chris fixed the plumbing at the Neighbourhood Centre and found the problem to be very interesting - 18 paint brushes lodged in the drain!<BR>
Involvement in Community Awareness Day is a wonderful way for students to better understand the varied needs of a community and how they can contribute to it.

Famine Fighters - Second in Queensland for World Vision
<P>
With all the troubles afflicting our word today, it is so easy to be overwhelmed with feelings of helplessness.  That is why it is such a wonderful and rewarding experience to join with the thousands of enthusiastic Australians, young and old, who commit themselves to World Vision and to help those in need all around the world.<BR>
It is particularly satisfying to learn that the Somerset College 'Famine Fighters' (junior school) have worked together to raise an outstanding amount of $3,555 which ranks us as the second highest fundraising school in Queensland!<BR>
Famine Fighters, organised through Rev. <A HREF="mailto:jdonnell@somerset.qld.edu.au">Geoff Beel</A>, encourages the children to gather sponsors and then go without food for anywhere between four and eight hours.  Thanks to the enthusiasm of the students and the generous support of parents and teachers, there was a tremendous response with over 250 junior school students participating.  Congratulations to all who took part, and a special mention for Michael Liu (6W) who individually raised $261!<BR>
The Secondary School World Vision programme is called '40 Hour Famine' and is led by Rev. <A HREF="mailto:jdonnell@somerset.qld.edu.au">John Donnell</A>.  It operates in the same way, except that the senior students are able to put in an even greater effort, by going without food for 40 hours straight in order to raise money for the less fortunate.<BR>
The generosity, enthusiasm and participation of all the students has once again been outstanding, and of course a very special thank you must go to the parents and friends of the students, whose marvellous support has made this programme possible, and indeed, extremely successful.<BR>
All the money raised by the students is passed on to World Vision, who use the funds to supply long and short term relief for suffering people all around the world.  They distribute 'Harvest Packs', allowing families to grow their own crops, provide emergency shelters, medical supplies, care for orphaned and abandoned children, reunite families, and supply food for displaced refugees and victims of famine.<BR>
Congratulations again to all involved, and especially to Rev. <A HREF="mailto:jdonnell@somerset.qld.edu.au">Geoff Beel</A> and Rev. <A HREF="mailto:jdonnell@somerset.qld.edu.au">John Donnell</A> for the time and effort they put in every year to organise this wonderful opportunity for us to help those less fortunate than ourselves, and to do something positive and valuable for our world.

During March this year, many of you would have seen the Gold Coast production of 'Oliver' at the Arts Centre.  It was certainly a fabulous performance which earned good reviews everywhere.  What you may not have known is that two Somerset students were involved in the production - as part of the cast.<BR>
When Ben and Josh Cooper auditioned for the show last year, neither thought they would get a part.  However, they were later surprised and overjoyed when they were both selected.  Rehearsals began in December.  There were many songs and dances that had to be learned before the show opened in March and the boys put a lot of time and effort into this preparation.  (Not to mention the effort and hours put in by their tireless parents!)  The boys performed in the chorus of 'Oliver' as 'Workhouse Boys' and part of 'Fagan's Gang'.  When asked if they were nervous about performing Ben replied, "We weren't nervous, we just wanted to get on stage."  This was the first big show that either of them have been involved in and it gave them a taste of show business.  Both boys had a great time performing and made many friends with the other stars of the show.  When closing night came, they were sorry the experience had to end.<BR>
Ben, who is in Grade 6, has been taking singing lessons for 2 years and played a lead role in the Junior School Musical.  He is also involved in the Performing Arts Festivals, Tropicarnival Eisteddfods and has piano lessons.<BR>
Josh, who is in Year 4, also enjoyed being part of the Junior School Musical.  He learns the guitar and will begin singing lessons soon.<BR>
Both enjoy singing and performing.  They thought 'Oliver' was a lot of fun and agree that performing is something they would like to do more of in the future.<BR>
Watch out Broadway, here come the Cooper brothers!

Welcome to another Kulcha Korner.  This semester has been very busy for all those involved in cultural activities at Somerset College.  Founder's Day kicked off this semester, and the Junior School Performing Arts Festival followed soon after.  This Festival is designed to allow students studying either an instrument, speech and drama, or singing, to perform in an eisteddfod situation without the stress.  Congratulations to all who performed, worked and organised this event.<BR>
The Senior School Musical's production of Evita, heralded the beginning of August.  After months of hard work and sweat from staff and students involved, the musical had it's spectacular opening on August 1st.  For a six night season, the story of Eva Peron's rise to fame and fortune in Argentina was portrayed on the Performing Arts Centre stage.  This was an event not to be missed and all comments were extremely positive.  To all involved a heartfelt congratulations is extended for the time and effort put into this production.<BR>
During this semester, the College hosted the final two recitals of the Westpac Master Musicians Series.  The first was a recital by Brian Hawkins and Friends.  This recital featuring viola player Brian Hawkins, was an excellent night and was enjoyed by all.  The music of Mozart was featured, with the Oboe Quintet and Piano Trio being performed. The final concert was presented by students of the Queensland Conservatorium of Music's Opera School.  Under the direction of stagecraft lecturer Guisseppe Sorbello, the students presented their recital in cabaret style with all performers on stage for the duration of the concert.  Repertoire from major musicals and operetta were performed including, among others, works by Sondheim, and Gilbert and Sullivan.  This was a particularly enjoyable evening, which was evident by the sold out booking sheet.<BR>
Also during this semester, many of the College's chamber groups performed at functions outside of the College.  The Clarinet Ensemble, Saxophone Ensemble, Show Choir, Vojazz and String Trio, have all performed for such functions as the Youth In Performing Arts Festival, in conjunction with the Tropicarnival Festival. These groups have held the banner high for the cultural life of Somerset College.<BR>
The College's Performing Arts students presented a showcase of entertainment and talent in the annual Cultural Collage. This event is mainly for the benefit of presenting the cultural awards, but the evening is also a concert with all the major performing groups presenting items for an appreciative audience.  Congratulations to all the performers on the evening, and also to the staff who directed groups which performed on the evening.<BR>
The Junior Schools second Junior Instrumental Concert was held at the beginning of November.  This concert has the reputation of showing what the Junior School students have been striving for all year.  This concert was well received by the audience and all students performed to the best of their abilities on the night.  Congratulations to all especially to those who performed solos on the evening.<BR>
This year's Cultural Calender will finish, once again, with Scholar's Day.  This day is the ultimate showcase of the talent Somerset College has to offer and a day not to be missed.
<P>
To all, a very Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.  May your Kulcha be good Kulcha.
<P>

At the close of 1996 it is time to reflect on our achievements for the year.  Our main works programme has been the building of the bus shelter and a donation of $50,000 to the pool fund.  Our main aim this year was to provide more functions where parents could get together, have some fun, and hopefully meet new people.  Attendances were not as high as we expected but those who did attend any of the functions had a wonderful time.  So we will push ahead with more and varied functions next year in the hope that there will be something that you, the Somerset family, will want to attend.<BR>
The Gala Ball was our most glamorous evening.  The Manhattan setting was a perfect foil for the men in their dinner suits and the sophisticated glamour of the ladies.  This year a few of the ladies went partnerless including myself but that didn't stop us dancing the night away with everyone else.  Debbie Tjoeng commented "this is the first Ball I've been to because Danny's always away, but I would come again next year by myself."<BR>
The Stampede was a fun night of hay rides and dancing with the 'Leaping Lizards'.  Held outside at the Koala House, bright coloured lights and blazing fires created the atmosphere for fun.  I heard the spit roast was the best beef Ross Sorbello had ever had.  Next year we will have it at a warmer time of the year.<BR>
The P&F's last official duty for the year was to take the Canteen and Somerset Shop volunteers to lunch.  This year we went to the Woodchoppers Inn.  Our volunteers are a tireless group who provide the support, energy and above all their time, asking in return only that our children and the school benefits from their work.  Many of them are working mums with very busy lives but they never say no as was the case with Kristy Affleck who was asked to help at the Year 8 Lunch, thus missing our lunch.  These ladies deserve our praise.  Why is it that so many give of their time so unselfishly.  I asked a few ladies at the lunch why?  The simple answer was that we love the school!
