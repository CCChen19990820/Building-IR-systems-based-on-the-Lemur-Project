<CENTER><H2>DETECTING MICRON-SIZE MOVEMENTS</H2>by Shawn Carlson<P>
</CENTER>
<P>There's a lot going on down among the microns. What we perceive as a rigid surface squashes easily under a
finger's gentle pressure when viewed from a distance of a
millionth of a meter. Increasing the temperature sends objects at
that scale into even more violent upheavals.
<P> Biological processes reshape many living things on this
scale. For example, every beat of an insect's dorsal
vessel--essentially, its heart--flexes its abdomen by a few
microns.
<P> Now, thanks to John R. B. Lighton, a biologist at the
University of Nevada, these tiny movements can be readily
detected. (Lighton is not only a world-renowned physiologist but
also a kindred spirit to amateur scientists everywhere, always
striving to find the most direct and least expensive solution to
vexing experimental challenges.) He realized that by detecting
the microscopic flexings of an insect's body, he could in effect
put a tiny stethoscope on the creature. This technique opens all
kinds of micromotions for study, including the slight distortion
of materials caused by changes in ambient temperature and
pressure.
<P> Lighton's ingenious method allows experimenters to embark on
a fantastic voyage into the microscopic universe. Now anyone can
detect movements as small as half a micron-about the wavelength
of visible light-for less than $40.
<P> Lighton senses micromotions by using minuscule magnets that
he attaches to the moving objects. He then relies on a special
sensor that picks up the variations in the magnetic field caused
by the shifting magnet.<P>

<B>INSECT STETHOSCOPE</B> relies on a chip called a Hall effect transducer (HET), which
is held to within a centimeter of the subject by a 12-centimeter-long plastic
arm. The device recorded the "heartbeats" of a cockroach nymph (graph). The heart
briefly paused after the 70-second mark because the experimenter distracted the
nymph with a hand wave.
</FONT>
</TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER><BR>
<P> The sensitivity of Lighton's detector depends on the fact
that all magnets are dipolar; they have a north pole on one end
and a south pole on the other. These poles would cancel each
other perfectly if they weren't separated by the length of the
magnet. This self-cancellation quality makes the strength of a
magnetic field fall quite fast over space. Tripling the range to
the magnet weakens the field by a factor of 27-the cube of the
distance. The size of the magnet sets the scale by which this
falloff can be quantified. The closer together the magnetic poles
are (that is, the smaller the magnet), the more rapidly the
magnetic field changes over distance. That in turn produces a
larger signal for a micron-size shift.
<P> It's easy to get micromagnets. You can buy so-called
rare-earth magnets from Radio Shack (part number 64-1895), which
sell for less than $2 a pair. They are tiny disks about 0.48
centimeter in diameter and 0.16 centimeter high (3/16 by 1/16
inch). At the surface, the magnetic field, which is oriented
perpendicular to the flat part of the disk, is about 20,000 times
that of the earth.
<P> If these magnets are too big for your project, then crush one
with a pair of pliers. Made from a brittle ceramic, they will
shatter into little shards. You need to make sure, though, that
you know the direction in which the magnetic field of these
shards points. Using nonmagnetic tweezers, position a fragment on
a piece of wax paper. Placing the second magnet underneath the
paper forces the fragment to align with the bigger field. Then
dab a dollop of paint or five-minute epoxy over the magnetic
speck. Once it sets, the magnetic fragment will easily peel off
the paper. Make at least 10 of these magnetic chunks, all
slightly different in size, to see which one works best for your
application.
<P> A Hall effect transducer (HET) senses the changes in a
magnetic field. A modern-day silicon miracle, it is small,
extremely sensitive and easy to use. Lighton recommends model
SS94A1F from Honeywell Micro Switch in Freeport, Ill.; call (800)
537-6945 for a distributor. A bargain at less than $20, this
device changes its output by 25 millivolts for each one-gauss
shift in a magnetic field.
<P> Secure your HET no more than one centimeter away from your
subject. For instance, if you are monitoring insects, you can
epoxy the HET to a rigid piece of plastic and hold it above the
subject with a device called Helping Hands, a soldering aid sold
by Radio Shack. A HET records all magnetic fields, including the
earth's. This indiscriminateness means that the detector will
always produce a large constant voltage signal (created by the
earth and the magnet). On top of this voltage constant will be
the small changing signal created by the magnet's motion.
<P> You can forget about trying to boost the signal with a single
operational amplifier (op-amp). A single op-amp cannot accurately
amplify a small signal on top of a voltage constant. What you
need is an instrumentation amplifier. Like op-amps,
instrumentation amplifiers are available as inexpensive,
integrated circuits. Entry-level devices cost about $5; the
Cadillacs of these chips sell for about $20. The AD524 from
Analog Devices in Norwood, Mass., works well; to order, call
(800) 262-5643, extension 3. You can also construct an
instrumentation amplifier from three type 741 op-amps.

</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P> If you're monitoring temperature or another signal that
varies slowly, use Lighton's slowly varying signal rendition of
the circuit. For flexing insect abdomens and other activities
that change significantly over 30 seconds or so, use the quickly
varying signal circuit. The circuit employs a clever technique
that should be in every amateur's (and professional's) tool kit.
<P> The trick begins by splitting in two the voltage from the
HET. One signal goes into the amplifier's positive input. The
other goes into a low-pass filter that only passes signals that
oscillate slower than about one cycle every 30 seconds. Because
an insect's heart contracts in much less time, the filter strips
out that signal and passes the large constant voltage (the DC
offset). This filtered voltage is then fed into the
instrumentation amplifier's negative input. An instrumentation
amplifier boosts the difference between its two inputs, so the
troublesome offset voltage is automatically subtracted, leaving
only the coveted signal.
<P> Signal wires can introduce extraneous signals. They act like
antennae, picking up electromagnetic energy, such as emanations
from 60-cycle power lines, and then dumping it directly into your
amplifier. To minimize the effect, keep the leads between the HET
and the amplifier short. Additionally, you should use shielded
wire. Lighton relies on three-core shielded cables. An
electronics store may stock them, or you can make your own. Twist
together three different colored wires, one each for the
positive, negative and signal leads of the HET. Wrap the wires
inside a layer of aluminum foil and connect the foil to the
circuit's ground with a short wire. For protection, add a layer
of duct or electrical tape around the foil. The filter circuit
provides another barrier to power-line noise. Finally, encase all
your electronics inside a grounded metal project box.
<P> You can read the output with a digital voltmeter or, better
yet, use an analog-to-digital converter to record the data into a
computer. Several software packages that link the signals to your
computer are available [see "The New Backyard Seismology,"
Amateur Scientist, April]. Use shielded coaxial cable for the
output connections, to prevent the HET from detecting the signal.
<P> Lighton obtained some remarkable results after he superglued
a whole rare-earth magnet to the abdomen of a <I>Blaberus
discoidalis</I> nymph, a relative of the American cockroach. With
the instrumentation amplifier's gain set to 100, the signal
caused by the contractions of the dorsal vessel-the insect's
heartbeats-is striking. After about 70 seconds of recording data,
Lighton waved his hand in front of the nymph. The insect's heart
stopped beating for several seconds. According to Lighton, that
happened because the creature's nervous system may be too limited
both to maintain circulation and to attend to stimuli.
<P> Of course, any crawling by the insect will disrupt your
results, so record data only when it is still. If the insect
moves, it will generate a huge voltage signal that jumps well off
the scale. In fact, Lighton reports that large signals occur
whenever the insect opens its spiracles to breathe, about once
every five to 30 minutes. By lowering the gain of your
instrumentation amplifier, you can also monitor insect
respiration.
<P> Recording the vital functions of insects is just one of the
experiments you can do. By attaching the magnet to the bottom of
a heavy pendulum and affixing the HET to the floor one centimeter
below the magnet, you can make an extremely sensitive
seismograph. It can significantly extend the lower range of an
amateur seismography station, as described in the April column.
<P> By connecting the magnet to a sheet of Mylar stretched
tightly over the mouth of a jar, you might record the atmospheric
pressure that pushes against the membrane. Other suggestions
appear on the World Wide Web site of the Society for Amateur
Scientists. I invite you to invent, experiment and discover-and
let me know what you find.

<FONT SIZE=+2><B>THE CULTURE MACHINE: SCIENCE AND ART ON THE WEB</B></FONT><BR>

<P>
<B>Review by Ben Davis</B>
<BR><BR>

<P>What distinguishes formerly classified digital satellite
image archives from abstract art? As I gaze at my computer screen
I can't always tell the difference. The line between art and
scientific artifact has become a blur as cultural and scientific
institutions move onto the Internet, suddenly sharing the same
on-line formats and virtual architectures. In the process, the
World Wide Web seems to be creating a broad definition of culture
that forces us to recognize that science and art are parallel
aspects of the same basic creative impulse rather than unrelated
pursuits. It is revealing to examine how artists and art museums
are using the Internet; they are particularly sensitive to
aesthetic issues, and eventually the ability to express meaning
visually will help determine whether the Web succeeds or fails as
a new medium.
<P>
The on-line experience currently has some serious limitations.
Anyone who has explored the Web will have no trouble thinking of
the effort as trying to beat the clock. Depending on the
capabilities of your computer, modem and network server, you will
soon become acquainted with the inadequate pace of information
delivery, especially for pictures, movies or sound.
<P>
This condition is symptomatic not only of a medium in its infancy
but also of a profound shift in the perception of ideas. A
picture is literally worth a thousand words in the digital
currency of bits and seconds. A page of text traveling via the
Internet might arrive nearly instantaneously. A small,
"thumbnail" image of the Mona Lisa might take a few seconds to
reach your screen from the Louvre in Paris. Anything approaching
the detail of the original painting might take months-and no
video monitor could begin to display such detail. The computer
has made obvious an understanding of the physical art object-what
Marcel Duchamp once called a "delay"-a thing so laden with
emotion and thought that it is capable of slowing our perception
of time. The time of the on-line art object is very slow.
<P>
As a result, there is a distinct difference between an art book
or gallery and an on-line source. In the physical world, it may
take a while to find a book or get to a gallery, but once you are
in the right place all the pictures are accessible immediately.
The Web can take you "anywhere" instantly, but seeing the
pictures there takes almost forever.
<P>
This situation makes for a curious tension with the Internet's
role as a "store and forward" medium, one that allows the sender
of a message to spend a great deal more time composing it than
the receiver does reading it. This condition is very much like
that of a painter who labors for months to produce an exhibition.
At the opening of the show, the work is displayed as if it had
happened all at once. The paintings have been "stored" by the
painter until the gallery decides to "forward" them to the
public. Paintings are stored information every bit as much as any
other kind of data that one can download. The painful crawl at
which digital art must arrive, however, highlights the fact that
art on the Internet is not a thing, it is a condition: a
conceptual place for an aesthetic idea to unfold and be
communicated.
<P>
Scientists are excited by the prospect of placing research on the
Internet, thereby increasing access to valuable databases. In a
like way, the digital artist can broaden the composition and
dissemination of an artistic condition, enticing the viewer into
the process. A number of Web sites are not catalogues of
preexisting works but rather aesthetic experiences-anything from
traditional sketchbooks, raw and uncensored, to attempts to use
the Web as an interactive kinetic canvas, with which the person
visiting the site participates in the creation of an artwork.
What happens to the art if the computer crashes? Is this the
ultimate ephemeral art? It is not just an artist's concern: in a
medium where anyone can publish to everyone, the intellectual
stability of peer-reviewed science journals sits cheek by jowl
with the speculation of dilettantes.
<P>
Andy Warhol would obviously have loved the Web. What better way
to play with the sacred images of high art than in a digital
form? <A HREF="http://www.clpgh.org/warhol/">The Andy Warhol Museum</A> would seem a natural starting point
for our exploration. But, sadly, the Warhol museum site has none
of the playfulness of the artist. Instead it simply shows views
of the galleries and lists the paintings and prints in the
museum's collection. Distinctly un-Warhol-like.
<P>
Museum sites in general are problematic: they function somewhat
like exhibition catalogues, offering static records that may be
interesting to the serious scholar but are often dull for the
casual visitor. They also lack the physical presence of museum
architecture that can instill in the viewer a contemplative
experience. Some sites, such as <A HREF="http://www.echonyc.com/%7Ewhitney/">the Whitney Museum</A> or <A HREF="http://www.ago.on.ca/">the Art
Gallery of Ontario</A>, are more innovative and attempt to
compensate for this weakness in part by trying to get the
Internet visitor engaged enough to send e-mail or even become an
"electronic member" of the museum.
<P>
An odd hybrid site that mixes curatorial passion with a nonacademic approach is Roy Williams's
<A HREF="http://www.ccsf.caltech.edu/%7Eroy/vermeer/index.html">Paintings of Vermeer</A>. Williams, a researcher at the Center for
Advanced Computing Research of the California Institute of
Technology, is not a professional artist or museum employee. He
is simply a guy who loves the work of Jan Vermeer (1632-1675). His Paintings of Vermeer site helps you "find your closest
Vermeer" by locating all the paintings on a world map. You can
also rank the paintings by popularity, based on how many "hits"
each virtual painting on the Web site has received over an 11-day
period. In a nod to a historical approach, Williams allows the
user to view the paintings chronologically. He also includes
his own interpretations of the paintings in an accompanying text.
<P>
How-or whether-Williams obtained permission to make digital
copies of Vermeer's works is not revealed on his Web site. This
missing information reminds us that the Web is a popular medium
and that, in its present, unregulated form, the expert and the
amateur exist side by side, for better and for worse. The
enthusiasm engendered by the ease of access to the Web elevates
the fan of Vermeer to digital curator status. Although
professionals may rage against such disregard for law and
convention, the Vermeer site boldly says that individuals may
not know anything about art, but they know what they like, and
they are not afraid to tell you about it. 
<P>
The Warhol site and the Vermeer site, however, invite a more
serious question about the nature of culture on the Web: What if
I actually want to study at an academic level? Where do I go if I
really am interested in detail? I joined the Getty in part to aid
in answering such questions. The <A HREF="http://www.ahip.getty.edu/">Getty Information Institute</A> has
made an effort to answer that question with a.k.a., an automated
guide to cultural data.
<P>
The <A HREF="http://www.ahip.getty.edu/aka/">a.k.a. Web page</A> contains a thesaurus of art-history
terminology and a database of artists' and architects' names. Both can be used to
guide searches through other archives, among them Getty's
comprehensive index of current literature on the history of
Western art and an extensive database of architectural journals
and magazines. Ultimately, the same basic suite of tools could
make cultural databases all over the world available to anyone
with a Web browser.
<P>
Elsewhere on the Getty Web site you will find another Getty print
publication, <A HREF="http://www.ahip.getty.edu/intro_imaging/home.html">"Introduction to Imaging: Issues in Constructing an
Image Database."</A> Writing about digital imagery is, after all, a
task most appropriately carried out on the Web. This tutorial on
digital art on-line has the "real" digital images that the print
version can only represent in ink.
<P>
One of the most intriguing aspects of the Web, of course, is its
ability to do more than passively gather information; it also
allows the user to share in the process of what happens to that
information. Two artists who have taken advantage of the
interactivity and democracy of the Web are Komar &AMP; Melamid,
Russian emigres supported by the <A HREF="http://www.diacenter.org/">Dia Center for the Arts</A>, a
multidisciplinary contemporary arts organization based in New
York City. They have approached the Web with irony and humor that
strikes at one of the fundamentals of high art, "taste." Marshall
McLuhan once called taste the first refuge of the insecure, and
certainly Komar &AMP; Melamid have taken this thought to heart.
Their site, <A HREF="http://www.diacenter.org/km/index.html">The Most Wanted Paintings</A>, is a homage to the notion
that, by asking the right questions, anyone can create art.
<P>
Michael Govan, the director of Dia, explains: "The Most Wanted
Paintings, as well as The Least Wanted Paintings, reflects the
artists' interpretation of a professional market research survey
about aesthetic preferences and taste in painting." Intending to
discover what a true "people's art" would look like, Komar &AMP;
Melamid request that the Web user fill out a survey that asks
everything from "How carefully do you consider most of your
spending decisions?" to "In general, would you rather see
paintings of outdoor scenes, or would you rather see paintings of
indoor scenes?" The artists then tabulate the results and create
artworks that reflect the surveys. 
<P>
Komar &AMP; Melamid, like many businesses, are interested in the
Internet as a market research tool. The underlying questions,
Govan explains, are those that many of us think of but few dare
ask aloud: "What would art look like if it were to please the
greatest number of people?" Or conversely: "What kind of culture
is produced by a society that lives and governs itself by opinion
polls?"
<P>
As a public art medium, the Web has a facility like no other
public cultural architecture: not only can you talk back to it,
you can even talk to other people who talk back to it. Consider
<A HREF="http://fileroom.aaup.uic.edu/FileRoom/documents/homepage.good.html">Antonio Muntadas's File Room</A>. Muntadas, a media artist, built a
real, three-dimensional installation of file cabinets and
documents about censorship and then created an evolving virtual
file room on the Web. The project, hosted by the Randolph Street
Gallery and installed in the Chicago Cultural Center, indexes
cases of governmentally suppressed speech from classical Greek
drama to contemporary art and journalism. An Internet user can
search documents by country, date, medium censored or the kinds
of views that have been silenced. Those who have been censored
can add their own documents to the collection.
<P>
As the site's disclaimer asserts, "The File Room claims no
scholarly, editorial or scientific authority, but instead
proposes alternative methods for information collection,
processing and distribution, to stimulate dialogue and debate
around issues of censorship and archiving." Such debate is
particularly apt in light of ongoing attempts to bar from the
Internet itself material that some consider offensive or
indecent.
<P>
Electronic communication has been a key factor in popular
uprisings around the world during recent years (the role of the
fax machine in publicizing China's Tiananmen demonstrations being
perhaps the most notable instance). And the Web appears to be
continuing that tradition by serving as a venue for art that
might otherwise have no legitimate home. <A HREF="http://www.gatech.edu/graf/">Art Crimes</A>, for
instance, is a gallery of graffiti art from a number of U.S.
cities and 19 countries around the world. The site states,
"Protect your history by making it digital. Tell your story,
express your opinions and publish them. Make your own Web site
and link up with us. Tell the world about your zine or your art
enterprise.... Hook up." 
<P>
Graffiti are almost always instantly painted over by other
artists, gangs or by the authorities, so Art Crimes acts as an
electronic archive of otherwise ephemeral works. The site also
has articles, interviews, music and even a section on subway
graffiti, including tips on how not to get hurt. This kind of
site suggests that new art forms are part physical and part
virtual. Can new kinds of scientific scholarship-possibly
constructive, possibly corrosively inane-be far behind?
<P>
Other sites raise even more profoundly the question of just what
is or is not art. By signing an Executive Order on February 23,
1995, directing the declassification of intelligence imagery
acquired by the first generation of U.S. photoreconnaissance
satellites, President Bill Clinton set the stage for a historical
and geographic archive-and, in some sense, a marvelous trove of
found art. In the opening decade of the 20th century, artists
such as the young Pablo Picasso were inspired by the first aerial
photographs, which revealed a startling way of seeing the
landscape. Abstract forms and textures in these images appeared
to be flat and dimensional at the same time, as if you could see
a three-dimensional object (a cube, say) from all sides at once.
What are these <A HREF="http://edcwww.cr.usgs.gov/dclass/dclass.html">digital satellite photographs</A> to the artists of
today? On the Web, are they not common resource material for the
artist as well as the scientist?
<P>
One of the great values of the Web is that it makes us take a
fresh look at familiar concepts, inspiring a reexamination of
rarely reconsidered categories like "art" and "science." Art is
not only, as we commonly assume, about personalities, art
objects, criticism, scholarship or history. It is about a deeper,
slower reality that changes the way we understand the world. The
Web presents art as a category of interest, but once we begin to
investigate that category we find ourselves immersed in such a
variety of interlinked territories that we must admit that the
category is more than the sum of its parts.
<P>
The shift from memory to written record occurred some 5,000
years ago, when written property deeds replaced physical objects
such as rings and daggers as seals of commitment. Today it seems
we are moving from written record to collective electronic
memory. This collective memory is open and accessible and
presents us with a dynamic palette; it forces creativity on us.
In a sense, looking for art on the Web <I>is</I> art on the Web,
much like the gesture of a painter searching a canvas for a
vision.

<B>FEYNMAN'S LOST LECTURE: THE MOTION OF PLANETS AROUND THE SUN</B> <BR>

<I>by David L. Goodstein and Judith R. Goodstein. W. W. Norton,1996 (book and audio CD, $35).</I>

<P>Richard Feynman's prowess as an educator is well documented in
this recently unearthed "lost" installment from his introductory
physics lectures. With bulldog tenacity, he methodically
reconstructs Isaac Newton's singular insight that the elliptical
orbits of the planets can be explained entirely by the basic laws
of geometry and gravity. The authors' chapters add helpful
scientific background and reminiscences about Feynman. The
greatest treat, however, is listening to Feynman's New
York-accented voice reciting the lecture on the accompanying
compact disc.

<P><HR><B>SUMMER STARGAZING: A PRACTICAL GUIDE FOR RECREATIONAL
ASTRONOMERS</B> 

<BR><I>by Terence Dickinson. Firefly Books, 1996
($18.95).</I>

<P>In this large-format volume, Terence Dickinson eschews star
charts in favor of real photographs of the night sky. The result
is an unusually attractive and straightforward introduction to
the heavens (though urban dwellers might be disoriented by the
many faint stars they will not be able to see). The book also includes a series of intelligent essays
and a brief overview of the sky in the cooler seasons.

<P><HR><B>MINUTES OF THE LEAD PENCIL CLUB</B> 

<BR><I>edited by Bill Henderson. Pushcart Press, 1996 ($22).</I>

<P>The 40 contributors to this little volume share a deep skepticism
about the value of the computers and Internet connections that
increasingly permeate our society. There are some incisive
moments here, but the overall dour tone does little to advance
either the stabs at irony or the attempts at social commentary.
And one has to wonder about the book's cluttered mixture of short
essays, quotes and cartoons. Is it an alternative to hypertext or
an unwitting homage?

<P><HR><B>SEARCHING FOR MEMORY: THE BRAIN, THE MIND, AND THE PAST</B>

<BR><I>by Daniel L. Schacter. Basic Books, 1996 ($27).</I>

<P>Daniel Schacter has synthesized a broad overview (77 pages of
footnotes and references!) of the ways that our brains store and,
all too often, distort the past. Loss of memory is always
unsettling; as illustrated by the legal dramas surrounding
controversial "recovered memories" of abuse, the mind's blurring
of objective truth also has the potential to ruin lives. Schacter
argues passionately for a better appreciation of both the power
and the limitations of our mental records.

<P><HR><B>THE ULTIMATE EINSTEIN</B> 

<BR><I>Byron Preiss Multimedia, 1995 (CD-ROM for Windows or Macintosh, $49.95)</I>.

<P>The gorgeous, convoluted design of this CD-ROM offers yet another
instance of multimedia smarts run amok. Serious and often
thoughtful information is filtered through a needlessly
complicated interface. Albert Einstein's ruminations appear on a
fancy, rotating scroll that displays but 10 lines at a time;
meanwhile concepts such as wave-particle duality, which would
benefit from graphic treatment, are relegated to terse glossary
definitions.

<P><HR><B>KRAKATAU: THE DESTRUCTION AND REASSEMBLY OF AN ISLAND ECOSYSTEM</B> 

<BR><I>by Ian Thornton. Harvard University Press, 1996 ($39.95).</I>

<P>What if you could wipe the earth clean and start all over
again? Nature answered that question on a small scale in 1883,
when the eruption of Krakatau, a volcano in Indonesia,
obliterated essentially all the local flora and fauna. Within a
generation the islands were again green, and today they teem with
life. Ian Thornton's jargon-heavy style sometimes drowns out the
inherent drama of the story, but the underlying message of life's
remarkable resilience emerges loud and clear.

<BR><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH=335> Cambridge, Massachusetts, is a
long-urbanized, low-rise city of under 100,000, its population
nearly constant for a century, with scant parkland or undeveloped
lots. Gardens and lawns it has in plenty, but no one could point
to a commercial farm. In 1995 one very successful local
enterprise made surprising news, its agricultural technology at
the highest level, its urban standing crop worth six figures in
one indoor loft! Its 1/200th acre of deep-green marijuana beds
were of a strain pampered for generous yield of illicit resin,
won (and then busted) under a phalanx of fluorescent tubes
glowing behind closed doors and blanked windows.
<P>Twenty years before this covert, postmodern agronomy, we had
grown real grain crops in our own Cambridge garden open to New
England rain and sun. We sowed only a few square feet of wheat,
for our minute city harvest was intended not as an economic act
but as an educational one. By sharing the old complex experiences
of growing our daily bread, we hoped to grasp the metaphors
brought so long ago to poetry and language out of the fields of
grain.
<P>We began as novices. (Phil had never lived on a farm, although
Phylis, a keen gardener, had spent childhood summers in Alpine
fields.) One thing was plain: first get the seed. A city farmer
seeks the phone book. The White Pages reach out 10 miles from
downtown Boston to list what is still the nearest farm supplier.
The friendly man who awaited our naive request did not understand
at once what we sought. "Wheat seed?" he repeated, a bit puzzled.
Of course: <I>all</I> wheat is seed. What we wanted is always
called seed wheat. He brought us the smallest quantity he could
easily weigh out. It was a sight, dyed a daunting, inedible pink
to announce its mercurial antifungal dressing. We would not be
tempted to eat these seeds before planting.
<P>Our Cambridge backyard is not large: we planted a small first
plot with the seed. Soon enough, over the summer weeks, a few
dozen pale-green shoots sprouted to 16 or 20 inches high. But
that was all they did, although they had seemed such healthy
blades of grass. Autumn came, then winter, and every shoot died
back. We had failed utterly in our amateur farming.
<P>One day as winter wore on, Phil called in excitement from the
downstairs room, where many books arrive each day, their senders
hopeful of a review. "It's<I> winter</I> wheat!" A volume on
wheat and its characteristics had arrived (written by R. F.
Peterson), and he had quickly snatched the point. We were
agronomically on schedule through the time of first frosts. We
were painstakingly assured in print that once spring came, the
blades would lengthen and green again. The vital grass would
blossom and form a head; by full summer the seeds would fill and
ripen. That is the behavior of the most important North American
varieties of wheat.
<P>So it came to pass. In mid-July we found a sickle to harvest
the ripened grain. Then we threshed it with our fingers, piling
grains of wheat along with the glumes and light chaff. We
winnowed the threshed grain from the rest by dropping it into a
bowl while we fanned hard to blow away the residues. Then we
ground our handful of grain by mortar and pestle into coarse
flour. That year our Thanksgiving dinner was graced by a rather
heavy roll, made ceremonially from our first crop.
<P>We had so clear a sense of learning that we tried again the
next year on a larger scale, a weeded "field" now a couple of
yards on a side. By then neighborhood health food stores had
arrived, and it was easy to buy wheat we could choose either to
eat or to sow. Soon we learned why the most successful wheats of
the Green Revolution (and the rice, too) had been bred to inherit
the short habit of dwarfed varieties. When the wheat was nearing
maturity, a fierce July thunderstorm knocked most of our
top-heavy plants over every which way. We faced the farmers'
bane: lodged grain, heads beaten flat to the earth. Harvesting
that tangled and muddied crop from the ground was difficult; we
saved all we reasonably could.
<P>Some days later our neighbor's daughters came to our garden
door. The two wondered if they could still gather some good of
our tumbled wheat. The young women gleaners in our field evoked
that Ruth who bore King David's grandfather after asking, "Let me
glean . . . among the sheaves."
<P>Now the precise old words of art were made vivid. First had we
sown, and then tarried, to reap in haste after the storm laid
flat the stalks of our tallish strain. Others who were landless
gleaned a little of our lost bounty. Grinding to coarse flour was
hard work still, if not so bitter as the toil of the old serving
woman who ground meal daily for that arrogant crowd of suitors
lounging in Ithaca, eager to claim Penelope and her legacy from
royal Odysseus. The glorious language in the Scriptures and in
Homer was at least a little our own by right.
<P>The domestication of grains spans 11,000 years (with clear
precursors long before), but the next century is likely to see
unprecedented change. The Green Revolution was apt opportunism:
the farmers' grief over lodged grain had stimulated breeders to
work on crosses with dwarf strains for both wheat and rice.
Stiff, short straws supported bigger grainheads without buckling.
More important, yield increased under large additions of
fertilizer.
<P>It won't be so simple for the next vital task, doubling our
crops perhaps for the last time. Much detailed attention to the
spectrum of crop limitations in the diverse hands of farmers is
needed. Ahead are 50 years of modest but locally effective
novelties in field management of the crop cycle and in new,
precisely tailored strains. Other major crops-say, improved
millets and sorghums for drylands or even leguminous nodules
bioengineered into the cereal roots to replace nitrate
fertilizer-may well appear.
<P>After a full century of high biotechnology, an optimist may
conjecture that a stabilizing world of 10 or 12 billion people
will have outdone today's best marijuana lofts. Many farmers
might culture only plant tissues or cells or tiny organelles
under biopolymer plastic. Scarce inputs of water and nutrients
can be conserved and recycled even in the desert. Then the
harvest index can approach its ultimate limit, most products
taken directly as sugars, starches and proteins, supplemented to
suit by colors, flavors and textures. No carefree Eden, it will
be a planetary garden worked with powerful, growing knowledge and
yet by much sweat of the brow. We can be well but frugally fed,
with little waste.<HR></TD></TR></TABLE>

<FONT SIZE=+2>CONNECTIONS</FONT><BR>
by <B>James Burke</B>
<H2>A Lot of Boloney</H2>
<P>
<P>I have to confess a fatal weakness for Bologna, Italy. Apart
from having one of the oldest universities in Europe, and
possibly the most elegant women on the planet, it just so happens
to be the food capital of the known universe. And after lunching
on <I>tortellini alla panna,</I> you can go savor another work of
mouthwatering precision: a giant brass meridian line, inlaid
across the floor of the city's cathedral. Put there by Gian
Domenico Cassini, the hottest astronomer around in 1668. Which
was when his reputation brought him an offer he couldn't refuse,
from Louis XIV's right-hand man, Jean-Baptiste Colbert: to run
the new Paris observatory. Subsequently, he joined the great
national effort there to determine the shape of the earth (which
the French thought was not flattened at the poles).
<P>Colbert needed to know such arcana so that the new navy he was
putting together would more accurately be able to relate star-fix
angles to positions on the planetary high seas (which would be
different on an earth that was, or was <I>not, </I>flattened at
the poles). This way, French ships would be able to navigate
better. And rule the waves. And, perhaps, give the English one in
the eye, by snitching the prime meridian from Greenwich and
moving it to Paris. Unfortunately for <I>amour-propre, </I>they
were wrong about the shape of the globe, which is why I'm writing
this in Greenwich mean time.
<P>The sidereal shenanigans were key to Colbert's grand plan to
make France a mercantile superpower, as part of which Colbert
also offered tax breaks to anyone interested in sailing (more
accurately, it was now hoped) to exotic lands and returning with
import deals for high-end consumables. Idea being, this trade
could become a French monopoly and make oodles of ecus for king
and country. Well, king.
<P>This perfectly legitimate scheme for avoiding taxation was yet
another offer too good to refuse, so in no time at all
freebooters were hauling back shiploads of gold, ivory, slaves
and gum from Senegal in West Africa. Senegal gum turned out to be
just what you needed to machine-print chintz (the newest
Euro-fashion craze from India) with fast colors, because the gum
acts as a dye binding agent. By mid-18th century the chintziest
guy in town was an Irishman called Francis Nixon, who had a
method for producing all the cheap prints you wanted, and at high
speed. Nixon's trick involved pressing steel designs onto copper
rollers, then coloring up the rollers and running cotton between
them. Thus inventing matching curtains and covers.
<P>Anyway, by 1818 Jacob Perkins of Newburyport, Mass., had added
a few modifications to Nixon's process and went to London to
persuade the Bank of England to give him the printing contract
for banknotes whose intricate designs he claimed nobody could
copy. Speedily-18 years later-the bank said yes. (Well, this
<I>was</I> England.) Four years later the patient Perkins really
licked his competitors when he landed the job of producing the
"Penny Black," the world's first postage stamp.
<P>Businessmen all over instantly got stuck on this exciting idea
of pushing the communications envelope. By 1874, thanks to the
introduction of the stamp to Switzerland, Bern was home to the
Universal Postal Union, and the international community was
dividing mail into three categories: letters, parcels and a
brand-new thing called a postcard.
<P>Illustrations on some of the earliest cards came from the pen
of Phil May, a British cartoonist who did his best work for an
up-and-coming satirical magazine, <I>Punch. </I>The magazine
hadn't planned to include drawings, but events presented one of
those opportunities every editor dreams of. When Queen Victoria's
husband, Prince Albert, came up with a competition to decide who
should fresco the interiors of the
newly-rebuilt-in-19th-century-imitation-Gothic Houses of
Parliament, the entries His Royal Highness liked best were so
ludicrously <I>dreadful, </I>there was only one way to stop him.
Publish them. It worked.
<P>But not even <I>Punch</I> could prevent the Gothic revival.
Next time you're in Britain, note the many 19th-century
churches, originally built with gargoyles and gaslight. Gothic
was cheaper than neoclassical, so the Victorian church
commissioners threw up more than 500 of them. The fault, I
suppose, of that back-to-the-Middle-Ages lunacy we now call
Romanticism, spearheaded (like that medieval touch?) by a young
German philosopher-Johann G. Herder-who was deeply into the
fundamental unity of humankind, nature, German folk songs and the
stuff of<I> </I>Sturm und Drang-an epic view of existence, but,
by our standards...well over the top!
<P>Herder had been attuned to such excesses by the clamorous
arrival in Germany in the late 18th century of a collection of
Gaelic poems written by the third-century Irish warrior-poet
Ossian. These took Europe and Herder by sturm-sorry, storm. For
Romantics, the works pulsated with the pure and powerful feelings
of a primitive people. And triggered the Romantic movement. Of
such things are great moments of history made.
<P>Too bad the poems were fake. "Discovered" by a middle-rate
Scots poet named James Macpherson, who bundled a few ballads he'd
collected (on a tour of Scotland) together with his own work and
passed them off as Gaelic translations of 1,500-year-old
originals. Still, he did help give us Romanticism, which brought
us pathology and radio (more of that in another column). Why
would somebody like Macpherson be on an antiquarian ballad hunt
in the first place? Perhaps because back then the future of
Scottish culture was looking bleak.
<P>Ever since 1715, the Catholic Stuarts had been submitting
claims to the English throne (now occupied by Protestant
Germans) in the form of armed uprisings. Redcoats were all over
the Highlands. And matters such as clans, tartans and speaking
the local lingo were all stuff that could get you seriously
hanged. The English even wrote a special extra verse to their
national anthem, all about "rebellious Scots to crush!" 
<P>Things came to a head in 1745, when the last royal Stuart,
Bonnie Prince Charlie, and his "murderous band of cut-throats"
(a.k.a. "band of brave patriots") got as far south as Derby,
which caused a run on the pound. Now, you don't mess with the
Bank of England and get away with it. But get away he did. In the
words of the song: "Over the Sea to Skye," and then across the
channel to the Continent. To this day, in memory of Charlie's
flight to foreign parts, romantic Scots will raise their glasses
to "the king over the water."
<P>And finally: the reason I began this particular example of
tortuously crafted boloney the way I did. Because guess where
Charlie ended up spending the best of his declining years in
exile? Where would you go, if (like him) you were looking for
intellectual chat, the company of elegant women and
overindulgence in food and drink (of which the prince ultimately
expired)? Whichever way you sliced it, there was only one choice:
Bologna.

<TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH=340>
The semiconductor revolution has advanced to the point where
the computing
power that once took up an entire room can now be lost among the
spare change,
house keys or candy wrappers in the average pocket. For more than
10 years,
<A HREF="http://www-sloan.mit.edu/15.967/group02/smart.htm">"smart" credit cards</A> incorporating tiny chips have been in use in
France and
other parts of Europe. A set of standardized contacts on the
front of each card
supplants or supplements the familiar coded magnetic stripe on
the back. Although
<A HREF="http://www.racom.com/page5.htm#Smart Card Market Growth">the U.S. has been lagging</A> in the use of this technology, a series
of ongoing
pilot programs may soon change that situation. Some pundits have
criticized smart
cards as a technology endlessly in search of meaningful
applications, but the
divergent experiences of different countries show that the issues
are more
complicated.
<P> Curiously, telecommunications policy has been one of the
major influences on
the deployment of smart cards. In the U.S., where telephone calls
are cheap and
it is a simple matter to attach a magnetic-stripe reader to a
phone line, the
fraud-reduction aspects of smart cards are not necessarily worth
the extra
expense. Instead merchants can dial up a central database to make
sure a card is
valid before completing a transaction. <A HREF="http://www.gold.net/users/ct96/">In Europe</A>, where calls are
generally more
expensive and connecting modem-equipped devices to phone lines is
more difficult,
security was a significant driving force behind smart-card
introduction.
<P> The French, for example, made the switch during the mid-1980s
because fraud
rates were unacceptably high and rising. With smart cards,
merchants do not have
to go on-line to centralized databases. They can rely on personal
identification
numbers (PINs) to verify the ownership of a card simply by
checking the PIN typed
in by a customer against the record on the card itself.
Furthermore, the chips
are more resistant to tampering than magnetic stripes, which can
be read and
written on with readily available equipment. Over 20 million
smart cards are now
in use in France.
<P> One motivation for smart-card introduction in the U.S. today
is the
possibility of multiple uses for the same card. In theory, the
same
silicon-imbued piece of plastic could serve as personal
identification, credit
card, automated teller machine (ATM) card, telephone credit card,
transit pass,
carrier of crucial medical information and cash substitute for
small transactions
in person or over the Internet. Additional uses are limited
mostly by issuers'
imaginations and consumer acceptance. As a single card becomes
able to hold more
parts of a person's life, security and privacy concerns will have
to be met;
cards of the future will probably be highly personalized.
<P><B><A NAME="Standardizing">Standardizing Intelligent Transactions</A></B>
<P> Smart cards are becoming more attractive as the price of
microcomputing power
and storage continues to drop. They have two main advantages over
magnetic-stripe
cards. First, they can carry 10 or even 100 times as much
information-and hold it
much more robustly. Second, they can execute complex tasks in
conjunction with a
terminal. For example, a smart card can engage in a sequence of
questions and
answers that verifies the validity of information stored on the
card and the
identity of the card-reading terminal. A card using such an
algorithm might be
able to convince a local terminal that its owner had enough money
to pay for a
transaction without revealing the actual balance or the account
number. Depending
on the importance of the information involved, security might
rely on a personal
identification number such as those used with automated teller
machines, a
midrange encipherment system, such as the <A HREF="http://www.rsa.com/rsalabs/faq/faq_des.html">Data Encryption
Standard (DES)</A>, or a
highly secure <A HREF="http://csrc.ncsl.nist.gov/nistpubs/800-7/node49.html">public-key scheme</A>.
<P> Smart cards are not a new phenomenon. They have been in
development since the
late 1970s and have found <A HREF="http://www.cardshow.com/index.html">major applications in Europe</A>, with more
than a quarter
of a billion cards made so far. The vast majority of chips have
gone into
prepaid, disposable telephone cards, but even so the experience
gained has
reduced manufacturing costs, improved reliability and proved the
viability of
smart cards. International and national standards for smart cards
are well under
development to ensure that cards, readers and the software for
the many different
applications that may reside on them can work together seamlessly
and securely.
Standards set by the <A HREF="http://www.iso.ch/">International Organization for
Standardization (ISO)</A>, for
example, govern the placement of contacts on the face of a smart
card so that any
card and reader will be able to connect.
<P> Industry-specific standards are being developed for cards to
be used in
applications as diverse as digital cellular phones, satellite and
cable
television and, of course, finance. Recently <A HREF="http://www.visa.com/cgi-bin/vee/sf/chip/main.html">Visa</A>, <A HREF="http://www.mastercard.com/Vision/smart.htm">MasterCard</A> and
<A HREF="http://www.europay.com/1994/ph4rtt2i.htm">Europay</A> agreed
on a common specification for smart cards that defines the basic
protocols for
communication between cards and readers (analogous to the RS-232
standards that
govern communication between personal computers and modems). The
specification is
general enough so that virtually any kind of information can be
exchanged by
hardware and software that conform to it. As a result, this
agreement could bring
the convenience of a single card for purchases, ATM withdrawals,
frequent flier
miles and even Internet access.
<P><B><A NAME="Under">Under the Hood</A></B>
<P> Standards dictate a card's shape and electrical connections,
but the
technology inside has gone through significant evolution. The
simplest "memory"
cards contain only <A HREF="http://www.nml.org/publications/NML_TR/solid_state_memory_study/nonvolatile.html">nonvolatile memory</A> and a limited amount of
logic circuitry for
control and security. They typically serve as prepaid telephone
cards-a terminal
inside the pay phone writes a declining balance into the card's
memory as the
call progresses; the card is discarded when its balance runs out.
<P> Smart cards are more sophisticated and contain a chip with a
central
processing unit and various kinds of short- and long-term memory
cells. Some
versions may also incorporate a special coprocessing circuit for
cryptographic
operations to speed the job of encoding and decoding messages or
generating
digital signatures to validate the information transferred. [For
more information
on the kinds of cryptographic protocols that could be employed in
smart cards,
see "Confidential Communication on the Internet," by <A HREF="http://www.ira.uka.de/I3V_HTML/MITARBEITER/12">Thomas Beth</A>;
Scientific
American, December 1995, and "Achieving Electronic Privacy," by
<A HREF="http://www.digicash.com/digicash/people/david.html">David Chaum</A>;
Scientific American, August 1992.] Smart-card standards place no
limitation on
the amount of processing power in the card as long as the chip in
question can
fit the space allotted for it under the contact pad. Current
smart cards, made by
firms such as Giesecke &AMP; Devrient, <A HREF="http://www.gemplus.com/">Gemplus</A>, <A HREF="http://www.cardshow.com/industry/Schlumberger/about.html">Schlumberger</A> and
<A HREF="http://www.winforms.phil.tu-bs.de/winforms/company/solaic/solaic.html">Solaic</A>, range in
price from less than $1 to about $20. (The silicon inside the
cards is made by
companies such as <A HREF="http://www.mot.com/">Motorola</A>, <A HREF="http://www.siemens.com/">Siemens</A> and SGS-Thompson.) A
magnetic-stripe card, in
contrast, may cost between 10 and 50 cents, depending on whether
the card is bare
or incorporates a photograph or a holographic patch and on how
many cards are
made at once.
<P> Because the cards are dependent on an outside power source
provided by the
reader interface, any information held in conventional
<A HREF="http://www.cbs.cornell.edu/techconn/choosing/memory.html">random-access memory (RAM)</A>
will be lost every time it is removed from a reader. Hence,
smart-card
microprocessors use only a few hundred bytes of RAM as a
scratchpad for working
on transactions in progress. The software that controls a card's
operations must
survive from one use to the next, and so it occupies between
three and 20
kilobytes of permanent nonvolatile <A HREF="http://www.cyberstreet.com/hcs/museum/rom.htm">read-only memory (ROM)</A>. The
contents of the
ROM are fixed in the chip when it is made. The personal,
financial or medical
data that give each card value to its owner reside in an
alterable nonvolatile
memory (EEPROM, for electrically erasable programmable read-only
memory) of
between one and 16 kilobytes.
<P> The need for security influences the design and handling of
the card, its
embedded circuitry and its software. Microprocessors used in
smart cards are
specifically designed to restrict access to stored information
and to prevent the
card from use by unauthorized parties. Typically a card will work
only in a
well-characterized operating environment.
<P> For example, criminals may attempt to force the card to
operate outside
certain voltage or clock frequency ranges in the hope that it
will display
weaknesses that can be exploited; a properly designed device will
automatically
fail to respond under such conditions. In some cases, circuit
links may be
designed to become inoperable once a card has been programmed, so
that vital data
cannot be altered. Manufacturers also employ special
tamper-resistant techniques
that would prevent a thief from getting to the microscopic
circuitry directly.
<P> Most smart cards require physical contact between the card
and pins in the
reader, but a growing set of applications depends on so-called
<A HREF="http://panther.gsu.edu/%7Egs01rvk/smart2.html">contactless cards</A>.
Short-range cards operate by electrical inductive or capacitive
coupling with the
reader and card a millimeter or so apart; longer-range ones
communicate by radio
signals. (The radio-frequency energy emitted by the reader also
powers the cards,
which must therefore be extremely sparing of current.)
Contactless smart cards
are often used in situations where transactions must be processed
very fast, as
in mass-transit turnstiles. Transit system operators in Hong
Kong, Washington,
D.C., Manchester, England, and about a dozen other cities have
tested contactless
cards; Hong Kong will issue three million cards by 1997.
<P> Developers and users are working together to develop firm
standards for
long-range contactless cards. Efforts are also under way to
standardize hybrid
cards that can communicate either directly or by radio links.
<A HREF="http://www.mch.sni.de/public/ihv/offers/verk/atsa/news02.htm">Lufthansa</A>, the
German national airline, has already begun issuing a hybrid card
to frequent
fliers; the contactless part serves as an ID card for the firm's
paperless
ticketing system, and the contacts make for a European-standard
smart credit
card. Roughly 350,000 will be in circulation by year's end.
<P> The smart card is a technical achievement in its own right;
it is, however,
merely the most identifiable part of a vastly larger transaction
system that
surrounds it. The traits of this infrastructure may have much
more influence on
the evolution of the card's role in society than do the
characteristics of the
card itself. It is therefore important to see how the card would
function as part
of the larger system to understand why it might be appealing.
<P><B><A NAME="Big">The Big Picture</A></B>
<P><A HREF="0896fancherpic1.html"><IMG SRC="0896fancher08.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="72" HEIGHT="107" BORDER=0 HSPACE=10 VSPACE=10></A> Consider, for example, the stored-value card, at present the
most common
application of chip-card technology. The attractions of such a
card hinge on the
relatively high overhead costs of alternatives such as credit
cards or cash. Even
in the U.S., verification costs are too high to allow a profit on
conventional
card transactions smaller than a few dollars. <A HREF="http://www.cardshow.com/applications/VisaCash/what_is_svc.html">The stored-value
card</A> minimizes
transaction costs by carrying monetary value directly, instead of
merely acting
as a pointer to an account. It transfers the digital equivalent
of bills or coins
to a merchant's digital "cash register," whereupon they can be
deposited in a
bank. Children, tourists and others who do not have a local bank
account can use
these cards, which can even be sold from vending machines.
<P> Such cards are particularly attractive for pay phones,
parking meters,
photocopiers and vending machines. By eliminating the coin box,
they remove a
tempting target for thieves and vandals. Although digital tills
must be secured
against both unauthorized emptying and stuffing with counterfeit
electronic cash,
these problems appear easier to handle than their physical
counterparts.
<P> Bypassing the handling of money in paper or metallic form
could generate
significant savings. Economists estimate that counting, moving,
storing and
safeguarding cash cost about 4 percent of the value of all
transactions. The
interest lost by holding cash instead of keeping money on deposit
is also
substantial. <A HREF="http://www.royalbank.com/english/news/emondex.html">The Royal Bank of Canada</A>, which is participating in
digital-cash
trials in Ontario, keeps about a billion dollars on hand at all
times.
<P> The costs per transaction of stored-value cards tend to be
lower than those
for credit cards and cash, but initial capital costs tend to be
higher. The cards
themselves cost more, and whoever pioneers their use must bear
the expense of
installing an infrastructure of card readers. In addition,
software designed to
process transactions by credit and debit card must be modified to
deal with the
new form, which more closely resembles a digital traveler's
check. A typical
smart-card reader costs over $100, roughly comparable to the
price of the box
that reads a magnetic-stripe card and calls a credit-card company
to verify a
transaction. There are over 13,000 smart-card readers in the U.S.
versus more
than five million devices capable of dealing with conventional
credit cards.
<P> More than two dozen companies are working on smart-card
readers, and prices
will no doubt drop with volume production. Nevertheless, the
amount of equipment
that must be installed is substantial. Outside the U.S., the
number of
stored-value cards is steadily growing, with major national
programs implemented
or planned in Australia, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Denmark, Italy,
Portugal,
Singapore, Spain, Taiwan, the U.K. and elsewhere. Levels of
consumer acceptance
vary; the cards provide clear potential savings for banks and
merchants, but
transforming those benefits into incentives for users can be
difficult. National
banking authorities are also understandably cautious about what
is in effect a
new method of printing money, with no fixed rules about whose
authority
guarantees its value.
<P> Most stored-value cards now in use are disposable. Reloadable
devices would
work the same way for making purchases but would have extra
software that would
enable a consumer to transfer money to a depleted card.
(Encryption or other
security techniques would help ensure that a card could be
recharged only in a
legitimate transaction.) <A HREF="http://www.citibank.com/">Citibank</A>, <A HREF="http://www.chase.com/">Chase Manhattan</A>, <A HREF="http://www.visa.com/">Visa</A> and
<A HREF="http://www.mastercard.com/">MasterCard</A> are
assembling a <A HREF="http://www.ramresearch.com/crdflash/cf4_11b.html">pilot program</A> for stored-value cards in New York
City. The companies
will issue reloadable smart cards to approximately 50,000
customers; the cards
will also have magnetic stripes for conventional transactions.
About 500 stores,
restaurants and other merchants will have readers capable of
accepting
electronic-cash transactions. More than one million stored-value
cards are also
being issued for the 1996 <A HREF="http://www.atlanta.olympic.org/">Olympic Games</A> in Atlanta; they can be
used in Olympic
venues and at several thousand nearby shops.
<P> A number of groups are backing competing smart-card schemes
for stored value.
All use essentially the same hardware, but their software
differs. Manufacturers
of card readers are therefore developing equipment capable of
handling multiple
protocols. It is not yet clear which system consumers will favor,
and each has
its own strengths and weaknesses. The stored-value protocols of
the New York and
Atlanta pilot programs, for example, are relatively simple but
limited-for
example, there is no provision for rescinding or replacing the
value of a card
that is lost or stolen. The <A HREF="http://www.digicash.com/">DigiCash</A> system, which relies on
complex
cryptographic protocols, is both secure and untraceable but
requires more
processing power and hence more expensive cards. The British
<A HREF="http://www.mondex.com/mondex/">Mondex</A> system,
meanwhile, is intended as a full-scale secure cash replacement:
electronic money
can pass from one user to another indefinitely without being
redeposited in a
bank. A trial is under way in <A HREF="http://www.opendoors.eccosys.com/sp0929/spe_e/mon10.htm">Swindon</A> in the southwest of
England, and another
one is beginning in <A HREF="http://www.mondex.com/mondex/guelph.htm">Guelph, Ontario</A>, where even parking meters
will accept
digital currency.
<P><B><A NAME="Protecting">Protecting Health</A></B>
<P> In a mark of the technology's versatility, smart cards can
also carry vital
medical information. Instead of just indicating that a person has
medical
insurance, for example, a card can store details of the coverage.
It can also
provide basic medical information, such as lists of drug
sensitivities, current
conditions being treated, the name and phone number of a
patient's doctor and
other information vital in an emergency. An intelligent card that
carries only
the information most relevant to current treatment can streamline
care
significantly even as it bypasses the potentially intractable
privacy and
ownership concerns that would arise if health care administrators
attempted to
place every patient's complete medical history on a chip for easy
portability.
<P> Indeed, simply automating the process of entering a person's
name and account
number into medical forms can make insurance processing much more
efficient.
Germany has recently begun to issue to all its citizens chip
cards that will
carry their basic health insurance information, and France is
investigating a
similar program. Both countries have thus far decided against
storing more
sensitive data on chips until legal, ethical and security issues
can be ironed
out.
<P> In France and Japan, kidney patients can carry cards that
hold their dialysis
records and treatment prescriptions. Dialysis patients often need
their blood
cleansed two or three times a week. Each session involves a
particular set of
machine parameters and a personalized combination of drugs as
well as the use of
a kidney dialysis machine. Before the introduction of the smart
cards, patients
could go only to the local dialysis center where their records
were kept, but now
they have the geographic mobility most of us take for granted.
Security checks
built into the cards help to ensure that no one except doctors
and other
authorized persons can read or update treatment information. <P>
<P><B><A NAME="Personal">Personal Communication</A></B>
<P> Because the telecommunications costs involved in verifying
credit-card
transactions have played a crucial role in the history of smart
cards, it is
perhaps appropriate that one of the device's most innovative
applications is at
the heart of a new generation of mobile communications. The
<A HREF="http://ccnga.uwaterloo.ca/%7Ejscouria/GSM/gsmreport.html">Global System of
Mobile Communications (GSM)</A> is a technical specification for
digital cellular
telephones; about 10 million people have GSM phones, and service
is available or
under development in more than 85 countries. Every GSM handset is
designed to
<A HREF="http://www.winforms.phil.tu-bs.de/winforms/company/solaic/gsm/gsm.html#kap3">accept a smart card</A> that carries information about the telephone
number of the
card's owner and the suite of services it can access. A Swiss
executive traveling
to Belgium can just remove the smart card from her GSM unit at
home and plug it
into a rented or borrowed unit at her destination. When callers
dial her number,
the switching system will automatically locate the handset with
her smart card
anywhere in the world and deliver the call to it. In addition,
the smart card can
encrypt the transmission, preventing the casual eavesdropping
possible with other
forms of cellular phones.
<P> As with other smart-card applications, the U.S. lags behind
many nations in
GSM services. There are a few pilot programs in place, but
widespread deployment
is not expected until 1997. The GSM systems being built in the
U.S. operate at a
frequency of 1.9 gigahertz instead of the 1.8 gigahertz used
elsewhere and employ
two competing, incompatible technologies. As a result, handsets
may be useless
outside their home range. The smart cards that animate them,
however, should work
anywhere. <P>
<P><B><A NAME="Cards">Cards That Know You</A></B>
<P> If smart cards can give identity to an electronic device,
will they
eventually serve as foolproof credentials for humans as well?
Smart cards can
carry much more information than the paper or plastic rectangles
that are used to
constitute drivers' licenses, insurance cards or other kinds of
identification.
And they can probably carry it more securely.
<P> ID cards often have a picture and signature so that
authorities can make sure
the bearer matches the card. Smart cards can store a PIN to
improve security, but
they can also add a catalogue of other biometric identifiers:
voiceprints,
fingerprints, retina scans, iris scans or dynamic signature
patterns. Presented
with a card holding a reference pattern of some kind, computers
can determine
with a remarkable degree of accuracy how well its bearer matches
that pattern.
Customs authorities in the Netherlands have already tested a
system to speed
passport checking at the airport for frequent fliers: the person
puts a finger on
a glass plate, and a video camera captures the fingerprint; a
computer then
compares the video image with a reference print stored on the
smart card. With
the template on a smart card, there is no need to connect to a
centralized
database to confirm a person's identity.
<P> Such matching techniques are as yet imperfect-the smart cards
function well,
but the algorithms for deriving and comparing the biometric
patterns are still
imperfect. Furthermore, designers must decide whether they are
more interested in
rejecting impostors or making sure that legitimate cardholders
are always
accepted. A card that subjects its owner to the embarrassment of
an ID mismatch
even once a year is unlikely to find wide acceptance.
<P> This consideration and others suggest that smart cards have
reached a first
plateau of technological maturity: their capacity is no longer
the limiting
factor in systems that employ them. Instead their future depends
on software
design, economics, liability and privacy concerns, consumer
acceptance and a host
of other political and personal issues.

Throughout most of human history, a wide girth has been viewed as a sign
of health and prosperity. It seems both ironic and fitting, then, that
corpulence now poses a growing threat to the health of many inhabitants of
the richest nations. The measure of the hazard in the U.S. is well known:
59 percent of the adult population meets the current definition of
clinical obesity, according to <A HREF="0896trends_biblio.html#Institute_of_Medicine_1995">
a 1995 report by
the Institute of Medicine</A>, easily qualifying the disease for epidemic
status. <A HREF="0896trends_biblio.html#Wolf_1996">Epidemiologists at
Harvard University</A> conservatively estimate that treating obesity and
the <A HREF= "http://www.diabetes.org/">diabetes</A>, <A HREF="http://www.amhrt.org/">

gall stones</A> caused by it rang up $45.8 billion in health care cos
ts in 1990, the latest year studied. Indirect costs because of missed work
pitched another $23 billion onto the pile. That year, a congressional
committee calculated, Americans spent about $33 billion on weight-loss
products and services. Yet roughly 300,000 men and women were sent early
to their graves by the damaging effects of eating too much and moving too
little.<P>
   The problem is as frustrating as it is serious. Quick and easy
solutions--liquid diets, support groups, acupressure, appetite-suppressing
&quot;aroma sticks&quot; and even the best-intentioned attempts to eat
less and exercise more--have all failed in well-controlled trials to
reduce the weight of more than a small fraction of their obese adherents
by at least 10 percent for five years--an achievement shown to increase
life expectancy sharply.<P>

that lack it, raised hopes of a better quick fix. Those 
<A HREF="http://www.nytsyn.com/medic/Lead/031_013196_182344_27632.html">hopes have
faded</A> as subsequent <A HREF="http://www.nejm.org/publicM/1996/0334/0005/0324/1.htm">studies</A> have
found no fat people who share the leptin-related mutations seen in mice.
But the identification of leptin is only one of many important advances
over the past several years that have opened a new chapter in the
understanding of obesity.<P>
   Armed with powerful new tools in molecular biology and genetic
engineering, scientists are seeking physiological explanations for some of
the most puzzling aspects of the fattening of industrial society. Why is
obesity on the rise, not just in the U.S. but in nearly all affluent
countries? How is it that some individuals remain fat despite constant
diets, whereas others eat what they want without gaining a pound? Why is
it so hard to lose a significant amount of weight and nearly impossible to
keep it off? Perhaps most important, what can be done to slow and
eventually reverse this snowballing trend? The traditional notion that
obesity is simply the well-deserved consequence of sloth and gluttony has
led to unhelpful and sometimes incorrect answers to these questions.
Science may at last offer better.<P>
<A NAME="section2"><B>What Makes the World Go Round</B></A><P>
Contrary to conventional wisdom, the U.S. is not the fattest nation on
earth. Obesity is far more common on Western Samoa and several other
Pacific islands. On <A HREF="http://www2.hawaii.edu/~ogden/pacific/nauru.html">Nauru</A>, a mere dot
of eight square miles once covered to overflowing with seabird guano, the
7,500 islanders have traded that valuable source of phosphate to
fertilizer companies in exchange for one of the highest per capita incomes
in the world. Many also traded their plows for lounge chairs and their
traditional diet of fish and vegetables for Western staples such as canned
meats, potato chips and beer. Within the course of a generation, the
change has taken its toll on their bodies. By 1987 well over 65 percent of
men and 70 percent of women on Nauru were obese, and one third suffered
from diabetes.<P>
   Many countries, developed and developing, are heading in the same
direction at an alarming pace. Changes in diet alone do not explain the
trend. Surveys--some of which admittedly are of dubious accuracy--show
that the proportion of calories Americans get from fat has dropped about
eight points since the 1980s, to 34 percent. Yet the prevalence of obesity
has risen by a similar amount in nearly the same period. Britons ate 10
percent fewer calories overall in 1991 than in 1980, according to 
<A HREF="0896trends_biblio.html#Prentice_1995_(Britain)">government
estimates</A>, while the number of heavyweights doubled. Polls that show
gasoline consumption and hours spent watching television rising about as
quickly as the rate of obesity in some countries seem to explain part of
the disparity.<P>
   Evolutionary biology may provide a deeper explanation, however. In 1962
James V. Neel of the <A HREF= "http://www.umich.edu/">University of
Michigan</A> proposed that natural selection pressured our distant
ancestors to acquire &quot;thrifty genes&quot;, which boosted the ability
to store fat from each feast in order to sustain people through the next
famine. In today's relative surfeit, Neel reasoned, this adaptation has
become a liability. The theory is supported by the Nauruans' plight and
also by studies of the <A HREF="http://www.up.pt/liacc/ML/statlog/datasets/diabetes/diabetes.doc.html">Pima Indians</A>, a tribe whose progenitors split into two groups sometime during
the Middle Ages. One group settled in southern Arizona; the other moved
into the Sierra Madre Mountains in Mexico. By the 1970s most of the
Indians in Arizona had been forced out of farming and had switched to an
American diet with 40 percent of its calories from fat. They now endure
the highest incidence of obesity reported anywhere in the world--far higher than among their white neighbors. About half
develop diabetes by age 35.<P>
   Eric Ravussin, a researcher with the <A HREF="http://www.niddk.nih.gov/">National Institute of Diabetes and
Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK)</A>, has compared Pimas in Arizona
with their distant relatives in Maycoba, Mexico, who still live on
subsistence farming and ranching. Although the groups share most of the
same genes, Pimas in Maycoba are on average 57 pounds (26 kilograms)
lighter and about one inch (2.5 centimeters) shorter. Few have diabetes.
Maycobans also eat about half as much fat as their counterparts to the
north, and they spend more than 40 hours a week engaged in physical work.
The fact that Mexican Pimas remain lean provides strong evidence that the
high rate of obesity among American Pimas is the result not of a genetic
defect alone but of a genetic susceptibility--exceptionally thrifty
genes--turned loose in an environment that offers easy access to
high-energy food while requiring little hard labor.<P>
   Because all human populations seem to share this genetic susceptibility
to varying degrees, &quot;we are going to see a continuing increase in
obesity over the next 25 years&quot; as standards of living continue to
rise, predicts F. Xavier Pi-Sunyer, director of the obesity research
center at <A HREF="http://cpmcnet.cpmc.columbia.edu/research/campus/camp0104.html">St.
Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital</A> in New York City. He warns that &quot;some
less developed countries are particularly at risk. It is projected that by
2025, more than 20 percent of the population of Mexico will have
diabetes.&quot;<P>
   Studies of Pimas, islanders and migrants &quot;all seem to indicate
that among different populations, the prevalence of obesity is largely
determined by environmental conditions,&quot; Ravussin concludes. A few
doctors have proposed changing those conditions by levying a &quot;fat
tax&quot; on high-calorie foods or raising insurance rates for those who
fail to show up at a gym regularly.<P>
   But economic and legal punishments are unlikely to garner much popular
support, and no one knows whether they would effectively combat obesity.
So most researchers are turning back to factors they think they can
control: the genetic and biological variables that make one person gain
weight while others in the same circumstances stay lean.<P>
<A NAME="section3"><B>Finding Genes That Fit</B></A><P>
Doctors have long known that the tendency to gain weight runs in
families--how strongly is still under debate. Numerous analyses of
identical twins reared apart have shown that genetic factors alone control
a large part of one's body mass index, an estimate of body fat commonly
used to define obesity [<I>see the sidebar <A HREF="0896trends_box2.html">&quot;A Shifting Scale&quot;</A></I>]. A few
have found weight to be as dependent on genes as height: about 80 percent.
But the majority have concluded that genetic influences are only about
half that potent.<P>
   Investigators at the <A HREF="http://www.nih.gov/">National Institutes
of Health</A> who examined more than 400 twins over a period of 43 years
<A HREF="0896trends_biblio.html#Fabsitz_1992_(middle_age)">concluded</A>
that &quot;cumulative genetic effects explain most of the tracking in
obesity over time,&quot; including potbellies sprouting in middle age.
Interestingly, the researchers also determined that &quot;shared
environmental effects were not significant&quot; in influencing the twins'
weight gain. That result is bolstered by five studies that compared the
body mass indexes of adopted children with their biological and adoptive
parents. All found that the family environment--the food in the
refrigerator, the frequency of meals, the type of activities the family
shares--plays little or no role in determining which children will grow
fat. Apparently, only dramatic environmental differences, such as those
between the mountains of Mexico and the plains of Arizona, have much effect on the mass of a people.<P>
   Just which genes influence our eating, metabolism and physical
activity, and how they exert their power, remains a mystery. But
geneticists do have some encouraging leads. Five genes that can cause
rodents to balloon have now been pinpointed.<P>

<A HREF="http://www.rockefeller.edu/pubinfo/ob.nr.html"><I>Obese</I></A>, cloned
by <A HREF="http://www.hhmi.org/science/genetics/friedman.htm">Jeffrey M.
Friedman</A> and others at <A HREF="http://www.rockefeller.edu/">the
Rockefeller University</A>, encodes a blueprint for leptin, a hormone
produced by fat cells. Mice
with a <A HREF="http://www.rockefeller.edu/pubinfo/leptin-splice.nr.html">mutation</A> in
this gene produce either no leptin or a malformed version and quickly grow
to three times normal weight. <I>Diabetes</I>, cloned last December by a
team at <A HREF= "http://www.bio.com/companies/millennium.html">Millennium
Pharmaceuticals</A> in Cambridge, Mass., codes for a receptor protein that
responds to leptin by reducing appetite and turning up metabolism. Mice
with a bad copy of this gene do not receive the leptin signal, and they, too, get very fat from infancy.<P>
   Within the past year scientists at <A HREF="http://www.jax.org/">the
Jackson Laboratory</A> in Bar Harbor, Me., have cloned two other fat
genes, named <I>fat</I> and <I>tubby</I>. Mice with a mutation in either
of these genes put on weight gradually--more like humans do. The
<I>fat</I> gene gets translated into an enzyme that processes insulin, the
hormone that signals the body that it has been fed. But the protein
produced by the <I>tubby</I> gene is unlike any ever seen. Researchers do
not yet know why mice with errors in <I>fat</I>, <I>tubby</I> or <I>agouti
yellow</I>, a fifth obesity gene discovered several years ago, put on
extra ounces.<P>
   Although geneticists have located versions of all five genes within
human DNA, &quot;so far, when we have looked for human mutations on these
genes, we haven't found them,&quot; reports L. Arthur Campfield, a
research leader at Hoffmann-La Roche, the drug company that has bought the
rights to Millennium's work on the leptin receptor. In fact, clinical
studies by Friedman and others have shown that unlike <I>obese</I> and
<I>diabetes</I> mice, heavy humans generally produce a normal amount of
leptin given the amount of fat they are carrying. At least at first
glance, there seems to be nothing wrong with their leptin systems.<P>
   All of which is no surprise to most obesity researchers, who have long
maintained that there must be multiple genes that interact with one
another and with economic and psychological pressures to set an
individual's susceptibility to weight gain. Although identifying clusters
of interrelated genes is considerably trickier than finding single
mutations, some labs have made headway in mice. David West of <A HREF="http://www.pbrc.edu/">the Pennington Biomedical Research
Center</A> in Baton Rouge, La., has been crossing one strain that fattens
dramatically on a high-fat diet with a closely related strain that remains
relatively lean on the same menu. By tracking the way the trait is passed
from one generation to the next, West has proved that the fat sensitivity
is carried by one to four dominant genes, and he has narrowed down the
chromosome segments on which they could lie. Interestingly, the
<I>tubby</I> gene happens to rest within one of these segments.<P>
   Eventually the genes involved in human weight regulation should be
found. But that is the simple part. To make a dent in obesity,
physiologists will then have to figure out how all these genes work in
real bodies outside the lab. The first step will be to resolve once and
for all an old dieters' debate: Do we or do we not have set
points--predetermined weights at which our bodies are happiest--and can
they be changed?<P>
<A NAME="section4"><B>Set up for Failure</B></A><P>
A typical American adult gains about 20 pounds between the ages of 25 and
55. &quot;If you figure that an adult ingests 900,000 to one million
calories a year and you calculate the energy cost of those additional 20
pounds,&quot; observes Rudolph L. Leibel, co-director of the 
<A HREF="http://www.rockefeller.edu/sep/hirsch_leibel.html">human metabolism
laboratory</A> at Rockefeller, you find that &quot;just a few tenths of 1
percent of the calories ingested are in fact being stored. That degree of
control or balance is extraordinary.&quot; [<A HREF="../interview/0896leibel.html">A complete transcript</A> of
<I>Scientific American</I>'s interview with Leibel is available.]<P>
   Multiple <A HREF="http://www.rockefeller.edu/pubinfo/metabolism.nr.html">feedback loops</A>
maintain the body at a stable weight by shunting messages through the
bloodstream and the autonomic nervous system between the brain, the
digestive tract, muscle--and, it turns out, fat. Until recently, fat was
generally considered just a passive storage tissue. In fact, says <A HREF="http://www.salk.edu/faculty/evans.html">Ronald M.
Evans of the Salk Institute</A> in La Jolla, Calif., &quot;it is a type of
endocrine tissue. Fat secretes signals--hormones such as leptin--and also
monitors and responds to signals from other cells.&quot;<P>
   Last December, Evans reported his discovery of a new hormone, with the
catchy name of <A HREF="http://www.cell.com/cell/abstract/w0963.html">15d-PGJ<SUB>2</SUB></A>,
that is produced inside fat cells and seems to trigger the formation of
new ones, at least in children. Any drug that tried to interfere with the
hormone to prevent new fat from forming would probably work only in
children, Evans says, because fat cells in adults usually inflate in size
rather than increase in number. But a synthetic molecule that mimics
15d-PGJ<SUB>2</SUB>, called troglitazone, does appear to be an effective
drug for the type II diabetes associated with obesity, because it also
signals muscle cells to respond normally to insulin.<P>
   In mapping the maze of intertwined pathways that control short-term
appetite as well as factors (such as fat and carbohydrate levels) that
change over days or weeks, researchers are slowly working out how all
these signals combine to hold weight steady. Two major theories vie for
acceptance: set point and settling point.<P>
   The <A HREF="http://healthnet.ivi.com/hnet/9507/hl/setpo_up.htm">set-point
hypothesis</A> is the older and more deterministic. It asserts that the
brain continuously adjusts our metabolism and subconsciously manipulates
our behavior to maintain a target weight. Although the set point may
change with age, it does so according to a fixed genetic program; diet or
exercise can move you away from your set point, at least for a time, but
the target itself cannot change--or so the theory goes. Last year Leibel
and his colleagues Michael Rosenbaum and Jules Hirsch, who are three of
the strongest proponents of the set-point theory, completed <A HREF="0896trends_biblio.html#Leibel_1995">a study that seems to support
their hypothesis</A>.<P>
       The physicians admitted 66 people to the Rockefeller hospital. Some
of the patients were obese, and some had never been overweight, but all
had been at the same weight for at least six months. Over the next three
months the subjects ate only precisely measured liquid meals. The doctors
ran an extensive battery of tests on the volunteers and then increased the
calories that some were fed and put the others on restricted diets. When
the subjects had gained 10 percent or lost either 10 or 20 percent of
their original weight, the tests were run again to see what had changed.<P>
   The investigation disproved some tidbits of weight-gain folklore, such
as that thin people do not digest as much of their food as heavyweights.
The <A HREF= "http://www.blc.arizona.edu/INTERACTIVE/NUTRITION5.95/human_metabolism.html">study</A> also found that &quot;the idea that you will be fatter--or will
require fewer calories to maintain your starting body weight--as a result
of having yo-yoed down and back up again is wrong,&quot; Rosenbaum adds.
Moreover, the research showed that obese people, when their weight is
stable, do not eat significantly more than lean people with the same
amount of muscle but less fat.<P>
   But the trial's real purpose was to determine how much of a fight the
body puts up when people attempt to change the weight they have maintained
for a long time--why, in other words, dieters tend to bounce back to where
they started. When both lean and obese subjects dropped weight, &quot;it
seemed to set off a bunch of metabolic alarms,&quot; Leibel recalls. The
subjects' bodies quickly started burning fewer calories--15 percent fewer,
on average, than one would expect given their new weight. Surprisingly,
the converse also seems to be true for weight gain. Even rotund people
have to eat about 15 percent more than one would expect to stay very far
above their set point.<P>
   That fact raises a major problem for set-point theory: How does it
explain the rapid increase in the prevalence of obesity? &quot;Clearly,
set points have to be rising, just as we are getting taller in every
generation,&quot; Rosenbaum says. &quot;But set points are not changeable
in adulthood, as far as we can tell. So there must be a window of
opportunity sometime in childhood where the environment influences the set
point,&quot; he speculates. &quot;If you could figure out when and how
that occurs, maybe you could modify the environment then, and you wouldn't
have to <A HREF= "http://ctw.org/0196/019630T1.HTM">worry about your
kids</A> getting fat 20 years down the line.&quot;<P>
   That will remain wishful thinking until set-point advocates demonstrate
how weight is centrally controlled. Their best guess now, explains Louis
A. Tartaglia, a scientist at Millennium, is that &quot;the body's set
point is something like a thermostat&quot;--a lipostat, some have called
it--and leptin acts like the thermometer.<P>
   As you gain weight, Friedman elaborates, &quot;you make more leptin.
That shuts off appetite, increases energy expenditure and undoubtedly does
other things to restore body weight to the set point. Conversely, if you
get too thin, levels of leptin fall, and now you eat more, burn less, and
again your weight returns to where it started. Now that we know what the
gene and its product are, we can test that simpleminded theory.&quot;<P>
   <A HREF= "http://www.bio.org/companies/amgen.html">Amgen</A>, a
biotechnology firm in Thousand Oaks, Calif., that has reportedly promised
Rockefeller up to $100 million for the <A HREF="http://science-mag.aaas.org/science/scripts/display/short/270/5244/1904e.htm">right to produce leptin</A>, has begun injecting the hormone into obese
people in clinical trials. &quot;The goal,&quot; Rosenbaum says, &quot;is
to co-opt your body into working with you rather than against you to
maintain an altered body weight&quot; by tricking it into believing it is
fatter than it is.<P>
   But the body may not be easily fooled. In May, scientists at the
University of Washington reported that they had engineered mice that lack
the gene for neuropeptide Y (NPY), the most powerful appetite stimulant
known. Leptin curtails NPY production; this, it was thought, is how it
quells hunger. But mice lacking NPY do not lose weight--something else
compensates.<P>
   Critics of the set-point hypothesis also protest that it fails to
explain the high rates of obesity seen in Nauruans and American Pimas.
Moreover, if body fat is centrally controlled, they argue, the amount of
fat in your diet should have little impact on your weight. Numerous
studies have found the contrary. <A HREF="0896trends_biblio.html#Prentice_1995_(Britain)">One recent
survey</A> of some 11,600 Scotsmen observed that obesity was up to three
times more common among groups that ate the most fat than among those who
relied on sugars for most of their energy.<P>
<A NAME="section5"><B>Fat in the Balance</B></A><P>
At <A HREF="0896trends_biblio.html#Bouchard_1996_(Dahlem_conf.)">a
conference last year</A>, researchers reviewed the evidence and judged
that although the set-point hypothesis has not been disproved, there is
more &quot;biological merit&quot; to the idea of a &quot;settling
point.&quot; This newer theory posits that we maintain weight when our
various metabolic feedback loops, tuned by whatever susceptibility genes
we carry, settle into a happy equilibrium with our environment. Economic
and cultural changes are upsetting this equilibrium and propelling more
people--those with more genetic risk factors--into obesity.<P>
   The prime culprit suspected in this trend is hardly surprising: it is
the fat dripping off hamburgers, smoothing out ice cream and frying every
meat imaginable. But biochemists are at last working out precisely why fat
is bad. For years, they have known that people fed a high-fat meal will
consume about the same amount as those given a high-carbohydrate meal.
Because fat has more calories per bite, however, the subjects with greasy
grins tend to ingest more energy than they can burn, a phenomenon known as
passive overconsumption.<P>
   One reason for this, according to biopsychologist <A HREF="http://lethe.leeds.ac.uk/research/biol/nutrition/">John E. Blundell
of the University of Leeds</A>, seems to be that the systems controlling
hunger and satiety respond quickly to protein and carbohydrates but slowly
to fat--too slowly to stop a high-fat meal before the body has had too
much. Metabolic systems seem to favor carbohydrates (which include sugars
and starches) as well. Knock down a soda or a plate of pasta, and your
body will soon speed up its carbohydrate combustion. Polish off a bag of
pork rinds, however, and your fat oxidation rate hardly budges, points out
Jean-Pierre Flatt, a biochemist at the University of Massachusetts Medical
School. Most incoming fat is shipped directly to storage, then burned
later only if carbohydrate reserves dip below some threshold, which varies
from person to person.<P>
   There is another way to increase the rate at which fat is burned for
energy: pack on the pounds. More fat on the body yields more fatty acids
circulating in the bloodstream. That in turn boosts fat oxidation, so that
eventually a &quot;fat balance&quot; is reached where all the fat that is
eaten is combusted, and weight stabilizes. Many genetic and biological
factors can influence the fat oxidation rate and thus affect your settling
point in a particular environment.<P>
   <A HREF="http://www.olean.com/faqs.html">Olestra, an artificial fat</A>
approved earlier this year by the <A HREF="http://www.fda.gov/opacom/backgrounders/olestra.html">Food and Drug
Administration</A>, may change that rate as well. Olestra tastes more or
less like an ordinary fat, but it flows undigested through the body. A
preliminary study by George A. Bray, Pennington's executive director,
suggests that the ingredient may short-circuit passive overconsumption.
For two weeks, Bray replaced the natural fat in his subjects' meals with
olestra. &quot;They did not compensate at all by eating more food,&quot;
he reports, adding that &quot;it remains to be seen whether that holds up
in longer-term studies.&quot;<P>
   The fat balance explains in part why settling points vary among people
who overeat fat: some oxidize fat efficiently at normal weights; others
burn too little until excess pounds force the oxidation rate up. But the
model does not by itself explain why some do not overeat at all. To answer
that, Flatt has proposed a &quot;glycogen hypothesis.&quot; <P>
   The human body can store about a day's supply of carbohydrates in the
form of glycogen, a simple starch. Glycogen reserves function somewhat
like fuel tanks; we partially refill the stores with each meal but rarely
top them off. In fact, the range between &quot;empty&quot; and
&quot;full&quot; appears to be a matter of individual preference,
influenced by such factors as the diversity and palatability of food at
hand, social pressures and meal habits. People who are content with lower
glycogen levels or who frequently deplete them through exercise burn fat
more readily than those who like to keep their tanks full, Flatt suggests.
But he concedes that the &quot;crucial link from glycogen stores to
appetite remains to be proven.&quot;<P>
   Researchers need more evidence before they can pronounce either set
point or settling point--or neither--correct. James O. Hill of the <A HREF= "http://www.hsc.colorado.edu/">University of Colorado Health
Sciences Center </A>has begun collecting some of those critical data. He
is assembling <A HREF="http://www.hsc.colorado.edu/ctrsinst/nutritio/nwcr.htm">a
registry</A> of the most precious resource in obesity research: the people
who have lost a large amount of weight and kept it off for several years
without relapse. Hill has already identified about 1,000 such individuals
and has begun examining a handful for biochemical clues to their
success.<P>
   Unfortunately, no current explanation of weight regulation leaves much
room for voluntary control; all the metabolic cycles involved are governed
subconsciously. Settling-point theory does at least suggest that
sufficiently drastic changes in lifestyle might prod the body to resettle
at a new weight. But without assistance, changes radical enough to make a
difference are evidently uncomfortable enough to be infeasible--for
millions of dieters have tried this strategy and failed.<P>
<A NAME="section6"><B>Getting over the Hump</B></A><P>
Increasingly, obesity researchers argue that the most effective assistance
they can provide their patients will probably be pharmacological.
&quot;The treatment philosophy of the past 40 years, which has been to
train patients to eat differently, is simply not going to cure the
epidemic of obesity that we see worldwide,&quot; asserts Barbara C.
Hansen, director of the obesity research center at the <A HREF="http://som1.ab.umd.edu/som.html">University of Maryland School of
Medicine</A>.<P>
   Untangling the biology beneath body fat has created a plethora of new
drug targets that has drawn dozens of pharmaceutical firms off the
sidelines [see sidebar <A HREF="0896trends_box3.html">&quot;A Spoonful of
Medicine: Obesity Drugs under Development&quot;</A>]. The potential market
is enormous, not only because obesity is common and growing but also
because even an ideal drug will have to be taken indefinitely, according
to Hansen and others. &quot;Obesity isn't curable,&quot; Bray says.
&quot;It's like high blood pressure. If you don't take the medication,
your blood pressure won't stay down. And if you don't take drugs--or do
something--to treat obesity, your weight won't stay down.&quot;<P>
   Part of the reason for the resurgence of commercial interest is a shift
in policy at the FDA, which <A HREF="http://www.fda.gov/cder/da96.htm#Apr">decided in April</A> to allow
the appetite suppressant <A HREF="http://pharminfo.com/pubs/msb/dexfen.html">dexfenfluramine</A> to be
prescribed for obesity in the U.S., as it already is in 65 other
countries. It is the first weight-loss drug approved in the U.S. in 23
years, and nearly all obesity researchers agree it has been too long
coming. The FDA also recently relaxed its guidelines for obesity-drug
applications. &quot;As our compromise right now, we're suggesting that a
company can present us with two years of data--in some cases, one year if
the data look good enough and the company gives us a firm commitment to do
follow-up studies under tight controls,&quot; says Leo Lutwak, a medical
officer with the FDA's <A HREF="http://www.fda.gov/cder/">Center for Drug
Evaluation & Research</A>.<P>
   Lutwak admits that with only two years of information, the FDA may
approve drugs that turn out to have serious long-term side effects.
&quot;The best we can hope for is something like insulin for the treatment
of diabetes,&quot; Leibel says. Insulin rescues a type I diabetic by
replacing a hormone that is missing. &quot;But after 15 years, you begin
to have complications of our inability to perfectly mimic the
biology,&quot; Leibel continues. &quot;If we're lucky, that's the kind of
problem we'll face in the treatment of obesity.&quot; Lutwak responds that
&quot;when that happens, the public will be informed, and they will have
to make a decision about whether it is worth it.&quot;<P>
   If the long-term cost of treatment is unknown, the benefits are
becoming clearer, thanks to studies on people who have an operation,
called <A HREF="http://www-surgery.med.ohio-state.edu/divisions/genr/obesity.htm">gastroplasty</A>, that reduces the size of the stomach. Although infrequently used in
the U.S., the procedure has proved remarkably effective in Sweden. 
<A HREF="0896trends_biblio.html#Sjostrom_1995">A long-term study there</A> of
1,150 obese patients who underwent gastric surgery found that they
typically dropped 66 pounds over two years--88 pounds if a more severe
procedure was used--whereas control subjects given standard dietary
treatment lost nothing. The surgery cured more than two thirds of those
with diabetes, compared with 16 percent cured in the control group.
Likewise, twice as many (43 percent) of the hypertension cases were cured
by the operation.<P>
   Gastroplasty has drawbacks in addition to the risks that always
accompany major surgery--principally a high rate of digestive
complications. Drug treatments might be better, but <A HREF="0896trends_biblio.html#Hansen_1993_(monkeys)">Hansen's work</A> with
rhesus monkeys suggests that prevention would be best. A decade ago her
team began a trial on young adult monkeys, equivalent in maturity to
20-year-old men. The researchers adjusted the animals' food supply so that
they neither gained nor lost weight. &quot;In the past 10 years we have
had 100 percent success preventing both obesity and type II
diabetes,&quot; Hansen asserts. &quot;In the control group, which was
simply allowed to feed freely on the same diet, half are diabetic. Because
everything we know about human obesity is also true of nonhuman primate
obesity, that shows you the power of weight control.&quot;<P>
   It does not, unfortunately, demonstrate a feasible way to achieve it.
The NIDDK has launched <A HREF="http://www.niddk.nih.gov/NutritionDocs.html">a program to educate
Americans</A> about ways to avoid weight gain, but Susan Z. Yanovski, the
program's director, admits that so far it has had little perceptible
impact. There is no major lobbying organization for the disease, notes
Pi-Sunyer, and the NIH directs less than 1 percent of its research funding
at obesity. &quot;Many people seem to be unaware of how big a health
problem this is now and how big it is going to grow, particularly when you
look at the increasing obesity of children,&quot; Yanovski says. Because
obese adolescents usually become fat adults, &quot;we're really heading
for trouble in another 20 to 30 years,&quot; she adds.<P>
   At least one grade school intervention has had modest success, knocking
a few percentage points off the number of children who turn into
overweight adolescents by taking fat out of the children's lunches, giving
them more strenuous recreation and educating their parents about weight
control. &quot;We have to be very careful about putting children on
restrictive diets,&quot; Yanovski warns. &quot;That is inappropriate. But
we can be more proactive in getting our kids away from the television set,
more physically active, riding their bikes instead of being driven
everywhere. If people recognize that this is a serious public health
problem affecting their children, then maybe they will start taking some
action.&quot; If not, economists should start adjusting their models now
to account for the tremendous health care cost increases that lie
ahead.<P>

The human-like behavior of dolphins has long been noted. Now they
have revealed yet another trait: just like humans, they seem to
enjoy blowing bubbles. Bottlenose dolphins in Hawaii
can create shimmering, stable rings and helices of air as part
of their play. These images and videos were captured at Sea Life Park
Hawaii as part of Project Delphis, a program of dolphin study
run by the non-profit conservation organization Earthtrust, in
cooperation with the Park.

The adult male dolphin Kaiko'o produces a ring and follows it up through the
water. Occasionally, he emits two rings in succession and fuses them into
one large ring. The halo of air becomes thinner and expands in radius as it
is carried to the surface by a vortex flow through the center of the ring;
the vortex also stablizies the ring, preventing it from breaking up into
smaller bubbles.<P>

<B>OVER THE RAINBOW</B>
<P>
<P>
Gary Stix's vicious little squib ["The Rainbow Majority," Science and the Citizen, February] exactly confirms the contention of my book <I>Alien Nation</I> that antiracism hysteria has paralyzed discussion of the unexpected consequences of the pivotal 1965 Immigration Act to the point where the current situation can be regarded as Hitler's posthumous revenge on America. Stix argues that the shifting ethnic makeup of this country is "inexorable," suppressing the fact that it will not happen without continued immigration. He then concludes by suggesting that opposition to continued immigration is "neoapartheid." It would be fairer to say that his peculiar zeal to see the present American nation displaced by an immigrant "rainbow majority" is a species of treason.

<B>AIDS AND CIRCUMCISION</B>
<P>
<P>
John C. Caldwell and Pat Caldwell propose in "The African AIDS Epidemic" [March] that lack of male circumcision has sustained the heterosexual AIDS epidemic in sub-Saharan Africa. Although several studies have documented that lack of circumcision does contribute to heterosexual transmission of the virus, it is doubtful that it is the leading cause of the epidemic in sub-Saharan Africa. Lack of male circumcision may increase the likelihood of HIV transmission from females to males but not from males to females. Hence, it is unlikely that lack of circumcision plays a role in the majority of transmission events.
<P>
Also, recent studies have established that a variety of sexually transmitted diseases, not only chancroid, are probably the major determinant in the transmission of HIV from men to women as well as from women to men, regardless of circumcision status. By considering only the role of chancroid in increasing susceptibility to HIV, the Caldwells give these data short shrift. High levels of other diseases, including chlamydia, gonorrhea, herpes and syphilis, undoubtedly go much farther to explain the African AIDS epidemic.

In Africa, male circumcision and female circumcision occur in the same communities. Another researcher with a bias in favor of female circumcision could just as easily suggest that it is <I>female</I> circumcision that protects against HIV infection. Amputating parts of the reproductive organs of either sex will not prevent venereal infections. Only education will accomplish this goal.

<I><B>The Caldwells respond:</B></I>
<P>The heterosexual AIDS epidemic in sub-Saharan Africa has been sustained by an unfortunate concurrence of circumstances: high levels of multiple sexual partners and prostitution, poor medical care (resulting in a high incidence of untreated sexually transmitted diseases) and a large, contiguous population of uncircumcised men. Lack of male circumcision is not the critical factor promoting the spread of HIV, but it is the additional one that distinguishes the AIDS belt from the rest of Africa.
<P>
Furthermore, recent work with more than 4,000 women in Nairobi shows that lack of male circumcision trebles the likelihood of male-to-female transmission: if a large number of uncircumcised men, who are more likely to be infected by female prostitutes, bring the disease home to their female partners, more women will contract HIV. 
<P>
And we do not mean to diminish the role that other sexually transmitted diseases play in increasing susceptibility to HIV infection. The AIDS belt has experienced not merely the usual burden of sexually transmitted diseases but also the added burden of extremely high levels of chancroid, which is so common precisely because most men are uncircumcised. Finally, although many communities practice both male and female circumcision in northern Africa, this is not true in the south, where the epidemic retains its intensity in Malawi, Zambia, Zimbabwe and Botswana.

<B>BRIGHT LIGHTS, BIG CITY</B>
<P>
<P>
In "Urban Planning in Curitiba" [March], Jonas Rabinovitch and Josef Leitmann write, "As late as the end of the 19th century, even a visionary like Jules Verne could not imagine a city with more than a million inhabitants." What an impoverished imagination poor Verne had! All he had to do was imagine something that already existed. By 1850 the population of London was over two million, and Parisians numbered more than one million. Closer to (our) home, greater New York City's population in 1900 was over three million.

<B>THE MIRACLE OF MICROBIOLOGY</B>
<P>
<P>
I respect James Randi's fight to escape medieval superstition through scientific inquiry ["Investigating Miracles, Italian-Style," Essay, February] and do not fault his citation of my work on <I>Serratia marcescens. </I>But I wish to clarify that my research did not conclude that the "most celebrated miracle of the 13th century 'may be more microbiological than metaphysical.'" 
<P>
It was not the miracle but the physical manifestations that occurred during the event that I determined were micro
biological in origin. Argu
ably, my research did not so much disprove the miracle as it supported a sac
ramental view of nature-one in which God worked through nature to resolve the incredulous priest's doubts and bring him to faith.

"Radio transmission between two points on the earth after
reflection from the moon may enter the realm of practicality, now
that it has been demonstrated by radar that the space surrounding
the earth is not impassable to radio waves. If an
ultra-high-frequency pulse was beamed at the moon from an
antenna, the receiver could be located at any place on earth
where the moon could be 'seen' at the same time as at the
transmitter. Hence, the blocking action of the earth's curvature
to high-frequency line-of-sight transmission would be eliminated,
and nation-wide television broadcasts from a central station
might become practical."

"Demand is zooming for prefabricated houses built on
mass-production principles. Designs for prefabs range from
conventional practice to weird hemispherical structures of
aluminum alloy and steel with a central steel mast, the whole
unit built on suspension-bridge principles. Some are so radical
in appearance that there is a serious question as to whether the
public will accept them. No matter what the design, the problem
of materials still haunts. Until shortages are relieved, and home
builders can perfect their plans, prefabs as well as conventional
hand-built homes will suffer delays."

insects, animals and weeds abound, or are likely to migrate when

"The ravages of the rinderpest in South Africa are said to be
more appalling than any cattle plague which has affected the
region within living memory. As an instance of the devastation
wrought in Bechuanaland, it is reported that Khama, the paramount
chief, who recently visited England, has lost from his private
herds alone, 8,000 head of cattle. At Pitsani, at last advices,
the cattle were dying by the hundred daily. To the South African
native, cattle are a medium of exchange and a staple of the

Agriculture, examinations of milk made at various places yielded

microbes, as many as 135,000,000 germs being found per ounce.
Although much has been accomplished in our country of late to
improve the sanitary conditions surrounding public milk supplies,
a great deal still remains to be done. There cannot be a doubt
that the next important step will be the distribution by our
dairies of 'pasteurized' milk and butter."

<FONT SIZE=2><B>CONVENTIONAL BULBS</B> contain a chemically inert gas, and so the tungsten vapor given off by the hot filament is simply deposited on the glass, darkening it. Standard bulbs thus have to be made large enough so that the tungsten coating does not become opaque.

</TABLE>
<P>
During the 1950s, researchers at General Electric wanted to build tiny, powerful lights that could fit within the razorlike wing tips of supersonic jet aircraft. They first tried increasing the temperature of the tungsten filament to boost its light output. But, as expected, the tungsten metal quickly evaporated, blackening the bulb and causing the filament to break.
<P>
Then they hit on a clever idea. Rather than filling the bulb with an inert gas, as in standard bulbs, they used a highly reactive element, iodine. This experiment spawned a variety of lamps now known as halogens for the type of gas that fills the interior (usually iodine or bromine).
<P>
Halogen lights take advantage of the peculiar chemistry of tungsten. At the extreme temperatures around the hot filament-about 3,000 degrees Celsius-tungsten vapor does not chemically combine with<B> </B>halogen gas. As<B> </B>the tungsten atoms approach the glass, however, they cool to below 800 degrees C and spontaneously react with the halogen, creating gaseous tungsten halide.

<BR>
<B>AIRCRAFT LIGHTS</B> have to be small and bright. Such demanding requirements first spurred scientists and engineers at General Electric to develop the halogen lamp.
<BR CLEAR=ALL><HR><P>
Molecules formed in this way migrate toward the center of the bulb and reach the eroding filament. Because the tungsten halide is unstable there, it decomposes, releasing halogen gas and depositing solid tungsten back on the glowing filament.
<P>
Halogen lamps thus shine brighter for longer because tungsten metal does not darken the glass but instead cycles back to help "heal"<B> </B>the eroding filament. Halogen lights are widely employed as floodlights, for automobile headlights and as desk lamps for the home or office. Some still find their way into airplane wings.

<CENTER><H2><B>WAKING UP</B></H2>Finding a purpose for sleep has been as elusive as rest to an<BR>
insomniac, but researchers are getting much closer</CENTER><P>
<P>
Sleep may well be "a gentle thing, beloved from pole to pole," as
Samuel Taylor Coleridge observed. For physiologists, it remains a
<A HREF="http://bisleep.medsch.ucla.edu/">biological mystery</A> of the first order. Why should mammals and
birds spend such a large part of their lives unresponsive and,
worse, vulnerable? Although denying an animal sustenance produces
bodily changes that are readily measured, nobody understands what
harm is done to an animal--or a person--deprived of sleep. Yet
something clearly goes terribly wrong. Researchers have known for
more than a decade that a rat prevented from sleeping will lose
the ability to maintain body heat and die in about three weeks,
leaving no clues in the form of physiological damage. For humans,
sleep deprivation undermines thinking, but science has no
explanation.<P>
There are, however, plenty of theories--and thus plenty of enmity
in the field. Sleepers lower their metabolic rate, thereby
conserving energy. But this does not explain why we lose
consciousness. Most researchers believe sleep benefits the brain,
perhaps by giving neurons a chance to recuperate. Some, pointing
to the fervid neuronal activity during the bouts of REM
(rapid-eye movement) sleep that punctuate our nights, suggest we
doze to consolidate memories. Others propose that dreams are
mental junk being eliminated: we sleep to forget. Although it is
too soon to proclaim the conundrum of sleep solved, findings are
illuminating processes that seem to control it. At the same time,
investigators are refining their ideas about the benefits of
slumber for the brain. Understanding its purposes may ultimately
help the millions of people who suffer from sleep disorders,
which range in severity from the merely irritating to the fatal.<P>
The starting point for many investigations into the control of
sleep has been the hypothalamus, a platformlike structure in the
brain that has long been known to have an important role. Damage
to the back part of the hypothalamus causes somnolence,
suggesting that when intact, it maintains alertness. Damage near
the front part, in contrast, induces insomnia, indicating that
the spur to sleep is there. Investigators have long looked for a
controlling circuit for slumber that operates between the two
halves of the hypothalamus.<P>
The hypothalamus also plays a part in temperature regulation, and
some physiologists have speculated that sleep evolved out of a
more primitive thermostat. Last year M. Noor Alam, Dennis McGinty
and Ronald Szymusiak of the Department of Veterans Affairs
Medical Center in Sepulveda, Calif., found the <A HREF="http://www.uth.tmc.edu/apstracts/1995/regulatory/May/138r.html">first evidence</A> of
neurons that fill both functions. The team discovered neurons in
the front part of the hypothalamus of cats that fire more rapidly
when they are warmed by two degrees Celsius--and automatically
increase their firing rate while the animal sleeps. The
researchers suggest that these neurons are part of the body's
thermostat and that they are responsible for controlling
naturally occurring non-REM sleep.<P>
A <A HREF="http://highwire.stanford.edu/science/scripts/display/short/271/5246/216.html">related discovery</A> was reported earlier this year by Jonathan E.
Sherin, Priyattam J. Shiromani, Robert W. McCarley and Clifford
B. Saper of Harvard Medical School. These workers uncovered
evidence that clusters of neurons in part of the front
hypothalamus of rats--a site called the ventrolateral preoptic
(VLPO)--seem to be activated when the animal is not awake. The
researchers tracked the levels of a gene product that appears to
be present whenever a cell is busy: the busy signal in these
neurons was greater in animals that had slept more.<P>
Sherin and his colleagues then took another step. They had
previously suspected that neurons in the VLPO region send
extensions to the rear part of the hypothalamus. By injecting
what is called a retrograde tracer into the suspected target
region in the rear of the hypothalamus and then following the
diffusion of the tracer, they proved that the sleep-active
neurons in the VLPO area did indeed project to the back part of
the hypothalamus, where they wrap around their target cells. The
pathway "probably is playing a major role and may play a critical
role in helping sleep," according to Saper.<P>
Evidence from two quite different avenues of inquiry is
consistent with the idea that a crucial piece of the puzzle
resides in that region. One is narcolepsy, which affects 250,000
Americans, causing them suddenly and unpredictably to lose muscle
control and fall asleep. Any emotionally laden event--even hearing
a joke--can trigger such attacks. Neurologists have supposed that
some specific type of brain damage must underlie the condition,
but nobody has been able to pinpoint it.<P>
Until now. Jerome M. Siegel of the University of California at
Los Angeles studied the brains of narcoleptic Doberman pinschers
and found destruction of cells in the amygdala, a region involved
in emotional responses. Damage to these areas could explain the
symptoms of narcolepsy, Siegel suggests. Moreover, neurons run
from the amygdala to the front part of the hypothalamus. It is
therefore possible, others observe, that cell death in the
amygdala might somehow influence the VLPO, bringing on drowsiness
and the loss of muscle control characteristic of REM sleep.<P>
Another VLPO clue comes from studies of circadian rhythms,
described roughly as a 24-hour cycle of sleep and waking.
Recognized as providing one cue for sleep in animal studies, the
circadian clock resides in a part of the hypothalamus called the
suprachiasmatic nucleus. And the suprachiasmatic nucleus sends
neuronal projections to the VLPO, Saper reports. This pathway
could be what directs signals about the time of day from the
suprachiasmatic nucleus to the VLPO region.<P>
Details of the neural circuitry that turn on sleep beg the
question of what sleep is ultimately for. No damage to the brain
prevents sleep indefinitely, notes <A HREF="http://www.cmhc.com/articles/sleep1.htm">James M. Krueger</A> of the
University of Tennessee. Therefore, Krueger argues, the final
explanation must involve a benefit to neural functioning. And he
asserts that the benefit is closely linked to the immune system.<P>
Krueger points to experiments conducted by Carol A. Everson, also
at Tennessee, showing that rats deprived of sleep have high
numbers of bacterial pathogens that are normally suppressed by
the immune system. Everson says there is little doubt that the
bacteria eventually kill the rats. The exhausted, dying rats fail
to develop fever, which would be the normal response to
infection. Prolonged sleep deprivation, then, apparently
dangerously suppresses the immune system. In humans, even
moderate sleep deprivation has a detectable influence on immune
system cells.<P>
Further, the effect of sleep on the immune system is not a
one-way street: the immune system affects sleep in return.
Infections are well known to cause sleepiness, and Krueger has
shown that several cytokines, molecules that regulate immune
response, can by themselves induce slumber. In addition,
cytokines have direct effects on neural development. Krueger and
his colleagues have recently demonstrated that in rats, a gene
for one cytokine becomes more active in the brain during sleep.
He suggests that <A HREF="http://www.med.uoeh-u.ac.jp/Symposium95/Krueger.html">cytokine activity during sleep</A> reconditions the
synapses, the critical junctions between neurons, thereby
solidifying memories. The cytokines also keep the immune system
in shape. Neural pathways like the one in the VLPO region,
according to Krueger, may simply coordinate a process that arises
at the level of small groups of neurons.<P>
Many physiologists still regard Krueger's ideas as
speculative--but later this year Krueger says he will present hard
data indicating that cytokines are involved in normal sleep.
Genetically engineered mice that lack receptors for two important
cytokines, interleukin-1 and tumor necrosis factor, sleep less
than usual, Krueger says. So these and related cytokines may well
trigger normal sleep in healthy animals, not just the sleepiness
of infection and fever.<P>
Whether cytokines, heat-sensitive neurons and the VLPO area
indeed hold the key to understanding sleep is a question for the
future. But one thing is clear: sleep researchers have never
before had so many tantalizing leads or such a full
agenda.

<CENTER><H2>POT LUCK</H2>Linear A, an ancient script, 
<BR>is unearthed in Turkey</CENTER>
<P>
Throughout this century, scholars studying the ancient civilizations of the Mediterranean have pondered a vexing puzzle. The mystery unfolded soon after 1900, when the English archaeologist Sir Arthur J. Evans began excavating the buried palace of Minos at Knossos on the island of Crete. Among the many artifacts found were clay tablets bearing two related forms of unintelligible writing that Evans termed Linear A and Linear B script. 
<P>
Evans, along with many other classicists, struggled for decades to decode the enigmatic symbols. It was an amateur-a young English architect named Michael G. Ventris-who finally deciphered Linear B in 1952, concluding correctly that the language it represented was archaic Greek. The older and more rarely preserved Linear A code seemed obviously of a different origin, but the identity of that language remained unknown. Now an archaeological discovery in Turkey links the authors of that script-the so-called Minoans-with lands to the east. 
<P>
There are many thoughts about what language the far-ranging Minoans spoke. Some scholars believe Linear A inscriptions may be in the language of the Hittites, who some 4,000 years ago dominated what is now Turkey. Others suggest that Linear A transcribes Luwian, a more obscure ancient language of that area. Some have proposed that Linear A symbols spell out Semitic words. It also may be completely possible that the mysterious dialect of the Minoans is not related to any known language at all. 
<P>
Because there is so little certainty about the origin or extent of Minoan civilization, scholars have been particularly intrigued by the recent findings: Wolf-Dietrich Niemeier of the University of Heidelberg's Archeological Institute has discovered Minoan artifacts bearing Linear A script on mainland Turkey, marking a strong connection between the ancient inhabitants of Crete and the mainland to the east.
<P>
Niemeier's work began in 1994, at the ruins of Miletus. He had returned to excavations made there by German teams during the 1950s and 1960s. Niemeier installed powerful pumps to lower the water table so that he could explore even deeper levels. Although his initial discovery of Linear A was made during the first season of fieldwork, he did not realize the significance of the find. He thought the curious marks incised on a shard of pottery were just a graffito, a mere doodle. But in the second year his team uncovered two additional pieces with similar inscriptions. At that point, Niemeier remarks, "I recognized it immediately as Linear A." He remembered the earlier discovery: "We pulled out the box with the shard, the so-called graffito, and it matched."
<P>
According to Thomas G. Palaima, chairman of the department of classics at the University of Texas at Austin, "There's absolutely no doubt that this is Linear A." With only small fragments of pottery bearing three signs found so far, there is not much to read-even if one knew how. Still, this cryptic message helps to paint a picture of the Minoans who lived some 36 centuries ago.
<P>
Because Minoan artifacts have been found on several of the Aegean Islands, experts have wondered whether these people presided over a maritime empire that stretched beyond Crete. Did they, for example, rule overseas colonies, or was it just that they exported their wares? (To make an analogy, one might find Chinese porcelain among items from Victorian England, yet it would be wrong to conclude that China had dominated the British Isles.)
<P>
From the type of clay used, it is apparent that the pottery in Miletus was made locally. It is also clear that these Linear A symbols were inscribed before the pot on which they were written was fired. According to Palaima, these facts (and the observation that one of the signs is rather rare) suggest that Minoan speakers must have been there-probably as members of a Minoan colony.
<P>
Greater insight into Minoan society would come from reading Linear A inscriptions, but decoding remains elusive, in part because so few examples have been available to scrutinize. Perhaps archaeologists as determined as Niemeier will eventually recover sufficient text to make decipherment possible. But for the time being, the mystery of Linear A endures.

A whiff of supersymmetry at Fermilab
</CENTER>
<P>
A single piece of data rarely draws much serious attention -
except when it comes from the Fermi National Accelerator
Laboratory. Earlier this year the lab reported that its Tevatron
collider produced an anomaly suggesting that quarks might have
structure, a violation of cherished conventional wisdom. More
recently, it noted that the collider generated an event hinting
that supersymmetric particles were formed. <P>
<A HREF="http://aps.org/april96/vpr/B12.01.html">Supersymmetry</A>, or SUSY for short, is the theory that extends the
Standard Model, currently a successful, albeit conceptually
incomplete, view of subatomic particles and the forces that act
on them. SUSY unifies those two aspects by postulating that every
particle of matter has a force partner and that every force
particle has a matter partner. An electron has a SUSY mate called
a selectron, the photon has a photino, and so on. (Supersymmetry
is also a natural outgrowth of superstring theory, currently the
most popular "theory of everything.") <P>
For years, though, SUSY remained just a nice idea, for most SUSY
particles are hypothesized to be extremely heavy, and the energy
needed to create them lay beyond the power of current
accelerators. But calculations indicated that on rare occasions
particle collisions might give birth to the lightest SUSY
particles. <P>
That's what the Tevatron may have created. The world's most
powerful accelerator, it smashes protons and antiprotons
together, yielding a burst of energy that can form other
particles. In April 1995, during the Tevatron's second round of
collisions to confirm the discovery of the top quark (the last of
the six quarks to be found), unusual by-products emerged from one
collision. Two electrons, two photons and a shortfall of energy
were found, which could not be explained by the Standard Model.
<P>
The missing energy suggests that a SUSY particle may have emerged
from the wreckage but went undetected. More than 10 years ago
Gordon L. Kane and his colleagues at the University of Michigan
calculated that a proton-antiproton collision could first produce
a selectron and its antimatter twin. The selectron would then
decay into a photon and a photino, and the photino into a photon
and a Higgsino, the superpartner of the hypothetical Higgs
boson. The antiselectron would decay in a similar way. With more
generic assumptions, Michael Dine and his collaborators at the
University of California at Santa Cruz figured that the event may
have produced a superlight gravitino, the partner of the
graviton, the particle of gravity. <P>
"Anything can happen once," remarks <A HREF="http://rainbow.uchicago.edu/%7Ephys_web/x_part.html#Frisch">Henry J. Frisch</A> of the
University of Chicago, a member of one of the Fermilab detection
teams. He notes that the data, which have yet to be published,
are still being analyzed. "What one can do is take such an event
as a signpost and ask, 'What is it trying to tell me?'" <P>
Possibly quite a bit, at least according to Kane. Higgsino
production would not only explain the Fermilab event but would
also account for some inexplicable results obtained at the Large
Electron-Positron (LEP) collider at CERN, the European laboratory
for particle physics near Geneva. There researchers found that
so-called Z particles decayed in unexpected ways. Moreover, the
Higgsino could also be the invisible, cold dark matter thought to
permeate the universe. A Higgsino may weigh about 40 billion
electron volts, some 40 times a proton's heft. Calculating the
number of Higgsinos that would have been left over from the big
bang, Kane finds that Higgsinos provide just the right amount of
matter to account for the "missing mass" of the universe. <P>
Although Kane's proposal sounds too good to be true, he argues
that several consistency checks in the calculations all seem to
point to the same numbers. Barring some technical glitch, Kane
figures that the chance of the event happening under the auspices
of the Standard Model is slim: the Tevatron would have to run for
20,000 years. <P>
That fact would seem at least to put the SUSY proposal on much
firmer ground than the idea of quark structure. Given that other
detectors have never recorded evidence of what would be a major
aspect of matter, most physicists dismiss the explanation of
quark parts. <P>
Whether supersymmetric particles were created may be settled as
early as September. This past month LEP began a new round of
collisions, and researchers will be on the lookout for
supersymmetric particles. "One is certainly not out of line to be
optimistic," Kane states.

The trials and tribulations
of shrimp farming
</CENTER>
<P>
Shrimp farming is an economic mainstay for some countries, but it has also proved a mainstay of controversy. Both wealth and conflict were in evidence at a recent meeting at the United Nations. And although the International Shrimp Tribunal was run informally-no seating assignments, for instance-all the important issues were touched on.
<P>
Jason Clay of the World Wildlife Fund opened the session by reading a litany of woes. Shrimp fishing generates enormous bycatch, he stated: 10 pounds of finfish are killed for each pound of shrimp. Space for Third World shrimp farms is cleared by cutting down the mangroves in which many marine fish breed. Catching wild shrimp larvae and rearing them with intense concentrations of food and antibiotics leave coastal waters poisoned and adjacent lands saline. As a consequence, fishermen and farmers are uprooted. Further, the harvest is almost entirely exported; the farm owners are generally wealthy city dwellers who enjoy government support.
<P>
The chair, Jacob Scherr of the Natural Resources Defense Council, turned next to the countries slated to make presentations. But Ecuador was awaiting visual-display aids, and India had gone for a walk, so the U.S. described the positive results of attaching turtle-excluder devices to shrimping nets. Shrimp farming in the U.S. accounts for a mere 1,300 metric tons a year, but Alfredo Quarto of the Mangrove Action Project pointed out that in September 1995 a class-action suit was filed against shrimp farmers in Texas for polluting estuaries.
<P>
The lights were dimmed. Saraswadi Plod Prasop of Thailand said his government has allocated more than $40 million for mangrove conservation. His video sputtered on, displaying miles of shrimp ponds and shrimp fry reared by the Department of Fisheries wiggling off into the wild. But Quarto stood up again. "More than 50 percent of the ponds on Thai coasts are closed," he maintained. "The pollution problems are not resolved. The industry came to Thailand from Taiwan and is moving to Mexico, Cambodia, India. Behind it lies ruin." A report by Thailand's National Committee on Mangrove Resources estimated that 65,000 hectares of mangrove forests had been lost to shrimp farming by 1993, leaving only 168,700 hectares.
<P>
Ecuador-which produces $500-million worth of cultured shrimp a year-was up next and gave a slick presentation. The water flushed from shrimp farms, asserted Juan X. Cordovez of the National Chamber of Aquaculture, an industry group, is cleaner than the water taken in. The farms account for 67 percent of the country's exports; 9 percent of the population is supported by the industry. And the government is trying to stop mangrove destruction.
<P>
Gina Chavez of Accion Ecologica, however, had a different perspective. Bribes of $100 per hectare and connections between the industry and government ensure that permits for new farms keep flowing, she alleged; many people are displaced, and few benefit. Cordovez raised his eyebrows: "I don't know where she got her information." From documents of the Ministry of Agriculture, Chavez retorted.
<P>
Australia spoke, and half the room wandered off-the country was later congratulated for reducing its fishing fleet. The audience perked up when Japan took the floor and was asked if it cares how its consumption of shrimp-the world's largest after the U.S.-is affecting the environment. Japan said it recognizes its responsibilities but cannot take unilateral measures. Jacob D. Raj of the Indian nongovernmental organization PREPARE registered a protest: he stated that although Japan may discourage shrimp farms on its own coasts, it provides technical assistance to other countries to set them up.
<P>
The chair called Ghana, last on the roster. Edwin Barnes said Ghana does very little shrimp farming. A recent U.N. report recommended the pristine African coastline as the next prime location. "But I am beginning to wonder if this is an area we really want to get into," he said. "I need to have a second thought." For the first time, the room broke into applause.

EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY<BR>
<CENTER><H2>GROUP THINK</H2>A previously rejected theory 
<BR>
about natural selection 
<BR>
makes a comeback</CENTER><P>
<P>

Slowly, tentatively, the once shunned idea of group selection is
creeping back into evolutionary theory. The concept posits that
natural selection can operate not only on genes and individual
organisms, as most mainstream theorists hold, but on hives,
herds, clans and other aggregations of organisms. <P>

Charles Darwin himself speculated that natural selection might
favor groups whose members engaged in altruistic behavior, even
if the individual do-gooders harmed their own fitness. But in
1966 George C. Williams of the State University of New York at
Stony Brook attacked that proposal in his classic book
<I>Adaptation and Natural Selection. </I>Williams asserted that
genes encouraging truly altruistic behavior-defined as acts that
increase the fitness of others while decreasing the fitness of
the benign individual-would almost certainly vanish over time.
<P>

Other analysts argued that altruism could be explained by the
concepts of inclusive fitness, in which an individual's
apparently selfless act enhances the fitness of close relatives,
and reciprocal altruism, which posits that generosity toward
non-kin occurs only on a tit-for-tat basis. In the 1970s Richard
Dawkins of the University of Oxford pounded a few extra nails
into the coffin of group selection with his "selfish gene" model,
which built on the work of Williams. <P>

In large part through the determination of David Sloan Wilson of
S.U.N.Y. Binghamton, discussions of group selection are sprouting
up again. In fact, Wilson has been publishing papers on the topic
for some 20 years. Perhaps <A HREF="http://cogsci.ecs.soton.ac.uk/%7Ebbs/Archive/bbs.wilson.html">his most influential paper</A>, however,
is one co-authored with his frequent collaborator Elliott R.
Sober, a philosopher at the University of Wisconsin, and
published in the December 1994 issue of <I>Behavioral and Brain
Sciences.</I> <P>

Wilson and Sober argue that just as separate organisms can be
viewed as collections of mutually dependent genes, so groups can
be like "individuals in the harmony and coordination of their
parts." In the eyes of Wilson and Sober, a group may be not only
a close-knit family but also a community of unrelated individuals
and even a pair of different species locked in a symbiotic
relationship. When these groups compete with one another, natural
selection can favor one group over another and so exert a strong
influence on the group's characteristics. <P>

The article provoked a guardedly positive response. Thomas D.
Seeley of Cornell University is "sympathetic" to the idea that
group selection can explain the behavior of certain social
insects-namely, bees. Within the same hive, bees certainly
compete with one another, Seeley explains, but they may also band
together to compete with other hives for resources, thus acting
like one organism. But Seeley thinks Wilson "goes overboard" in
ascribing the behavior of more complex animals-namely, humans-to
group selection. <P>

"There is some value in [Wilson's] terminology and focus," says
Paul W. Ewald of Amherst College, an authority on the evolution
of diseases, "because it helps us think about the survival of
packets of organisms" in fresh ways. For example, Ewald notes,
the selfish-gene model implies that microorganisms inhabiting a
larger animal should tend to replicate as rapidly as
possible-even if that means they kill off their host. The fact
that certain parasitic microorganisms settle into a more benign
and stable relationship with their host makes sense from the
perspective of group selection, according to Ewald. <P>

On the other hand, he observes, avirulence can be explained by
the kin selection hypothesis, which is a major component of the
selfish-gene model but which Wilson and Sober consider to be a
type of group selection. "So much of this argument comes down to
semantics," Ewald says. Williams, the original slayer of the
group selection concept, has a similar complaint, arguing that
Wilson and Sober "define group selection in such a way as to make
everything group selection." <P>

Undeterred, Wilson is organizing symposia on group selection for
the annual meeting of the <A HREF="http://psych.lmu.edu/hbes.htm">Human Behavior and Evolution Society</A>,
to be held June 26 to 30 at Northwestern University, and for the
American Society of Naturalists, convening August 11 to 15 in
Providence, R.I. Wilson and Sober also attempt to explain human
morality in group selection terms in <I>Unto Others: The
Evolution of Altruism, </I>which is scheduled to be published
next year by Harvard University Press.  -<I>John Horgan</I>

ANTI GRAVITY<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Wonderful Town</H2></CENTER><P>
<P>

No wonder it's "the city that never sleeps." A study in the May
issue of Fertility and Sterility showed that New York City leads
the nation in sperm counts. Actually, the study found that the
Big Apple outdoes only two other cities. But, more important, the
findings contradict previous studies suggesting a global decline
in sperm counts. <P>

Unless you are one of those people who thinks Testicles was a
hero of the Trojan War, you have probably read about the possible
link between falling sperm counts and chemicals that may behave
like estrogens. A 1992 paper by Danish researcher Niels
Skakkebaek noted that studies done around the world indicated
that sperm counts had fallen from about 113 million per
milliliter in 1938 to 66 million per milliliter in 1990. Combine
that with a rise in testicular cancer and genetic reproductive
abnormalities in some countries, and experts began to worry that
we were on our way to a future of infertility. Accounts of the
controversy appeared in this magazine (which is published in New
York). <P>

The new study, by Harry Fisch and colleagues at the
Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center (which is in New York),
reports that what Skakkebaek took to be a worldwide decline may
have been a misinterpretation of natural geographic variations.
"There are geographic variations in everything-cancer and heart
disease, for example," Fisch says. "I would be more surprised if
sperm counts were the same everywhere." <P>

Fisch looked at counts for about 1,300 men who had donated at
sperm banks in New York, Roseville, Minn., and Los Angeles
between 1970 and 1994. Rather than diminishing, counts rose in
New York and Roseville. The differences among cities, however,
were striking. Los Angeles came in at 73 million per milliliter,
Roseville at 101. Start spreading the news that New York, N.Y.,
came in at the top of the heap with a whopping 132. <P>

This New York talent could account for a misperception of an
international decline-apparently, it's not true that if you can
make it there, you can make it anywhere. When Fisch examined the
1992 Danish paper, he found that 94 percent of the men studied
before 1970 were from the U.S., 87 percent of them from New York.
But after 1970, only half the subjects came from the U.S.-and
only 25 percent of them were New Yorkers. If geographic
variations do exist in sperm production, then what appeared to be
a ubiquitous decline may have been merely the result of a shift
in study sites. <P>

None of which explains New York's explosive ability for sperm
production. "We don't know why New York sperm counts are
highest," Fisch admits. In what may or may not be a related
story, New York was recently shown to lead the nation in
obsessive-compulsive disorder. With so much sperm to count, this
was perhaps obvious.    -<I>Steve Mirsky in New York City</I>

<B>Vive la Francium
<P>
</B>Physicists have for the first time trapped atoms of <A HREF="http://mwanal.lanl.gov/julie/imagemap/periodic/87.html">francium</A>, the rarest naturally occurring element. Because francium decays very quickly, the team needed to make one million atoms of it each second. Workers used six laser beams and a magnetic field to hold some 10,000 francium atoms in a space the size of a pinhead. Francium has a very simple structure, and so it may enable scientists to make precise measurements of the weak nuclear interaction.

<B>Allergy Relief
<P>
</B>Soon peptides and DNA vaccines, rather than antihistamines, may stop the sniffles and itching of an allergy attack. Scientists have created two peptides that block the activity of IgE, an immunoglobulin molecule that normally attaches itself to allergens-say, pollen-and in doing so starts the allergic response. Another group is developing vaccines containing DNA that encodes other kinds of allergens. Through exposure to irritating proteins, such as those made by dust mites, the body may become tolerant.

<B>Forecast on Venus
<P>
</B><A HREF="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/venus.html">Venus</A> was long considered the best example of a runaway greenhouse effect: its atmosphere consists mostly of carbon dioxide, and its surface is about 850 degrees Fahrenheit. Earth, too, it was thought, would continually warm if its atmosphere were saturated with carbon dioxide. But according to a new study by a team at the University of Colorado at Boulder, Venus, like Earth, may have an unstable climate system that could suddenly change.

<B>Disease-Free Mosquitoes 
<P>
</B>The dengue virus, which can cause deadly hemorrhagic fevers, often spreads by way of mosquitoes. Netting and vaccines have failed to keep transmission in check. So scientists have searched out a new solution: through genetic engineering, they have made insects that cannot carry the virus from one victim to the next. The altered genes block viral replication. <P>

It's a new comet, caught by NASA's <A HREF="http://huey.jpl.nasa.gov/%7Espravdo/neat.html">Near-Earth Asteroid Tracking</A> (NEAT) system camera. True to its name, NEAT found four new asteroids as well-two of which, scientists say, may someday hit Earth. A recent report notes that a similarly hazardous asteroid or comet probably touched down in Kansas, Missouri and Illinois 320 million years ago. A string of craters across these states resembles the marks that Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 made when it bombarded Jupiter for a week in July 1994.

<B>Anatomy Update</B>

A year ago scientists working on a cadaver uncovered an unknown muscle used for mastication. Now confirmation has come from several sources, including The Dissectible Human, an interactive CD-ROM by Engineering Animation.

<B>Staying Afloat
<P>
</B>Scientists now have all the facts about how some fish control the depth at which they swim. Workers knew that many species rise by pumping gas into a swim bladder and sink by sucking gas out of that same organ, regulating the flux by way of lactic acid. The acidity prompts hemoglobin in the blood to release oxygen gas. But what they didn't know until now was that the lower pH radically alters hemoglobin's shape, making it less able to bind to oxygen.

<B>Crystallization Made Easy
<P>
</B>To study the structure of proteins, scientists must first arrange them into crystalline layers. It is not a simple task, but a new technique from the California Institute of Technology and the University of Washington should make it easier. Researchers designed special lipids adorned with copper ions. The lipids align themselves into thin films, and the ions bind to an amino acid that nearly all proteins contain. Thus, like tugboats, the lipids grab proteins and pack them into a dense sheet, seeding a two-dimensional crystal in the process.<P>

<B>Modeling Life from Clay
<P>
</B><A HREF="http://phserver.rpi.edu/dept/chem/rpichem/faculty/research/Ferris.html">James P. Ferris</A> and his colleagues at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies have recently revised the recipe for cooking up life from scratch. Since Darwin's day, molecular chefs had mixed organic and inorganic ingredients in solution, hoping the resulting nucleic acid-based polymers would become long enough to establish a genetic system. But, alas, the polymers always remained too short-suggesting that life did not spring forth from some primordial soup. Now Ferris has found that by letting the polymers condense on claylike minerals, they can become long enough to, in principle, self-replicate and evolve. His finding lends strong support to the notion that clay contributed to the start of life.

Micromechanics helps to 
<BR>
integrate electronics and 
<BR>
optical technologies
</CENTER>
<P>

The image of spinning motors no more than a hair's width graced
the science pages of newspapers in the late 1980s. But what
exactly do you do with a rotor 70 microns wide? The rotating
elements on these tiny motors produced only a few trillionths of
a newton-meter of torque, enough to get a flagella to its
destination, but not much else. <P>

Nearly a decade after the headlines, a few intrepid researchers
have found  compelling applications for miniature motors and
other microscopic machinery. These mite-size actuators may prove
ideal for manipulating something as light as light. Vanishingly
small machines can move tiny mirrors, lenses and other elements
so that photons reflect, transmit or diffract. In their best
techno-gibberish, engineers are calling this nascent field
micro-opto-mechanical systems, often lovingly reduced to the
acronym "MOMS." <P>

Semiconductor manufacturer Texas Instruments has perhaps best
highlighted the prospects for this natural coupling of optics
with electronics. The company has begun to find a market for an
electronic display whose picture elements, or pixels, are
controlled by micromechanical structures. The display contains
500,000 aluminum mirrors, each of which measures 16 microns on a
side. The mirrors tilt into an "on" or "off" position in response
to an electrical impulse. When the display is turned on, pulses
of colored light are reflected onto a larger screen. Texas
Instruments has sold its display to 13 companies that have begun
to market it for projectors or for use in computers [see
"Engineering Microscopic Machines," by Kaigham J. Gabriel;
September 1995]. <P>

But Texas Instruments is no longer alone. A number of
universities and small companies, some of which receive funding
from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, have begun to
explore the use of micromechanics as a technology for processing
light. For instance, <A HREF="http://dumbo.eeap.cwru.edu/eeapdept/Mehregany.html">Mehran Mehregany</A> and his colleagues at Case
Western Reserve University have put a scanner on a chip,
fashioning a miniaturized version of the kind of supermarket
checkout system that reads a bar code with a beam of light. The
scanner was made by etching a diffraction grating into the middle
of the spinning micromotors. To operate it, an infrared laser
diode focuses its light on the grating (a series of parallel
grooves in the surface of the rotor). The grating diffracts the
beam onto a bar code, and the movement of the rotor scans the
beam across the various lines. The light reflected off the bar
code hits a photodetector, which translates the signal into an
electrical impulse for processing by computing circuitry. <P>

Such microscanners could become small and cheap. The rotating
scanning element, which is 500 microns in diameter, is larger
than the earliest micromotors. But it is minuscule enough that
many spinning wheels can work simultaneously. Such an array could
read complex bar codes that contain more than just the product
name and price. In addition, a scanner could be used by
telecommunications companies to diffract light from an incoming
signal, allowing information from one optical fiber to be
channeled to several other fibers. Mehregany and his team have
also developed a process to create mirrorlike finishes on
silicon. A silicon mirror, etched onto a cantilevered beam that
rises off the surface of a microchip, can tune the wavelength of
a laser or serve as a filter in a device capable of converting
optical signals into electronic impulses. <P>

Researchers at the University of California at Los Angeles have
begun to integrate a broad range of optical devices on a silicon
microchip. The group, headed by <A HREF="http://www.ee.ucla.edu/faculty/Wu.html">Ming Wu</A>, has made an optical
light bench-that is, a miniaturized version of the collection of
lenses, lasers and filters used in university physics
departments. Aligning and positioning optical components is
usually a task painstakingly carried out by skilled technicians.
In a large-scale optical bench, components are attached to
sophisticated mountings on stabilized tables. In Wu's setup, all
the optical elements, except the lasers, can be made on a
microchip using conventional lithographic and etching techniques.
This approach avoids the expensive and labor-intensive assembly
of optoelectronic components by hand. <P>

The U.C.L.A. workers have fashioned a lens attached to a
microscopic hinge, developed by electrical engineering professor
<A HREF="http://synergy.icsl.ucla.edu/%7Epister/pister.html">Kristofer S. J. Pister</A>. The hinge allows the lens to rotate until
it sits at right angles to the chip's silicon surface. Once the
lens is raised off the flat silicon, a beam parallel to the
microchip surface can pass through it. Although the lens still
requires some manual adjustment-a step that researchers are
trying to eliminate-the final alignment of the device can be made
by micromechanical motors, small plates that turn or move back
and forth underneath the lens. <P>

This method might be used to build a read-head (or sensing
head)-the mechanical sensor that moves across the surface of an
optical disk to decode data. The negligible weight of a
micromechanical head would let it move more quickly over the disk
surface, speeding up the rate at which data can be read. Wu has
used the same techniques to fabricate a mechanical switch that
can route an optical signal so that it bypasses a faulty
computer. <P>

Other research has targeted micro-opto-mechanical systems for
adaptive optics that can adjust light entering a telescope to
compensate for distortions introduced by the presence of
atmospheric turbulence. The ideas-and the acronyms-are bound to
keep flowing. And if all goes well, engineers should learn to
love their MOMS.        -<I>Gary Stix</I>

ASTRONOMY<BR>
<CENTER><H2>TREBLE VISION</H2>Combining telescopes 
<BR>makes seeing easier</CENTER>
<P>

If one telescope does not provide a clear enough view of a
distant star or galaxy, why not use two, three or more? The idea
of blending light from different instruments to improve the
quality of images has tantalized astronomers for decades. Modern
high-speed light detectors and computers are putting the goal
within reach for arrays of telescopes a few tens of meters apart.
<P>

Earlier this year a group at the Cambridge Optical Aperture
Synthesis Telescope (<A HREF="http://www.phy.cam.ac.uk/www/research/ra/coast.home.html">COAST</A>) in England achieved a notable first
when it published a test image of a double star obtained by
<A HREF="http://www.aip.org/pt/9505interf.html">optical interferometry</A>. This technique has proved challenging: in
order to form a clear image, the lengths of the light beams from
the observed object have to be within a few wavelengths of one
another as they come through the different instruments.
Unfortunately, atmospheric turbulence continually changes the
path length above the respective telescopes; the light beams must
be equalized by equipment that monitors fluctuations and rapidly
compensates for them. The COAST instruments, for example, bounce
their beams off computer-controlled mirrors on moving,
rail-mounted trolleys. <P>

The equipment of the Navy Prototype Optical Interferometer (<A HREF="http://aries.usno.navy.mil/ad_home/npoi.html">NPOI</A>)
near Flagstaff, Ariz., works similarly. Not to be outdone by the
English team, J. Thomas Armstrong of NPOI notes that his
colleagues also now have data that indicate a double star. COAST
and NPOI both use three small telescopes for their observations,
and each will soon introduce a fourth. <P>

Several large planned projects-on Mount Wilson in California, in
Hawaii and in Chile-will also use optical interferometry to boost
resolution. The Hawaii project may be the most ambitious of the
three. It envisages linking the two 10-meter Keck telescopes on
Mauna Kea. This double-headed instrument will break new ground
because it will use the light from a bright "guide star," which
resides close to the object of interest, to equalize the path
lengths of the relevant light beams. <P>

The upshot of the innovation is that the Keck interferometer
should be able to detect oscillations in the positions of stars.
These variations would, in turn, suggest the presence of orbiting
planets one thirtieth the mass of Jupiter in systems 30
light-years away. A prototype has proved that the concept, at
least, works, according to Michael Shao of the Jet Propulsion
Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. <P>

Although ground-based interferometry can provide much higher
resolution than the <I>Hubble Space Telescope </I>for small,
bright objects, it is not so good with larger, complex ones. The
latter require more intricate calculations. So <I>Hubble</I> has
nothing to fear, at least for a few years. <P>

<H2>Panacea Lost?</H2>
Pity the economist who tries 
<BR>
to market social insights

</CENTER>
<P>

Crime, substance abuse and other social ills are generally
considered to have a relatively indirect connection to economic
theory. But lately economists have been asserting that these
problems, too, are subject to the inexorable laws of supply and
demand. Raise taxes on beer, and highway deaths will fall,
asserts the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER). Lower
drug prices (say, by decriminalizing marijuana or cocaine), and
the number of addicts will climb. This spring a paper by Steven
Levitt of Harvard University-reporting that increased police
hiring is effective against crime-ended up on President Bill
Clinton's desk during budget debates.<P>

Levitt's work was based on the observation that mayors tend to
beef up police forces during election years to make voters think
they are "tough on crime."<B> </B>As elections otherwise have
relatively little effect on the rate of mugging, burglaries or
petty theft, Levitt reasoned, any reduction in crime that showed
an election-year cycle could probably be attributed to increased
police activity rather than to other, extraneous causes. Levitt
freely concedes, however, that his work probably traveled as far
as it did because of its conclusion rather than its impeccable
logic.<P>

In general, economists' work has been of less use to
policymakers' preconceptions.<B> </B>Christopher J. Ruhm of the
University of North Carolina at Greensboro, who did the
alcohol-related research that the NBER relies on, notes that 30
of the 48 contiguous states did not change the nominal tax on a
case of beer at all during the period in the mid-1980s for which
he analyzed data. Because of inflation, that translates to a
significant decline in the effective tax rate.<P>

Nevertheless, traffic deaths related to alcohol declined,
apparently thanks to other measures, such as more stringent
enforcement<B> </B>of drunk-driving laws, the increase in the
minimum legal drinking age, grassroots antidrinking
campaigns and improvements in automotive safety. Ruhm and his
colleagues are left to argue, based on the differing rates of
decrease<B> </B>in the states that raised alcohol taxes compared
with those that kept them the same, that the taxes are more
effective than other laws alone. Michael Grossman of the NBER
notes that the most recent federal alcohol-tax increase, in 1991,
was passed in order to raise revenue, and the legislators
rejected efforts to hike the tax rate to a point that might
reduce consumption (and thus government income) significantly.<P>

The current test case for economic theory appears to be the war
on drugs. Henry Saffer of the NBER and Frank J. Chaloupka of the
University of Illinois are among the few who have undertaken
studies of the laws of supply and demand for illegal drugs. They
correlated a database of prices from 15,000 undercover
purchases of heroin and 23,000 of cocaine by the Drug Enforcement
Administration with responses to drug-use questions from the
Census Bureau's National Household Survey on Drug Abuse given
between 1988 and 1991 (the survey does not cover homeless
people, prisoners or college students).<P>

After adjustments for the "nonlinear" relation between price and
quality, Saffer says, a detectable relation between drug prices
and consumption emerged. A 10 percent increase in the price of
cocaine led to about a 3 percent decrease in the number of people
using the drug more than once a month. (Although, as Chaloupka
points out, the effects of cost are hard to disentangle from
those of the stepped-up police work usually responsible for price
increases.) <P>

Curiously, the Drug Enforcement Administration does not release
similarly detailed information on the price of marijuana, even
though it commands a far larger market share than harder drugs.
Chaloupka says he and Saffer tried to make do with the limited
data they could get, but the analysis "did not pay off," yielding
relations between price and demand that made little apparent
sense. As with any heavily regulated market, it appears that
simple economic arguments may be inadequate.<P>

For certain issues, researchers may want to emulate Levitt: while
Democrats were citing his conclusion that police hiring reduces
crime, Republicans were brandishing another of his papers, more
to their taste, showing that increasing the number of convicts in
prison has a similar effect.    -<I>Paul Wallich</I></TD></TR>

It's not quite the handheld medical scanner you've seen on <I>Star
Trek</I>, but simply push a button, and this spectrophotometer can
quickly diagnose what's finishing off your foliage. The device,
designed by a team of scientists led by Larry S. Daley and Li
Ning at Oregon State University, monitors the fluorescence of
living plants. It can detect subtle changes in the vegetation's
health long before problems become apparent to the naked eye. <P>
Daley and Ning's instrument relies on the fact that during
photosynthesis, leaves produce strong fluorescence signals and
that the intensity of the signal coming from a leaf depends on
how healthy it is. A plant damaged by frost barely emits a signal; a leaf
treated with an herbicide shows an unusual pattern of
fluorescence (left) as compared with a healthy leaf (right).
Typical plant monitors do not pick up variations that are
restricted to small areas because they look at averages for an
entire leaf or plant. <P>
Botanists such as Gary A. Strobel of Montana State University see
exciting uses for the new instrument in agriculture,
environmental monitoring and even home horticulture. Daley cites
a project the team has recently begun in collaboration with
companies interested in remote-sensing technology: because the
cost of coffee goes up after a hard freeze, researchers would
like to be able to assess the amount of damage so that prices can
be set accordingly. Such measurements might someday be possible
from satellites-permitting scientists to see the forest for its
leaves.

NUCLEAR POWER<BR>
<CENTER><H2>KEEPING THE 
<BR>"TIGER" AT BAY</H2>
<P>
With fewer experts and facilities, 
<BR>
the DOE is trying new ways 
<BR>
of preventing nuclear accidents</CENTER><P>
<P>
One of the most dreaded mishaps involving nuclear materials is an accidental criticality-the inadvertent accumulation of enough fissile materials, typically plutonium or highly enriched uranium, to cause a spontaneous shower of deadly radiation. Since the mid-1940s, there have been 34 known cases of accidental criticality in the U.S. Five of them killed a total of seven people; those five and others also injured workers or subjected them to significant doses of radiation.
<P>
Seven of the U.S. incidents, and one that happened in England in 1970, were "process" accidents, meaning they occurred at places where plutonium or highly enriched uranium was being created or processed. Last autumn it was revealed that 12 such episodes took place in the Soviet Union between 1953 and 1978. In the late 1980s, after the cold war, the U.S. and the Soviet Union stopped making plutonium and enriched uranium for weapons. Ironically, however, some experts say the threat of criticality is perhaps greater now than ever. 
<P>
"The eight previous criticality accidents [in the U.S. and the U.K.] in processing plants were in situations very similar to what we're in today," notes Shirley J. Olinger of the U.S. Department of Energy's Rocky Flats complex near Denver. For the past seven years, the DOE, which oversees the national weapons complexes, has been decommissioning and decontaminating some plants. At certain sites, those tasks involve extracting fissile nuclear materials from ducts or air filters, from decommissioned weapons or from pipes or tanks.
<P>
"In the past, process accidents almost always occurred during nonstandard, cleanup-type activities and with materials in solution," explains Ronald A. Knief of Ogden Environmental &AMP Energy Services in Albuquerque, N.M. Criticalities in solutions have been triggered by accumulations of as little as 1.5 kilograms of plutonium or 2.5 kilograms of highly enriched uranium.
<P>
There are other complications now, too. In recent years the DOE has lost to retirement many of its most experienced operators, engineers and criticality-safety specialists, most of whom spent their entire careers at the plants. Also, the DOE has only one laboratory, at Los Alamos in New Mexico, performing safety-related experiments on critical mass. As recently as the late 1980s there were three; the others were shut down for budgetary reasons (the one at Los Alamos narrowly escaped the budget ax in 1993).
<P>
There have been no such accidents in the U.S. since 1978. But over the past few years, there have been several serious violations of rules established to prevent them. These procedures are conservative, and in none of these cases was a criticality imminent. In the fall of 1994 an infraction took place at the Y-12 facility of the Oak Ridge complex in Tennessee; another occurred around the same time at Rocky Flats. Each site had been hit hard by the loss of experienced personnel. At Oak Ridge, some drums containing highly enriched uranium were stored in a manner inconsistent with safety rules. At Rocky Flats, workers overstepped their authority by draining some solution from a tank, leaving an excessively high concentration of plutonium. Operations have been partly or entirely suspended, as experts review safety procedures and retrain workers.
<P>
Tara O'Toole, the DOE's assistant secretary for environment, safety and health, states that in the past, important knowledge about criticality and other subjects "lived in the individual and was passed person to person." That system is being supplanted by one dependent on worker training, supervision and an emphasis on rules. "We're trying to translate an individual-expertise-based culture to a standards-based one," O'Toole says. "This is a major and essential transformation for the DOE, and it has been painful," she adds. "We're talking about changing hearts, minds and human behavior, and it doesn't happen overnight."
<P>
Of course, authoritative information on criticality will still be needed. But with fewer labs, "we don't have the ability to get data on different operations and different configurations," Knief asserts. "In cleanup, what we're finding is fissile material mixed with other materials-it could be iron, silicon or components from steel or ceramic crucibles-and we don't have good experimental data on the neutronic, or chain-reaction, behavior of plutonium or uranium mixed with these residual materials."
<P>
Robert E. Wilson of Safe Sites of Colorado, the safety contractor at Rocky Flats, notes that the lack of specific data from critical-mass experiments requires specialists to "develop ways of building added margins of safety into the control system" governing some cleanup tasks. At the same time, the country's sole remaining critical-mass lab is working through a prioritized list of experiments suggested by other DOE sites, many of which need the data for cleanup.
<P>
Olinger and others maintain that even the best information and procedures are of little value if workers become complacent. Instilling vigilance can be especially challenging at Rocky Flats, she explains, because it is being decontaminated and decommissioned and because it is one of the few large DOE weapons sites that has never had a criticality accident. Keith Klein of the DOE's Rocky Flats organization agrees. "One of the problems we're acutely aware of," he says, "is when you've lived next to the tiger for so long, you can forget it's a dangerous animal."   <I>-Glenn Zorpette</I>

Pushing the Envelope
for Vaccines
</CENTER>
<P>
Gazing at the cream interior of Gursaran Prasad Talwar's office in New Delhi, I idly count about 40 framed certificates and medals-the French Legion of Honor, the Padmabhushan from India's president, a dancing Shiva with a citation at its base. The medals are displayed in velvet-lined cases laid open on the bookshelves, flanking brightly colored volumes on immunology and contraception. After some 30 minutes, Talwar turns around from reviewing a student's paper to ask what documents I need. The 70-year-old man projects an aura of power and vigor. His accented, measured speech is touched with an edge of wariness; I wonder why. I collect a volume and leave. The real interview is the following day, a Saturday, at Talwar's home.
<P>
Talwar, declares Sheldon Segal of the Population Council in New York City, is one of the top three scientists from the developing countries-"maybe the top one." In the 1970s Talwar pioneered a contraceptive vaccine that induces antibodies against part of the reproductive process in women. As the founder of India's National Institute of Immunology (NII) in 1986, he is credited with creating a world-class institute and training a generation of scientists. The ventures flowing from his fertile brain include a vaccine against leprosy, a topical contraceptive derived from the neem tree, a male contraceptive vaccine and others against prostate and lung cancer.
<P>
The next morning it takes fully 13 landmarks, sketched by Talwar on a map, for my taxi driver to find the whitewashed house at the end of a labyrinthine road. A uniformed guard opens the gate, escorting me into a living room hung with canvases by prominent local artists. Talwar is elegant in casual <I>khurta-pajamas;</I> he pours himself a drink while I settle into the silk cushions and request a coffee to clear my head. I note that I am intimidated by Talwar-as an Indian woman half his age, I automatically take on a respectful tone, and he, a paternal one. We begin, cautiously.
<P>
Talwar started his career by studying immunology at the Pasteur Institute in Paris. In 1956, after completing a Humboldt Fellowship in Germany, he joined the brand-new All India Institute of Medical Sciences in New Delhi. "For the first six years, we could do nothing," he recalls. "There were no buildings." After the facilities were built, he worked on ovarian hormones, figuring out an essential way in which estradiol promotes the growth of the uterus. "Talwar was a pioneer in demonstrating these steps," Segal attests. "He has not gotten enough credit."
<P>
The research was exciting. "But, you see, living in a country where you are surrounded by so many problems, you cannot remain immune from what is happening around you," Talwar explains. One ailment that caught his attention was leprosy. Only 1 percent of those who are exposed to the disease contract it. Talwar discovered a bacterium, called <I>Mycobacterium w, </I>that enhanced their immune response and speeded up the treatment regime. In one of his papers, I find astonishing before-and-after pictures, showing a woman's features transformed from a grotesque glob to a smooth, shiny face.
<P>
The vaccine is now undergoing clinical trials in India, along with rival vaccines from the World Health Organization and from Madhav G. Deo of the Cancer Research Institute in Bombay. Later I learn that Deo has alleged that <I>Mw</I> is actually the Bombay bacterium, which Talwar acquired and renamed: the two organisms are reported to be almost identical. Talwar admits to receiving Deo's culture but insists that <I>Mw </I>is different and that Deo has refused to provide his bacterium for comparison.
<P>
A six-year-old girl with dark eyes and a long braid, Talwar's granddaughter Nayana, shyly comes in to display her colorful sketch. Duly admiring it, Talwar continues as she climbs all over him. "You know, in India you have to work on more than one problem at a time. Partly because, at that time, we were very dependent on chemical reagents imported from abroad. You could be held up for months for lack of one chemical." In choosing his second problem, Talwar drew from his visits to the plains of the Ganges. "Even coming from Delhi, I found the people in Benares to be diminutive, to be like those Japanese trees-what are they called?" I supply the name. "Like bonsai. You have all the features there, but somehow they are more stunted. Why were they nutritively so undernourished?" Concluding that the problem was overpopulation, Talwar observed that the available contraceptives required too much motivation.
<P>
Talwar decided to develop a vaccine. His target was human chorionic gonadotropin, or hCG, the hormone that allows an embryo to be implanted in a uterus. Although hCG consists of two subunits, alpha and beta, it was considered safest to stimulate antibodies to just the beta subunit. To induce an immune reaction, Talwar coupled the beta hCG to something the body would recognize as an enemy: the tetanus toxin. The result was a vaccine against pregnancy and tetanus.
<P>
In the early 1970s the WHO decided to fund research on contraceptive vaccines, supporting a similar program headed by Vernon Stevens at Ohio State University. The WHO argued that because parts of beta hCG resembled the beta subunit of the luteinizing hormone (LH), Talwar's vaccine caused antibodies to LH to be developed as well, raising fears of complications. Stevens's vaccine, based on a unique fragment of beta hCG, was deemed safer. "If we were both given funding, it would have been okay, stimulated healthy competition," Talwar says with some bitterness.
<P>
But Talwar did have supporters. The Population Council stepped in, conducting trials in Finland, Chile and the Dominican Republic, and in 1976 the International Development Research Center in Canada started to fund research in India. The longer beta hCG chain used by Talwar, it turned out, was more efficacious in producing antibodies (although it generated enough in only 80 percent of the women). "Surprisingly, LH was not a problem," says Nancy Alexander of the National Institutes of Health. Trials of the WHO vaccine, on the other hand, were suspended in 1994 after several women developed reactions at the injection site; the trials may resume next year with a reformulated vaccine. Still, Talwar's vaccine needs more work: its effects wear off in three months, necessitating repeated injections. 
<P>
Talwar has his critics on this front as well. Autar Singh Paintal, a prominent cardiologist who heads the Society for Scientific Values in New Delhi, charges that in 1974 Talwar injected women with a contraceptive vaccine before trying it out on animals-a claim that Talwar says is absurd. But the WHO's David Griffin also reports that Talwar had apparently vaccinated women without adequate animal studies. Whatever the truth may be, women's organizations have strongly opposed the vaccine. One group, Saheli, advises women to avoid the vaccine, warning that they may be "tested upon." Part of the problem, explains Saroj Pachauri of the Population Council in New Delhi, is the adversarial relationship that the Indian population-control program has traditionally had with the women who are its targets. 
<P>
The vaccine faces other barriers as well. The Population Council has discontinued its trials because of a lack of funds. Although most doctors consider pregnancy to begin when an embryo attaches to the uterus, the U.S. Congress, among others, deems it to begin when the sperm attaches to the egg. By the second definition, Talwar's and Stevens's vaccines are abortifacients and cannot receive American funding. 
<P>
Talwar pours himself a second drink. "I am feeling in a holiday mood," he explains. "I am having a man come over to give me a massage. A luxury that is affordable in India." The caffeine and the alcohol, I note with relief, have both taken effect. Nayana comes in to play again; we take a break, with Talwar showing off his art collection. I venture to ask more about his life.
<P>
Talwar's mother died eight days after he was born-tetanus, he guesses, a major killer of women in childbirth. That realization led him to choose tetanus as the conjugate in his pregnancy vaccine. Brought up in Lahore, Talwar was athletic in college, the captain of his rowing team. Then came the partition: independence from Britain, in 1947, gave bloody birth to two nations, as Hindus and Muslims slaughtered one another. Talwar was in India at the time and suddenly found his home to be in Pakistan. "I did not know where my parents were," he relates. He joined a military convoy put together by the Indians to rescue Hindus in Lahore but, arriving there, found his house stripped, empty.
<P>
Talwar, who is Hindu, mercifully ran into a Muslim poet, Hafeez Jullundary, who risked his own life by hiding Talwar in the secluded women's quarters of his home. Sometimes Talwar, who grew a beard and donned a cap to pass as a Muslim, would venture into the city to persuade the few remaining Hindus to leave. With one father and son, he did not succeed; later he found them shot. "Funny that people who looked very much alike, spoke the same language, had to kill each other," he muses dispassionately. Talwar eventually found his father, safe but broken, in India.
<P>
If it had not been for the partition, Talwar shrugs, he would most likely have been running his father's factory in Lahore. The only thing he misses about his life there, he confesses, is his room full of rowing trophies. For an instant, I have a vision of his office at the NII, an institution that Talwar built from scratch, planting the trees at its periphery even before construction began.
<P>
Talwar has just retired from the NII, to join the International Center for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology. The contraceptive vaccine project remains with the NII: "I have left all the legacy-grants, money, patents, science and a base. If it materializes or not, I have no say." Talwar is concentrating on the neem cream and his anticancer vaccines.
<P>
Yet another controversy surrounding Talwar has to do with TALSUR, his male contraceptive vaccine for animals. Maneka Gandhi, a former minister of environment-perhaps best known as the rebellious daughter-in-law of the late prime minister Indira Gandhi-charges that Talwar's vaccine has killed "a great many" dogs. "He kept saying nothing was wrong with the vaccine, the application was wrong," Gandhi attests. So she had him inject her own pet: "I had to have him operated to save him." But Talwar protests that he does not know of any confirmed deaths.
<P>
Nayana is hungry, and so am I. Talwar graciously invites me to share their light lunch-which he says is one secret of his vitality, along with yoga. Tucking the napkin under Nayana's chin, Talwar tells me of his concern for the many problems Indian women face: he has set up a trust that allows women to resume scientific careers interrupted by marriage. Soon I take my leave, walking out into the hot sun to wake up the taxi driver, who is curled up across the front seat. Turning to wave good-bye to Talwar, I realize that the man remains an enigma.

<P> Naturalists are among the most passionate of scientists.
Their deepest wish is to get close enough to record a species'
most intimate behaviors but not so close as to disturb the
animals. This desire for intimacy is indelibly etched into a
naturalist's soul and is so strong that many spend years in the
wild seeking new scientific understanding of their subjects.
<P>
Sadly, few amateurs can devote years of their lives to
fieldwork. But that doesn't mean enthusiasts cannot make
important contributions. Thousands have already joined the ranks
of urban naturalists, studying species that live quite literally
in their own backyards. A few have even distinguished themselves
by developing new methods to uncover nature's secrets. <P>
To this short list of distinguished amateur naturalists, we can
now add an ophthalmologist from Omaha. Robert Slaughter has
developed an ingenious method for spying on house sparrows. He
combined a birdhouse, a camera and a blind in one unit to get
close-within a foot or so-to a brood of nesting birds. The method
opens up new vistas for investigating animal behavior. <P>
The idea is simple. Slaughter modified a standard birdhouse,
removing the top and extending the sides. He next cut an
observation port in his elevated wooden patio deck and mounted
the birdhouse underneath the deck so he could peer down into the
chamber. (Deckless amateurs take heart-you can adapt this project
with a video camera, as I'll explain later.) An old magician's
trick enables Slaughter to view the birds surreptitiously. The
entire arrangement lets him make detailed observations of nesting
birds, day or night. <P>
The magician's trick requires a black veil thin enough to see
through easily. It is stretched across the open top of the
birdhouse. By lighting the interior of the birdhouse, a
naturalist can see the goings-on inside the nest. In Slaughter's
device, the fabric is mounted on a sliding frame to allow a fresh
section to be moved into place whenever material from exuberant
nest building adheres to the fabric and obstructs the view. <P>
The birds will not sense that they are being watched as long as
the observer remains in darkness. To accomplish that, Slaughter
built a blind (basically, a small tent) that completely enclosed
the observation area.<B> </B>The frame, which was made from
plastic polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipe fittings, can house two
people. He draped the frame with "blackout" cloth purchased from
a neighborhood fabric store and covered the cracks between the
floorboards of the deck with opaque tape. You can also place
aluminum foil over the cracks and seal it in place with duct
tape. <P>
Although the blind technique works well, you may want to consider
less ambitious (and less costly) strategies. A hood similar to
those used to cut down glare on oscilloscope displays should do
nicely; you will also need some additional black cloth to keep
out the light when you are not observing. Alternatively, you can
permanently affix a 35-millimeter, single-lens reflex camera just
above the hole. Amateur ornithologists<B> </B>may then watch the
birds directly through the viewfinder of the camera without
having to conceal themselves. Whatever you do, make sure that
rainwater cannot leak into the nest and, more important, that a
cat or other predator cannot get in. When not observing,
Slaughter protected his subjects by turning a plastic washbasin
upside down over the observation port and securing it with bungee
cord. <P>
The interior lighting is critical. A bulb inside the birdhouse
would overheat it, so Slaughter illuminated the nest from the
outside. He first painted the nest's interior white to minimize
shadows. Then he cut into the back of the box a rectangular slot
one and a half inches wide, three and a half inches long and six
inches above the bottom of the nest chamber.<B> </B>To diffuse
the light and illuminate the nest evenly, Slaughter covered the
slot with a piece of opalescent glass. A thin sheet of white
plastic would serve the same purpose. <P>
Almost any light source is suitable so long as it is
weatherproof. Slaughter used low-voltage yard lights available
from local hardware stores. The brightness of the lights can be
controlled by wiring in a dimmer switch. To reflect more light
into the box, he placed a white board behind the lights. <P>
Slaughter sent me some wonderful photographs taken from his
ornithological observatory. He gets good depth of field using a
flash and a 100-millimeter macro lens with its f-stop set at 32.
The problem was directing<B> </B>enough light from the flash into
the birdhouse. Slaughter removed the flash from his camera and
positioned it over a hole he cut in the side of the birdhouse. He
triggered the flash with a short cable purchased at a camera
store. Slaughter reports that, oddly enough, the flash does not
seem to bother the birds. <P>
Nifty as this setup is, the project could be developed into an
even better scientific tool. Consider, for example, how to
automate the observing process, quantify the activity in the
nest, record the weights of the birds throughout the nesting
season or monitor the temperature of the eggs during incubation.
Any of these additional endeavors would make a great amateur
project. <P>
To get you started, let me suggest a way to record your
observations of the nest continuously. Try replacing the
still-photography camera<B> </B>with a small video camera. It can
continuously record the movements in the birdhouse, and the
signal can be piped directly into your television or
videocassette recorder. That way, you can observe your subjects
comfortably in your own home. It's also a dandy solution for
amateurs who do not have a wooden patio deck: you can mount the
birdhouse wherever your subject roosts. Also, many camcorders can
detect near-infrared light. A bright infrared-light-emitting
diode may be able to illuminate the inside of your birdhouse and
allow clear videos to be shot at night without disturbing the
birds.<B> <P>
</B>It may be possible to quantify the activity inside the nest
using an ultrasonic motion sensor. Such devices can be
cannibalized from old burglar alarms. Position the sensor next to
the camera and point it down toward the birds. If they do not
flee when the sensor is turned on, they probably can't hear the
ultrasound. <P>
The fraction of time the sensor spends in its triggered mode is a
measure of the birds' activity.<B> </B>You'll need to experiment
with both the intensity and sensitivity levels of the sensor. You
will also need a chart recorder or a computer to monitor the
signal. Data recorded 24 hours a day throughout the nesting
season could reveal fascinating tidbits about avian behavior. The
sensor can also alert you when the birds enter or leave the nest
or set off your photographic equipment. <P>
Keep in mind that improving these techniques could allow you to
answer several open scientific mysteries. For instance, a house
sparrow typically lays a clutch of four eggs, one each day for
four days, and so the first egg is usually three days older than
the last. Yet all the eggs hatch within about 24 hours of one
another. Perhaps the nesting bird positions its body to warm new
eggs more efficiently than the older ones, so the warmer eggs
develop faster. Measuring the eggs' temperatures when the birds
leave the nest may answer this question.<B> </B>Let me know what
you discover with this or any other variation.<B> <P> </B>

<P>
Anthropology is the granddaddy of multiculturalism. Long before
anyone even considered putting the word "correct" next to
"politically," stalwart ethnographers were taking notes by
firelight in isolated camps, documenting the fact that there are
many ways to create a life. And it is the beads, baskets and
spears hauled back from points previously unknown that first
demonstrated how every group is sophisticated in its own right,
every society deserves reverence and every culture is in its own
way "correct." <P>
I have found that it is all too easy to lose touch with such
insights. For me, over the years, the feeling of<B> </B>cultural
magic<B> </B>that usually clings to anthropology had been buried
under the daily grind of academic life. But last winter a most
unusual place reminded me why I love my work. I was spending a
few days in Oxford, visiting a former teaching assistant, Nick
Fowler. This trip was for pleasure, not business, but Nick
thought that nonetheless we should honor our anthropological
roots by touring the Pitt Rivers Museum, the oldest anthropology
museum in the world. "Oh great," I muttered. "Just what I need, a
dusty, badly lit collection of bowls, baskets and spears." On the
other hand, it might be amusing. We could laugh at what the world
looked like before deconstruction and semiotics became as
important as vaccinations and see displays in which certain
ethnic groups were still called "Eskimos" and "American Indians."
We decided to go primarily because of the museum's kitsch appeal.
<P>
From its inception, the Pitt Rivers was never intended to be a
standard museum. General Augustus H. Pitt-Rivers (who lived from
1827 to 1900) was originally an avid collector of firearms and
other weaponry but on reading Charles Darwin's <I>On the Origin
of Species</I> began collecting other artifacts instead.
Pitt-Rivers believed that material culture could be arranged on a
progressive evolutionary scale, much as his contemporaries were
organizing animal taxonomy. He wanted to demonstrate, through
objects, that there existed a relation between the simple
technology of aboriginal peoples and the more "advanced"
artifacts of our more recent past. And he felt the keys to
understanding this historical continuum were the everyday objects
used by regular folks. After retiring from the military in 1882,
Pitt-Rivers focused full-time on archaeological pursuits,<B>
</B>overseeing meticulous excavations of prehistoric, as well as
Roman and Saxon sites on his Wiltshire estate. <P>
Pitt-Rivers's ideas fit nicely with the times; in the mid-1800s
British naturalists and explorers<B> </B>were traveling the
globe, collecting all sorts of plants, animals and human doodads.
Through a network of friends and contacts, Pitt-Rivers was able
to amass a huge personal collection of artifacts, and he soon
began lobbying the government for a national anthropological
collection. In 1874 he obtained exhibit space at what is now the
Victoria and Albert Museum in London. The collection continued to
grow and found a permanent home at Oxford in 1884. <P>
So, on a rainy weekday afternoon, Nick and I entered the Oxford
University Museum of Natural History on Parks Road. Dinosaur
fossils collected in Darwin's day sat forlornly, illuminated by
the meager sun filtering through a lattice of Victorian iron
grillwork and antique glass panes.<B> </B>This room recalled an
era of men in pith helmets on expeditions into remote places
where tea was served at 4 P.M., no matter what. I assumed the
Pitt Rivers would be just as nostalgic. <P>
We passed into the forecourt of the Pitt Rivers, which housed a
temporary display of textiles, and headed around the corner into
the main museum. And then we stopped. The glass case in front of
us mirrored our matching expressions: we were dumbstruck. <P>
Ahead stretched a central court, three stories high, and each
floor was stacked to the rafters with more junk than I had ever
seen in my life. We had walked into a wonderland of stuff, a
jumble of human stuff, stuff so strange and fascinating that I
wanted to shout, "Look at this!" and run from case to case like a
three-year-old in a toy store. There were shrunken heads here,
boats there, magic beads over there, cases of cloth and costumes,
drawers of shells, samples of yarn, hundreds of musical
instruments. At every turn we saw piles of junk thrown together
like the world's richest yard sale. I felt a familiar joy rise in
my soul; I felt at home. <P>
This bounty, I realized, is what anthropology is all about. Not
dissertations, not books on cultural theory, not lectures and
slides, but <I>stuff-</I>human culture at its most expressive.
The Pitt Rivers, in all its junky glory, captures the basic
impulse of our species to create-and to solve a problem by
inventing a tool to fix it. Nick and I did not just want to stand
there and ponder the meaning of all this <I>stuff</I>-we wanted
to play with it. <P>
The Pitt Rivers is unlike any other museum for one basic reason:
it is a mess. The museum does not try to impart a full
understanding of another way of life. Instead the artifacts are
grouped by mind-set. A case labeled "Measures of Time" shows how
people from any number of cultures solved the problem of marking
moments; the boats from every sea, river and ocean stacked
together demonstrate how humans from all places and all
generations figured out how to get from place A to place B when
faced with large intervening bodies of water;<B> </B>endless
drawers of amulets and potions bring home the ubiquitous fear of
the unknown. <P>
People, the Pitt Rivers reveals, have common problems but find
local solutions.<B> </B>Visual excess turns out to be a brilliant
curatorial technique for emphasizing the universality of problem
solving and creativity. A paean to global humanity sings from
every case. <P>
The museum owes much of its style to Henry Balfour, a zoologist
by training who was its first curator.<B> </B>Balfour traveled
extensively with his wife, sometimes commissioning pieces for the
museum from artisans along the way.<B> </B>More important,
Balfour (like Pitt-Rivers) insisted on extensive documentation;
each object in the museum is painstakingly labeled-some have
yellowed tags handwritten by Balfour himself. <P>
The Pitt Rivers Museum has a long history of influencing<B>
</B>both budding anthropologists and the direction of British
anthropology. It was at Pitt-Rivers's insistence in 1883 that Sir
Edward B. Tylor was appointed to the university's faculty in the
first full-time position in anthropology in Britain.<B> </B>And
Beatrice Blackwood, a museum employee, was one of the first
female anthropologists to travel to remote places in the 1930s,
living among headhunters in New Guinea and collecting artifacts
for the museum. <P>
Today anthropologists returning from the field continue to donate
objects. These newer artifacts-the African toy trucks made from
flattened oilcans or the miniature clay cars made by native South
Americans and sold to tourists-demonstrate ongoing changes in
material culture. And I discovered that the Pitt Rivers remains
as vital an academic resource today as it was at the turn of the
century. It is closed in the mornings so that teaching and
research can go on without interruption; during our visit, a
class of young artists was busy drawing masks from the
collections. <P>
The museum is also completely unpretentious. Yes, the 40-foot
Haida totem pole with its carved bear, raven and frog faces is
imposing, and it certainly merits the status of "art." But just
as impressive in its own way is the case packed full of hair
combs: combs from Africa and Asia, combs made of shell and of
bone. If these objects were spotlighted and displayed on velvet,
they, too, could surely be called art. Instead they are presented
as practical devices, things that humans make to accomplish a
task. <P>
By casually stuffing the combs together in one glass case, the
museum seems to say that we are a species that just cannot let
well enough alone. We don't just make a tool and be done with it.
No, we have to shrink it, elongate it, paint it or carve it. We
have to add beads, give it spiritual significance and pass it
down through generations. In a sense, human artfulness is
documented more effectively in this cluttered sanctuary than in
museums, where every painting cries for reverence. Here the
creativity that underlies art appears plainly as part<B> </B>of
human nature rather than as a diversion for an elite few. <P>
The collection is also a testimony to common concerns that cut
across ethnic lines. Technology often passes from one group to
another in a process that anthropologists call cultural
diffusion. But when faced with mummies from ancient Egypt and
mummies from rather recent Peru, the viewer is struck by the way
that people in two distinct cultures and times, with absolutely
no contact with one another, were compelled (presumably for
similar emotional reasons) to preserve the things they loved. <P>
As the cases and drawers of the Pitt Rivers Museum suggest,
humans all over the world, and throughout history, have been
motivated independently to make music, smoke weeds, defile their
enemies, keep away evil and gamble, among other activities. The
Pitt Rivers confirms the oneness of our species while presenting
the myriad ways in which different cultures solve the same
problems. When we left the museum several hours later and headed
for the Kings Arms for a pint of beer, Nick and I crowded close
under an umbrella, chatting about why we had become
anthropologists in the first place. As I told Nick, who couldn't
love these strange creatures who make rain gear from walrus
intestines and shrink the heads of their enemies? <P>
I often think about all that clutter in the Pitt Rivers Museum,
especially when I am in a shopping mall staring at all the new
stuff my own culture is trying to make me buy. I wonder about
those shrunken heads, I recall the various hair combs and I
ponder the diverse measures of time. And I silently thank those
fellow anthropologists who still go far away and come back loaded
down with the detritus of other cultures. They are the guardians
of the true purpose of our field-to make multiculturalism come
alive. <P>

<B>Force of Nature: The Life of Linus Pauling
<BR>
</B>BY THOMAS HAGER
<BR>
<B>Simon &AMP Schuster, 1995</B> ($35)
<P>
Thomas Hager first met Linus C. Pauling in 1984 at a
presentation on vitamin C by the then 83-year-old scientist. Both
men arrived early and found themselves alone in the seminar room.
Pauling introduced himself and, wasting no time, proceeded to
deliver an enthusiastic "minilecture on the chemical binding
properties of tin." <P>
Hager's description of this encounter reminded me of my own
meeting with Pauling, only a couple of years before Hager's, at
the University of Oslo. Pauling lectured a packed auditorium
about structural chemistry. He was deriving complicated
expressions without using so much as a scrap of paper, marching
back and forth in front of the long blackboard, which he covered
with formulas. He kept his enthusiastic Norwegian audience in awe
and only gradually did it dawn on me that the sophisticated
derivations were superfluous to an understanding of the subject
matter. During the luncheon after the talk, he stayed fresher and
more alert than any of us. <P>
Hager faced a daunting task in trying to document the energy and
diversity that marked Pauling's long scientific career (spanning
almost 70 years until his death in 1994). To the public, Pauling
is probably best known for his championing of the health benefits
of vitamin C. In scientific circles, however, he is most renowned
as the principal architect of structural chemistry, the
fundamental science of the spatial arrangements of atoms in
molecules and crystals and the interactions that bond
substances.<B> <P>
</B>This work, crowned by<B> </B>his book <I>The Nature of the
Chemical Bond</I> (first published in 1939), earned him the 1954
Nobel Prize for Chemistry. Although Pauling possessed only a tiny
fraction of what we know today about structural chemistry, his
observations have withstood the test of time. His achievements
have also demonstrated that a method of collecting information
and arriving at a discovery may have as lasting an impact on the
development of science as a discovery itself. <P>
Hager, a science journalist, describes Pauling's science well-not
a simple task, considering its breadth. He explains complicated
concepts easily yet correctly and fixes ideas in the reader's
mind with succinct descriptions. For example, the ability of
hydrogen to bond simultaneously to two atoms instead of the usual
one-a structural feature of vital importance to chemistry-becomes
"hydrogen bigamy." Just as Hager uses human terms in explaining
science, he also speaks about the "chemical bond" between Pauling
and a fellow scientist. <P>
The author has exercised much restraint in condensing Pauling's
exceptionally productive and inspiring life into a manageable
book. Those aspects of the scientist's work that are left out of
<I>Force of Nature</I> might suffice as life achievements for
lesser researchers. For example, Pauling and his graduate student
assistant Lawrence O. Brockway (whose name is misspelled in the
book)<B> </B>used gas-phase electron diffraction to determine the
structure of volatile molecules during the early 1930s; they
introduced a technique called Fourier transformation with which
the distances between atoms can be determined directly. This
approach is now applied daily in electron diffraction
laboratories. <P>
Hager also omits Pauling's role in the development of
Corey-Pauling-Koltun (CPK) space-filling models, Tinkertoy-like
objects whose relative sizes and connection points are based on
those of actual atoms and molecules. They facilitate hands-on
testing of proposed molecular structures and are still in
widespread use. They were instrumental in launching the theory of
host-guest chemistry, which earned Donald J. Cram a Nobel Prize
in 1987, and have aided in many a chemist's education. <P>
<I>Force of Nature</I> presents Pauling not only as a great
scientist but also as an exceptional human being. Hager reaches
back to Pauling's ancestors from Germany and Ireland, tracing his
childhood in Oregon and his youthful travels to his happy and
productive decades at the California Institute of Technology.
(Hager also tells the love story of Pauling and Ava Helen Miller.
We learn about their dogged pursuit of their goals; a pursuit
they sometimes engaged in at the expense of their four children.)
<P>
Pauling played a major role in making Caltech a world center of
scientific research. Yet the institute attempted to ease him out
in the 1950s, when his leftist political activism began to
embarrass its mostly conservative administration. His resistance
to the actions of the House Un-American Activities Committee, the
Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Passport Office of the
State Department showed him to be a true champion of the spirit
of American independent thinking. Even so, Pauling eventually
felt compelled to choose between conspicuous political resistance
and research opportunities, so he scaled down his political
activism. There are lessons in this chapter of Pauling's story
that remain important today. <P>
Hager's book gives great emphasis to the other arena of Pauling's
political work: his fight against nuclear weapons testing, for
which he received the 1962 Nobel Peace Prize. In these activities
he appears to have been somewhat one-sided, trying to pressure
the U.S. (and Great Britain) more than the Soviet Union. Pauling
explained that it was more natural for him to criticize his own
country's government than that of the U.S.S.R.; nevertheless, he
apparently was fooled by Soviet propaganda and did not see the
Soviet Union for what it was. <P>
It is ironic, then, that just as Pauling was facing political
problems at home, he was declared a public enemy by the Soviet
chemistry establishment. Some mediocre but influential professors
considered his resonance theory to be ideological heresy and
managed to terrorize the entire Soviet chemistry community into
reviling it. Pauling thought Soviet chemists merely needed more
time to appreciate his theory. In fact, generations of talented
young Russians considered theoretical chemistry hazardous and
continued to shy away from it long after the resonance theory had
become a nonissue. <P>
At times, Hager appears to succumb to the temptation to make his
subject larger than life. Something of this bias may be seen when
Hager details Pauling's unsuccessful attempts to help the son of
a German crystallographer escape Nazi Germany. The relatively
large weight given to this one episode-and the lack of similar
ones-suggests that Pauling's aid to victims of German National
Socialism was limited. This early stance is in pointed contrast
to his work on behalf of<B> </B>Japanese-Americans interned in
the U.S. during World War II and his later dedication to other
causes involving the persecuted and oppressed. <P>
Hager does not flinch, however, from recounting some of Pauling's
personal and professional relationships that became very close,
only to break apart, sometimes ending in lawsuits. Pauling's
attitude toward the mathematician Dorothy Wrinch and her original
(albeit probably erroneous) protein model, for instance, appears
anything but magnanimous. <P>
Another such story, which Hager does not mention, involves
Pauling's unbending hostility toward quasicrystals after their
discovery in 1984 by Dan Shechtman. Quasicrystals are regular but
nonperiodic structures that scientists once considered to be a
physical impossibility; the evidence for their existence
necessitated a change in the very definition <BR>
of what a crystal is. Pauling never did believe in quasicrystals,
and his immense influence may have hindered the broadening of
crystallographic concepts. <P>
Despite the 627 pages of text and more than 50 pages of notes, it
is inevitable that <I>Force of Nature</I> omits chunks of
Pauling's life. Nevertheless, Pauling comes alive on the
page-forceful, creative and unyielding. Hager has produced a book
worthy of its subject. <P>

<B>THE EARTH DWELLERS: ADVENTURES IN THE LAND OF ANTS</B>
<BR>
<I>by Erich Hoyt. Simon &AMP Schuster, 1996 ($24).
<P>
</I>For as long as there have been myrmecologists, ant colonies have served as metaphors for human society. The author follows two giants of the field, Edmund O. Wilson and William Brown, into the Costa Rican rain forest and describes the life cycles of the superorganisms they observe there. Erich Hoyt's anthropomorphisms sometimes recall stylistic excesses of A. S. Byatt's novella <I>Morpho Eugenia,</I>  but the tales he tells are interesting and full of unexpected detail.

<BR>
<I>by Stanton A. Glantz, John Slade, Lisa A. Bero, Peter Hanauer and Deborah E. Barnes. University of California Press, 1996 ($29.95).</I>
<P>
Based on several thousand pages of legal documents that mysteriously found their way from a tobacco-company law firm to the public domain (the originals are on-line at <A HREF="http://www.library.ucsf.edu/tobacco">http://www.library.ucsf.edu/tobacco</A>), <I> The Cigarette Papers</I> chronicles the response of BAT Industries and its American subsidiary, Brown and Williamson, to the growing evidence that their product kills. The authors relate that efforts in the 1950s and 1960s to develop less harmful cigarettes gave way to a multimillion-dollar campaign of obfuscation driven by fear of litigation.

<B>THE WING OF MADNESS: THE LIFE AND WORK OF R. D. LAING</B>
<BR>
<I>by Daniel Burston. Harvard University Press, 1996 ($35).
<P>
</I>R. D. Laing was for a time among the most influential of psychologists, but he is now almost forgotten. His work with schizophrenics helped form the notion of a "therapeutic community" to supersede the near barbaric conditions prevalent in mental institutions during the 1960s and 1970s. Yet Laing's own life was marked by alcoholism, erratic behavior and personal strife. This tentative biography offers at least a measure of insight into Laing's often contradictory life and work.

<B>THE SIMPLE SCIENCE OF FLIGHT: FROM INSECTS TO JUMBO JETS</B>
<BR>
<I>by Henk Tennekes. MIT Press, 1996 ($20).
<P>
</I>Frequent flyers will find a good companion in this paean to the creatures and devices that take to the air. The book begins with casual ruminations on the energy consumed in airplane travel and culminates in a discussion of the Boeing 747, "one of the great engineering wonders of the world." Along the way, Henk Tennekes painlessly carries the reader through some of the fundamental ideas and equations of aerodynamics. He makes persuasive connections between science and everyday life-explaining, for instance, why a 737 has stubby wings or how birds adapt to a wide range of airspeeds.

<B>AIR &AMP SPACE SMITHSONIAN DREAMS OF FLIGHT</B>
<BR>
Creative Multimedia, 1995 (CD-ROM for Windows, $29.99).
<P>
</I>This ambitious disc includes a multimedia encyclopedia of aviation, a collection of aircraft clip art and a flight-simulator program. The result is decidedly mixed. The interface is attractive but cumbersome, the encyclopedia entries interesting but often simplistic. Enthusiasts may enjoy the numerous images and the charming-albeit difficult to install-software that permits stunt flying on the PC. Those seeking a definitive reference, however, should look elsewhere.

<I>by Peretz Lavie. Translated by Anthony Berris. Yale University Press, 1996 ($27.50).</I>
<P>
We spend approximately a third of our lives asleep; Peretz Lavie explores what occurs during those lost hours. The book rocks intriguingly between well-told clinical anecdotes and scientific analysis: the dreaming behavior of Holocaust survivors, the biochemical function of melatonin, and how to handle children who refuse to go to sleep. If only Lavie delved more boldly into the most basic question-<I>Why</I> do we sleep?</TD>

Decades ago a brilliant physiologist showed a crowd of
abiological number crunchers like myself how to model a
generalized animal. Easy: suppress all finer points-limbs, wings,
fur, fins-and consider a simplified, living cylinder,<B>
</B>pierced rather like a bead but doubly, by two passages, one
for the breath of life, the other for food and water. <P>
The reason lies deep in chemistry: the cells of any familiar
animal require a regular double uptake.<B> </B>Each day we
nourish ourselves on close to two pounds of airy oxygen and
another pound, by dry weight, of denser foodstuffs. We routinely
breathe through one compound passage, while we eat and drink
through quite another. Almost every second, we draw a new breath,
although the other foods, no less essential, can enter<B> </B>in
timed batches. Even aquatic vertebrates use two passageways: Who
has not watched tank fish steadily and visibly gulp watery
"breaths"? Their gills extract from the flow the dissolved oxygen
the fish must have, but fish digest what they eat via quite
another elaborate tube, which empties into their wake. <P>
Yet there are certain wondrous exceptions. Twenty years ago the
little submersible <I>Alvin</I> first found them about two miles
down in the darkness of the Galapagos Spreading Center, where new
ocean floor issues as quick-hardening lava, and the seawater
leaks into a field of volcanic fissures. Once the water reaches
the molten magma below, it is superheated and soon rises out of
many ridge vents, which nurture vigorous oases of remarkable
animal life. By now such hydrothermal vents are known to exist on
the seafloor from the Sea of Japan to the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. <P>
Several hundred new species have been found thriving at these
undersea sites. Among the most conspicuous are the giant
red-tipped tube worms.<B> </B>These creatures are leathery white
cylinders, longer than a tall pitcher's arm.<B> </B>They stand
upright in showy clusters, each tube topped by its soft, crimson
gill plume: quite literally, these are "gutless wonders." They
have no guts at all: no jaws, no mouthparts or teeth, no stomach,
no intestinal tract, no anus. <P>
Tube worms breathe water but eat no organic foodstuffs in all the
decades of their fast-growing, if sedentary, adult lives. All the
energy feedstocks<B> </B>they need flow in as seawater streams,
some magma-heated, some cold as iced beer. The seawater provides
life-supporting gases in solution: hydrogen sulfide, carbon
dioxide and the same dissolved oxygen that fish enjoy. <P>
Vent life cannot engage in photosynthesis, for no sunlight at all
reaches those murky depths. Instead a large, odd-looking
blood-rich organ occupies most of the lower part of each tube
worm. Those tissues are crammed with microscopic bacteria
clustered among the tube worm's own cells, all embedded in
innumerable flecks of yellow sulfur, the solid wastes of the
organism's lifetime. (The aerobic zoologist wielding the scalpel
will smell brimstone.) <P>
Whereas green plants use photons from the generous sun, this
symbiotic bacterial plantation exploits chemically stored energy,
the product of inorganic reaction between seawater gases and
plentiful sulfates in the very hot rock below the vent. The
product is the dissolved H<SUB>2</SUB>S, a hydrogenous gas toxic to us. That
fuel is gathered freely by the tube worm from the hot, outpouring
water. The gas circulates past the resident microbes, which split
and oxidize it, using the oxygen in cold seawater. Coupling to
that energy source, the microorganisms can spin as well as any
leaf can the molecule glucose, simplest of sugars, out of water
itself and dissolved CO<SUB>2</SUB>. Thus do the bacterial partners nourish
their big, sheltering host lifelong. The solid sulfur so split
off remains behind as waste in<B> </B>the tube worm's body. <P>
That is most unlike the recycling of the analogous waste, oxygen,
from sun-split H<SUB>2</SUB>O. In our sunnier world, oxygen replaces sulfur
as the waste atom. Thus atmospheric oxygen gas diffuses from
every leaf in support of the animal kingdom. Of course, the
intricate reactions of solar photosynthesis store energy much
more effectively than any simple water-mineral reaction generated
by magma.<B> </B>For each atom of oxygen freed by sunlight, a
cell gains an order of magnitude more useful energy than by
freeing one atom of sulfur. Vent life is elegantly adapted to
exceptional existence in that hot and sulfurous darkness. <P>
But the blood-red plumes of the tube worms bear witness to the
vital importance of oxygen even in their deep-water ecosystem.
Without that critical co-fuel oxygen,<B> </B>the creative
sulfur biochemistry of the tube worm and its bacterial
partners would come to naught even where geothermal heat is
plentiful. <P>
It is natural to imagine that the life of the vents is
independent of the sun. But it is just not so. The luxuriant
sun-fed life on land and sea generates reactive oxygen in the
atmosphere so fast that it recycles through the biosphere in some
10,000 years. Some of it dissolves in the sea. Should the sun
die, the sea, too, would run out of oxygen after a delay of a few
thousand years, and the vent fauna would suffocate in a geologic
instant. <P>
Indeed, anaerobic bacteria that are biochemical virtuosi abound
in such airless environments as soil, marshes and hot springs.
Most of them use organic breakdown products of oxygen-dependent
life; some may use mineral sources alone. But they (and we)
depend on the sun for the whole unfrozen ambiance of surface
life, winds and currents, day and night, the climate itself. The
mobile diversity of the biosphere above the bedrock is a debt
owed the sun. <P>
Is there any life now on Earth that owes no obligation to
sunlight at all? In 1992 an unexpected regime of fully sunless
life was compellingly suggested by Thomas Gold of Cornell
University, based on his own experiences while drilling for
natural gas through five miles of granite in Sweden. Much
microbial life now does appear to dwell in the wetted pores of
deep crustal rock, at least within a couple of miles of the
surface, where temperatures are not too high. <P>
Since Gold's proposal, a number of finds of such rock microbes
have been reported, although neither the full extent nor the
diversity of this newly entered<B> </B>domain of life is known.
Presumably, this subterranean life, too, draws on gases vented
from the geothermal interior to make a living, for example, by
oxidizing abundant iron in the surrounding rock while
transforming it from a rust-red state to a dark one.<B> </B>So
modest a chemical change offers only a hardscrabble living
compared to tapping solar photons, but it can arise without any
exposure to perils from the open sky. <P>
We humans and all surface life owe our energy to the enduring
thermonuclear gift of bright Apollo. The life we are finding in
the warm, rocky strata survives on the much less abundant energy
(chemical) secreted below by the god Pluto since the assembly of
Earth. And the denizens<B> </B>of the vents belong to Poseidon,
ruler of the seas that lie between; they mainly make use of gases
empowered by glowing lava and of oxygen set free by the sunlight
of years past.

<H2>Folies de Grandeur</H2>
<P>
<P>
Sitting here by the Thames at my word-processing machine, I look out on a beautiful Isambard Kingdom Brunel railway bridge, so I'm constantly reminded of the way 19th-century iron and steel technology produced so many machine-assisted <I>folies de grandeur. </I>And as I dredge my mental silt for a start to this column, one comes floating past. A dredger, that is.
<P>
Which brings to mind<B> </B>the Suez Canal, <I>folie de grandeur</I> of them all. Everybody, from the Romans on, had a go at linking the Mediterranean and the Red Sea. Even Napoleon,<B> </B>after he invaded Egypt in 1798, tried (and gave up when his commission of scientists told him the 30-inch difference in water level between the seas made it inadvisable). But in 1869, 25,000 <I>fellahin</I> backed by a consortium of Switzerland, Italy, Spain, Holland and Denmark succeeded. In the last stages of construction, suction dredgers were employed.
<P>
Both the canal and the pneumatic sand removal had been French ideas. The canal itself was masterminded by a think-big entrepreneur named Ferdinand-Marie de Lesseps (who went on to bankruptcy over a similar job, in the Isthmus of Panama). Industrial-scale pneumatics were introduced while the French were digging the first railway tunnel through the Alps under Mont Cenis. This project was intended to unite Italian Savoy (north of the mountains) through Switzerland with the rest of Italy to the south. Also, people coming home from India and the East could then pick up a train somewhere like Brindisi, instead of having to sail all the way around Spain. But before the tunnel was complete, there was a war, and the French got Savoy. Still, it would be good for tourism.
<P>
In 1861, after three years of tedious hand-boring into the Alpine rock face (advancing all of eight inches a day), the chief engineer, Germain Sommeiller, decided to try to finish the job in less than his lifetime. To get through faster, he built a special reservoir, high above the tunnel entrance, to produce a head of water that compressed air for pneumatic drills, which sped things up 20 times.
<P>
The Mont Cenis Tunnel amazed everybody almost as much as the Suez Canal did, and the new wonder drills were showcased in a magazine perused by an American whiz kid, George Westinghouse. In 1869 he turned the pneumatic concept into an air brake for use on trains. Compressed air, in pipes running under the train, held back pistons. In the event of a release of air pressure, the pistons slammed forward, driving brake shoes against wheels. Thus a 103-foot train going 30 miles per hour could be stopped in 500 feet.
<P>
<P>
Such a feat encouraged the idea of scheduling more trains, more closely spaced than had previously been wise, which in turn required better signaling. Which is why, in 1888, Westinghouse fell in with an inventive Croat who wore a new red-and-black tie every week and lived in a hotel room full of pigeons. Name of Nicola Tesla, he figured out how to send electrical power long distances over train tracks to operate railway signals. And then he invented a device so fundamental to the modern world that most of the time you don't know it's there. Tesla sent alternating current into two sets of coils wound on iron, setting up currents that were 90 degrees out of phase with each other. These generated a magnetic field that rotated with each successive burst of current, causing a copper disk to spin. When you put a belt on the disk, you had an electric motor. By World War I, this trick was just what the captains of the newest monster-size battleships were desperate for.
<P>
Desperate, first of all, because metal ships with onboard electrical power made things difficult for a magnetic compass, so you could easily get lost. And second of all, the giant 14-inch guns, capable of firing 850-pound shells nearly 10 miles, were unlikely to do any harm if the ship were rolling so much you couldn't hit an enemy barn door.
<P>
Tesla's little motor helped to solve both these problems because it could spin gyroscopes of different sizes. There were tiny gyros, for true-north pointing (once you spin the gyro, it stays pointing the way you set it spinning, come hell or, more appositely, high water). Then there were humongous, 4,000-ton gyros, spinning in the center of a ship and compensating for the swell of the sea. And, finally, midsize gyros, doing the same favor for all the gun platforms. Now dreadnoughts could live up to their name. In her first wartime encounter, the newly gyrostabilized USS <I>Delaware</I> shot every attacking plane out of the sky. During a storm.
<P>
This use of the gyroscope was the brainchild of Elmer A. Sperry, a Brooklyn electrical component manufacturer, and it made his fortune. Mind you, persuading the navy to buy wasn't all plain sailing. And the financial risks were real high-wire stuff. Which, as it happened, was where Sperry had originally (and only once) failed. Early on, he'd tried to talk P. T. Barnum into featuring a gyrostabilized wheelbarrow in one of his circus trapeze acts.<B>
<P>
</B>The likely reason for Barnum's refusal was that he didn't have much truck with technology, except briefly in the 1840s, when he first set out to be a showman and went looking for curiosities to exhibit. His wish list included "industrious fleas ... fat boys ... rope dancers and ... knitting machines." Besides, by the time Sperry was pitching the gyro idea to him, Barnum was well beyond wheelbarrows (or fleas), touring "The Greatest Show on Earth" with 800 people, 10,000 miles a year by special train.
<P>
From time to time Barnum would give it all up for temperance work, or, from 1851 to 1852, to manage a U.S.-Cuba tour for the greatest soprano in the world, Jenny Lind. In 1844 Lind had given her first performance outside Sweden (in Berlin) and was so extravagantly successful that she became an instant diva at 24. One fan wanted only to touch her shoulder "to see where the wings began"(she was known as the "Swedish Nightingale").<B> </B>In the street she caused scenes that wouldn't be witnessed again until the Beatles. In 1845 Her Majesty's Theater in London commissioned an opera for Lind and asked the other operatic superstar of the day,<B> </B>Giuseppe Verdi, to write it. Two years later Verdi obliged with <I>I masnadieri, </I>starring Lind in the role of Amalia. Boffo.
<P>
This might be why Verdi got the chance, in the late 1860s, to write what became the most popular opera ever: <I>Aida. </I>Running Egypt at the time was a khedive called Ismail Pasha, whose local engineering efforts had cost so much he was severely short of funds and had to sell his shares in a potentially major moneymaker (the project for which <I>Aida</I> was originally commissioned). The opera, being set in Pharaonic Egypt, was supposed to glorify the country's ancient past and cock a snook at Ismail's Turkish overlords. It didn't do much in that direction, however, and perhaps because it took so long to strike a deal Verdi would accept, delivery of the score was two years overdue. Too late for the occasion it was supposed to celebrate: the opening of the Suez Canal.
<P>
And that's my machine-assisted <I>folie de grandeur</I> for this month.

<BR><B>Introduction</B><P>
In 1994 <A HREF="http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/DAMTP/user/hawking/home.html">Stephen W. Hawking</A> and <A HREF="http://www.phys.psu.edu/PENROSE/penrose.html">Roger Penrose</A> gave a series of
public lectures on general relativity at the <A HREF="http://www.newton.cam.ac.uk/">Isaac Newton
Institute</A> for Mathematical Sciences at the <A HREF="http://www.cam.ac.uk/CambUniv/AboutCam/AboutCam.html">University of
Cambridge</A>. From these lectures, published this year by <A HREF="http://aaup.princeton.edu/pupress/">Princeton
University Press</A> as The Nature of Space and Time, Scientific
American has culled excerpts that serve to compare and contrast
the perspectives of the two scientists. Although they share a
common heritage in physics-Penrose served on Hawking's Ph.D.
thesis committee at Cambridge-the lecturers differ in their
vision of quantum mechanics and its impact on the <A HREF="http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/Cyberia/Cosmos/CosmosCompHome.html">evolution of
the universe</A>. In particular, Hawking and Penrose disagree on what
happens to the information stored in a <A HREF="http://www.astro.umd.edu/%7Emiller/astr100/evolution/blackhole.html">black hole</A> and on why the
beginning of the universe differs from the end.<P>
One of Hawking's major discoveries, made in 1973, was that
quantum effects will cause black holes to emit particles. The
black hole will evaporate in the process, so that ultimately
perhaps nothing of the original mass will be left. But during
their formation, black holes swallow a lot of data-the types,
properties and configurations of the particles that fall in.
Although quantum theory requires that such information must be
conserved, what finally happens to it remains a topic of
contentious debate. Hawking and Penrose both believe that when a
black hole radiates, it loses the information it held. But
Hawking insists that the loss is irretrievable, whereas Penrose
argues that the loss is balanced by spontaneous measurements of
quantum states that introduce information back into the
system.<P>
Both scientists agree that a future quantum theory of gravity is
needed to describe nature. But they differ in their view of some
aspects of this theory. Penrose thinks that even though the
fundamental forces of particle physics are symmetric in
time-unchanged if time is reversed-quantum gravity will violate
time symmetry. The time asymmetry will then explain why in the
beginning the universe was so uniform, as evinced by the
<A HREF="http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/html/cbr.html">microwave background radiation</A> left over from the big bang,
whereas the end of the universe must be messy.<P>
Penrose attempts to encapsulate this time asymmetry in his Weyl
curvature hypothesis. Space-time, as Albert Einstein discovered,
is curved by the presence of matter. But space-time can also have
some intrinsic bending, a quantity designated by the Weyl
curvature. <A HREF="http://www.planetary.caltech.edu/%7Eeww/physics/node872.html">Gravitational waves</A> and black holes, for example,
allow space-time to curve even in regions that are empty. In the
early universe the Weyl curvature was probably zero, but in a
dying universe the large number of black holes, Penrose argues,
will give rise to a high Weyl curvature. This property will
distinguish the end of the universe from the beginning.<P>
Hawking agrees that the big bang and the final "big crunch" will
be different, but he does not subscribe to a time asymmetry in
the laws of nature. The underlying reason for the difference, he
thinks, is the way in which the universe's evolution is
programmed. He postulates a kind of democracy, stating that no
point in the universe can be special; therefore, the universe
cannot have a boundary. This no-boundary proposal, Hawking
claims, explains the uniformity in the microwave background
radiation.<P>
The physicists diverge, ultimately, in their interpretation of
quantum mechanics. Hawking believes that all a theory has to do
is provide predictions that agree with data. Penrose thinks that
simply comparing predictions with experiments is not enough to
explain reality. He points out that quantum theory requires wave
functions to be "superposed," a concept that can lead to
absurdities. The scientists thus pick up the threads of the
famous <A HREF="http://orac.sunderland.ac.uk/%7Ehs0bcl/h_nb.htm">debates between Einstein and Niels Bohr</A> on the bizarre
implications of quantum theory.

<B><A NAME="hquantum">Stephen Hawking on quantum black holes</A>:</B><P>
The quantum theory of <A HREF="http://fermi.phys.ualberta.ca/%7Edroz/inside/Inside.html">black holes</A>...seems to lead to a new level
of unpredictability in physics over and above the usual
uncertainty associated with quantum mechanics. This is because
black holes appear to have intrinsic entropy and to lose
information from our region of the universe. I should say that
these claims are controversial: many people working on quantum
gravity, including almost all those who entered it from particle
physics, would instinctively reject the idea that information
about the quantum state of a system could be lost. However, they
have had very little success in showing how information can get
out of a black hole. Eventually I believe they will be forced to
accept my suggestion that it is lost, just as they were forced to
agree that black holes radiate, which went against all their
preconceptions... <P>
The fact that gravity is attractive means that it will tend to
draw the matter in the universe together to form objects like
stars and galaxies. These can support themselves for a time
against further contraction by thermal pressure, in the case of
stars, or by rotation and internal motions, in the case of
galaxies. However, eventually the heat or the angular momentum
will be carried away and the object will begin to shrink. If the
mass is less than about one and a half times that of the Sun, the
contraction can be stopped by the <B><I><A HREF="0796hawkingbox1.html#DEGENERACY">degeneracy pressure</A>
</B></I>of <A HREF="http://www2.ari.net/home/odenwald/qadir/q204.html">electrons</A> or neutrons. The object will settle down to
be a <A HREF="http://www.astro.umd.edu/%7Emiller/astr100/evolution/wdwarf.html">white dwarf</A> or a <A HREF="http://www.astro.umd.edu/%7Emiller/astr100/evolution/neutron.html">neutron star</A>, respectively. However, if the
mass is greater than this limit there is nothing that can hold it
up and stop it continuing to contract. Once it has shrunk to a
certain critical size the gravitational  field at its surface
will be so strong that the <B><I><A HREF="0796hawkingbox1.html#LIGHT">light cones</A> </B></I>will be bent
inward.... You can see that even the outgoing light rays are bent
toward each other and so are converging rather than diverging.
This means that there is a closed trapped surface....<P>
Thus there must be a region of space-time from which it is not
possible to escape to infinity. This region is said to be a black
hole. Its boundary is called the event horizon and is a
<B><I><A HREF="0796hawkingbox1.html#NULL">null surface</A> </B></I>formed by the light rays that just
fail to get away to infinity....  <A HREF="http://cossc.gsfc.nasa.gov/htmltest/rjn_bht.html">Computer animations</A> help clarify some of there peculiar phenomena<P>
[A] large amount of information is lost when a body collapses to
form a black hole. The collapsing body is described by a very
large number of parameters. There are the types of matter and the
<B><I><A HREF="0796hawkingbox1.html#MULTIPOLE">multipole moments</A> </B></I>of the mass distribution. Yet the
black hole that forms is completely independent of the type of
matter and rapidly loses all the multipole moments except the
first two: the monopole moment, which is the mass, and the dipole
moment, which is the angular momentum.<P>
This loss of information didn't really matter in the classical
theory. One could say that all the information about the
collapsing body was still inside the black hole. It would be very
difficult for an observer outside the black hole to determine
what the collapsing body was like. However, in the classical
theory it was still possible in principle. The observer would
never actually lose sight of the collapsing body. Instead it
would appear to slow down and get very dim as it approached the
event horizon. But the observer could still see what it was made
of and how the mass was distributed.<P>
However, quantum theory changed all this. First, the collapsing
body would send out only a limited number of photons before it
crossed the event horizon. They would be quite insufficient to
carry all the information about the collapsing body. This means
that in quantum theory there's no way an outside observer can
measure the state of the collapsed body. One might not think that
this mattered too much, because the information would still be
inside the black hole even if one couldn't measure it from the
outside. But this is where the second effect of quantum theory on
black holes comes in....<P>
[Quantum] theory will cause black holes to radiate and lose mass.
It seems that they will eventually disappear completely, taking
with them the information inside them. I will give arguments that
this information really is lost and doesn't come back in some
form. As I will show, this loss of information would introduce a
new level of uncertainty into physics over and above the usual
uncertainty associated with quantum theory. Unfortunately, unlike
<A HREF="http://theory.uwinnipeg.ca/physics/quant/node7.html">Heisenberg's uncertainty principle</A>, this extra level will be
rather difficult to confirm experimentally in the case of black
holes.<P>
<B><A NAME="rquantum">Roger Penrose on quantum theory and space-time</A>:</B><P>
The great physical theories of the 20th century have been <A HREF="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/%7Ehistory/HistTopics/The_Quantum_age_begins.html">quantum
theory</A>, <A HREF="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/%7Ehistory/HistTopics/Special_relativity.html#46">special relativity</A>, <A HREF="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/%7Ehistory/HistTopics/General_relativity.html#63http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/%7Ehistory/HistTopics/General_relativity.html#63">general relativity</A> and quantum field
theory. These theories are not independent of each other: general
relativity was built on special relativity, and quantum field
theory has special relativity and quantum theory as inputs.<P>
It has been said that quantum field theory is the most accurate
physical theory ever, being accurate to about one part in about
10<SUP>11</SUP>. However, I would like to point out that general relativity
has, in a certain clear sense, now been tested to be correct to
one part in 10<SUP>14</SUP> (and this accuracy has apparently been limited
merely by the accuracy of clocks on Earth). I am speaking of the
<A HREF="http://pscinfo.psc.edu/MetaCenter/MetaScience/Articles/Taylor/Taylor.html#Relativity">Hulse-Taylor binary <B><I>pulsar</A> </B></I>PSR 1913+16, a pair of
neutron stars orbiting each other, one of which is a <A HREF="0796hawkingbox1.html#PULSARS">pulsar</A>.
General relativity predicts that this orbit will slowly decay
(and the period shorten) because energy is lost through the
emission of gravitational waves. This has indeed been observed,
and the entire description of the motion...agrees with general
relativity (which I am taking to include Newtonian theory) to the
remarkable accuracy, noted above, over an accumulated period of
20 years. The discoverers of this system have now rightly been
awarded <A HREF="http://www.lib.lsu.edu/sci/chem/guides/srs118_physics.html">Nobel Prizes</A> for their work. The quantum theorists have
always claimed that because of the accuracy of their theory, it
should be general relativity that is changed to fit their mold,
but I think now that it is quantum field theory that has some
catching up to do.<P>
Although these four theories have been remarkably successful,
they are not without their problems....General relativity
predicts the existence of space-time <B><I><A HREF="0796hawkingbox1.html#SINGULARITIES">singularities</A>.
</B></I>In quantum theory there is the "measurement problem"-I
shall describe this later. It may be taken that the solution to
the various problems of these theories lies in the fact that they
are incomplete on their own. For example, it is anticipated by
many that quantum field theory might "smear" out the
singularities of general relativity in some way....<P>
I should now like to talk about information loss in black holes,
which I claim is relevant to this last issue. I agree with nearly
all that Stephen had to say on this. But while Stephen regards
the information loss due to black holes as an extra uncertainty
in physics, above and beyond the uncertainty from quantum theory,
I regard it as a "complementary" uncertainty.... It is possible
that a little bit of information escapes at the moment of the
black hole evaporation...but this tiny information gain will be
much smaller than the information loss in the collapse (in what I
regard as any reasonable picture of the hole's final
disappearance).<P>
If we enclose the system in a vast box, as a thought experiment,
we can consider the <A HREF="0796hawkingbox1.html#PHASE"><B><I>phase-space</I></B></A> evolution of matter inside
the box. In the region of <B><I>phase space </B></I>corresponding
to situations in which a black hole is present, trajectories of
physical evolution will converge and volumes following these
trajectories will shrink. This is due to the information lost
into the singularity in the black hole. This shrinking is in
direct contradiction to the theorem in classical mechanics,
called <A HREF="http://www.planetary.caltech.edu/%7Eeww/physics/node1209.html">Liouville's Theorem</A>, which says that volumes in phase
space remain constant....Thus a black hole space-time violates
this conservation. However, in my picture, this loss of
phase-space volume is balanced by a process of "spontaneous"
quantum measurement in which information is gained and
phase-space volumes increase. This is why I regard the
uncertainty due to information loss in black holes as being
"complementary" to the uncertainty in quantum theory: one is the
other side of the coin to the other....<P>
[Let] us consider the <B><I><A HREF="0796hawkingbox1.html#SCHROEDINGER">Schroedinger's cat</A> </B></I>thought
experiment. It describes the plight of a cat in a box, where (let
us say) a photon is emitted which encounters a half-silvered
mirror, and the transmitted part of the photon's wave function
encounters a detector which, if it detects the photon,
automatically fires a gun, killing the cat. If it fails to detect
the photon, then the cat is alive and well. (I know Stephen does
not approve of <A HREF="http://pantheon.cis.yale.edu/%7Ezetie/story/schcat">mistreating cats</A>, even in a thought experiment!)
The wave function of the system is a superposition of these two
possibilities....But why does our perception not allow us to
perceive macroscopic superpositions, of states such as these, and
not just the macroscopic alternatives "cat is dead" and "cat is
alive"?... <P>
I am suggesting that something goes wrong with superpositions of
the alternative space-time geometries that would occur when
general relativity begins to become involved. Perhaps a
superposition of two different geometries is unstable and decays
into one of the two alternatives. For example, the geometries
might be the space-times of a live cat, or a dead one. I call
this decay into one <B>or </B>the other alternative objective
reduction, which I like as a name because it has an appropriately
nice acronym (OR). How does the Planck length 10<SUP>-33</SUP> centimeter
relate to this? Nature's criterion for determining when two
geometries are significantly different would depend upon the
<B><I><A HREF="0796hawkingbox1.html#PLANCK">Planck scale</A>, </B></I>and this fixes the timescale in which
the reduction into different alternatives occurs.<P>
<B><A NAME="hquantumcos">Hawking on quantum cosmology</A>:</B><P>
I will end this lecture on a topic on which Roger and I have very
different views-the arrow of time.<B> </B>There is a very clear
distinction between the forward and the backward directions of
time in our region of the universe. One only has to watch a film
being run backward to see the difference. Instead of cups falling
off tables and getting broken, they would mend themselves and
jump back on the table. If only real life were like that.<P>
The local laws that physical fields obey are time symmetric, or
more precisely, <B><I><A HREF="0796hawkingbox1.html#CPT">CPT (charge-parity-time) invariant</A>.
</B></I>Thus, the observed difference between the past and the
future must come from the boundary conditions of the universe.
Let us take it that the universe is spatially closed and that it
expands to a maximum size and collapses again. As Roger has
emphasized, the universe will be very different at the two ends
of this history. At what we call the beginning of the universe,
it seems to have been very smooth and regular. However, when it
collapses again, we expect it to be very disordered and
irregular. Because there are so many more disordered
configurations than ordered ones, this means that the initial
conditions would have had to be chosen incredibly precisely.<P>
It seems, therefore, that there must be different boundary
conditions at the two ends of time. Roger's proposal is that the
<B><I><A HREF="0796hawkingbox1.html#WEYL">Weyl tensor</A> </B></I>should vanish at one end of time but
not the other. The Weyl tensor is that part of the curvature of
space-time that is not locally determined by the matter through
the Einstein equations. It would have been small in the smooth,
ordered early stages but large in the collapsing universe. Thus,
this proposal would distinguish the two ends of time and so might
explain the arrow of time.<P>
I think Roger's proposal is Weyl in more than one sense of the
word.  First, it is not CPT invariant. Roger sees this as a
virtue, but I feel one should hang on to symmetries unless there
are compelling reasons to give them up. Second, if the Weyl
tensor had been exactly zero in the early universe, it would have
been exactly homogeneous and isotropic and would have remained so
for all time. Roger's Weyl hypothesis could not explain the
fluctuations in the background nor the perturbations that give
rise to galaxies and bodies like ourselves.<P>
Despite all this, I think Roger has put his finger on an
important difference between the two ends of time. But the fact
that the Weyl tensor was small at one end should not be imposed
as an ad hoc boundary condition but should be deduced from a more
fundamental principle, the <B><I><A HREF="0796hawkingbox1.html#PROPOSAL">no-boundary proposal</A>....<P>
</B></I>How can the two ends of time be different? Why should
perturbations be small at one end but not the other? The reason
is there are two possible complex solutions of the field
equations<B><I>....</B></I> Obviously, one solution corresponds
to one end of time and the other to the other<B><I>....</B></I>
At one end, the universe was very smooth and the Weyl tensor was
very small. It could not, however, be exactly zero, for that
would have been a violation of the uncertainty principle. Instead
there would have been small fluctuations that later grew into
galaxies and bodies like us. By contrast, the universe would have
been very irregular and chaotic at the other end of time with a
Weyl tensor that was typically large. This would explain the
observed arrow of time and why cups fall off tables and break
rather than mend themselves and jump back on.<P>
<B><A NAME="rquantumcos">Penrose</A> on <A HREF="http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/gr/public/qg_qc.html">quantum cosmology</A>:</B><P>
From what I understand of Stephen's position, I don't think that
our disagreement is very great on this point [<B><I><A HREF="./0796hawkingbox1.html#CURVATURE">the Weyl
curvature hypothesis</A></B></I>].<B><I> </B></I>For an initial
singularity the Weyl curvature is approximately zero.... Stephen
argued that there must be small quantum fluctuations in the
initial state and thus pointed out that the hypothesis that the
initial Weyl curvature is zero at the initial singularity is
classical, and there is certainly some flexibility as to the
precise statement of the hypothesis. Small perturbations are
acceptable from my point of view, certainly in the quantum
regime. We just need something to constrain it very near to
zero<B><I>....</B></I><P>
Maybe the no-boundary proposal of [James B.] Hartle and Hawking
is a good candidate for the structure of the <I>initial
</I>state. However, it seems to me that we need something very
different to cope with the <I>final</I> state. In particular, a
theory that explains the structure of singularities would have to
violate [<A HREF="0796hawkingbox1.html#">CPT and other symmetries</A>] in order that something of the
nature of the Weyl curvature hypothesis can arise. This failure
of time-symmetry might be quite subtle; it would have to be
implicit in the rules of that theory which goes beyond quantum
mechanics.<P>
<B><A NAME="hphysics">Hawking</A> on physics and reality:</B><P>
These lectures have shown very clearly the difference between
Roger and me. He's a Platonist and I'm a positivist. He's worried
that Schroedinger's cat is in a quantum state, where it is half
alive and half dead. He feels that can't correspond to reality.
But that doesn't bother me. I don't demand that a theory
correspond to reality because I don't know what it is. Reality is
not a quality you can test with litmus paper. All I'm concerned
with is that the theory should predict the results of
measurements. Quantum theory does this very
successfully<B><I>....</B></I><P>
Roger feels that<B><I>...</B></I>the collapse of the wave
function introduces CPT violation into physics. He sees such
violations at work in at least two situations: cosmology and
black holes. I agree that we may introduce time asymmetry in the
way we ask questions about observations. But I totally reject the
idea that there is some physical process that corresponds to the
reduction of the wave function or that this has anything to do
with quantum gravity or <A HREF="http://thesis.newsint.co.uk/SPECIAL/abs3.html">consciousness</A>. That sounds like magic to
me, not science.<P>
<B><A NAME="rphysics">Penrose</A> on physics and reality:</B><P>
Quantum mechanics has only been around for 75 years. This is not
very long if one compares it, for example, with Newton's theory
of gravity. Therefore it wouldn't surprise me if quantum
mechanics will have to be modified for very macroscopic
objects.<P>
At the beginning of this debate, Stephen said that he thinks that
he is a <A HREF="http://www.stg.brown.edu/projects/hypertext/landow/victorian/religion/comte.html">positivist</A>, whereas I am a <A HREF="http://www-und.ida.liu.se/%7Ey92bjoch/filosofer/platon.html">Platonist</A>. I am happy with him
being a positivist, but I think that the crucial point here is,
rather, that I am a realist. Also, if one compares this debate
with the famous debate of Bohr and Einstein, some
70 years ago, I should think that Stephen plays the role of <A HREF="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/%7Ehistory/Mathematicians/Bohr_Niels.html">Bohr</A>,
whereas I play <A HREF="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/%7Ehistory/Mathematicians/Einstein.html">Einstein</A>'s role! For Einstein argued that there
should exist something like a real world, not necessarily
represented by a wave function, whereas Bohr stressed that the
wave function doesn't describe a "real" microworld but only
"knowledge" useful for making predictions.<P>
Bohr was perceived to have won the argument. In fact, according
to the <A HREF="http://sorrel.humboldt.edu/%7Erescuers/book/Strobos/BramPais/BramBibli.html">recent biography of Einstein</A> by [Abraham] Pais, Einstein
might as well have gone fishing from 1925 onward. Indeed, it is
true that he didn't make many big advances, even though his
penetrating criticisms were very useful. I believe that the
reason why Einstein didn't continue to make big advances in
quantum theory was that a crucial ingredient was missing from
quantum theory. This missing ingredient was Stephen's discovery,
50 years later, of black hole radiation. It is this information
loss, connected with black hole radiation, which provides the new
twist.<P>

BROWSING is a time-honored tradition at newsstands and in
bookstores and libraries. Proposed changes to copyright law could
regulate electronic browsing and make it illegal unless expressly
permitted. Although it is unlikely that electronic publishers
would utterly prohibit people from leafing through their
publications, the author asserts that even a partial ban would
upset the current balance between the rights of readers and
copyright holders.<P>

<BR>Millions of readers since 1926 have found <A HREF="http://www.clark.net/pub/rinzel/muppooh/">A. A. Milne's stories</A>
of Pooh and Piglet and their friends Eeyore and Tigger
delightfully simple and yet profound. So it is not surprising
that <A HREF="http://www.public.iastate.edu/%7Ejmilne/homepage.html">James Milne</A> (no relation) of Iowa State University thought
that it would be a wonderful idea to put <I><A HREF="http://www.public.iastate.edu/%7Ejmilne/pooh.html">Winnie-the-Pooh</A></I>
on the World Wide Web. A computer attached to the Internet could
take a few files containing linked text and pictures from the
books and make them available to children of all ages around the
world. In April 1995, shortly after he created the Web site,
Milne received a <I>very</I> polite letter (as have other Pooh
fans) from E. P. Dutton, the company that holds the rights to the
text and classic Pooh illustrations, telling him in the nicest
way imaginable to cease and desist. His other choice was to
sequester a substantial part of his life's savings for the coming
legal bills.<P>
About the same time, a <A HREF="http://www.dm.net.lb/gsecret.htm">scandalous new book</A> about the private life
of former French president Francois Mitterand was banned from
distribution in print in France. It turned up anonymously on the
Internet days later. There was little anyone could do to prevent
its rapid digital dissemination.<P>
Some network enthusiasts assert that "information wants to be
free," but an equally vociferous band of digital pioneers contend
that the real future of the global Internet lies in metering
every drop of knowledge and charging for every sip. How will
society's legal and cultural institutions react? Will tomorrow's
readers be able to browse <A HREF="http://gort.ucsd.edu/newjour/">electronic works</A> as easily as they have
been able to peruse books at their favorite bookstore? Will they
be able to borrow from virtual libraries? Authors, publishers,
librarians and top-level government officials are debating these
questions.<P>

Even five years ago few people would have thought of <A HREF="http://www.library.yale.edu/%7Eokerson/copyproj.html">electronic
copyright</A> as an issue for heated national controversy. But today
there are vast sums to be gained-or lost-as a result of the
inevitable legal decisions to be made regarding ownership of
"intellectual property" transmitted via electronic media. By the
early 1990s the core copyright industries of the U.S. (which
include publishing, film and music) accounted for more than $200
billion in business annually, or about 3.6 percent of the gross
domestic product. In 1993, when QVC and Viacom battled for
control of <A HREF="http://www2.paramount.com/homevideo/">Paramount and its archive of classic films</A>, it became
clear that both companies believe the future lies in ownership
of "content." Since 1981 the <A HREF="http://www.docwriter.com/nwu/index.html%0D">National Writers Union</A> has sued
large publishing organizations, including the <A HREF="http://www.nytimes.com/">New York Times
Company</A> and <A HREF="http://www.computerreview.com/mead.htm">Mead Data Central</A>, for allegedly selling unauthorized
digital copies of its members' works. Even universities now think
about how to maximize the return on the intellectual property
they produce, rather than simply assigning full rights to
publishers.<P>
For the most part, the copyright industries create mass-market
products such as trade books, films and related items. (The novel
<I><A HREF="http://www.randomhouse.com/BB/promos/crichton/park.html">Jurassic Park</A></I>, for example, spawned a <A HREF="http://202.14.103.180/special/movie/jurassic.txt">major movie</A>,
videotapes, audiotapes, T-shirts, toy dinosaurs and other
derivatives, all protected by various rights.) Scholarly and
literary publishing-the scientific, critical and artistic record
of human knowledge, culture and experience-accounts for only
about half a percent of the total, or $1 billion a year.
(Publicly funded government information, freely distributed,
plays no important part in that market.)<P>
Most scientists and scholars are far more interested in the
widest possible distribution of their work to their professional
colleagues than in capturing every possible royalty dollar. The
Internet can deliver information more quickly and cheaply than
traditional print formats can, which makes it an appealing
vehicle for publishing. An electronic copy of a document or
program will also usually be identical to the original and
exactly as functional. <P>
Yet such authors are merely passengers on a mass-media ocean
liner, required to abide by the same copyright laws as the makers
of action-figure toys based on Saturday-morning cartoons. And
publishers' exhilaration about new products and markets is offset
by fear that a single sale to a library or an individual could
result in the endless reproduction of a document over the global
Internet, eliminating hopes of further revenue.<P>
Questions about how to apply current copyright law to new formats
and media abound: To what extent are works on the newer-let alone
not yet created-electronic media protected by law? Is cyberspace
a virtual Wild West, where anyone can lay claim to anyone else's
creations by scanning and uploading them or simply copying a few
files? Many works are being created through extensive electronic
communities or collaborations-who owns and benefits from
these? How can we track who owns what, assuming that ownership
makes sense at all? How do we efficiently compensate information
owners when their works can be sold by the word, phrase or even
musical note? What are the liabilities of Internet access
providers, who may be unaware of copyright violation over their
facilities? Should we dispense with copyright as we have known it
entirely and seek new paradigms, as the Office of Technology
Assessment advocated in 1986?<P>
<B><A NAME="Stands">Where the Law Stands</A></B><P>
The roots of copyright are old, and the lines along which it has
grown are complex. One of the earliest copyright disputes, from
sixth-century Ireland, sets the tone: <A HREF="http://www.nepean.uws.edu.au/wsschools/columba/saint.html">St. Columba</A> had copied out
for himself a manuscript of the Latin Psalter, and the owner of
the original, Finnian of Druim Finn, objected. The king ruled:
"As the calf belongs to the cow, so the copy belongs to its
book." A war ensued; the "copyright violator" prevailed and held
on to the book. (The manuscript has had a long history as a good
luck charm for the Columba clan's military adventures and
survives to this day in the library of the <A HREF="http://www.ucd.ie/%7Eclassics/Huxley95.html">Royal Irish Academy</A> in
Dublin.)<P>
The <A HREF="http://www.msoe.edu/gen_st/style/copyrght.html">Statute of Anne</A>, enacted in England in 1710, was the first
national copyright law. It gave authors rights to their work and
limited the duration of those rights; it served as a model for
the first statute governing copyrights in the New World, enacted
in 1790. On both sides of the Atlantic, copyright in its nascent
stages balanced neatly the interests of private property and
public use. Indeed, the constitutional authority for U.S.
copyright is based on its potential to "promote the progress of
science and useful arts."<P>
In successive revisions, Congress has extended the period of
copyright, expanded the types of works that are protected, and
joined in global copyright agreements, such as the <A HREF="http://edie.cprost.sfu.ca/cjc/amb/berne.html%0D">Berne
Convention</A>. Berne signers agree to give copyrighted works from
other countries the same protection they would have if they had
been produced in the home nation.<P>
American publishers have not always been so scrupulous in
observing foreign copyrights. Pirate editions were common during
the 19th and early 20th centuries (when, according to an argument
made by <A HREF="http://medicine.wustl.edu/%7Efrisse/goldsref.htm">Paul Goldstein</A> of Stanford University and others, the
U.S. was a net importer of intellectual property). British
artists then, from Gilbert and Sullivan to J.R.R. Tolkien, were
acutely aware of such trespasses. Today, however, Americans look
at such lax-copyright countries such as China as disapprovingly
as Britain looked westward 100 years ago.<P>
Some observers have argued that cyberspace is a similarly
underdeveloped territory with respect to intellectual
property-many words and images from other media find their way
there, but relatively few cyberworks have crossed in the opposite
direction. That asymmetry is changing rapidly, though: the land
rush of media companies to the Internet in the mid-1990s may
already have put an end to the frontier era. And, of course,
because cyberspace has no physical territory, its citizens are
subject to the laws of whatever jurisdiction they live in.<P>
<B><A NAME="Field">A Tilted Playing Field</A></B><P>
The most recent revision of the U.S. <A HREF="http://vpr.admin.arizona.edu/ott/COPYMENU.HTM">copyright law</A>, made in 1978,
is far more thorough than its predecessors. It protects creative
works in general, including literature, music, drama, pantomime,
choreography, pictorial, graphical and sculptural works, motion
pictures and other audiovisual creations, sound recordings and
architecture. (Patents and trademarks are governed by their own
laws, as are trade secrets.) Copyright explicitly grants the
owners of the expression of an idea the right to prevent anyone
from making copies of it, preparing derivative works,
distributing the work, performing it or displaying it without
permission.<P>
At the same time, the law limits the exclusive rights of owners
in various ways. The most important of these exceptions is <A HREF="http://www.cs.orst.edu/%7Ecook/copyr.html">fair
use</A>, which allows copies to be made without either payment or
permission under certain conditions. Fair use includes copying
for purposes of research, teaching, journalism, criticism, parody
and library activities.<P>
Much of the current debate about electronic copyright stems from
questions about the future of fair use raised by the Lehman
Commission, known more officially as the National Information
Infrastructure Task Force's Working Group on Intellectual
Property Rights, chaired by <A HREF="http://www.nla.gov.au/gii/lehman.html">Bruce A. Lehman</A>, the U.S.
commissioner of <A HREF="http://www.uspto.gov/">patents and trademarks</A>. In mid-1994 the 25-member
group released a <A HREF="http://www.cadsim2.gmu.edu/mon/ElectronicProperty/LehmanRptIntelProperty.html">first draft</A> of its report for comment. Hearings
were held in Washington, D.C., Chicago and Los Angeles, and the
group took comments by post, fax and e-mail. Individual readers
and copyright market participants offered well over 1,000 pages
of opinion. In September 1995 the group released its final
draft-<A HREF="http://www.uspto.gov/web/ipnii/">a white paper</A>-containing a legislative package intended to
update the current Copyright Act.<P>
In general, the information-producing industries have greeted the
white paper's recommendations with relief and acclaim. It
forestalls publishers' and authors' worst-case scenario, which
could have reduced income to the point where there would be no
incentives to produce new works and market them on-line. The
tighter controls over digital reproduction proposed in the white
paper appear to secure the industry's financial well-being in the
on-line environment.<P>
In contrast, library and education groups, on-line services and
private citizens have been mostly negative-and very voluble-in
their responses to the <A HREF="http://www.educom.edu/educom.review/review.95/nov.dec/lehman.html">Lehman proposals</A>. Their nightmare future
is one in which nothing can be looked at, read, used or copied
without permission or payment. Many libraries are already feeling
pinched as costs for information, particularly scientific books
and journals, increase by 10 percent or more annually.<P>
Fees charged for electronic information licenses (which give
libraries or schools permission to use material that they do not
own) are generally even higher than prices for the equivalent
books or periodicals. Thus, the working group's suggestion that
the use of licensing should be greatly expanded has an ominous
ring for librarians in most American institutions. Under the
typical license, such terms as price, permission for users to
download sections of a database, liability and long-term
ownership favor the information provider in significant ways. If
license terms continue to make electronic information more
expensive than its print counterparts, and the digital domain
continues to grow, libraries will eventually be unable to afford
access. At that point, of course, this imbalance will have to
change, because there can be no marketplace without a ready
supply of customers to buy new products.<P>
Furthermore, in the eyes of many citizens and legal scholars, the
Lehman commission's suggested changes upset the balance that the
current law maintains between the rights of copyright owners and
those of users. For example, the commission affirms that any
information alighting in a computer's memory for any length of
time-however fleeting-is "fixed" for purposes of copyright. The
<A HREF="http://www.law.cornell.edu/usc/17/overview.html">Copyright Act</A> governs only ideas "fixed in a tangible medium of
expression, when its embodiment... is sufficiently permanent or
stable to permit it to be perceived, reproduced, or otherwise
communicated for a period of more than transitory duration." This
distinction is crucial. The white paper implies that anyone who
for any reason transfers a sequence of bits representing
copyrighted information between computers without permission of
the copyright owner breaks the law. Indeed, the working group
recommends that the Copyright Act be amended expressly to
recognize that transmissions fall within the exclusive right of
the copyright owner. Even the act of viewing a Web page, which
involves transmitting it from a server to a user's computer,
could be interpreted as illegal without specific prior
authorization.<P>
In addition, the group refuses to extend to electronic copies the
so-called doctrine of first sale. Someone who buys a book or
magazine can sell or give away that copy without paying
additional royalties, but this would not be true in cyberspace.
This apparently illogical recommendation follows the argument
that during an electronic transfer, a work is "fixed" in at least
two computers, even if only for a few milliseconds-and hence is
duplicated rather than being transferred the way that a book
might be. Legitimate ways for a lawful owner of a copy of an
electronic work to sell the copy or to give it to a friend, an
act that is perfectly legal in the world of print-on-paper, are
left unexplored. As a result, in the electronic information
omniverse, the ability even to glance at materials, an act we
take for granted in libraries and bookstores, could vanish.
Browsing works on-line without permission could be considered a
violation of the law. <P>
Universities and other organizations that supply access to the
Internet are particularly concerned by the commission's assertion
that they should be liable for any copyright violations committed
by their users. Such a situation would force them into the role
of unpaid digital police, checking on every piece of data that
students, staff or subscribers read or published.<P>
Although the white paper proposes a future inconsistent with the
grand tradition of public access, one way around these
controversies might be disarmingly simple. The commission
emphasizes technological aspects of "transmission" and
"fixation," but many critics have found those discussions
imperfect precisely on technological grounds. A more thorough
analysis of the range of technological possibilities for
transferring files-including cryptographic methods that
effectively limit the number of permanent copies produced-might
make the Lehman approach more useful than it now seems likely to
be.<P>
<B><A NAME="Balancing">Fair Use-The Balancing Act</A></B><P>
If access to electronic materials without payment for every use
is to be recognized, then fair use is the area in which the
bridges can be built between the rights of copyright owners and
those of information users. At least that is where they have been
built in the medium of the printed word.<P>
Just what fair use means in the electronic environment is
unclear. Other than stating that fair use should continue in the
electronic realm and that the need for it will diminish as
licenses and other automatic accounting techniques become more
widespread, the white paper says little about it. Advocates of
readers' and users' rights find this imprecision particularly
troubling. Although the Lehman commission made a clear statement
in favor of owners' rights, it balked at the chance to clarify
users' rights similarly.<P>
Lehman's office has, however, continued to foster an unofficial
series of meetings, at which between 50 and 70 users, authors,
librarians, lawyers and publishers' representatives meet every
month in Washington, D.C., in an attempt to evolve guidelines for
electronic fair use. This Conference on Fair Use is
affectionately called CONFU, a reference to the CONTU (Commission
on New Technological Uses) group that drafted the guidelines that
have helped to clarify the 1978 copyright revisions. From the
start of CONFU, it quickly became clear that little agreement
would be reached by the time the white paper was due or copyright
legislation would be introduced and debated on Capitol Hill.<P>
What policymakers may not appreciate is that the inability of the
CONFU participants to agree is by no means bad. On the one hand
are fears that without a set of electronic fair use guidelines,
confusion about the law and the likelihood of litigation will
increase-particularly damaging for elementary schools and others
who can least afford the risk. Yet on the other hand are the
advantages of proceeding slowly with legislation. Because there
are not a lot of rules about the new media, publishers,
librarians and scholars are free to conduct electronic
experiments-many of them governed by written agreements between
commercial publishers and educational or library
organizations.<P>
Progress in the creation and distribution of electronic
information is being made nicely, though not rapidly. Commercial
copyright owners seem a long way from suing libraries or
elementary schools. The individual scientist or teacher preparing
a Web page may be in technical violation of one or another
owner's rights but seems similarly immune, at least for now, from
legal action. (If this truce breaks down, of course, the
consequences for electronic distribution of information could be
grim.)<P>
In the view of many participants, the disagreements at CONFU
meetings deserve to be cherished. Many believe the technology is
not mature enough for agreement about fair use guidelines. They
shy away from making legal commitments before they really
understand the implications of what they agree to, and at this
writing it appears that the process of reaching adequate
voluntary electronic fair use agreements will take a long time.<P>
<B><A NAME="Future">Coming to Terms with the Future</A></B><P>
For all the criticism that some aspects of the Lehman
commission's report have generated, there is substantial
consensus on many others. Many recommendations have generated
dissension not so much about their general appropriateness as
about the degree to which they should be codified in law. For
example, few take issue with the notion that malicious tampering
with encryption methods intended to secure copyright should be
illegal. Questions arise only about how draconian the punishment
for such an offense should be and whether investigators should be
able to presume guilt. <P>
Similarly, everyone, except for the small minority who believe
copyright protection has no future on the Internet, agrees that
there is an urgent need to educate citizens about copyright. Now
that everyone with a computer and modem is a publisher, rules
that once applied to only a few companies bind millions of
people.<P>
How society ultimately changes the Copyright Act will largely
determine the nation's information future. The power of new
technologies already transforms the way creators work and how
authors and publishers deliver information. Is it too much to
hope that widely and cheaply accessible public and academic
information will coexist with information sold by publishers at
prices that earn profits and foster the copyright industries? We
do have the potential, if we act wisely and well, to arrange
matters so that most participants in the new technologies will be
winners.<P>

The excellent review in the February issue of delayed intellectual development of children ["Malnutrition, Poverty and Intellectual Development," by J. Larry Brown and Ernesto Pollitt] did not address the uniqueness of this problem in the U.S. This country is the only industrial democracy with a substantial impoverished and undernourished population. Among this group, iron deficiency, growth retardation, lead poisoning or fetal exposure to alcohol can cause a downward shift in intelligence test scores by approximately five points. This result may have little effect on the life of an individual child, but the overall effect can be profound. 
<P>
In impoverished, malnourished communities, classes for mentally gifted children (with IQ scores over 130) may be emptied, whereas classes for children with mild mental retardation (IQ scores under 70) may begin to overflow. Simplistic explanations for this phenomenon-such as the notions put forth in the recent book The Bell Curve-fail to appreciate the complexity of poverty.

<B>MILITARY ADVANTAGE</B>
<P>
<P>
I was pleased when I first saw your February article "The Global Positioning System," by Thomas A. Herring. As developers and operators of GPS, we in the Department of Defense and our partners in industry are justifiably proud of the technology. GPS represents the best of American scientific and technical ingenuity as well as being an excellent example of cooperation between the military and civilian sectors. But after reading the entire article, I was disappointed by its unbalanced discussion of the national security aspects of GPS. 
<P>
Yes, the Defense Department does operate GPS with unpopular security features. But these features were not designed to inconvenience the peaceful users of the system, as Herring implies. Rather they were designed to provide U.S. and allied forces with a crucial military edge. Furthermore, the Defense Department is well aware that the security aspects of GPS are an additional burden for many users. And while we believe such measures are still needed at this time to help preserve our military advantage, we have set a goal of discontinuing regular use of the feature known as Selective Availability, the component that degrades GPS accuracy, within a decade. 
<P>
Both time and resources are needed to replace the advantages Selective Availability provides. In light of the revolutionary contributions of GPS to both military and commercial enterprise, Herring could have portrayed the technology in a more evenhanded manner.

<B>FIGHTING POLIO</B>
<P>
<P>
G ary Stix reports in the article "Keeping Vaccines Cold" [Science and the Citizen, February] that efforts to develop a heat-stable oral polio vaccine have "foundered in a morass of bureaucratic confusion" at the World Health Organization. I disagree. The process of improving a vaccine and developing it for general use is quite complex. While research was proceeding in the lab, progress in the field was more rapid than anticipated. Polio was eradicated in the Americas in 1991, and heat-sensitive monitors on vials reduce the need for new vaccines. 
<P>
Indeed, it remains unclear whether a new vaccine can even be brought to market before polio is eradicated. Simply put, it is apparent to both the WHO and vaccine manufacturers that the efforts required to bring this vaccine to market are not worth the potential benefits.

Capable of solving scientific problems so complex that all previous methods of solution were considered impractical, an electronic robot, known as Eniac-Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer-has been announced by the War Department. It is able to compute 1,000 times faster than the most advanced general-purpose calculating machine, and solves in hours problems which would take years on a mechanical machine. Containing nearly 18,000 vacuum tubes, the 30-ton Eniac occupies a room 30 by 50 feet."

The subject of grafting living tissue has been treated facetiously by the lay press, and at last a novel has been based upon it. Mr. H. G. Wells has based the plot of his recent 'Island of Dr. Moreau' on the artificial production of semi-human beings from animals. Dr. Moreau is a ferocious vivisector, with something of the hypnotist thrown in, and has produced a set of amusing creatures, such as ox-hog-men, and a puma-dog-lady who escapes in an incomplete condition, to the subsequent destruction of her artificer. The story is grewsome and exciting to a high degree. Recent work on transplantation and transfusion, however, is conclusively against the success of operations conducted upon animals of different species. So extreme is the aversion of a body to extrinsic material, that transplantations from other individuals, even of the same species, rarely hold. They are treated as foreign bodies."

"Sixteen thousand railroad employees were killed, and 170,000 crippled, in the seven years from 1888 to 1894. The awful record of the killed and injured seems incredible; few battles in history show so ghastly a fatality. A large percentage of these deaths were caused by the use of imperfect equipment by the railroad companies; twenty years ago it was practically demonstrated that cars could be automatically coupled, and that it was no longer necessary for a railroad employee to imperil his life by stepping between two cars about to be connected. In response to appeals from all over, the United States Congress passed the Safety Appliance Act in March 1893. It has or will cost the railroads $50,000,000 to fully comply with the provisions of the law. Such progress has already been made that the death rate has dropped by 35 per cent."

"The crystalline lens in the eye, like the lens of a camera, causes the image of an object to be inverted upon the retina. Psychologists have yet to explain in detail, however, why we see things right side up, though it is believed that the re-inversion is effected mentally, and is determined and controlled by sensations of touch. It has lately been pointed out that many young children draw things upside down. However, if a child who draws things upside down when drawing on a horizontal table, is asked to draw on a blackboard placed vertically, he will draw everything the right way up."

The mammoth steam-ship Great Britain arrived in New York on Saturday morning, 20 days from Liverpool. Her propellers have been remodelled, but there appears to have been no improvement in her speed.

The notion of using a rapidly inflating cushion to prevent crash
injuries enjoyed a long history before the U.S. Department of
Transportation called for such equipment in automobiles during
the 1980s. Indeed, the first patent on an "inflatable crash
landing device for airplanes" was filed during World War II.<P>
The automotive air bags that evolved in the next two decades
contained many of the features found in their modern
counterparts. Yet these early air bags all remained impractical
and extremely expensive. The chief technical hurdles involved the
storage and release of compressed air. Was there room enough for
a gas canister? Would the gas stay contained at high pressure for
the entire life of the car? And how could it be made to expand
quickly and predictably at a variety of operating
temperatures-and without creating an earsplitting bang?<P>
The answers came in the 1970s with the advent of small
solid-propellant inflators. These devices initiate a chemical
reaction that releases hot nitrogen gas into the bag. This
innovation allowed many vehicles to begin sporting air bags on
the highway during the 1980s.<P>
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration estimates
that air bags prevented about 600 fatalities in 1995 alone. As
the number of air-bag-equipped cars grows, so, too, will the
count of lives saved by this technology. Engineers continue
designing bags that might better protect automobile passengers as
they also explore alternative gas sources that may permit the
devices to become smaller and to be recycled more easily.<P>

<IMG SRC="0696working5.gif" WIDTH="264" HEIGHT="208"><P>
Inflators contain a squib that ignites solid grains of sodium
azide along with an oxidant. These materials burn within the
metal canister, producing solid particles of sodium oxide (which
are trapped by filters) and a sudden pulse of hot nitrogen gas.
Inflators on the passenger's side are typically cylindrical,
whereas those on the driver's side are shaped to fit in the
center of the steering wheel.

In competitions that push the limits of human performance,
victory can hinge on scant centimeters or hundredths of a second.
To get the edge they need, modern Olympians and their coaches
turn to science and technology. A sports scientist for the U.S.
Olympic Committee describes how training programs drawing on
physiology, psychology, aerodynamics and other disciplines are
boosting the performance of athletes in four events: bicycling,
weight lifting, rowing and shooting.

The federally funded research consortium SEMATECH is often
credited with restoring vigor to the U.S. semiconductor industry.
The ability of such cooperative efforts to foster competitive
technology can be severely limited, however, as illustrated by
the noteworthy failure of GCA Corporation. A once successful
manufacturer of microlithography tools, GCA hit hard times during
the 1980s. SEMATECH tried to resuscitate GCA's business but could
not. That experience holds lessons for other public and private
policymakers.

<CENTER><H2>"Peaceful" Nuclear Explosions</H2>China's interest in this technology<BR>may scuttle a test-ban treaty</CENTER><P>
China's northwest territory, which includes the Gobi Desert,
contains almost half of that country's total landmass but only 7
percent of its freshwater. Recently some Chinese engineers
proposed diverting water into this arid area from the mighty
Brahmaputra River, which skirts China's southern border before
dipping into India and Bangladesh. Such a feat would be
"impossible" with conventional methods, engineers stated at a
meeting held last December at the Chinese Academy of Engineering
Physics in Beijing. But they added that "we can certainly
accomplish this project"-with nuclear explosives.<P>
This statement is just one of many lately in which Chinese
technologists and officials have touted the potential of nuclear
blasts for carrying out nonmilitary goals. Now that France has
finally pledged to stop testing, the Chinese interest in
so-called peaceful nuclear explosions (PNEs) is emerging as the
major obstacle to the enactment of a Comprehensive Test Ban
Treaty, which arms-control advocates had anticipated might be
achieved this year.<P>
The U.S. considers China's position on PNEs to be "totally
unacceptable," says Katherine E. Magraw of the U.S. Arms Control
and Disarmament Agency. "Other states would view PNEs as a gaping
loophole" in a test-ban treaty, she maintains, because any
nuclear blast can provide useful information for military
purposes. Of the 38 states engaged in test-ban talks, only China
is seeking a PNE exclusion.<P>
Some diplomats fear that China secretly intends to sabotage the
test ban so that it can upgrade its relatively small, primitive
nuclear arsenal without any constraints. China is thought to
possess some 300 warheads, compared with 10,000 in the U.S. and
12,000 in the former Soviet republics. China has conducted 43
nuclear tests in all, most recently in August 1995, whereas the
U.S. and Russia have detonated 1,030 and 715 devices,
respectively.<P>
One Asian diplomat with close ties to China contends privately
that Beijing is not trying to scuttle the test ban entirely, but
only to delay its enactment long enough for a few more weapons
tests. "When push comes to shove," says the diplomat, the Chinese
will accept a test ban without an allowance for PNEs. But Chinese
officials have denied that they are engaging in negotiating
tactics. "As a populous developing country with insufficient
energy and mineral resources," declared Qian Shaojun, a test-ban
negotiator, in January, "China cannot abandon forever any
promising and potentially useful technology." To alleviate
concerns that China might carry out weapons research under the
guise of PNEs, Wang Xuexian, deputy ambassador to the United
Nations, stated in February that China would be willing to accept
"stringent international monitoring and verification with prior
approval by the treaty organization."<P>
Both the U.S. and the former Soviet Union once supported PNE
programs. From the 1950s through 1973, the U.S. detonated 27
nuclear devices in Nevada, Alaska, New Mexico, Colorado and other
states as part of its Plowshare program; the tests were aimed
primarily at establishing the efficacy of nuclear blasts for the
stimulation of oil and gas production and for excavation. (In the
late 1950s the U.S. considered blasting a new canal through
Central America with PNEs.)<P>
The largest excavation experiment took place in 1962 at the
Department of Energy's Nevada Test Site. The so-called Sedan test
displaced 12 million tons of earth, creating the largest man-made
crater in the world; it also generated a "vast amount of fallout"
that drifted beyond Nevada and over Utah, according to Derek S.
Scammell, a spokesperson for the Nevada Test Site. Explosions in
oil and gas fields did indeed stimulate production, but in some
cases they also made the fuel so radioactive that it could not be
used. The Plowshare program was discontinued in 1973 after the
U.S. decided that the cons of PNEs--including criticism from the
growing environmental movement--far outweighed the benefits.<P>
The Soviet Union pursued a much more vigorous program, notes Milo
D. Nordyke of Lawrence Livermore Laboratory. The Russians
detonated 124 PNEs in all, Nordyke says, for many ends: to move
earth, to stimulate fossil-fuel production, to blow out oil and
gas fires, to create underground cavities for storing fossil
fuels and to dispose of toxic waste. With a technique called
seismic sounding, the Russians also created images of buried
geologic formations by observing how they reflect shock waves
from nuclear explosions. The Russians only reluctantly agreed to
stop their PNE program in 1988 as a result of then president
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's disarmament initiative, Nordyke explains.
But he adds that the engineers involved in the Soviet program
still take pride in their accomplishments.<P>
Indeed, Robert S. Norris of the Natural Resources Defense
Council, a watchdog group, speculates that China's recent
interest in PNEs may have been piqued by "Russian
mischief-makers" who pine for the return of the technology. PNE
experts from the Russian Ministry of Nuclear Energy were active
participants at the meeting in Beijing last December. The
Russians related their experience with PNEs and provided advice
and encouragement to Chinese engineers formulating their own
plans, according to a report by He Zuoxiu, one of the
participants. Those plans included a scheme for deflecting
asteroids away from Earth with nuclear-tipped rockets (an idea
also popular among certain members of the U.S. nuclear weapons
establishment) and the Brahmaputra River project, which would
require blasting a 20-kilometer channel through a mountain range.
The Russians hailed this latter proposal as a "wonderful idea,"
He claimed.<P>
In addition, the Chinese proposed harnessing the energy of
underground thermonuclear explosions for generating electricity.
The explosions would supposedly take place in a subterranean
cavity lined with massive steel tubes, which would conduct steam
to turbines on the surface. "It's possible that this kind of
controllable nuclear electric station will become the main energy
supplier around the world in 30 to 50 years," He wrote.<P>
That scenario is highly unlikely, according to Richard L. Garwin
of the IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center, who participated in
a U.S. study of this power-generation concept in the 1970s. The
investigation, he says, showed that a minimum of two detonations
a day, or more than 700 a year, would be required to keep such a
generator running. The costs of this technology, Garwin says,
would exceed those for conventional nuclear reactors, which are
already hard-pressed to compete economically with hydropower,
fossil fuels and other energy sources. Garwin contends that
nonnuclear methods are also cheaper, more effective and less
damaging to the environment than PNEs for applications such as
excavation and oil-well stimulation.<P>
PNEs are simply not worth the risk that they would pose to
international security, adds Nordyke of Lawrence Livermore. Even
if a nation is prevented by international monitors from
extracting detailed information from a PNE, he explains, simply
knowing the yield of a nuclear device--and that it works--has
military value. In the 1950s, Nordyke recalls, arms-control
experts considered establishing an international organization
that would stockpile devices for PNEs and oversee their use to
ensure that they were not exploited for military advantage. But
this plan was soon abandoned as politically and technically
unworkable.<P>
Michael Krepon of the Henry L. Stimson Center, a think tank in
Washington, D.C., is cautiously hopeful that a Comprehensive Test
Ban Treaty can still be achieved this year, even if China
continues to insist on a loophole for PNEs. The trick, he
observes, will be negotiating a provision that technically allows
PNEs but makes them subject to so many restrictions that they are
unlikely ever to be employed. "I don't believe this is a
treaty-breaker," Krepon says of the Chinese position on PNEs.
"But it sure as hell isn't any help."

<CENTER><H2>Cities of the developing world 
learn to feed themselves</H2></CENTER>
The number of city dwellers in the developing world, a total of
1.5 billion in 1990, will likely triple during the next 30 years.
The great migration from the country has become a factor in many
of the doomsday scenarios put forward by policy analysts and
journalists. In these depictions, the defining image of the 21st
century consists of swarming shantytowns populated by children
with the swollen bellies emblematic of severe malnutrition.<P>
Counterbalancing such dark visions is the growth of informal
economies-barter networks and the Grameen banks that provide
credit to small enterprises in developing countries. Perhaps the
most important item on this list, though, is a flourishing urban
agricultural sector that could achieve a measure of food
self-sufficiency for even the poorest of urbanites.<P>
The potential of cities to feed themselves will be one of the
themes of the second United Nations Conference on Human
Settlements, known as Habitat II, that will meet this month in
Istanbul. In preparation for the meeting, the U.N. Development
Program (UNDP) issued a report earlier this year-<I>Urban
Agriculture: Food, Jobs and Sustainable Cities</I>-that assesses
the role of city farming in both developing nations and the
industrial world.<P>
The document traces the urban approach to cultivation as far back
as the Aztec, Inca and Indus River civilizations. Even a century
ago Parisians farmed the <I>marais, </I>harvesting six salad
crops annually from land that adjoins the Seine River. While
Paris picked its greens, the 19th-century idea of the planned
modern city as a locus of industrial activity had begun to
undermine urban farming in many places. Some contemporary
economists question whether farming is the best use for what they
perceive as scarce urban land. But the challenge of feeding the
flood of migrants to cities of the developing world has begun to
reverse these negative perceptions.<P>
For the urban poor of developing nations, farming is a necessity
because 60 to 90 percent of household income is spent on
nourishment. "Food becomes a form of money," says Jac Smit of the
Urban Agriculture Network, a policy group that wrote the report
for the UNDP. To date, no global census of urban agriculture
exists. But studies of individual countries have shown a marked
upswing. In Dar es Salaam, the capital of Tanzania, 67 percent of
families had become farmers by 1991, a nearly fourfold increase
from 1967.<P>
The impact on food resources can be substantial. China supplies
almost all its vegetables within its metropolises. City farming
can also achieve surprising efficiency. By raising a variety of
crops in a confined area with little water, urban agriculturists
obtain yields for produce that are several times as high per
square meter of cultivated land as those achieved by rural
farmers. At the same time, they deliver fresher produce and avoid
transport and distribution costs.<P>
Urban agriculture is the antonym of the monoculture. In Mexico
City, potatoes grow in stacked tires; cactus cultivated in yards
and on rooftops and patios serves as both food and cash crop. In
Port-au-Prince, Haiti, rooftop compost beds sprout fresh
vegetables. In Peru, guinea pigs are raised in cages that hang on
apartment walls. Farmer cooperatives in Calcutta produce tilapia,
carp, rohu and other fish in treated sewage water, supplying one
fifth of the fish consumed there. Land is often procured under
the legal principle of <I>usufruct, </I>the Latin word meaning
"to use and enjoy." Farmers agree to maintain a tract or a body
of water in exchange for the right to grow food on land they do
not own.<P>
These practices do more than just keep stomachs full. According
to the UNDP report, women in a cooperative in Bogota, Colombia,
that produces several dozen varieties of hydroponic vegetables
earn three times more than their husbands do. Urban farmers also
create a closed system in which organic wastes-from food,
manufacturing or partially treated animal or human feces-are
reused instead of being channeled into dumps, waterways or
treatment plants.<P>
Some case histories glow less brightly. Urban farming must be
carefully managed to avoid contamination of food with pollutants
or raw sewage. Chile and Peru experienced cholera incidents in
1992 from untreated sewage used in irrigation. Salad leaves in
Yaounde, the capital of Cameroon, often contain sump oil or
sewage. Wastes can be treated, though, by exposing them to algae
or to plants such as duckweed, which digest harmful
microorganisms.<P>
If the impact of urban agriculture continues to broaden, the
notion of the garden city-the turn-of-the-century dream of urban
centers lined with trees and ornamental plants-may take on a new
and more pragmatic meaning.

<CENTER><H2>Star-Hopping by the Outhouse</H2></CENTER>
As my headlight-dazzled pupils slowly dilate, I can begin to
distinguish the forms scattered across this grassy slope on Mount
Tamalpais. Tall knolls block most of the orange glow from San
Francisco, so it is quite dark. There seem to be about two dozen
tall, thin objects pointing up at the vast canopy<B> </B>of
stars. Some of the objects, I presume, are members of the
Astronomical Society of the Pacific, assembled to witness Comet
Hyakutake's unexpected visit to our part of the solar system.
The rest are their telescopes.<P>
Al Stern, a jovial member of the society, points me toward the
comet and proceeds to describe, in endearing detail, its
position over each of the past seven nights. Tonight it hangs
like a drop of milk frozen mid-fall from the handle of the Big
Dipper. Hyakutake is just one day from its closest approach to
Earth, and its tail seems to grow by the minute. "I believe it
stretches halfway to Arcturus," Stern says, tracing a line with
his finger to the bright red giant in Booetes.<P>
My cosmic reverie is interrupted by a whiff of-something very
unpleasant. "Someone knocked over the portable john," Stern
explains. "It kind of stinks up here. But the seeing is good," he
adds enthusiastically.<P>
Two other stargazers, Shelley and Art, also don't seem to mind
the fallen latrine. They have set up their scope just downwind of
it. As I get a closer look at the comet, Shelley recalls how she
and Art met at an ASP star party. "We got married on an observing
trip to Yosemite," she says. "The preacher camped out with us
at Glacier Point." Stern is checking out that tail again. "I'm
not sure, but I think it's three quarters as far as Arcturus," he
says. Shelley agrees. Art simply stands and gazes, with an air of
contentment.<B> </B>"Star-hopping by the outhouse," he says,
apropos of nothing in particular.<P>
Down the slope a bit, another observer peers through a
six-foot-long cylinder resting in an odd cradle that Stern calls
a Dobsonian mount: "It's much cheaper and easier to build than
the standard equatorial mount." Two sets of bearings allow the
scope to move in two directions. "The bearings are just toilet
flanges!" Stern points out with great amusement. Local folklore
has it that John Dobson, a former monk, invented the design and
was consequently kicked out of the brotherhood. <P>
Stern hustles me over to another fellow peering through a 10-inch
reflector. When I ask his name, he digs through the pockets of
his coat and produces a penlight, which he proceeds to shine for
several seconds into a cupped palm. At last he douses the light
to reveal a small nameplate with "DENNIS TYE" spelled out in
glow-in-the-dark letters. "It's always so hard to tell who's who
at these things, so I made this in my basement," he deadpans, as
I finally dissolve in laughter.<P>
Tye is one of two amateurs in the club to have run experiments on
the <I>Hubble Space Telescope, </I>through a NASA extension
program. Although the Cassegrain instrument he now uses can't
quite make out the quasars he studied with the <I>Hubble,
</I>Tye boasts that its tracking system has as much processing
power as a Macintosh computer. "I would have liked to get a
12-inch scope," he quips, "but I figured it would cost me another
$11,000-$1,000 more for the telescope and $10,000 for a new car
to carry it."<P>
Indeed, some of the instruments are as tall as their owners and
twice as heavy. Gordon Robinson's seven-inch refractor weighs
330 pounds. But it provides the best view of Hyakutake this
evening, revealing a brilliant green jet shooting from the
nucleus. Robinson, who watched Comet West as a teenager in 1976,
recalls that West's fan-shaped tail was brighter. But Hyakutake
hardly disappoints. "This is just fascinating," he muses. Tye,
remembering the overhyped disappointments of Kohoutek and Halley,
is more emphatic. "On a scale of one to 100," he beams, "those
others were fours or fives. This is an 80."

When a probe from the <I>Galileo </I>spacecraft perished in a
plunge through the crushing Jovian atmosphere last December, it
pulled a few assumptions about the gaseous planet down with it.
The 339-kilogram craft parachuted through Jupiter's thick,
turbulent atmosphere, taking the first samples from an outer
planet. Onboard sensors gathered and transmitted a trove of data
that scientists have been analyzing ever since. Preliminary
results indicate that the great ball of gas that makes up most of
Jupiter's volume has far more helium and carbon, but less water,
than had been thought. The strength of the planet's winds, too,
was surprising: they whip around the planet at up to 200 meters
per second.<P>
Overall, however, data from the probe's 57-minute descent did not
challenge the prevailing hypothesis of the evolution of the solar
system and its largest planet, according to Richard Young of the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration Ames Research
Center. For example, the notion that the sun and Jupiter
coalesced out of the same cloud of space dust is consistent with
the probe's measurements of the percentage of helium in the
Jovian atmosphere. At 24.24 percent by mass, this ratio closely
matches the sun's.<P>
The lack of water in Jupiter's atmosphere tops a list of puzzles
likely to keep scientists busy for a while, says David D.
Morrison, also of NASA. "It's the biggest surprise, among the
unexpected concentrations," he comments. Extrapolating the sun's
makeup, at least one researcher had expected to find a Jovian
oxygen content as high as one one-hundredth of the hydrogen
content. But the actual oxygen concentration measured by the
probe was one fiftieth of that. <P>
Several theories have emerged to explain this finding. It may be
that water concentrations vary with latitude, Young says, citing
the observation that most of Jupiter's lightning occurs at middle
latitudes (such electrical activity tends to occur in water
clouds). The probe, on the other hand, descended near the
planet's equator. <P>
Another working hypothesis, proposed by Tobias C. Owen of the
University of Hawaii, is that during Jupiter's formation, oxygen
was deposited from rock and ice planetesimals, such as comets,
that collided and built up Jupiter's core. This core was later
blanketed by gases such as hydrogen and helium drawn in from the
surrounding primordial dust cloud. This blanketing, in Owen's
theory, tended to confine the water to the planet's core. Later
the hydrogen and helium in the great, gaseous ball surrounding
the core mixed with carbon- and nitrogen-containing gases given
off by the planetoids. This conflation, Owen points out, would
also explain the relative abundance of carbon in Jupiter's
atmosphere. <P>
In comparison with elemental abundances (or the lack thereof),
measurements of the brisk Jovian winds have permitted slightly
more conclusive theories about the planet's meteorology. Before
the probe plunged, scientists wondered whether the thermal energy
that drives the planet's winds resulted mainly from uneven solar
heating of the surface or from Jupiter's hot interior.<P>
For many researchers, the new data offer strong evidence that the
winds are driven mainly from below. While still at relatively
high altitudes, where the pressure was about half an Earth
atmosphere, the probe measured wind speeds of some 150 meters per
second. Down where the pressure equaled several Earth
atmospheres, the wind speed increased to 200 meters per second.
It held more or less constant until the craft stopped sending
readings, 600 kilometers down, where the pressure was about 24
Earth atmospheres.

ARCHAEOLOGY<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Artful Dating</H2>Researchers refine techniques to gauge the age of ancient sites</CENTER><P>
Throughout history, people have sought to leave their mark by
painting on cave walls and scraping designs into rock. Until
recently, pinpointing the age of these efforts has been mostly
speculative. Now, with advances in radiocarbon-dating techniques,
the art of telling the age of rock engravings is becoming a
science.<P>
The use of accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) and improved
carbon-extraction methods have transformed the field. "This is
the first time we can put numbers on a painting or engraving,"
says Alan L. Watchman of the Canadian rock-art dating and
conservation company Data-Roche Watchman. "Now we can date the
art and see how it matches up to archaeological evidence."<P>
Much of the success depends on microorganisms. After humans
scrape into rock, microbes inevitably move in. Eventually these
colonizers are killed by a layer of varnish that is produced by
other microorganisms or inorganic processes. The net effect
traps the microorganisms, a carbon source; scientists can then
isolate and date this carbon. And this date, it is believed, is
when humans chiseled their designs into the rock.<P>
This past year the technique was used on giant figures called
geoglyphs, found on the desert floor of the southwestern U.S. The
geoglyphs, some of which extend for tens of meters, resemble
human stick figures, lizards and dance circles. The new dates are
the first solid evidence to give the geoglyphs some historical
context. "There was absolutely no clue about the chronology of
these things, a total blank," explains Ronald I. Dorn of Arizona
State University. "This was the first effort to date them
systematically."<P>
The target carbon at the geoglyph sites was contained in lichen
trapped under a layer of varnish. The carbon 14 results indicate
that the figures were etched between 1,000 and 3,000 years ago.
Dorn admits, however, that radiodating of entombed carbon is
best at providing only a minimum age for rock art.<P>
"The application involves a lot of complexity and requires
refinement," he says. Interpreting the data can be complicated by
the variability of biological processes involved. For example, it
can take between 80 and 110 years for varnish to start to form.
This time lag could make the carbon 14 dates younger than those
of the geoglyphs. Another challenge is isolating the carbon that
was deposited soon after the creation of the engraving.
Contamination by older carbon from soil or from the weathering
rind-a layer of organic material between the varnish and the
lichen-could push the numbers toward a riper age.<P>
In an attempt to limit error, Dorn pretreated samples with
chemicals to remove contamination. He also selected sites with
the most defined layers of varnish and organic material to
decrease the chance of mixing carbon originating from different
times. Adjacent unscraped rocks served as controls; the radio
dates of their varnishes, which were older than those of the
geoglyphs, confirmed the relative accuracy of the numbers.<P>
Dorn's dates have not upset anyone so far, but some of the new
numbers have not been embraced. Watchman stirred up controversy
last June in the Coa Valley in Portugal when he declared supposed
Paleolithic rock engravings to be modern-that is, created after
A.D. 250. Specialists had previously identified the art as
approximately 20,000 years old, basing their assessment on its
style. <P>
Watchman used radiocarbon to date samples of phytoplankton and
algae embedded in a silica skin covering the rock. His numbers
revealed only 1,700-year-old carbon. Watchman claims the more
modern date is consistent with physical observations of
weathering patterns. But he does admit there is room for doubt:
"We were dealing with very small samples, so the dating at Coa is
at the very limit of radiocarbon dating."<P>
In the future, increasing confidence in dating will depend on the
ability to identify and separate various carbon sources on the
rock art. Watchman is experimenting with a laser he hopes will
help him to achieve that goal. More research on various surfaces
in different climates could also help. "AMS and work on the
chemistry of the materials that are being dated have made
radiocarbon dating a far more powerful tool than it's ever been,"
says Michael B. Collins of the Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory at the University of Texas at Austin.
"Archaeologists are going to be skeptical whenever a new dating
technique comes out, but I believe the work is heading in the
right direction."

A SPECIAL REPORT<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Among the Papers in Kaczynski's Cabin</H2><I>by Anne Eisenberg</I></CENTER><P>
Theodore J. Kaczynski, the man suspected of being the Unabomber, did not keep a list in his Montana cabin, according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. What he did keep were names scribbled on pieces of paper: some were followed by addresses; others had no information beyond the names themselves. One FBI agent told me that Kaczynski packed his handwritten notes into boxes and then stored these in a wooden loft he built. ("Everyone describes that cabin as small," the agent said. "Let me tell you, it's not small when you are sifting through box after box of paper.")<P>
My name, it turned out, was on one of those pieces of paper. My address was there, too, straight down to the zip code. I discovered this a few days ago, when an FBI agent telephoned and informed me, quite calmly, that I should be careful about U.S. Postal Service deliveries. "You don't need to be overly concerned, though," the agent continued in a steady, polite voice as I absorbed the startling news. "We watched Kaczynski for the four weeks before he was taken in, and he didn't mail a thing." I called my office to warn the staff about packages; one of my colleagues floored me by saying, "I'm a bit jealous. I think I might like to have been chosen, too."<P>
I can't say I found Kaczynski's regard enviable; the news chilled me. Over the years, I had occasionally wondered if my writing would draw the Unabomber's gaze, but the knowledge that it may actually have done so was unsettling. I felt like Frodo, the hobbit in <I>Lord of the Rings, </I>just trotting along while from far away Sauron watches with his evil, giant eye.<P>
The details of how I had engaged Kaczynski's attention were of interest to the FBI, and we arranged to meet at the agency's New York City office to try to nail the matter down. "You'll feel safe here," one of the agents said, and indeed I did. I entered the interior offices in a series of elaborate, solemn stages, standing beside a bulletproof delivery hatch and negotiating by telephone with a guard behind double sets of glass doors that were also bulletproof. "Every year we have to increase the security," my escort said as we rose in the elevator. A second agent joined us for the interview. "We're in terrorism," they explained.<P>
Kaczynski had put no date next to my name and address. Apparently this was common; the agents said that many of his notations were undated. They hoped that by interviewing people whom Kaczynski had noted-they stressed again that there was no list, just names, and many names at that-they could find out what had attracted him to us. In building a case, they looked for connections between what he jotted down and when he jotted it, what he was reading and when he was reading it. "We're looking for a pattern," they said.<P>
Our conference took several hours; by the time it was done, the jolt I'd felt at learning of my name among Kaczynski's papers had faded. The fear of bombing recedes quickly when you are trying to recall details of the first book you wrote or of your out-of-town speaking engagements over the past 10 years. Letters received, articles anthologized or syndicated, books published, pieces by others in which I was mentioned-all were extracted from me for cross-checking by computer. The agents were thorough, stopping to question and note the possibilities of a connection. What I could not remember I promised to look up and deliver later through the bulletproof hatch.<P>
It was clear the agents were disappointed with many of the scientists they had interviewed. They found them a trying, arrogant lot. One agent said, "They called all the time. 'Did you get a suspicious package?' we asked. No, no package, but they wanted us to protect them anyway. They thought their accomplishments would make them targets."<P>
P>aul Saffo of the Institute for the Future shares the FBI's lack of sympathy with people who feared the bomber; he calls them "Unawannas"-those whose "inflated sense of self-importance" led them to conclude that they were likely targets. Since the arrest, he says, Unawannas have sought status by hoping their names were noticed by Kaczynski.<P>
I think Kaczynski noticed me by way of his local library, but however I made my way onto his dance card, I did not seek it, nor do I think my status is going to be increased if I become known as the Unabomber suspect's favorite writer. It's true that the Unabomber has many fans, particularly on the Internet (the Usenet news group is alt.fan.unabomber).<P>
But the scientists I know don't share the free-floating appreciation of him shown by his Internet following. On the contrary, they find him repellent. Their interest in him during the search was confined largely to affixing cautionary notes to their computers or office doors-for instance, photocopies of Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers warnings against opening packages with stamps instead of meter strips. They kept an eye on the news not because of the allure of the anonymous figure but because so many of the targets were academics.<P>
When Kaczynski was arrested, people glumly noted the similarities between themselves and him. A computer scientist pointed to the parallels with his usual precision: "We both studied mathematics at Berkeley during the 1960s, we both ride bicycles, we both have a lot of books." But Kaczynski is not admired, and no one finds his attentions status-enhancing; we follow the case because a madman was after us, not out of some appreciation of his counterculture, save-our-planet beliefs.<P>
I never met Kaczynski or knew of his interest in me before the FBI telephoned. But in the blaze of publicity after his arraignment, I recognized where I'd seen him before: in the movies. In Hollywood, scientists star in dramas of destruction. In their quest for power, they bring trouble on us all. If convicted, Kaczynski will be perfect-he'll get top billing in the celluloid pantheon of scientists become monsters, replacing Vincent Price plotting murders in his laboratory or Dr. Strangelove wheeling through the War Room. He will become the apotheosis of the stereotype, the archetype of the scientist run amok.<P>
I don't want him as the governing image of scientists in popular imagination. If I get to pick an embodiment, it will be in the likeness of the numberless people who have extended my leisure time and life expectancy with their intelligent work, people exemplified by Paul Ehrlich or Marie Curie but never by the gaunt face of Theodore J. Kaczynski.<P>

ANTI GRAVITY<BR>
<CENTER><H2>The Lizard Kings</H2></CENTER>
About halfway between Fresno and San Jose, in California's
Merced County, a tiny creature is stuck in an endless cycle, in
which winning guarantees imminent defeat, and losing only
foreshadows a brighter future. The creature is the side-blotched
lizard, <I>Uta stansburiana, </I>for which evolution has designed
a unique chore: three distinct male types are caught in a living
version of the rock-paper-scissors game. In a recent issue of
<I>Nature, </I>Barry Sinervo and Curtis M. Lively of Indiana
University describe this first example of a species in which the
population frequency of males is determined by a cycle involving
three different forms of male.<P>
In the rock-paper-scissors game, paper always covers rock,
scissors always cut paper, and rock always breaks scissors, only
to be covered by paper again, and so on. In the lizard version,
mating is the objective: orange-throated males beat out
blue-throats, blue-throats overpower yellow-striped throats and
yellow-striped throats checkmate orange-throats. These relations
have generated a six-year cycle in which the three distinct
morphs take turns being predominant. <P>
When the temperate blue-throats, which keep harems of three
females and defend small territories, are the most common males,
even small numbers of aggressive oranges can take over. These
lizards are "ultradominant," brimming with testosterone, keeping
harems of up to seven females and defending large territories.
Just one generation later, oranges dominate.<P>
But then a few yellow-stripes can easily infiltrate the orange
camps, passing themselves off as females and secretly copulating.
(A related strategy was featured in the movie <I>Shampoo, </I>in
which Warren Beatty cuckolded husbands by pretending to be a gay
hairdresser and thereby gaining easy access to their wives.)<P>
Another generation later the yellow-stripes have become the most
populous morph. This change at the top, however, reopens the door
for the now sparse blues, who recognize the yellow-throats for
what they are and are aggressive enough to do something about it.
"One reason that the blue males can see through [the yellows'
deception] is that they know all their neighbors very well,
because they have a small territory," Sinervo explains. "Whereas
an orange may have just a whole slew of males that it's up
against. And a whole slew of females to keep track of. It's got
way more information to process." Not to mention the fact that
the blues, with their lower testosterone levels, can probably
think more clearly.<P>
Of course, other cyclical relations exist that define population
frequencies. The lynx-hare association is an example of
predator-prey linkage in which both players shape the other's
numbers. But, Sinervo points out, the lizards "could be the first
example of a species almost like a perpetual-motion machine,
without any other real external inputs." The possibility of <BR>
a monospecific population cycling through a rock-paper-scissors
scenario was predicted by John Maynard Smith in 1982. Eight years
later Sinervo began collecting data on the lizards for general
ecological studies, simply because they are widespread and
abundant. Using number of females per male as a measure of
evolutionary fitness, Sinervo worked up his data in 1995. This
exercise proved irritating-at first. <P>
"Then I looked at the data in the right way, by year," Sinervo
recalls. "We were in my office, and Curt and I just looked at
each other and we said, 'Dude! This is the rock-paper-scissors
game!' We both knew it at the same instant." Whether lizards
enjoy such moments of simultaneous rapture remains a mystery.

NEUROSCIENCE<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Senile Words</H2>Susceptibility to dementia may be apparent at an early age</CENTER><P>
Alzheimer's disease destroys the memory. It kills many older
people. Their brains contain so-called senile plaques. Yet some
senior citizens, passed over by this capricious angel of death,
die at advanced ages with their faculties intact and neural
connections free of the ailment's proteinaceous tangles. The root
cause of the disease is still unknown.<P>
An ongoing study of some 700 retired midwestern nuns, however,
appears to have uncovered an odd correlation between writing
style at an early age and senile dementia decades later. All the
novices who wrote autobiographical essays in very simple
sentences died with symptoms of Alzheimer's (<I>A</I>), but none
of those whose prose style was more complex succumbed to the
disease (<I>B</I>).<P>
(<I>A</I>) <I>"I attended the public school until the fifth grade. I
started St. John's school when I was in the fifth grade. On
September 1, 1925 following graduation, I entered as junior. I
reentered on August 29th, 1927. On account of ill health I was a
novice for two years."</I><P>
</I>(<I>B</I>) <I>"During my junior year I again thought of
entering. My father himself gave me the opportunity to express
this desire, when he asked me what I intended to make of myself.
I told him, 'a Notre Dame.' To my surprise, he said, 'If it's
your vocation go to it.' I went to it, with God's grace, and find
myself, this very day, happily preparing to take Holy
Vows-preparing to be 'a Notre Dame.'"</I><P>
Susan J. Kemper of the University of Kansas, who studied the
biographical essays, notes that measurements of "idea density"
are surprisingly consistent and appear to correspond to some kind
of general cognitive skill. Because all the nuns in the study
belonged to the teaching order of the School Sisters of Notre
Dame, and because many of them were educated in the same schools
and classes, it seems reasonable that their preferred writing
styles would be similar, Kemper explains. (Cohorts with some
subjects brought up to emulate Ernest Hemingway and others
nurtured on Anthony Trollope would show too much variability for
such an effect to be noticeable.)<P>
The nuns who wrote the simplest sentences probably did so, Kemper
argues, because even around age 20, they did not have the
short-term memory skills to juggle all the components of more
complex wordings. She notes that many people tend to write less
densely as they grow older, even while other aspects of their
writing style remain the same.<P>
One long-running hypothesis about Alzheimer's holds that people
show signs of dementia only when brain damage has eroded their
"cognitive reserve"-the smaller the reserve, the earlier the
onset. If this extra brain capacity could somehow be enhanced or
preserved, it might be possible to stave off the worst phases of
Alzheimer's, says David A. Snowdon of the University of Kentucky,
the director of the nun study. Martha Storandt, a psychologist at
Washington University, notes that some of the subjects at whom
she and her colleagues have looked died free of apparent
cognitive impairment, but with at least some visible senile
plaques in their brain. These elderly patients may have been
reaching the end of their cognitive reserve.<P>
Snowdon points out, however, that examinations of the brains of
nuns who have died cast doubt on the cognitive reserve theory:
those who suffered from dementia before death had numerous neural
plaques and tangles characteristic of Alzheimer's; those who died
unimpaired had almost none. If the theory were correct, he
explains, one would expect to see roughly similar numbers of
tangles in both cases.<P>
Although the narrow slice of midwestern population covered by the
study makes it possible for researchers to see effects that would
otherwise be hidden, it also prevents easy generalization. It
appears that early in life something may be measurable that
distinguishes those at high risk for Alzheimer's from those at
low risk, but finding a way to detect it in the general
population will be difficult.<P>
Because the nuns have led remarkably similar lives since their
early twenties-doing essentially the same work, often living in
the same residences and eating the same food-it appears that
whatever factors control susceptibility to Alzheimer's are
probably fixed at an early age, Snowdon says. Recent studies of
people who have tested positive for genes that mark a familial
version of the ailment tell a parallel story: scans indicate
differences in brain metabolism among subjects in their early
fifties, long before any cognitive changes are apparent.<P>
The researchers are currently investigating what is known of
their subjects' prenovitiate life to see if any childhood or
teenage factors seem to be correlated with the disease.

Seven years under construction, the Hall of Vertebrate Origins at
the American Museum of Natural History in New York City opens
this month. The collection completes the tour-replete with
murals, skeletal mounts and multimedia displays-through evolution
and traces the history of vertebrates as they developed true
backbones, jaws and limbs. Specimens include Loch Ness
monster-like plesiosaurs, 40-foot sharks and giant flying
reptiles.<HR><P>
<B><I>Aging Gene</B></I><P>
Scientists in Seattle have characterized the gene responsible for
Werner's syndrome, a rare disorder whose course mimics the aging
process. Early in adulthood, affected individuals develop gray
hair, wrinkles and a number of age-related diseases. Study of
this gene may boost knowledge about aging in general. <HR><P>
<B><I>Heat Shrinker</B></I><P>
Doors, streets, feet-all things swell in the heat. Except
zirconium tungstate. Researchers have found that this solid
actually contracts when warmed. They presume that higher
temperatures make the oxygen atoms in the compound vibrate more,
pulling the other constituent atoms closer together. The
material, which has already received patent approval, should find
an array of commercial uses. <HR><P>
<B><I>Gene Therapy for HIV</B></I><P>
Scientists at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious
Diseases inserted antiviral DNA into CD4+<I>T<B> </B></I>cells
and found that these immune cells fared better in the face of HIV
infection. The group tested three HIV-positive people; in all,
the altered CD4+<I>T<B> </B></I>cells remained healthier longer. <HR><P>
<B><I>Cryptographic Lawsuit</B></I><P>
Engineer Phil Karn of Qualcomm lost another round in his legal
battle to export encoding software on floppy disk. In 1994 Karn
received an export license for the book <I>Applied Cryptography,
</I>by Bruce Schneier, but the State Department deemed that
digital copies of the text threatened national security:
whereas book buyers would have to retype the source code therein,
disk users could merely copy it. Karn's appeal was denied this
March. <HR><P>
<B><I>Herbal X-pos&eacute;</B></I><P>
The Food and Drug Administration now warns that many of the
herbal drugs sold in health food stores and nightclubs can be as
dangerous as their illegal inspirations. Herbal Ecstasy and other
such substances containing ephedra can cause heart attacks,
seizures and psychotic episodes. Also called ma huang, ephedra is
the herbal form of ephedrine, a stimulant found in some
over-the-counter dietary supplements and asthma medications. <HR><P>
<B><I>Looking Glass</B></I><P>
Dutch physicists have found a way to switch the optical character
of certain films. Thin dihydride layers-made from yttrium,
lanthanum and other rare elements-reflect mirror images. Once
exposed to hydrogen, though, the same films become transparent
trihydrides. The process, which is fully reversible at room
temperature, may well find applications in architecture,
communications and photography. <HR><P>
<B><I>Gnat Lag</B></I><P>
Four teams of researchers have unraveled how light winds a fruit
fly's biological clock. The rising sun switches on two genes,
period (<I>per</I>) and timeless (<I>tim</I>). Their messenger
RNA accumulates during the day. At dusk, proteins PER and TIM
bind together and somehow stop transcription.<B> </B>The mRNA and
protein levels then fall through the night until morning, when
the cycle starts again. The mechanism may offer clues into sleep
and mood disorders, as well as jet lag.<HR><P>
<B><I>Comet Caper</B></I><P>
When Comet Hyakutake neared Earth this past March,
astrophysicists could at last confirm that comets shine in
x-rays. For 24 hours, Germany's orbiting <I>ROSAT </I>satellite
tracked Hyakutake's fluctuating emissions. On occasion, the
radiation became some 100 times brighter than predicted. One
theory posits that water molecules around the comet's core absorb
solar x-rays and later reemit them. Another credits collisions
between the comet's components and those streaming away from the
sun. <HR><P>
<B><I>Apoptosis in Plants</B></I><P>
New research shows that plant cells, like animal cells, undergo
apoptosis-a series of changes causing damaged cells to
self-destruct. Scientists observed stages of the process after
exposing plants to fungal toxins. The find suggests that
bacteria, viruses and fungi may promote disease in plants by
triggering programmed cell death. Understanding the mechanism
could lead to hardier crops.<HR><P>
<B>FOLLOW-UP</B><P>
<B><I>Manatee Mystery</B></I><P>
Marine biologists are puzzled by the sudden death of some 128
manatees in Florida. Last year 201 of the gentle sea cows
died-most fell victim to boats speeding through shallow waters
where the animals swim. These new deaths, however, seem related
to an unknown natural cause. Some suspect that a nearby red tide,
caused by toxic microorganisms, may explain the situation. But
the manatees show none of the ordinary symptoms. (See July 1994,
page 66.) <HR><P>
<B><I>Hantavirus</B></I><P>
New data show that hantavirus infections have become more
prevalent since 1993, when an outbreak struck a Navajo
reservation in New Mexico. The figures tally 131 cases
nationwide; most have taken place in western states. The
virus-spread by several types of rodent-typically infects only
isolated individuals in an area. Virologists do not yet know why
certain people are more susceptible than others. (See December
1994, page 34.)<P>

Born into a sea of sound and light, humans develop sophisticated
organs to sense and process the waves. Technology has extended
the range of our perception, allowing us to discern oscillations
as slow as Earth's seismic shudders and as rapid as the x-ray
wail of hot gas spinning into a black hole. But like the eyes and
ears of the humans who built them, imaging instruments are
generally blind to one of the three forms in which waves
transport information. We sense a wave's amplitude as brightness
or loudness, its frequency as color or pitch. Yet its phase-the
position of the waves' crests and troughs in space-falls on deaf
ears. <P>
An innovative medical imaging system unveiled in April
demonstrates how much we have been missing. By translating the
phase information in ultrasound echoes into a form humans can
see, the machine gives physicians a significantly clearer window
into the inner workings of their patients.<P>
Doctors have been using ultrasonic imaging systems to peer within
the body for more than two decades, but it was not until
all-electronic machines were introduced in the early 1980s that
the technology found widespread use. Since then, all such systems
have worked similarly: extremely high pitched sound pulses-at
about 250 times the frequency of the highest squeal that human
ears can apprehend-are produced by a handheld wand pressed
against the patient. As the pulses travel through the body, faint
echoes return from spots where the tissue changes in density or
stiffness. The wand then picks up the reflected sound and sends
the signal to a computer, where it is amplified and processed
into a black-and-white image.<P>
Denser surfaces, such as bone, return louder echoes and thus
appear brighter than squishier bits, like kidneys. Quickly moving
cells, such as blood, change the pitch of the sound they reflect
through a phenomenon known as the Doppler effect. Most systems
can detect this shift and display blood flows in bright
colors.<P>
Converting sonic reflections to visual patterns remains an
inexact science, however, complicated by echoes arriving from
many different directions and depths at once. To sort out which
pulses are returning from where, ultrasound machines try to focus
on a slice within the body and scan it one line at a time. But
there are trade-offs. Higher-frequency sound returns crisper
echoes but does not penetrate as far. Boosting the number of scan
lines also increases clarity. But doctors often use ultrasound to
look for unusual movement as well as suspicious shapes-a leaking
heart valve, for example, or inadequate circulation in an organ.
In order to update the image several times a second, the number
of lines must be reduced.<P>
The result is often a fuzzy-and sometimes inconclusive-picture.
To make accurate diagnoses, physicians have to learn how to read
the missing information between the lines. In many cases, they
send patients on to get clearer, but considerably more expensive,
scans using computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI).<P>
Imaging specialists have long known that half the information
returned by an ultrasound echo is coded in its phase, which
reflects changes in the stiffness of tissue where the echo
originated. Theoretically, that information could be used to
produce more distinct images. But because a wave's phase is
altered by its journey through the body, no one could figure out
how to incorporate phase data in a way meaningful to human
eyes.<P>
In 1987 engineers at Acuson, an ultrasound equipment manufacturer
in Mountain View, Calif., began work on a solution. The system
they developed sends sonic pulses into the body one at a time, as
usual; its innovation is on the receiving end. The machine can
record the strength and phase of up to four separate echoes,
reflected from a row of four closely adjacent spots as each pulse
bounces off a cross section of tissue. Because the echoes come
from the same initial pulse and follow essentially the same path
back to the receiver, the slight differences in their phase are
caused only by tissue variations at the spots where they were
created.<P>
The four echoes are passed to a device called an imageformer. If
one imagines the echo pulses as parallel rays of light, then the
imageformer acts like an adjustable lens. It can focus the rays
into an image of any of the four spots in the body. But it can
also focus them to reproduce an image of any point <I>between
</I>the spots, thanks to the extra phase information that the
echoes carry. Because the system is computerized, it can refocus
the same set of echoes over and over to form a nearly continuous
band of varying brightness. As successive groups of pulses
arrive, the imageformer stacks the bands into image cells and
finally converts them into a picture.<P>
After seven years and more than $200 million in research and
development, the new system, dubbed Sequoia, is ready for market.
For Acuson, a leader in its market that has nonetheless seen the
demand for ultrasound equipment fall by 30 percent and has had to
cut its prices by up to 50 percent over the past two years, the
future rides on Sequoia. Will hospitals and clinics pay a 40
percent premium-raising the price to about $200,000-for this new
technology?<P>
Radiologists who have evaluated Sequoia say they might. These
doctors are optimistic that the noticeably clearer images may
make ultrasound a more reliable diagnostic method for a number of
conditions.<P>
"It gives us a tremendous window on the fetal heart, for
example," says Donald S. Emerson of the University of Tennessee
at Memphis. Recently Emerson examined an expectant mother whose
fetus suffered from a rare heart condition. Blood vessels
connected one chamber in the fetus's heart to the coronary
arteries that feed the heart, resulting in a backwash of blood
flooding the arteries. Using a state-of-the-art ultrasound
machine, doctors had to sit and stare for a long time in order to
make a diagnosis, Emerson says. "With shrinking reimbursements
reducing the time physicians can spend on patients, many labs
might have missed it. But when we examined this patient with
Sequoia," he recalls, "those vessels just jumped out." No doctor
could have failed to notice the aberrant blood flow, he says.<P>
Acuson has demonstrated that Sequoia can reveal an impressive
list of structures that have been difficult, if not impossible,
to see with ultrasound. Blood flow through the coronary arteries
stands out clearly on Sequoia's monitor-important because if this
flow is blocked it frequently indicates heart disease.
Circulation through the brain, kidneys and heart of a tiny fetus
is now visible perhaps a month or two earlier than before.<P>
Early adopters, such as the Mayo Clinic, which has ordered eight
Sequoia machines, will test Acuson's assertion that the new
device can justify its higher cost by reducing the need for more
expensive tests. "All we have now," Emerson says, "is tantalizing
but preliminary experience that tells us we are seeing more
anatomy." He chuckles. "But I was sure disappointed when the
evaluation ended, and they took it out of our lab."<P>

NEUROSCIENCE<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Mind Readings</H2>Researchers can now predict what a monkey will draw- before it even moves</CENTER><P>
In a laboratory outside San Diego, a rhesus monkey sits and peers
through a periscopelike arrangement of mirrors into a
computer-generated virtual reality. If monkeys have a sense of
wonder, this one must have been in awe at first seeing an
elliptical tube float before its eyes. But now the animal has
mastered this game. The monkey reaches for the object. When it
does, infrared diodes strapped on its arm convey its movement to
the computer, which then moves a spherical cursor in the virtual
world. As one segment of the tube lights up and spins around the
ellipse, the rhesus must follow it, tracing ovals in the air.
After months of practicing four hours a day, five days a week,
the monkey has this down. Every time it completes five orbits,
the creature wins a drink of water.<P>
As the rhesus plays, Andrew B. Schwartz, a senior fellow at the
Neurosciences Institute, sits in front of a floor-to-ceiling rack
of equipment recording the animal's thoughts-or rather electrical
traces of them. His instruments are connected by a wire far
thinner than a human hair to a single brain cell lying just below
the surface of the animal's primary motor cortex. No electricity
goes into the subject's skull. But the moment the monkey decides
to move its arm, this neuron starts firing, sending pulses out to
the computer, which registers how rapidly they arrive. From the
pattern of signals produced by fewer than 100 brain cells sampled
as the rhesus repeats its task, Schwartz has all the data he
needs to predict where the monkey's arm is going a good tenth of
a second before the animal moves a muscle.<P>
Neuroscientists discovered a decade ago that the rate at which a
neuron fires in the motor cortex determines the direction the
associated muscle will tend to move. Averaging the directions
sent by a bunch of brain cells within the region, researchers
found that they could predict with uncanny accuracy which way a
monkey was going to move its arm-so long as the movement was a
straight line. Working with colleagues at Arizona State
University, Schwartz has improved the technique to reproduce the
spirals and other complex curves the subject draws in
three-dimensional space.<P>
The advance is important, explains Gary T. Yamaguchi of Arizona
State, "because our long-term goal is to try to figure out how to
use these neural signals to move a prosthetic limb in a natural
way." Schwartz suggests that within a decade or so it should be
possible to fit amputees with thought-controlled robotic arms
that move naturally.<P>
"One of the big problems with building devices that replace human
function is that they often fail or make the wearer feel
conspicuous and then get thrown in the closet," Yamaguchi says.
But building a bionic arm involves more than just decoding the
path a person intends his or her arm to follow.<P>
"The problem is that there are an essentially infinite number of
joint positions and movements you can use to move your hand from
point A to point B," Yamaguchi explains. "Fortunately, humans and
lower primates almost always make common movements in just one
way." At a conference in February, Yamaguchi reported that his
group has developed a mathematical model that, given a
trajectory, can accurately predict just how a human would move
six of the seven major joints in the arm.<P>
Schwartz found that the key to translating motor cortex signals
is to associate neuron firing rates with velocity as well as
direction. He improved the accuracy of his decoder further by
accounting for what he calls "a time-warping phenomenon" in the
brain. When humans and other primates draw straight lines, the
lag between brain signal and muscle movement is tiny, just a few
hundredths of a second. Curves are harder, however. So the
tighter the curve, the slower we draw it, and the further our
brains have to race ahead of our hands.<P>
That process complicates movement prediction, however. "If at one
moment the lag from neuron firing to movement is 200 milliseconds
and then a moment later the lags drops near zero, the two signals
might cross, making the movements occur out of order," Schwartz
says. "In reality, the change from moment to moment is never so
radical that signals actually cross, but you can see how
predictions get really messed up unless we take time warping into
account."<P>
Although Schwartz's current technique works well on tasks that
monkeys have been trained to perform, he has yet to test it when
the animals are drawing patterns they have never seen before. His
colleagues have constructed an artificial neural net that
reorganizes itself to extract as much information as possible
from the cortex signals. It should predict new patterns with more
accuracy.<P>
The technology still offers more questions than answers.
Deciphering the brain signals that produce finer motions like
grasping may be much trickier than predicting arm movement. And
no one knows whether it will work in humans as well as it does in
lower primates.<P>
Schwartz intends to find out. This summer, he says, his group
will start testing two new devices. A larger probe will sense the
firing rates of many cortex cells simultaneously, producing
real-time predictions such as those generated by muscle and
brain-wave monitors. And an early prototype of a wireless probe
will radio its host's intentions to an external processor. If the
device is successful, the researchers will try to shrink and
implant it within an animal's skull.

ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Good Wood</H2>Can timber certification save the rain forest?</CENTER><P>
During the 1980s, concern about Earth's dwindling rain forests
and the loss of biodiversity caused some environmentalists to
call for boycotts of tropical woods. One organization decided not
to threaten the timber industry with a stick but to wield a
carrot instead: it would offer formal approval to logging
operations that could meet certain standards. So began the
Rainforest Alliance's Smart Wood Program in 1990, the first of
several ongoing efforts to grant official recognition to
environmentally sustainable and socially responsible timber
production. Such certification, a market-driven approach to
conservation, is gaining momentum worldwide, with more than a
dozen sources now approved and big retailers such as Home Depot
and IKEA seeking to offer consumers "green" wood products.<P>
Yet the challenges to this strategy remain daunting, particularly
for the besieged forests of the tropics. One problem is that
certification is not likely to catch on in developing countries
any time soon, because the vast majority of timber operations in
the U.S. and Europe lack any such credentials. "For this scheme
to be credible, it needs to function globally," notes Justin
Stead, who coordinates a group of companies that allied with the
World Wide Fund for Nature in the U.K. to support certification.
Hence, it is understandable that the Rainforest Alliance has
certified nearly as many operations in the U.S. (four) as in
tropical countries (six), even though the temperate forests of
the Northern Hemisphere are roughly stable in area.<P>
"Stable" does not describe undeveloped tropical lands, where an
area the size of Florida is denuded every year. But logging
contributes only modestly to this deforestation: according to a
United Nations study, nine out of 10 tropical trees are felled
for agriculture or cattle ranching. Most trees cut for their wood
are used locally for fuel; only 14 percent are taken for timber,
and less than a third of that material ever enters international
markets. So it is unclear whether consumers in developed
countries could slow tropical deforestation even if they demanded
that all their wood purchases be certified.<P>
Richard E. Rice of Conservation International argues that many
environmental interest groups are too focused on timber
certification, which could prove to be too little, too late. He
is convinced that the economic pressures threatening the forests
of developing countries are impossible to counter with
enlightened consumerism alone. And he is concerned that other
opportunities are being overlooked.<P>
Rice suggests, for example, that a more effective strategy might
be to convince the governments of tropical nations to tax timber
producers according to the extent of their holdings rather than
by the amount or type of wood extracted. That simple change would
provide an economic incentive for the timber companies to place
many of their economically marginal lands off-limits to logging.
He also says certifiers have overemphasized "sustainability," an
often vague term that can be defined in this context as managing
the harvesting and replanting of trees so that the amount of any
given species removed equals what regenerates. Rice objects
because that seemingly virtuous principle can be at odds with
preservation.<P>
These complexities are well demonstrated by the conundrum of
mahogany. Laura K. Snook of Duke University notes that true
mahogany grows naturally only in tropical regions of the new
world-such as the forests of Mexico's Yucatan peninsula. The
logging operations she studied there, a cooperative enterprise
called Plan Piloto Forestal, have been certified by Scientific
Certification Systems in Oakland, Calif., and are deemed "well
managed" by the Rainforest Alliance.<P>
The certification criteria applied to the Mexican loggers are
fundamentally no different from those demanded of other such
operations. Approval hinged on satisfying three imperatives: the
timber must be harvested sustainably; the health of the ecosystem
must be maintained; and the social and economic needs of the
community must be respected. Although each organization offering
certification defines its requirements differently, most groups
have moved toward setting a common framework for certification,
established by an umbrella body called the Forest Stewardship
Council.<P>
Certification has, however, highlighted certain difficulties for
the Plan Piloto. The problem is ecological, Snook explains. The
density of mahogany is quite low (typically about one tree per
hectare), and mahogany seedlings cannot survive in the shade of
other trees. If new mahogany does not grow, sustainability is
impossible to achieve. In the past, mahogany regenerated in
clearings where trees had been destroyed by fire, blown over by
hurricanes or felled by Mayan farmers. Now the only way to
harvest this wood sustainably is to remove many other trees that
are of little or no economic value.<P>
Although it seems counterintuitive, Debbie Hammel of Scientific
Certification Systems asserts that "the removal of more trees is
not necessarily a negative thing." The premise is that by taking
out additional trees and selling them, the loggers of Plan Piloto
might be able to profit indefinitely from the forests,
forestalling the influx of farms or ranches.<P>
But Rice points out that such efforts can be considerably more
damaging to a forest than simply taking the mahogany and leaving
the other trunks alone. After studying the Chimanes Forest of the
Bolivian Amazon (where there is little pressure to convert lands
to agriculture), he concluded that uncontrolled logging of
mahogany is a lesser evil than trying to manage the process
sustainably. Rice estimated that the unsustainable pattern (as is
now practiced) would in fact do one third the damage to these
forests.<P>
Finding the formula to preserve tropical forests in the face of
the immense economic and social forces working to clear them
remains a difficult assignment. Timber certification may well
prove an important tool, particularly if consumer demand mounts
and the prerequisites for approval become better tailored to
local situations. Yet other conservation measures will
undoubtedly need to be applied alongside. As Hammel freely
admits, "Certification is not a panacea."

<CENTER><H2>Testing, Testing</H2>Unusual proteins could improve cancer diagnosis and reduce deaths</CENTER><P>
The key to treating cancer is to catch it early. But identifying
the subtle changes in cells that betray their turncoat tendencies
requires skill-and good luck-on the part of pathologists. Many
cancers are not spotted until too late, when the rebel colonies
are well enough established to put up a fight and found new
mutinous outposts.<P>
Matritech, a Massachusetts-based start-up company, has developed
a diagnostic technique that detects bladder cancer more
easily-and possibly more effectively-than existing methods can.
Matritech's test, which the company expects the Food and Drug
Administration to approve by this summer, measures the amount of
a particular type of protein in urine. Bladder cancer patients
excrete this substance, called a nuclear matrix protein, in
greater amounts than healthy subjects do.<P>
All cell nuclei contain matrix proteins, constituents that give
the nucleus its shape and organize the chromosomes. Researchers
have known of their existence since the 1970s. Their possible
value has become apparent just in the past few years, however,
since investigators at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
showed that some nuclear matrix proteins in cancer cells are
different from those in normal cells. Others are present in
elevated amounts. <P>
The unusual proteins seem to explain why the nuclei of cancer
cells are often oddly shaped. The proteins escape into body
fluids, where they can be identified using antibodies. Thus,
the way is opened to tests for abnormal matrix proteins or, as in
the case of Matritech's bladder cancer test, a normal one in
unusual amounts. "There's been all this hoopla about genetic
screening, but nuclear matrix protein testing could have the
biggest impact of all," says Lance Willsey of Harvard Medical
School.<P>
Stephen D. Chubb, Matritech's chief executive, says his company's
test, called NMP22, detected all cases of invasive disease in a
trial with 1,000 subjects who had previously been treated for
bladder cancer and were being monitored for recurrences-which are
very common. Furthermore, it found about 70 percent of cases of
bladder cancer that was still localized and in less need of
urgent treatment. A negative result meant patients had a 90
percent chance of cancer not developing in the next three to six
months-a useful predictive ability, because that is the usual
interval between follow-up visits for bladder cancer patients.<P>
Those figures, Chubb notes, indicate that NMP22 could be used
instead of current techniques, which involve examining cells from
the bladder shed in urine or viewing the inside of the bladder
with a fiber-optic device (cystoscopy). Moreover, Matritech's
test is one sixth the price of cystoscopy, which is typically
billed at $300, and obviates any risk of infection. Matritech is
initially seeking approval for NMP22 solely to check for
recurrences of bladder cancer. But Chubb is not averse to the
idea that NMP22 could be used more widely to screen for the
disease in people who have not previously been diagnosed.<P>
NMP22 might be the first of a series of matrix protein-based
tests. Although the matrix protein that NMP22 detects is found in
low levels in nuclei throughout the body, other nuclear matrix
proteins are more specific. In April, Robert H. Getzenberg of the
University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute and his colleagues
reported their discovery of five matrix proteins (not yet
employed in any test) that occur exclusively in bladder cancer
cells-thus suggesting the possibility of even more accurate
diagnosis.<P>
Chubb states that Matritech has strong patent protection for all
uses of nuclear matrix proteins as cancer diagnostics and that it
is working on such tests for early detection of prostate, colon,
cervical and breast cancer. Most of these will be based on
proteins that occur exclusively in particular cancers. But
Willsey wonders whether Matritech has sufficient resources to
develop nuclear matrix protein-based tests as fast as the
company, and he, would like.<P>
Nuclear matrix proteins could represent targets for therapeutic
agents, too. The difficulty is that drugs have trouble
penetrating cell nuclei. But Chubb says Matritech is giving the
development of such therapeutics serious thought-and about 10
percent of its research budget.<P>

In 1861, at Cloud's Mill, Va., the Union Army took to the air
with a reconnaissance balloon to help spot Confederate artillery
pieces in one of the first uses of flight in war. Now, in 1996,
the U.S. Army is going back to the balloon to identify an
emerging, lethal class of cheap, sophisticated missiles.
Balloons are not likely to replace high-technology spy planes
anytime soon, but forward-thinking military planners see an
increasingly important battlefield role for inexpensive,
unmanned platforms that cost far less and can stay aloft much
longer than conventional aircraft.<P>
These are no ordinary balloons. The Pentagon, being the Pentagon,
prefers to call them aerostats-helium-filled craft tied down by
thin but incredibly strong fiber-optic cables that transmit
missile-tracking and communications data to the ground. Aerostats
are not self-propelled: they can be tethered to ground vehicles,
ships or even airplanes.<P>
The idea is to float a sensor-laden aerostat high above a
battlefield area to increase the range at which soldiers can
monitor incoming threats. "The aerostat is a very inexpensive way
to have cheap surveillance over a military force," says retired
admiral William Owens, until recently the vice chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff and the principal sponsor of the new
aerostat program.<P>
Specifically, the Pentagon is developing aerostats to spot cruise
missiles: remote-controlled aircraft packed with explosives and
directed by sophisticated navigation equipment. Because cruise
missiles are designed to fly low to the ground, they can get very
close to their targets before ground-based radar can detect them.
And destroying such missiles close to friendly troops can be
dangerous because they may carry biological or chemical
materials-perhaps even nuclear weapons. With an aerostat, which
can see "over the horizon" beyond the range of ground-based
radar, cruise missiles can be located earlier; data passed to
missile defense weapons such as the Patriot system can then be
used to shoot the missiles down over enemy territory.<P>
Although the Pentagon has spent billions developing so-called
Star Wars weapons systems designed to bring down ballistic
missiles, it has only recently begun to pay close attention to
the threat posed by cruise missiles. The imperative for doing so
is obvious: smaller nations are discovering that cruise missiles
are easy to build and even easier to buy. The Pentagon's own
Global Positioning System satellite network, which was designed
for military navigation but which has become a hugely successful
commercial tool, has opened the door to more sophisticated remote
piloting systems perfect for cruise missiles. For around $50
million, any nation can purchase either a very few fighter
aircraft, about four attack helicopters or 15 ballistic missiles.
But the same amount buys hundreds of cruise missiles-what the
army calls "a poor man's air force."<P>
Today and for the foreseeable future, the military can do little
about cruise missiles, especially those that attack targets on
land. Enter the aerostat. The U.S. Air Force has years of
experience operating the balloons along the southern U.S. border,
but until last year the Pentagon paid little attention to the
"lighter than air" solution. Now, given a high-profile push by
top military leaders, the Pentagon has devoted $500 million over
the next five years to develop and test aerostats' potential for
cruise missile defense.<P>
And the military might not stop there. Owens, keeping an eye on
what he calls the "smart front edge of warfare," thinks balloons
have potential far beyond the detection of cruise missiles.
Current aerostats fly as high as 15,000 feet; for cruise missile
defense, 20,000 feet is a likely ceiling. But Owens believes an
aerostat flying at 60,000 feet could one day keep watch over an
area the size of Bosnia for days or even weeks without
maintenance or fuel, providing surveillance and communications
for troops on the ground. Given the soaring costs of constructing
and flying high-tech surveillance airplanes, the balloon may
have a lofty place on the battlefield of the
future.

<CENTER><H2>JAMES ALAN FOX</H2></CENTER>
<CENTER>Catching a Coming Crime Wave</CENTER>
<P>
College deans do not seem to make suitable protagonists in
movies, unless they are the butt of fraternity pranks. So the
idea of an academic who moonlights as a sleuth of serial murder
might appear downright improbable. Still, the script is being
written, an actor is lined up, and in a year, James Alan Fox, the
dean of the College of Criminal Justice at Northeastern
University, will likely see himself portrayed in a movie made
for television.<P>
Television and Fox are hardly strangers. The criminologist has
studied serial killings and mass murders for almost 20 years.
Whenever bodies turn up or some multiple shooting occurs, the
media look to Fox for the usual commentary. In addition to being
quoted in thousands of articles, he has appeared hundreds of
times on network programs, from <I>Good Morning America</I> to
the <I>Late Late Show with Tom Snyder. </I>"I've done the
<I>Oprah</I> show eight times," Fox states.<P>
"Not all my colleagues think it's a good idea to appear on
television," he adds. "There's a gut feeling that it's not
appropriate, that it's beneath the role of a serious academic. I
don't agree with that. The way I look at it, I'm teaching a class
of millions. It's an opportunity lost and a responsibility
shirked if we don't publicize important research findings."<P>
That's why Fox freely gives out his beeper and home numbers to
journalists, returns their calls promptly and answers the
telephone that frequently interrupts our conversation in his
office. He even pauses midsentence to allow me to flip the
recording tape. "Academics don't know how to say things in a
concise manner. Most people want straightforward answers. I
know, sound bites," Fox winces. "But they're not always bites.
Sometimes they're whole meals."<P>
Wearing an Italian suit and a Movado watch, the boyish
44-year-old media maven is a far cry from the shy, short, fat
teenager with Coke-bottle glasses. Back then, he was a math whiz,
although by the end of his college years at the University of
Pennsylvania, he had turned to sociology in the search for a
topic that had more immediate applicability. Inspired by a summer
course in criminology, Fox earned master's degrees in criminology
and statistics before completing his doctorate in sociology at
Pennsylvania at the age of 24.<P>
Soon after, he assumed a professorship at Northeastern. There he
combined criminology with his love of mathematics and
computers<I>-</I>programming is a hobby of his, and he says he
would be a computer scientist if he had to do it all over again.
Fox began to use statistics and demographics to forecast crime
patterns, showing, for example, how trends in homicide depend
largely on the number of 18- to 24-year-olds, the most
crime-prone age group.<P>
His interest in multiple killings developed when his colleague
Jack Levin approached him at a party with the idea to conduct a
study on mass murder. Their first effort was published in 1985,
and since then the two have collaborated on several other books
and articles.<P>
Fox began honing his media skills with Levin as well, when they
broadcast an interview program from the campus radio station. "I
worked hard at getting rid of my Boston accent in that show,"
Fox-who grew up in the city's suburbs-recalls. The thick
eyeglasses are gone as well. The only obvious indications of his
legal blindness<I>-</I>resulting from the high oxygen content in
his incubator after his premature birth<I>-</I>are the size of
the fonts displayed on his monitor and the fact that he brings
reading material to the tip of his nose. <P>
The television movie (appropriately, to appear on the Fox
network) is based on the criminologist's involvement with a 1990
case in Gainesville, Fla., in which five college students were
brutally slain. The news broke while Fox and his wife were
vacationing in Maine, and Fox soon found himself in Florida
appearing on a talk show. On it, he stated that the suspect in
custody was the wrong man, even though he matched the profile
supplied by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. "He was an
impulsive, young hothead who could not control himself. Someone
as impulsive as he could not carry out such a methodical,
meticulous crime," Fox explained, noting how the killer carefully
mutilated the corpses. Moreover, the suspect was only 18,<I>
</I>rather young for a serial killer.<P>
Harboring their own doubts about the suspect, the local police
hired Fox as a consultant. Culling records of previous murders
in the area, Fox was struck by crime-scene photographs of a
murder in Shreveport, La., months earlier. "The FBI did not think
the connection was so strong," Fox says, but he was not misled by
the differences, pointing out similarities in the way the killer
had cleaned up, then posed the corpses in both cases.<P>
So he told the police to look for someone who had a connection
between the two towns. After compiling hospital records, college
rosters and other lists, the police came across a man from
Shreveport who was in custody in Ocala, Fla., for stealing a car
from Gainesville near the time of the murders. Soon, the
authorities genetically matched Danny Harold Rolling to the
crimes.<P>
Although the study of mass murder seems to have made Fox the
country's most quoted criminologist, it no longer holds the same
fascination for him. "It got to a point that it was not
satisfying, because there's not much you can do about it," Fox
confesses, remarking that there is no real way to identify
potential mass killers. So he branched out to research violence
in the workplace and among juveniles. These topics have led him
back to number crunching to explain and predict patterns. He and
others have recently used statistics to argue that the current
downturn of crime rates in many cities reflects the drop in the
population of young adults.<P>
Such conclusions agitate law-enforcement officials, most notably
William J. Bratton, until this past April the New York City
police commissioner. Bratton claims that his revamping of the
department and aggressive policing sparked the 39 percent drop
in homicide from 1993 to 1995, with equally impressive
double-digit declines in most other major crimes. Last year
Bratton set out to disprove the theories of Fox and his academic
ilk, promising to "knock them down like ducks in a row" and
declaring that the police are winning the war on crime.<P>
The ducks quack right back. "I hate that stuff," Fox groans.
"We're not winning the war on crime. Bratton deserves a lot of
credit in terms of expanding community policing and bringing a
greater sense of order to the city. But he doesn't deserve all
the credit."<P>
In fact, Fox's studies of homicide lead him to conclude that the
U.S. is headed for a crime wave. "Hidden beneath the overall drop
in crime is this tremendous surge in youth crime," Fox asserts.
Historically, young adults<I>-</I>between the ages of 18 and
24<I>-</I>were responsible for the vast majority of murders. But
since the mid-1980s, when the crack epidemic struck, juveniles
began committing more murder: the rate among those in the 14- to
17-year-old group more than doubled between 1985 and 1994, from
seven to 19.1 per 100,000.<P>
The baby-boom generation has produced 39 million people who are
now under the age of 10. During the next decade, this "baby
boomerang," as Fox calls it, will enter their most crime-prone
years. Unless steps are taken immediately, "the next crime wave
will get so bad that it will make 1995 look like the good old
days." Although some investigators disagree with his conclusions
and choice of language, few argue with his statistical
analyses.<P>
The notoriety he has achieved with media appearances has helped
him gain an audience for his glum forecast. During the past year,
he has testified before members of Congress, dined with President
Bill Clinton and briefed U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno.
"People are listening. I hear the president talking about it, the
senators. And now Janet Reno is appointing a juvenile violence
czar," the criminologist enthuses.<P>
Fox rattles off several reasons why teenagers are more violent
today, such as access to weapons, lack of parental supervision
(crime among juveniles peaks at 3 P.M.) and the brutal aspects of
American society. "We have a culture that glorifies violence,"
Fox complains, citing as an example serial killing, which is
mostly a U.S. phenomenon. Killers often become celebrities, their
visages appearing on trading cards and on the covers of
entertainment magazines. <P>
Videocassettes have made it easy for children to view violence.
And the proposed ratings system for television and the
incorporation of the V-chip (a device that can block out
adult-oriented programming) provides an incentive for producers
to include more gratuitous scenes to achieve higher ratings, Fox
comments. "It's a myth that parents will be able to tune this
stuff out," he opines, arguing that parents would not know how to
manage the technology. <P>
Threats of severe punishment will not stem the coming tide. "Many
kids face violence and death in the classrooms by their peers,"
Fox emphasizes. "As far as they're concerned, the criminal
justice system might as well take a number and stand in line with
all the other people who want to get them.<P>
"It might make us feel better that an offender is getting a hard
sentence," he continues, "but that's not accomplishing anything.
We need to put him in an environment that is therapeutic." Given
that many working parents cannot afford child care, Fox thinks
government and corporations should develop programs that keep
teens engaged, rather than try to hold parents responsible for
their children's crimes. <P>
Not surprisingly, he is vociferously opposed to the death
penalty. "Nothing is gained by execution, and a lot is lost," Fox
maintains. It costs more, largely because of the legal machinery
needed to ensure a fair trial and not, as many people believe,
because of repeated appeals. Given the sentence, prosecutors take
more care in preparation, and judges give the defense a wider
latitude. The argument that it is expensive to lock up murderers
for life does not wash with Fox, either. He disputes the
typically cited estimate of $30,000 to $40,000 a year, which
comes from dividing the correctional budget by the number of
inmates. Most costs are fixed and do not drop when prisoners are
executed. "You can't call up the commissioner and tell him we're
going to cut his salary because there is one fewer inmate," Fox
sneers. "The actual expendable cost for incarcerating that one
person is probably a couple of thousand dollars."<P>
"We have a very good alternative to the death penalty, which is
life in prison," he explains. "One reason so many Americans
thirst for the death penalty is that they don't trust the
criminal justice system." They fear that such offenders will be
given parole after only a brief jail term. But to Fox, the system
works pretty well, given the millions of people that pass through
it. It is the rare instance of a corrupt judge or a recidivist
parolee that captures the front pages. "Good news is no news," he
concludes, "and bad news is big news."<P>
A reporter from <I>USA Today </I>calls for the second time. Fox
obliges with more of his statistics and prognostications. And of
course, he speaks in concise, brief statements, sure to read well
on the front page.

<I>Review by Joe Nickell</I>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=4>The Demon-Haunted World: <BR>Science as a Candle in the Dark</FONT><BR>
</B><I>BY CARL SAGAN</I>
<BR>
Random House, 1996 ($25.95)
<P>
Books promoting pseudoscience are often popular and profitable-James Redfield's <I>The Celestine Prophecy</I> has sat on the best-seller list for more than two years. Skeptical books are much less marketable and so are comparatively rare. Rarer still are those of the caliber of Carl Sagan's new work, which joins a small but distinguished group that includes such classics as Charles Mackay's <I>Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds</I> (published in 1843) and Martin Gardner's <I>Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science</I> (1957).
<P>
Sagan, director of the Laboratory for Planetary Studies at Cornell University, is perhaps the best known popularizer of science today. Moreover, he has written and lectured extensively on the paranormal and is an active fellow-as am I-of the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal (CSICOP), one of the better known investigative organizations in the field.
<P>
<I>The Demon-Haunted World</I> is impressively comprehensive: it discusses topics from alien abductions to witchcraft, making stops at astrology, crop circles, dowsing, faith healing, ghosts, past-life regression and telepathy. (Sagan has an edge here, having recently written the foreword to Gordon Stein's 860-page <I>Encyclopedia of the Paranormal.</I>) Sagan even cites the recent evidence unmasking the 1947 Roswell Incident-firmly entrenched in UFO mythology as a flying-saucer cover-up-as the crash of a secret reconnaissance balloon. He also manages a debunking discussion of the infamous "alien autopsy" film shown on network television late in 1995.
<P>
Taking his title from the ancient In-
<BR>
dian text <I>Isa Upanishad, </I>Sagan draws persuasive parallels between the oldest demon stories of the human mind and modern paranormal phenomena of spirit haunting and alien abduction. The vocabulary changes, he notes, but the underlying experiences appear to remain the same. "For much of our history," Sagan explains, "we were so fearful of the outside world, with its unpredictable dangers, that we gladly embraced anything that promised to soften or explain away the terror." Even ghosts and demons were better than nameless fear.
<P>
Sagan finds an impending threat not only in the New Age mania for the paranormal and religious miracles but also in that much broader realm known as pseudoscience. He takes a swipe at such jargon-clad follies as "facilitated communication" with autistic children, claims of hereditary racial differences in IQ and billions spent on the fanciful Star Wars antimissile umbrella. Amid these "regions of utter darkness," however, Sagan sees scientific reason as a candle lighting the way to sense. Like superstition, "science is an attempt...to understand the world, to get a grip on things, to get hold of ourselves, to steer a safe course," he writes. In contrast to pseudoscience, the scientific method has been mostly successful: "Microbiology and meteorology now explain what only a few centuries ago was considered sufficient cause to burn women to death."
<P>
Although his sympathies clearly lie with the debunkers, Sagan bravely acknowledges his own fallible humanity while attempting to coax readers to his point of view. He agrees that some unsupported beliefs have a strong and quite understandable attraction:
<P>
<P>
My parents died years ago. I was very close to them. I still miss them terribly. I know I always will. I long to believe that their essence, their personalities, what I loved so much about them, are-really and truly-still in existence somewhere. I wouldn't ask very much, just five or ten minutes a year, say, to tell them about their grandchildren, to catch them up on the latest news, to remind them that I love them. There's a part of me-no matter how childish it sounds-that wonders how they are. "Is everything all right?" I want to ask. The last words I found myself saying to my father, at the moment of his death, were "Take care."
<P>
Sometimes I dream that I'm talking to my parents, and suddenly-still immersed in the dreamwork-I'm seized by the overpowering realization that they didn't really die, that it's all been some kind of horrible mistake.... When I wake up I go through an abbreviated process of mourning all over again. Plainly, there's something within me that's ready to believe in life after death.
<P>
<P>
Sagan occasionally stumbles, however, when preaching the gospel of modern technology. In one passage, he comments that "we can pray over the cholera victim, or we can give her 500 milligrams of tetracycline every 12 hours." In reality, antibiotics only slightly shorten the course of the disease. One would do better providing abundant fluids while the infection burns itself out-during which time emotional support and other intangibles clearly aid recovery-rather than contributing to the forces of unnatural selection that are rapidly rendering many antibiotics ineffective.
<P>
Elsewhere, Sagan does offer perfectly sound guidance for seeing through mediums, channelers and other such charlatans. How is it, he asks, that they never provide information from their spiritual "sources" that is both verifiable and unavailable by other means? "Why don't Sophocles, Democritus and Aristarchus dictate their lost books? Don't they wish future generations to have access to their masterpieces?"
<P>
There are practical means for warding off the demons of superstition and ignorance. In a chapter entitled "The Fine Art of Baloney Detection," Sagan offers a kit of effective procedures, including Occam's razor (always choosing the simplest hypothesis that explains the data at hand) and the concept of falsifiability. "Propositions that are untestable, unfalsifiable are not worth much," he cautions. His kit also provides lessons on what not to do, including such rhetorical fallacies as the ad hominem argument, the "confusion of correlation and causation" and the fallacy of the excluded middle.
<P>
Sagan's book is, of course, only an introduction to the enlightenment that he hopes to help spread. The final chapters are devoted to the importance of education, especially education in critical thinking. He cites the case of Frederick Bailey, a 10-year-old black child sold into slavery in 1828. The slave owner's wife helped Bailey learn the rudiments of reading until her husband forbade it, explaining that such knowledge would "forever unfit him to be a slave." But the boy persevered in private.
<P>
Bailey escaped to New England, changed his name to Frederick Douglass, eluded the bounty hunters who tracked down runaway slaves and became one of the greatest orators, writers and political leaders of his century. "All his life," Sagan writes, "he understood that literacy had been the way out."
<P>
So it is today, for people hungry for real knowledge but largely bereft of the tools to acquire it. "In every country we should be teaching our children the scientific method and the reasons for a Bill of Rights," Sagan concludes, pointing out that an educated citizenry faces the best chance of constraining those in power to work for the people's interests. "In the demon-haunted world that we inhabit by virtue of being human, this may be all that stands between us and the enveloping darkness."

In Victorian times Michael Faraday gingerly liquefied gases inside thick-walled glass tubing. By World War I, ingenuity and boldness of design allowed Harvard's Percy W. Bridgman to reach much higher pressures along semi-industrial lines. His large press disclosed innumerable new phases in familiar condensed matter, most famously several new crystalline phases of H<SUB>2</SUB>O. Eventually he came to water ice VI, which at the highest pressures of the time remained an icy solid even at the temperature of a very hot kitchen oven. 
<P>
The price of this mastery was not low: in 1922 a pressure container failed, steel flew like shrapnel and two men were killed, although the Harvard laboratory went on safely for decades more. Step by step, industry developed high-pressure technology for large-scale syntheses. The most important early product was ammonia, made in the millions of tons by reacting hydrogen and nitrogen gases at modest pressure. The most celebrated is synthetic diamond, by now a high-pressure commodity.
<P>
Set some simple markers along the pressure scale. Infants breathe and puff their cheeks, displaying small changes in local air pressure. Mountaintops lure others among us into pressures lower by a factor of two or so. The weather brings stay-at-homes incessant, less noticeable variations in pressure, but sea-level air still affords us a meaningful natural unit. Call the typical pressure at sea level one atmosphere.
<P>
Like many another kid, I was disappointed years ago by the poor results of taking a long rubber tube into the pool, in an attempt to tap surface air for breathing on the bottom. No way! The added weight of even a foot of water is too much for chest muscles. To breathe at any depth underwater, you need either to be housed within some sealed submersible or to sip breaths of air fed from a portable tank at regulated matching pressure. That is SCUBA-self-contained underwater breathing apparatus.
<P>
The ocean defines a second natural pressure marker. Call 1,000 atmospheres one "ocean," by analogy. That value is a ballpark fit to seawater pressure six miles down in the deepest undersea trenches. The earliest physical successes called for pressures reaching one ocean or so, and the ices for pressures half a dozen times greater. The diamonds appeared after World War II up at 50 or 100 oceans, at which graphite dissolved in molten metal at white heat crystallizes to diamond. Such conditions have become routine in the special multiton presses that yield synthetic diamonds around the world.
<P>
Solid rock is denser than water, and our planet's center lies a decisive 1,000 times deeper than the average-depth sea bottom. We can plausibly define a third natural benchmark for core pressures, one equal to 1,000 oceans of 1,000 atmospheres each, or a million atmospheres. Calling one atmosphere by the crisper name "bar," its informal equivalent, we use its multiple, one megabar, as a convenient unit for describing the tremendous pressures at the core.
<P>
<P>
It turns out to be surprisingly easy to estimate the pressures so deep down. The symmetrical Newtonian pull of all the interior parts on all the layers above compacts Earth into a near sphere. Even the expected increase in density as depth approaches the center has at most a modest effect on a calculation that treats the globe as a uniform fluid. The central pressure approximates the simple product of three well-known quantities: the average density of Earth; the planet's radius; and the familiar constant g, the value of surface gravity signaled by every apple that falls. That central pressure is reliably estimated at about four megabars whatever the internal composition, if only all the strata are both stable (not undermined by vast buried caverns) and uniform from place to place, differing only as their depth differs. What is down there anyhow? This rich question bears strongly on the literal roots of all geology.
<P>
Can we proceed with theory alone as guide? Can we ignore unknown minerals and fluids, some sure to be as strange as hot ice was? The geophysicists wisely chose to experiment. One megabar of pressure was first reached 20 years ago at the Geophysical Laboratory of the Carnegie Institution of Washington. That lab and others can now summon the conditions of Hades itself right to the bench top. 
<P>
The megabar apparatus in no way resembles the heavy, house-size hydraulic presses of old, stowed behind safety walls and served by a team of cautious engineers. It resembles more a top-of-the-line research microscope in the precision machining of its minute, elegant parts and is not unlike it as well in bulk, weight and cost. No monster machine at all, this device is mostly made in house by a few master machinists as the prized tool of a few physicists.
<P>
How do they evade danger, weight and expense? Pressure is a local quantity. Even a handheld steel sewing needpushed firmly into a surface can exert oceanic pressures if only over a tiny area. Megabars of pressure in a minute container, a tenth of a millimeter on edge, store up something like the energy released by a pencil falling off the workbench. If that holder fractures, expect only a small pop, a source more of sharp fiscal pain than of physical injury. Work small; a miniature-scale apparatus produces pressure to match a planet's core simply by hand-tightening a single bolt!
<P>
But can you learn about Earth's center from so small a sample? Indeed you can, for matter is atomic. Its properties are well developed whenever sufficient atoms are present long enough to arrange themselves as the laws require. That small pressure vessel holds some million billion atoms, more than enough to allow matter to fulfill its subtlest intentions. A few micrograms are ineffective for making diamonds commercially but brilliantly suited to yield knowledge.
<P>
How will you learn what happens to matter compressed under megabars? First, use a transparent container, just as Faraday did. Probe it adroitly with infrared and optical lasers, with x-rays, neutrons, microwaves, even sound. Tight, high-intensity beams may be needed for a scant sample; for x-ray diffraction studies, the geophysicists often subject their pressure cell to a fierce synchrotron source. The limits are set mainly by the changing state of condensed-matter physics.
<P>
How to contain the sample? Squeeze it inside a tiny box of the hardest stuff known, diamond. Find two flawless gems-single crystals selected for purity and extratransparency-then cut in facets to order. Less than one carat in weight, they will be dear but affordable. Align the tip ends of the two truncated diamond cones with a thin ring gasket of steel alloy held between the two tiny flattened tips. The sample is confined within the hole in the gasket. Press diamond hard against diamond, and the whole assembly seals tight.
<P>
Megabars come easily. A diamond-diamond total force of only a couple of hundred kilograms is adequate, for that force is concentrated over an extremely small area. Up-to-date diamond-anvil cells may have contact faces only a thirtieth of a millimeter across. Sophisticated mounting design and virtuoso fabrication keep the gems nearly parallel for final optical alignment. Cryogenic cooling and resistance heating are both quite manageable.
<P>
The theorists opine that at about 12 megabars, diamond undergoes a change in phase, and some anvil will break. That limit is still ahead. About half that pressure is expected to be enough to press molecular hydrogen into hydrogen metal, a goal that has long eluded the labs. In the past few months there has been a credible report of making the metal hydrogen using a big, noisy gas gun, but the stuff lasted the mere microseconds it took a shock wave to cross the cryogenic hydrogen target. 
<P>
Fortune may favor us with some new anvil substance harder than pure diamond, so we will be able to see the luster of that simplest of metals. In this subtle corner of condensed-matter physics, the pressure of a planet's core is literally at hand, through an art once awkward but now as harmonious as a quiet song.

<H2>Out of Gas</H2>
<P>
I was taking some time off in Switzerland recently, driving along the Geneva lakeside, when my rental car announced that it needed gas. Things being the way they are nowadays, a talking automobile didn't strike me as science fiction. Which was ironic, given that at that moment, I was passing Villa Deodati, the very place another Brit vacationer had invented the genre.
<P>
Back in 1816 Mary Godwin holidayed there with her poet lover Percy Shelley (they would marry the next year), smoking hemp and having a generally unconventional time, joined by their new pal Lord Byron and his mistress, Claire (nee Jane), Mary's stepsister. One evening the dinner conversation got around to rejuvenating corpses and whether artificial human beings could be made from separate parts. And to the mind-boggling rumor that the esteemed Erasmus Darwin had electrically "galvanized" some vermicelli and made it come alive.
<P>
Well. Those science dingbats were starting to tamper with the fundamental forces of the universe, and where would it all end? So Mary, probably also influenced by the Humphry Davy chemistry lecture she'd been reading-and his remarks about scientists being able one day to discover the hidden secrets of nature-decided to write a cautionary tale about a Swiss nerd, name of Victor, whose experimental mix of chemistry, physiology and electricity goes horribly wrong and creates a monster Victor can't control. You must have seen one of the film renditions of the story. I prefer Boris Karloff's.
<P>
Mary got many of her technophobe views from her novelist and ex-preacher father, William Godwin, a fountainhead of socialism and political guru to such other left-wingers as Samuel Taylor Coleridge and Charles Lamb. Godwin and most of his Romantic fans reckoned the new factory lifestyle, being introduced everywhere by the Industrial Revolution and its juggernaut machines, would degrade the workers (only just arrived from their idyllic life in country villages) with diabolical and unnatural practices, including shift work and wages. Godwin wrote yards of visionary scribble on the subject of individuals being (mis)shaped by their environment and how the thing to aim for was not mass production and gigantic conurbations but decentralization and egalitarian communities built on the human scale.
<P>
One of Godwin's most devoted groupies was Robert Owen, a young Welshman who was to take Godwin's principles quite far afield. Owen supervised a spinning mill in Manchester, so he'd seen the worst effects of factory life. In 1800 Owen became part owner of the largest single manufacturing enterprise in Scotland, a water-powered textile mill at New Lanark, a village on the river Clyde. Two thirds of the machine operators were orphans. Extraordinary as it may sound now, this use of pauper children was considered real charitable stuff, because if they hadn't been given jobs at the mill those kids would have been starving, criminal or worse. Which is why, when Owen and his partners took over New Lanark, by the standards of the time it was a dangerously liberal place: the children's bed straw was changed once a month; they had two hours of schooling a day; their clothing was washed every two weeks; and they slept only three to a bed, 75 to a room.
<P>
It was a real socialist utopia, with intervals for music and dance, an Institute for the Formation of Character, a company store and a canteen. (Owen also upped the working day to 14 hours.) By 1824 these libertarian ideas were catching on, and Owen was heading a national labor movement, hobnobbing with such admirers as Grand Duke Nicholas of Russia, the reformer Jeremy Bentham and the archbishop of Canterbury.
<P>
The fellow who'd sold him New Lanark, and whose daughter he married, was David Dale, a successful textile maker, who counted among his very few failures a partnership in a Scottish cotton mill with one George Macintosh. In 1777 Macintosh had made a scarlet dye called cudbear. Principal ingredients: ammonia (from urine he collected from friends and factory workers) and lichen (mostly imported later on, after he'd scraped the Highlands bare, from Scandinavia and Sardinia). Cudbear was a cheap alternative to a much more expensive coloring, made from cochineal beetles all the way from Mexico. The other thing about the cudbear dye was that alkali made it blue. In acid, it went back to scarlet. Paper dyers knew it as litmus.
<P>
It was probably the cudbear link with ammonia that got George's son, Charles, involved with the Glasgow gasworks. In 1819 he cut a deal for all the coal tar they were throwing away there. Coal tar was a by-product of the manufacture of coal gas, which involved cooking coal to obtain the gas. The tar was then disposed of in quarries, rivers and ponds. From this foul-smelling and, for the moment, virtually free gunk, Charles distilled ammonia for the cudbear works, where production was far outpacing the supplies of urine. He also recovered another chemical that would change the meaning of rainy days: naphtha, which, Charles found, dissolved rubber. In 1822, after taking out a patent for this technique, he spread liquefied rubber between sheets of cotton and invented the raincoat, which, in Britain, is still known-and wrongly spelled-as the mackintosh.
<P>
Not long after Macintosh was finding wet-weather ways to make money out of muck, a German chemist called von Hoffman got his doctorate in coal tar. So with the nasty stuff thus made academically respectable, more experimental things began to happen. In 1856 one of von Hoffman's pupils at the new Royal College of Chemistry in London, William Perkin, discovered the first artificial aniline dye (mauve) in coal tar while trying to make artificial quinine-but that's another story.
<P>
Meanwhile a colleague of von Hoffman's, name of Runge, also experimenting with coal tar, produced creosote, which ended up saving American forests because it preserved railroad ties so well they didn't need replacing so often. Creosote prevented other rots, too. By 1857 in Carlisle, England, a form of creosote called carbolic acid was being mixed with sewage to prevent decomposition. 
<P>
Eight years later the professor of surgery at the Royal Infirmary in Edinburgh, Joseph Lister, heard about this trick, got hold of some from the Glasgow University chemistry lab and combined it with paraffin. Thus armed, Lister did the unthinkable: he premeditatedly broke the skin of a patient who had a nonlife-threatening complex fracture. When the usually fatal festering appeared, Lister slapped his carbolic goo on it, and, miracle of miracles, the patient survived!
<P>
Soon Lister was shooting a carbolic mist into his operating theaters and accomplishing daring antiseptic things. He even did it to Queen Victoria (she had an abscess). In next to no time, surgeons, who like a good laugh, were leaping into the operating theater with cries of "Let us spray!" Previously, appealing to the Almighty had been about their only hope for success in a profession whose other standard joke had been: "Good operation, but the patient died."
<P>
Sprays also became popular for local anesthesia and perfume bottles. Then, in 1883, a German engineer called Wilhelm Maybach teamed up with an ex-gunsmith friend, and they used the spray in a way that would literally change the way the world worked (and played). Maybach atomized gasoline into a fine mist that more readily ignited inside a cylinder and so drove the piston up and down. The machine this gizmo was attached to eventually took the name of the daughter of one of their major investors and a favorite of Maybach's partner. The partner was Daimler, and the girl was Mercedes. And Maybach's carburetor is, I suppose, ultimately responsible for me driving along the Geneva lakeside and running out of gas. Like this column (for now).

The lore of ancient Greece recalls an Olympic athlete who was
determined to become the strongest person in the world. Every day
<A HREF="http://www.culture.fr/louvre/images/isculp05.jpg">Milon of Croton</A> would pick up a calf, raise it
above his head and carry it around a stable. As the calf grew, so
did Milon's strength, until eventually he was able to lift the
full-grown cow.<P>
Milon, who won the wrestling contest five times, intuitively
grasped one of the basic tenets of contemporary sports science.
Progressive resistance training-the stressing of muscles with
steadily increasing loads-is something well understood by the
more than 10,000 athletes from 197 countries who will go to
Atlanta, Ga., next month for the centennial of the modern <A HREF="http://www.atlanta.olympic.org/">Olympic
Games.</A><P>
During the past half century, however, sports science has refined
the basic principles of training beyond the understanding of the
Greeks. Exercise physiologists and coaches draw on new scientific
knowledge to help athletes develop a balance of muscular and
metabolic fitness for each of the <A HREF="http://www.atlanta.olympic.org/acog/sports/d-sports.html">29 sports</A> in the Olympic Games.
Biomechanical experts employ computers, video and specialized
sensors to study the dynamics of movement. Design engineers
incorporate advances in materials and aerodynamics to fashion
streamlined bobsleds or racing bicycles. Sports psychologists
build confidence through mental-training techniques. The
integration of these approaches affords the small gains in
performance that can translate into victory.<P>
<P>
<B><A NAME="Working">Working the Body</A></B>
<P>
Understanding how training builds the strength and stamina needed
for Olympic events requires basic knowledge of how the body
produces energy. All human motion depends on the use and
resynthesis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), a high-energy
molecule consisting of a base (adenine), a sugar (ribose) and
three phosphate groups. The breaking of the bond between two
phosphate units releases energy that powers muscle contractions
and other cellular reactions. Humans have a very limited capacity
for storing ATP. At a maximum rate of work, the five millimoles
of ATP available for each kilogram of muscle is completely
depleted in a few seconds. To sustain activity, the body has
three interrelated metabolic processes for continually
resupplying the molecule. Which one predominates depends on the
muscles' power requirements at a given moment and on the duration
of the activity.<P>
The most immediately available source for reconstructing ATP is
phosphocreatine, itself a high-energy, phosphate-bearing
molecule. The energy released by the breakdown of the
phosphocreatine molecule is used to resynthesize ATP. The
phosphocreatine system can recharge ATP for only a short
while-just five to 10 seconds during a sprint. When the supply of
this molecule is exhausted, the body must rely on two other
ATP-generating processes-one that does not require oxygen
(anaerobic) and one that does (aerobic).<P>
The <A HREF="http://bmbwww.leeds.ac.uk/designs/glyintro/page01.htm">anaerobic process</A>, also known as glycolysis, is usually the
first to kick in. Cells break down specific carbohydrates
(glucose or glycogen in muscle) to release the energy for
resynthesizing ATP. Unfortunately for the athlete, the anaerobic
metabolism of carbohydrates can yield a buildup of lactic acid,
which accumulates in the muscles within two minutes. <A HREF="http://www.teamoregon.com/%7Eteamore/publications/energy.html">Lactic acid</A>
and associated hydrogen ions cause burning muscle pain. But
lactic acid and its metabolite, lactate, which accumulates in
muscle, do not always degrade performance. Through training, the
muscles of elite competitors adapt so that they can tolerate the
elevated levels of lactate produced during high-intensity
exercise.<P>
Even so, lactic acid and lactate eventually inhibit muscles from
contracting. So anaerobic glycolysis can be relied on only for
short bursts of exercise. It cannot supply the ATP needed for the
sustained activity in endurance events. That task falls to
aerobic metabolism-the breakdown of carbohydrate, fat and protein
in the presence of oxygen. In contrast with anaerobic glycolysis,
the aerobic system cannot be switched on quickly. At least one to
two minutes of hard exercise must pass until the increase in
breathing and heart rate ensures delivery of oxygen to a muscle
cell. During that interval, the athlete depends on a combination
of stored ATP, the phosphocreatine system or anaerobic glycolysis
to provide energy. With the activation of the aerobic processes,
these other systems function at a lower level. In the aerobic
phase, for instance, lactic acid and lactate are still produced,
but they are consumed by less active muscles or metabolized in
the liver and so do not accumulate.<P>
Although the aerobic system is highly efficient, its ability to
supply the muscles with energy reaches an upper threshold. If
still more ATP is needed, the muscles must step up the use of
various other energy sources. A soccer player in the middle of a
45-minute half, for example, would depend mostly on aerobic
metabolism. But if he needed to sprint briefly at full speed, his
body would immediately call on stored ATP or ATP reconstituted by
the phosphocreatine system to supplement the aerobic system.
Similarly, if this high-intensity sprint continued for five to 15
seconds, the player would experience a rapid increase in the rate
of anaerobic glycolysis. As the play ended, the body would return
to its reliance on the aerobic metabolic system, while the
capacities of the other energy systems regenerated themselves.<P>
Coaches must understand the requirements of their sports and
adjust the intensity or duration of training to improve an
athlete's aerobic or anaerobic functioning. The fundamental
principle of training is that sustained activity will result in
adaptation of the muscles to ever increasing levels of stress-an
idea sometimes referred to as the stimulus-response model. Over
time, training will induce physiological changes, which are
adapted to the needs of a specific sport. The distance runner's
training, for example, focuses on enhancing the capabilities of
the aerobic system. In contrast, a weight lifter would
concentrate on strength and power instead of the endurance
requirements of the distance events. <P>
<P>
<B><A NAME="Going">Going the Distance</A></B>
<P>
For the Olympic coach, training also becomes the judicious
management of diminishing returns. During the first year, an
athlete might invest 50 to 100 hours of training to improve 10 to
15 percent in a season. At the peak of his or her career, the
same athlete might put in 1,000 hours of intense and concentrated
effort to achieve an improvement of a single percentage point.
Such a small gain appears to be a seemingly poor return on
investment. But consider that the margin of victory in the track
sprint events in the 1992 Olympics-the average difference between
a gold and silver medal-was only 0.86 percent, little more than
two tenths of a second.<P>
The details of how coaches and athletes tailor training to
specific sports are perhaps best illustrated by the examples of
competitors in widely differing events. At the Atlanta Games, the
longest competition will be the <A HREF="http://www.olympic.nbc.com/sports/cycling/index.html">men's cycling race</A>, which lasts
about five hours. The 228-kilometer road race will bring together
rivals whose training is optimized for sustained aerobic effort,
while taking advantage of extraordinary advances in the
aerodynamics of cycling technology. <A HREF="http://www.chron.com/content/interactive/special/cycling/armstrong/lance2.html">Lance Armstrong of Austin,
Tex.</A>, is expected to be a strong contender for a medal. Although
he did not bring home any medals in the 1992 Olympics, he won the
world championship in 1993 and, in 1995, a day-long segment of
the Tour de France.<P>
Armstrong's innate ability was evident from an early age. At age
15, he demonstrated the aerobic capacity that places him among
the upper 1 to 2 percent of athletes worldwide. A measure of
overall cardiorespiratory fitness, aerobic capacity is the
maximum amount of oxygen that can be taken up and delivered to
muscle cells for use in making ATP. It also goes by the name of
maximum oxygen uptake, or VO2max. Armstrong registered a maximum
oxygen uptake of 80 milliliters of oxygen per kilogram of body
weight per minute, a rate he continues to maintain at the age of
24. This measurement is almost double that of the average fit
male.<P>
As part of his preparation for the Olympics, Armstrong has made
several trips to the <A HREF="http://www.rmii.com/colorado/csprings/info/olympic.html">U.S. Olympic Committee's largest training
center</A>, located at the committee's headquarters in Colorado
Springs. I am part of the sports science team there that
evaluates and advises athletes and their coaches on training
improvements. <P>
During one of his stays, Armstrong completed a metabolic
assessment on a cycling ergometer, a machine in the sports
physiology laboratory that precisely controls workload (how hard
and fast an athlete pedals). Tests conducted while Armstrong
labored on the ergometer measured VO2max, heart rate and lactic
acid levels. Armstrong registered the highest VO2max of any U.S.
cycler. When performing at this peak level, he was able to
marshal a world-class 525 watts of pedaling power.<P>
Physiologists also assess two other benchmarks of performance-how
efficiently the athlete uses oxygen and how quickly lactate
builds up in the muscles. This latter measurement, the lactate
threshold, is represented as a percentage of VO2max. It is at the
threshold that lactate begins to accumulate, causing pain and
burning. <P>
At the training center, Armstrong's lactate threshold measured 75
percent, which was 10 percentage points less than the average for
the best cyclists on the U.S. national team. The evaluation team
recommended that he train more often at close to or slightly
above his threshold. Training at this intensity produces changes
in circulatory, nervous and enzymatic functions that can raise
the lactate threshold, thereby delaying a buildup of lactate.<P>
Training to improve physiological capacity is only one
variable-and sometimes not even the most important one-in
streamlining performance in a sport that relies as much on
technology as cycling does. During Armstrong's visits to Colorado
Springs, we have also assessed his pedaling technique, riding
position and bicycle design.<P>
In our biomechanics laboratory Armstrong rode a stationary
bicycle that measured the direction and magnitude of the forces
on the pedals. <A HREF="http://ccwf.cc.utexas.edu/%7Efitprof/public/cycinfopage/cyclingpage.html#anchor42826">Jeffrey P.
Broker</A>, a biomechanics specialist at the center, determined that
Armstrong pedaled almost identically with the left and right leg.
The only flaws identified were minor weaknesses in propulsive
force at the top and bottom of the pedaling cycle. <P>
An analysis of Armstrong's body position proved more
constructive. The wind drag encountered by rider and bicycle
increases as the square of velocity and can dramatically affect
speed. The position of the rider on the bike becomes so critical
that some cyclists have assumed bizarre postures. <A HREF="http://www.roe.ac.uk/rmbwww/Cycling/Pics/obree.jpg">Graeme Obree</A>,
who won the 1995 world championship in the individual pursuit
race and set the one-hour record in 1994, contrived a position in
which his head was pitched far in front of the handlebars. His
arms were completely tucked under his chest, which was resting on
the handlebars. <A HREF="http://www.wsmith.com/velolinq/news/28news.htm">Obree's unconventional riding position</A>, one that
was difficult for other cyclists to master, was banned by the
International Cycling Union because it was unstable and
dangerous.<P>
The U.S. Olympic Committee evaluation team assessed Armstrong's
riding position through videotapes taken during competitions and
at the training center. The footage revealed that Armstrong's
trunk needed to be lower to reduce drag. His relatively wide arm
spacing permitted wind to stall against his upper torso,
requiring more power at any given speed than a flatter, more
streamlined position would. Moreover, his head position allowed
his helmet to project up into the airstream. We suggested he move
his seat forward and up slightly, his handlebars forward and down
and his hands further forward on the "aero" bars-aerodynamic
extensions of the standard drop handlebars. <P>
We also recommended design changes to his helmet, including a
longer, taillike extension in the rear (to keep the wind flowing
in a smooth stream over his head and onto his back). Testing with
power-monitoring equipment showed that Armstrong's new position
resulted in an increase in speed of 1.44 kilometers per hour
relative to his old position. If combined with the various
physiological improvements recommended, Armstrong could cut
nearly four minutes off his 40-kilometer <A HREF="0696kearneybox2.html">race time.</A><P>
No matter how they train, Armstrong and other cyclists in Atlanta
are sure to come equipped with bicycles incorporating the latest
designs. To a great extent, these innovations have come out of
Project '96, a collaboration between the <A HREF="http://www.usacycling.com/uscf/uscf.htm">U.S. Cycling Federation</A>,
the U.S. Olympic Committee and corporate America, with the
mission of combining advanced training and technology to prepare
athletes for the games in Atlanta. <P>
Designers have inspected every square inch of the frame to boost
aerodynamics. They have made the front wheel smaller and narrower
to cut wind resistance and to allow teammates to ride closer to
one another. In addition, by using high-strength composite
materials, they have minimized the amount of structural support
needed. The tubing found on an ordinary bicycle has been replaced
by structural members that taper off from front to back in a
teardrop shape, as does the wing of an airplane.<P>
Examining every aspect of Armstrong's performance has improved
his readiness for the Olympics. His lactate threshold has
increased from 75 to 79 percent. He now practices or competes up
to 40,000 kilometers every year. (This performance contrasts with
the 1,600 kilometers or so he cycled at the age of 15.) Armstrong
has also logged better results in recent races. In 1995 he won
the U.S. <A HREF="http://www.dupont.com/tourdupont/index.html">Tour DuPont</A>, and his training helps to explain why he
scored an astonishing breakaway victory in a 167-kilometer
stretch of the <A HREF="http://www.worldmedia.fr/tour/prev96.htm">Tour de France</A>, from Montpon-Menesterol to
Limoges.<P>
<A HREF="http://www.atlanta.olympic.org/acog/sports/weightlifting/d-weightlifting.html">Weight lifting</A> is at the opposite end of the physiological
spectrum from cycling. Whereas cycling is the longest event in
the Olympics, weight lifting is the shortest. Weight lifters
require extreme muscular strength and power, as opposed to
endurance. The act of lifting a 120- to 250-kilogram barbell
demands up to 3,000 watts of power, enough to illuminate 50
lightbulbs, each 60 watts, for a second. For these events, the
athlete relies on ATP stored in the muscles and the regeneration
of ATP by the breakdown of phosphocreatine. During the long
recovery period in training between each set of five or fewer
lifts, these energy systems replenish themselves aerobically.<P>
<P>
<B><A NAME="Eastern">Eastern European Training</A></B>
<P>
The U.S. has but a slight chance to win a medal in Atlanta,
because the championship eastern European weight-lifting programs
have endured in the newly independent countries that survived the
fracturing of the Soviet bloc. Nevertheless, U.S. athletes have
begun to adopt some of the same training methods embraced by
their competition.<P>
During the past five years, Dragomir Cioroslan, a
Romanian-educated coach who won a bronze medal for that country
in the 1984 Olympics, has taken over as the resident
weight-lifting coach at the U.S. Olympic Training Center.
Cioroslan has instituted a highly structured, year-round program
based on his eastern European training. Tim McRae is one of the
coach's protgs. With his anvillike upper body, McRae might have
been tapped for the National Football League instead of the U.S.
national weight-lifting team if he had not stopped growing at 160
centimeters (five feet three inches). McRae, in fact, took up
weight lifting because he hoped it would make him grow taller and
more competitive in football.<P>
McRae can lift more than twice his body weight, a feat that has
helped make him national champion five times and the U.S. record
holder in three weight classes for the two main competitive
events-the snatch and the clean and jerk. In the snatch, an
athlete grips the bar with hands placed two to three times
shoulder width. He then pulls it to chest level. He squats under
the bar, catching it overhead with straightened arms. Then he
returns to a standing position with the bar above his head. The
clean and jerk proceeds with hands at shoulder width. The athlete
brings the bar to chest level, squatting underneath to secure it
on the shoulders before standing. After a pause, he finishes with
the jerk, a full extension of the arms. An explosive vertical
thrust from the legs aids him in lifting the bar.<P>
McRae's stature-short limbs, long torso and muscular build-suits
him well for weight lifting. For one, his height means that he
need lift the bar only a relatively short distance. Perhaps
McRae's most remarkable physical skill can be seen when he jumps
straight up nearly a meter from a standing position, a
demonstration of the kind of leg power needed in lifting.<P>
Weight lifting is the ideal sport to illustrate another
fundamental concept of modern athletic training. Periodization,
as it is known, is the structured, sequential development of
athletic skill or physiological capacity through organizing
training into blocks of time. The time periods involved range
from an individual lesson to annual cycles. Weight lifters
prepare two to four months for a competition through a
macrocycle, a period that itself includes several shorter
segments called mesocycles.<P>
Cioroslan takes the athletes on the national team through three
to four macrocycles during the year, each leading up to a major
competition. A macrocycle begins with a preparatory phase, a
mesocycle that lasts about eight to 10 weeks. Each week during
this mesocycle, McRae and other athletes will perform 600 lifting
repetitions at 80 to 90 percent of the maximum amount they are
able to lift. The high-volume, medium-intensity workouts elicit
changes in muscle, connective tissue, ligaments and other soft
tissues. These changes enable the athletes to tolerate heavier
lifting in the next training phase.<P>
In the second mesocycle, which lasts another four to five weeks,
the team's training objective is to bolster strength and power by
doing fewer repetitions (200 to 300 per week) but using heavier
weights that require 90 to 100 percent of an athlete's lifting
capacity. The strongest of Cioroslan's athletes might lift more
than three million kilograms a year.<P>
The final mesocycle includes two phases leading up to the event.
During the first phase, the athlete works at maximum intensity to
ensure that the strength and power gains from earlier training
periods translate into competitive performances. The last week or
so of this mesocycle focuses on tapering: the reduction of the
volume and intensity of exercise to allow the athlete to recover
from the stresses of training without losing the benefits of
intensive preparation.<P>
In addition to applying physiological principles to training,
weight lifters, like cyclists, take advantage of an array of
sophisticated monitoring equipment. Weight lifting is one of the
most technically demanding sports, requiring use of a specific
sequence of muscles. If each muscle group, from the knee and hip
extensors to the shoulder and arm muscles, does not activate in
sequence, the lifter may not raise the bar high enough, or else
it may sway precariously back and forth.<P>
Sarah L. Smith, a biomechanical specialist at the Colorado
Springs training center, tested McRae to track the smoothness of
the S-shaped trajectory that the bar must trace from ground to
full extension. The analysis involves two cameras and two
platforms containing sensors that record the forces applied
through each foot. If the load on each foot differs, the lifter
may lose symmetry between his hands-that is, he may raise one
side of the bar faster than the other. Testing showed that
asymmetries in McRae's lifting made it difficult to catch and
stabilize the bar during the snatch, a finding that led to
several refinements in technique.<P>
<P>
<B><A NAME="Choosing">Choosing One's Parents</A></B>
<P>
McRae's ability to lift more than twice his body weight may be a
matter of birthright or his early exposure to the sport-or
perhaps a little of both. Sports scientists often ponder the role
of genes and environment in the makeup of the elite athlete.<P>
The physiologist Per-Olof Astrand coined the often repeated
maxim: to become an Olympic athlete, choose your parents well.
That genetics probably plays at least some role has been
demonstrated by Claude Bouchard, an anthropological geneticist
and exercise physiologist at Laval University in Quebec. In the
1980s Bouchard studied paternal and identical twins. He found
that some pairs of sedentary twins were able to nearly double
their maximum oxygen uptake after 15 to 20 weeks of physical
training, whereas others showed minimal gains in fitness. These
findings suggested a genetic basis for the superior physiology of
top-notch athletes. Bouchard is now looking for genetic markers
that would distinguish between those with a high response to
training and those who adapt less well.<P>
As yet, no elite training programs seek out competitors with
specific "athletic" genes. But they often do the next best thing.
The physical typing of a prospective athlete-the systematic
recruitment of youngsters based on traits under genetic
control-has become a fixture of many national programs,
particularly the now defunct East German sports machine. The
Australians, in fact, have demonstrated that these principles can
be applied in a country that does not exert heavy-handed control
over its citizens' lives. The Australian rowing federation worked
with coaches and sports scientists to develop a profile of women
athletes who had the potential to become world-class rowers.
Qualities such as height, body-fat composition, limb length and
cardiovascular endurance were surveyed. Athletes without these
characteristics are not excluded from consideration, however. The
Australians showed through this program that they could field
international athletes within two years.<P>
If a comparable program existed in the U.S., two women who would
have been targeted are the identical twins Mary and Betsy McCagg.
The McCagg sisters, stalwarts of the <A HREF="http://www.voyageronline.net/usrowing/">U.S. women's rowing team</A>,
are perfectly endowed for their sport. Both are 188 centimeters
(six feet two inches) tall and weigh 79 kilograms (175 pounds).
Both have body-fat compositions lower than that of the average
college-age male (meaning most of that weight is muscle) as well
as long legs that facilitate the execution of a long, powerful
stroke.<P>
The McCaggs also demonstrate that genes are only of value in an
environment that permits development of one's natural physical
assets through training. The family also had a multigenerational
tradition of involvement in the sport. The McCaggs' father and
grandfather-as well as many other family members-rowed
competitively while attending Harvard University and other
eastern establishment colleges. <P>
After finishing their rowing careers in an exceptional high
school program, the sisters attended Radcliffe College, with its
long tradition in women's rowing. Expectations for the twins
remained high from the outset: they joined the Radcliffe varsity
team as freshmen. In their sophomore and junior years, the team
went undefeated. Both sisters made the Olympic team in 1992;
their crew of eight scored a sixth-place finish.<P>
<P>
<B><A NAME="Improving">Improving the Best Rowers</A></B>
<P>
The McCaggs compete in either eight- or two-woman crews for sweep
rowing, in which each crew member pulls one long oar with both
arms. As much as any event, the 2,000-meter distance they
traverse in six to seven minutes requires a balance of athletic
physical capabilities: muscular power combined with a highly
honed aerobic capacity, and an ability to tap into one's
anaerobic pathway for more muscle power.<P>
The McCaggs and the rest of the <A HREF="http://www.mellow.com/mellow/rowing/national.html">national rowing team</A> came to the
training center in Colorado Springs in 1991 for a physiological
and biomechanical assessment to determine why they encountered
difficulties in the last 500 meters of a race. To their coaches,
it appeared that they had failed to develop the requisite
anaerobic capacity-and so were unable to achieve the increase in
rowing power required in a final sprint.<P>
Testing at the training center showed that, in actuality, the
team had attained a level of anaerobic fitness matching that of
the best rowers in the world. What the members lacked was
sufficient aerobic capacity to carry them through the first 1,500
meters of a race without accumulating debilitating levels of
lactate. <P>
Later in 1991 someone with ideas about how to solve the problem
of the anemic finishes arrived in the U.S. That year <A HREF="http://earth.voyageronline.net/usrowing/about.html">Hartmut
Buschbacher</A>, the former coach of the East German women rowers,
took charge of the U.S. national team. Ironically, it was an East
German junior women's team coached by Buschbacher that had beaten
a U.S. team on which the McCaggs had rowed in 1985-an event that
stiffened the sisters' resolve to become more competitive.<P>
Buschbacher soon established a full-time resident athlete program
in Chattanooga, Tenn., with a group of 15 carefully screened
women. His philosophy of coaching borrows extensively from the
systematic training principles for which the East Germans were
known. Buschbacher applied concepts of periodization, alternating
different mixes of volume and intensity of training that helped
to correct the aerobic deficit. <P>
Evidence that Buschbacher's strategy may be helping came last
summer when the McCaggs, racing in a team of eight, won the world
championships in Tampere, Finland.<P>
<P>
<B><A NAME="Mental">The Mental Game of Target Practice</A></B>
<P>
The Olympic events that rely less on brute strength and more on
skill and mental conditioning than any other sport are the
<A HREF="http://www.atlanta.olympic.org/acog/sports/shooting/d-shooting.html">shooting</A> and <A HREF="http://www.atlanta.olympic.org/acog/sports/archery/d-archery.html">archery</A> competitions, in which women can match or
better the performance of men. One female shooter, 27-year-old
Tammy Forster, started down the path to becoming a national and
international champion by watching television. At the age of
four, seeing Olga Korbut's gold-medal-winning gymnastic feats
made Forster vow to go to the Olympics. The opportunity to become
an Olympic athlete presented itself in Forster's backyard, where
her father, an expert rifleman and an occasional entrant in
shooting contests, showed each family member how to use and take
care of guns. Parental involvement in shaping the young athlete,
a theme in the McCaggs' career, also encouraged Forster. Once her
commitment became clear, her father decided to take classes in
how to train shooters-and he now serves as one of her coaches.<P>
By the time Forster was 15, she was training for 90 minutes a day
with an air rifle or an unloaded small-bore (.22 caliber) rifle
indoors. She is a testament to the benefits of perseverance,
showing that intensive training can in some sports make up for a
lack of innate ability. Not a natural talent, Forster observed
her sister shoot equally well while spending only a quarter of
the time in practice. Forster nonetheless stayed with it. By 1985
she had won a silver medal at the junior national competition,
and she chose to go to West Virginia University to train with Ed
Etzel, an Olympic gold medalist in 1984.<P>
In 1991 Forster took up residency at the Colorado Springs
training center. Her stay has allowed her to devote full time to
training for the 10-meter air-rifle contest and the
three-position shooting event. The latter contest requires firing
a small-bore rifle (one shooting a small-diameter bullet) at
targets 50 meters away while lying, kneeling and standing. She
has especially labored on the mental-rehearsal techniques she
needs in order to muster the focused concentration essential to
excelling in this event. Her efforts have improved her skills,
although she fell short of winning one of the two open spots on
the women's Olympic shooting team in the 10- and 50-meter events.
Forster's training, however, provides an illustration of the
benefits psychology brings to sports.<P>
The roots of the sports psychology field that are the basis for
Forster's skills extend back almost a century, when Norman
Triplett discovered that athletes performed better when competing
against one another than when competing against the clock. Sports
psychology began to gain a broad appeal in the 1970s, when the
profession started applying a set of cognitive and behavioral
techniques to athletic training. At that time, new research
showed that mental practice alone could improve motor
performance.<P>
As elements of her rehearsal training, she combines a number of
techniques-among them, muscle relaxation exercises, mental
visualization of a performance, and recording of her
accomplishments and day-to-day emotions in a journal. She also
sets out a series of realistic objectives that she can accomplish
during each practice.<P>
Relaxation exercises allow the shooter to heighten concentration
and to recognize sources of muscle tension in the shoulders and
back that can affect the accuracy of a shot. During
visualization, Forster may picture herself aiming and shooting;
at other times, she sees herself as a bystander watching the
event from the sidelines. The more active imagery, when she
actually imagines holding the rifle, seems to yield more of a
performance gain.<P>
Forster repeats a visualization routine before each shot she
takes in competition. In her mind, she moves slowly through each
step, from standing on the firing line to bringing the rifle into
position to firing an actual shot. She goes through this mental
exercise before each of the 60 shots in the three-position
competition. Invoking this state of focused calm before each
shot, a shooter may spend up to two and a half hours in
preparation and firing, the time limit for a shooting event. The winner, who is gauged on accuracy, not
speed, will hit the bull's-eye with more than 90 percent of the
shots made in the two events.<P>
Forster has also worked directly with U.S. Olympic sports
psychologist Sean McCann to allay the perfectionism that has
sometimes caused her to lose confidence in the accuracy of her
aim. To assess her technique, she shot a rifle equipped with an
infrared laser. An analysis of the placement of the beam on the
target showed that her aim was nearly flawless. But she
continually tried to make adjustments, and so her ability to
remain steadily fixed on the target deteriorated after five or
six seconds.<P>
McCann helped Forster develop visualization routines that
included a series of verbal cues to quell these fears-the
repeating of simple words like "relax" or "ready." Persistence
has yielded some payoffs. During her residency, Forster has won
two world cups, and last year she placed second at the national
championships-a testament to the accomplishments that accrue from
the slow, deliberate pace that characterizes this most cerebral
of sporting events.<P>
The combination of physical and mental training employed by the
rower or shooter applies across the full range of the 29 Olympic
sports, from swimming to baseball. Sports science and technology
have contributed to a trend in which world records in all sports
keep falling. Winning times for horses in the Kentucky Derby have
declined at a slower rate than records in the one-mile run have.
It is certain, moreover, that the Olympic Games in Atlanta this
summer will once again challenge the limits of human performance.<P>

<H2>Science in the Sky</H2>
<H3>The International Space Station will be the most expensive object 
ever built. Although many scientists oppose the grandiose scheme, 
its political momentum now appears unstoppable
</H3>
by Tim Beardsley, <I>staff writer</I></CENTER>
<P>
It's about life on Earth!" gushes an advertising slogan for
the <A HREF="http://issa-www.jsc.nasa.gov/">International Space Station</A>, the $27-billion orbiting
laboratory now taking shape at a <A HREF="http://www.boeing.com/dsg.station.html">Boeing plant</A> in Huntsville,
Ala., at the Khrunichev works in Moscow and at other locations
around the globe. Truer words were probably never spoken about
the 400-ton space behemoth, which after 12 years of redesigns,
reviews and cliff-hanging votes, seems finally to have reached
political escape velocity.<P>
The space station's brightening prospects have less to do with
its scientific potential than with terrestrial politics. Space
station boosters have for years claimed that research in orbit
will generate huge scientific and commercial rewards. But the
scientific returns from more than a decade of experiments in
weightless conditions on space shuttle flights, while sometimes
intriguing, have not generated fundamental insights. Scientific
panels, such as the National Research Council's space studies
board, have warned that although some interesting research will
be possible on the station, the expected returns cannot justify
the facility's overall cost. <P>
Commercial interest, too, is cool, even though the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration has provided substantial
incentives for businesses to conduct research and to manufacture
high-tech products in space. To date, no large companies are
planning major research or manufacturing efforts on the space
station. <A HREF="http://phserver.rpi.edu/dept/chem/rpichem/faculty/research/Ferris.html">James Ferris of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute</A> insists
that "nothing has come out of microgravity research to convince
me that a material can be fabricated in orbit that is going to be
better than what you can make on Earth." <P>
<A HREF="http://www.gsfc.nasa.gov/hqpao/bios/dan_goldin.html">Daniel S. Goldin</A>, NASA's administrator, tacitly acknowledges such
criticisms in stating the agency's rationale for the project.
Science and commerce are not the reason for building the space
station after all. "The space station is being built to see how
people can live and work safely and efficiently in space," Goldin
intones. "We can do stunning science," he adds as an
afterthought, in fields ranging from biotechnology to materials
processing, but "that isn't the justification." <P>
Why exactly the world needs to learn how people can live and work
in space is a question Goldin glosses over. Nevertheless,
ministers in Europe and Russia have been cajoled and bullied into
promising funds to support their share of the station, lured by
the prospect of providing jobs for defense-industry workers and
cementing peaceful ties between former geopolitical rivals. The
U.S. House of Representatives, which three years ago came within
one vote of canceling the project, has approved spending $2.1
billion a year to complete it by June 2002. <P>
Many researchers fear that the station is draining funds from
science at a time when research budgets are everywhere in
decline, <A HREF="http://spacelink.msfc.nasa.gov/NASA.Overview/NASA.Budget.Request.FY.1997/Administrators.FY97.Budget.Statement">even at NASA</A>. NASA quotes a price tag of $17.4 billion. A further $9
billion-plus will be contributed by international partners,
excluding Russia's share. But shuttle launches to build the
station and keep it supplied will amount to an additional $19.6
billion until 2002 and $46 billion thereafter, according to the
General Accounting Office (GAO). <P>
All told, the GAO's numbers make it clear that the station will
soak up more than $100 billion over its lifetime (which is
designed to be 10 years). Even so, there are no spares for the
major station components. If one were lost in an accident or if
(for example) an increasingly nationalistic Russia fell out of
the coalition, costs would soar still further, and the schedule
would be pushed back by years. NASA's 1995 research and
development outlay of $9.5 billion, bloated by the space station,
represents almost 40 percent of the nation's total nonhealth,
nonmilitary research and development. "I am concerned that the
space station may represent an excessive allocation, which is one
reason why we need to think about the sources of the nation's
R&AMPD funding," states <A HREF="http://uss-enterprise.bu.edu/busefl/investig/lanzerotti.html">Louis J. Lanzerotti</A>, a physicist at
AT&AMPT Bell Laboratories and a former chairman of the space
studies board. <P>
Barring a last-minute change of heart on Capitol Hill or a
technical showstopper, the space station's first component, the
Russian-built propulsion module, should be launched on a Proton
rocket from <A HREF="http://www.aia.lu/Down_Link/baikonur_nf.html">Baikonur Cosmodrome</A> in Kazakhstan in November
1997. When in 1984 President Ronald Reagan invited allies of the
U.S. to participate in building an orbital laboratory, a Russian
launching would have been unthinkable. The cold war was still
icy, and as far as Moscow was concerned, containment rather than
collaboration was the objective. <P>
But in 1986 the <A HREF="http://www.fas.org/spp/51L.html">Challenger disaster</A> forced a radical rethinking
of the station's design, and the $8-billion sticker price was
soon spiraling upward. After Reagan named the project Space
Station Freedom in 1988, the design started changing each year as
Congress called for cost reductions. By 1993 the program had
consumed $11.2 billion, with nothing launched. <P>
The incoming Clinton administration gave the space station a hard
look, redesigned it yet again and decided to save money and make
Russia a strategic ally by giving it a central role. Russian
rockets have a good safety record, and the country has a decade
of experience with its <A HREF="http://www.reston.com/astro/space.station/mir.html">Mir space station</A>. The current plan, which
was briefly known as Alpha but is now simply the International
Space Station, calls for Russia to build three of the first four
modules, including the all-important propulsion module. This
unit, which the U.S. is buying from Russia, will keep the station
on its trajectory 248 miles above Earth. <P>
The unilateral U.S. initiative to bring Russia into the charmed
circle caused consternation in Europe. But after some intense
politicking, European ministers voted last October to go along
with the new plan. Europe will supply its own experimental
module, and negotiations are under way with the U.S. about a
collaboration on an emergency crew return vehicle. Canada is
providing a robotic manipulator arm like that used on the
shuttle, and <A HREF="http://www.nasda.go.jp/environment/Contribution_e.html">Japan will build an experimental module.</A> <P>
<P><A NAME="a"><B>An Architect's Nightmare</B></A><P>
<P>
The space station might be a masterpiece of functional design,
but it looks like an architect's nightmare. Sprouting from the
propulsion module will be a Russian wing with its own laboratory
module, living quarters, docking compartment and power system;
the U.S. laboratory and habitation modules; a truss bearing 16
solar panels and the robotic arm; and Japanese and European
laboratory modules. The whole ungainly hybrid, which on the
ground would cover 14 tennis courts, will be assembled over five
years and after 44 launches of U.S. space shuttles and European,
Japanese and Russian rockets. On completion, the complex will
support a crew of six, who will enjoy a pressurized volume
equivalent to the passenger compartments of two jumbo jets. <P>
A single primary contractor, Boeing, is responsible for the U.S.
share, with <A HREF="http://www.rdyne.rockwell.com/power/power.html">Rocketdyne</A> and <A HREF="http://www.ksc.nasa.gov/mdss/stationproc.html">McDonnell Douglas</A> as subcontractors.
In March the U.S. laboratory and habitat modules, aluminum
cylinders 28 feet long and 14.5 feet across, were being machined
and outfitted in Boeing's assembly buildings at the NASA <A HREF="http://www.msfc.nasa.gov/pao.general.html">Marshall
Space Flight Center</A> in Huntsville. Laser measuring devices were
checking that the connecting surfaces that will mate the modules
to adjacent units are accurately machined to within two
hundredths of an inch. The accuracy is essential to minimize air
leaks. Many space station supplies, including air to breathe,
will be carried into orbit on shuttle flights, which cost $10,000
to $20,000 per pound of payload delivered. <P>
NASA officials say collaborative relations with their foreign
counterparts are generally good. But several of the teams
planning station research facilities acknowledge special
difficulties working with the Russians, who are not yet fully
participating in joint science planning for the station. Russian
health research has not impressed NASA's investigators, who say
it lacks statistical rigor. Some on the U.S. side complain that
the shortage of funds for science in Russia leads that country's
investigators to look continually for financial arrangements that
minimize Russia's outlays. U.S. shuttle flights to Mir are paving
the way to better scientific working relations. <P>
Nevertheless, late last year top Russian space officials startled
NASA by proposing a plan to scale back their participation,
suggesting that the international partners instead modify the
existing Mir station for the next few years. NASA quickly
squelched that plan, but the panic it triggered gave the Russians
leverage to renegotiate the complex agreement it has with its
space station partners. NASA had previously agreed to launch
several shuttle flights to supply Mir. Russia now demanded, and
got, an extra flight. <P>
Then this spring saw a reshuffling of the assembly sequence that
will delay orbiting of the Japanese module and a centrifuge unit
by several months. The European module will now not be flown
until 2003, after the nominal assembly-complete date. "We will
have to be flexible," says <A HREF="http://www.gsfc.nasa.gov/hqpao/bios/trafton.txt">Wilbur C. Trafton</A>, NASA's director of
space flight. <P>
Even though last year's scare was contained, Russian industry
sources have since indicated to NASA officials that Russian
government funding for the third element of the station, known as
the service module, has been held up. NASA has now "received
assurances from the Russians that the project will be fully
funded," Trafton declares. But anxiety over Russia's reliability
is palpable. In March, Vice President Al Gore sent a strongly
worded letter to Russian prime minister Viktor Chernomyrdin
warning that if Russia failed to provide full funding for its
part of the station, opponents of the project in Congress might
yet decide to end the partnership; Gore and Chernomydrin are
supposed to <A HREF="http://www2.whitehouse.gov/WH/EOP/OVP/html/Foreign-Cherno.html">safeguard the project</A>. <P>
<P> <A NAME="b"><B>Vibrations and Vapors</B></A> <P>
<P>
The station will probably survive this latest political flap. But
many scientists remain dubious about the venture. The planned
racks of research equipment, which will be launched after the
laboratory modules and then installed in orbit, are now in
various stages of design. Expert groups are providing advice on
the facilities that will be needed to attract investigators. Yet
the long lead time required to design and qualify apparatus for
flight-up to seven years-limits the enthusiasm of scientists
anxious to stay at the forefront of their fields. <P>
Planning of the research facilities is disrupted every time the
station assembly schedule is altered, because apparatus delivered
on one flight might be useless without an item assigned to a
different launch slot. And there are still unanswered questions
about how much time the space station crew will have for research
and about the amount of vibration during the five-year assembly
period. <P>
Originally, the station was advertised in part as a platform for
remote sensing of Earth. NASA still boasts that the station's
orbit, which sweeps over more of Earth's surface than Freedom's
would have done, "provides excellent Earth observation." Yet
there are currently no plans to study the terrestrial surface
from the station: crew movements mean it will be too jittery for
precise measurements. And a cloud of gases that will be vented
from the station and will follow it in orbit makes it a poor
platform for studying the space environment. <P>
Instead the emphasis has switched to studying the <A HREF="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/Noordung/noord28.html">effects of
weightlessness</A> on humans and on physical and biological
processes- goals that are described in a series of
optimistic <A HREF="http://issa-www.jsc.nasa.gov/ss/prgview/sswp2.html">background papers</A>. Trafton says he is building "a world-class laboratory"
to explore <A HREF="http://microgravity.msad.hq.nasa.gov/">microgravity</A>. (Even in the absence of vibrations,
zero-gravity conditions in orbit can be approached only at a
"sweet spot" that is the station's center of mass; other
locations have levels that are measured in units of millionths of
Earth-gravity, hence the term "microgravity.") <P>
A special fund of $2.6 billion has been set aside to support
space station research. "Microgravity research...will lay the
foundation for important advances in medicine, food, safety,
shelter, communications, transportation and environment," a
Boeing brochure advises. "The program will create tens of
thousands of high-technology U.S. jobs directly, and thousands
more in spin-off fields, thereby improving America's competitive
posture." <P>
In the 1980s NASA drummed up support for the station as well as
the shuttle by touting the opportunities for commercial materials
processing. The phenomenon that was seen as most promising for
exploitation was crystal growth, which occurs more slowly in
microgravity because convection currents are greatly reduced
(see a <A HREF="http://samson2.msfc.nasa.gov/scirev/delucas.html">technical assessment</A> of research progress). As
a consequence, crystals of some materials, notably proteins, form
more perfectly in space than they do on Earth- indeed, NASA has an entire
<A HREF="http://es91-server1.msfc.nasa.gov/ssl/msad/pcg/">protein crystal home page</A>. When probed by
x-rays, crystals therefore yield better data about their composition,
which could make it easier to design drugs that work by targeting
the protein in the body. In addition, interest focused on the
observation that liquids in microgravity are strongly affected by
forces such as surface tension, which suggested possible
advantages for separating mixtures of materials. Microgravity
also seemed to offer benefits for creating extremely thin
coatings of polymers or semiconductors. <P>
For the past decade, NASA has provided funds for the <A HREF="http://nctn.oact.hq.nasa.gov/STI/Innovation22/CCDSPhaseOut.html">Centers for
the Commercial Development of Space</A>, research units dotted
around the country that help companies develop projects to fly on
the shuttle. Originally intended to be self-supporting after five
years, the centers are still being bankrolled by NASA to the tune
of about $15 million a year. NASA also provides launch space
gratis, which has induced many adventurous companies to conduct
experiments. NASA hopes they will eventually be prepared to pay
full costs and make use of the larger facilities available on the
space station, where experiments can continue for longer than the
two weeks' duration of a shuttle flight. <P>
But NASA's commercial centers have come under fire because the
experiments they fly are not reviewed by disinterested experts.
<A HREF="http://info.phys.cmu.edu/faculty/sekerka/sekerka.html">Robert F. Sekerka</A> of Carnegie Mellon University, who chaired a
study of microgravity research for the National Research Council,
says that as long as an experiment is being given a ride into
space at public expense it should be subject to independent
scrutiny. <P>
<A HREF="http://www.bmg.uab.edu/2nd_fac/delucas/delucas.html">Lawrence J. DeLucas</A>, who runs a commercial center at the
University of Alabama at Birmingham that specializes in growing
protein crystals in microgravity, counters that the commercial
centers impose their own business discipline. "We have made
samples for lots of companies," DeLucas states. "We help them
design the drug. In return, they give us a share of the
royalties," he explains. So far, though, the greater part of the
receipts has been "in-kind contributions"-which include the value
of the company's samples. <P>
<P> <A NAME="c"><B>Skepticism over Costs</B></A> <P>
<P>
There seems to be little disagreement that NASA has improved the
quality of its science programs over the past decade. "All of
NASA's research fields have used rigorous peer review for quite a
while," remarks John-David F. Bartoe, chief station research
manager. Skepticism about research on the space station focuses
on whether the returns can possibly be worth the extraordinary
expense. <P>
<A HREF="http://www.bmb.psu.edu/deptpage/farber.htm">Gregory K. Farber</A> of Pennsylvania State University, who studies
protein crystals grown on Earth, acknowledges that some complex
space-grown crystals are bigger or produce better x-ray data than
their terrestrial counterparts do. But dozens of tests must be
made to discover the best conditions for growing each crystal,
Farber points out, so a specimen represents an investment in the
region of $1 million. "What would you have achieved if you had
spent that money to improve crystal growth on Earth?" he demands.
And Eric Cross, a materials researcher at Penn State, points out
that "success in growing simple crystals on Earth has been
staggering." <P>
The budget-blowing cost of sending anything into orbit has
largely extinguished enthusiasm for space-based manufacturing.
Indeed, some big corporations that were at one time interested
have given up on the idea. The 3M company, reputedly one of the
most imaginative of materials firms, was for a time excited about
making thin films and polymers in microgravity but abandoned its
efforts several years ago. <P>
One beam of hope for space manufacturing appeared to be
<A HREF="http://www.schering-pl.it/servizi">Schering-Plough Corporation</A>, which makes alpha-interferon, a
protein used to treat hepatitis and other disorders. A 1996 paper
by Paul Reichert and Tattanahalli L. Nagabhushan of
Schering-Plough Research Institute and others describes how a
microcrystalline form of interferon made on a space shuttle
flight stayed in the bloodstream of monkeys several hours longer
than the interferon solution now in use, a possible therapeutic
advantage. Four flasks of the preparation could meet the
$750-million annual demand for the drug, DeLucas notes. <P>
But Nagabhushan, who is Schering-Plough's senior vice president
for biotechnology, maintains he has no plans to do further
research on microcrystalline interferon on the space station.
The space-grown crystals "were not different enough to jump up
and down" about, he says, adding that he knows of nobody else in
the pharmaceutical industry who is planning to make drugs in
space. <P>
Another commercial space idea is molecular-beam epitaxy, a
technique for producing thin, single-crystal layers of materials
such as semiconductors. The method has been investigated for the
past decade by the <A HREF="http://www.svec.uh.edu/svec.html">Space Vacuum Epitaxy Center</A>, one of NASA's
commercial centers, based at the University of Houston. This
notion depends on the high vacuum that exists in the wake of an
orbiting satellite, rather than on microgravity. A recent shuttle
flight demonstrated that pure semiconductor layers can be made in
orbit behind a special shield. <P>
Yet no facility for orbital molecular-beam epitaxy could operate
within 50 miles of the space station because of its surrounding
gas cloud, and the Houston center has so far not persuaded any
business to fund epitaxy research in space. The National Research
Council's space studies board, in an unusually blunt assessment,
concluded last year that it "discards the idea that epitaxial
layers will be manufactured in space." <P>
Even when research in orbit identifies a novel phenomenon,
commercial interest is not assured. <A HREF="http://esmmac8.esm.psu.edu/HTMLs/Faculty/RGerman.html">Randall M. German</A>, another
materials researcher at Penn State, says his studies of
liquid-phase sintering of tungsten-based alloys on the shuttle
produced startling findings that have initiated an unexpected
line of inquiry. But German is not convinced that the space
station will offer him research opportunities that the shuttle
cannot, and he foresees no commercial interest "in the short
term." <P>
<P> <A NAME="d"><B>Fizzy Drinks</B></A> <P>
<P>
The only commercial enterprises still talking about making things
in orbit are bit players. Krist Jani of Paragon Vision Sciences
in Arizona professes to be enthusiastic about making better
<A HREF="http://mohawk.larc.nasa.gov/gppm.html">permeable contact lenses</A> in space. As of April, Paragon had
flown only two experiments on the shuttle-one of which did not
work-so manufacturing is still some way off. Coca-Cola has
conducted experiments on how to dispense fizzy drinks in orbit.
Yet a Coca-Cola consultant who gave a presentation to NASA
earlier this year frankly admitted that the company's effort is
driven by the publicity value. <P>
If space-based manufacturing is a bust, some research-oriented
companies remain optimistic about microgravity studies that might
show them how to make things better on terra firma. By probing
space-grown insulin crystals with x-rays, G. David Smith of the
Hauptman-Woodward Medical Research Institute in Buffalo, N.Y.,
has created images with unprecedented resolution of complexes
formed between insulin and a possible drug for diabetics. The
images could guide chemists attempting to devise better drugs.
Howmet, a company in Michigan, wants to study how liquid metals
flow in microgravity, in the hope of refining its computer models
of casting. <P>
Daniel C. Carter, a NASA protein crystal scientist at the
Marshall Space Flight Center, is assisting several companies to
grow crystals of medically important proteins in orbit. The list
includes an enzyme from the AIDS virus crystallized with a drug,
a protein produced by an oncogene and a blood-clotting protein.
At least 38 percent of proteins crystallize more successfully in
microgravity, he maintains, and with more sophisticated
temperature-controlled apparatus recently available the
proportion is approaching 100 percent. <P>
Studies of combustion are another important part of the research
scheduled for the station. Materials burn completely differently
in microgravity because of the lack of convection currents: a
candle flame <A HREF="http://samson2.msfc.nasa.gov/scirev/ross.html">in near zero-g</A>, for example, is spherical and quickly extinguishes
itself. If basic studies of combustion showed how to increase the
efficiency of automobiles or power plants, notes NASA's <A HREF="http://samson2.msfc.nasa.gov/scirev/rhome.html">Robert
Rhome</A>, the economic consequences could be vast. For the time
being, though, it is mainly NASA that is interested in the
practical applications, which bear on safety in spacecraft. <P>
The number of phenomena that might be studied in microgravity is
huge, but Cross notes that within the space station it will be
impossible to reach temperatures as low as those that can
routinely be achieved on Earth. Nor will it be possible to make
such high vacuums. <P>
Tremors caused by equipment and the crew on the space station
will further limit opportunities for a lot of precise research,
Cross asserts, despite NASA's efforts to design
vibration-resisting equipment. Cross, who has designed space
hardware and flown an orbital experiment, says materials research
opportunities on the station impress him "not one bit." Critics
argue that robotic spacecraft custom-built for specific purposes
could investigate the surprising behavior of liquids in the near
absence of gravity, as well as some of the biological effects,
for far less than the cost of the space station. <P>
Biology has increasingly become the focus of those who hope to
exploit the space station's scientific promise. Results from
shuttle experiments indicate that microgravity has significant
effects on the development of plants and animals. Cells grow
differently in culture, and there are indications it may be
easier to grow human tissues. Plants lay down less of an
important structural material called lignin, and one result
suggests bacteria divide 50 percent faster in microgravity, which
would be "astounding if true," comments Maurice M. Averner, a
microbiologist with NASA. <P>
<P> <A NAME="e"><B>Studying Life in Space</B></A> <P>
<P>
Results so far are sparse, because experimenting with animals and
plants demands a lot of an astronaut's time. Joan Vernikos,
NASA's life science head, says the superior facilities planned on
the space station will allow researchers to repeat and modify
biology experiments far more easily than they can on the shuttle.
Moreover, a centrifuge that can spin animal cages will enable
researchers to study for the first time the effects of different
gravity levels on developing organisms. (The centrifuge is a
divisive issue on the space station, because it will produce
vibrations.) <P>
The strongest new emphasis in space station science, however, is
human health. The human frame is affected by the absence of
gravity in ways more serious than might be supposed from watching
the fun and games broadcast from the shuttle. Bones lose calcium,
muscles atrophy and immunity may diminish. Health research on
station astronauts will be conducted in a special facility
boasting instruments to weigh people (not trivial without
gravity), to measure their muscle strength and to analyze their
blood and expired gases, among other vital signs. <P>
But the value of biological and health research in orbit has been
challenged by Elliott C. Levinthal, a former program director of
the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency who worked on the
Viking robotic missions to Mars. Levinthal, who has been a
professor of genetics and mechanical engineering at Stanford
University, asserts that no neutral committee handing out funds
for basic research in biology would support microgravity
studies. Levinthal argues that giving priority to such
investigations would make sense only if the space station is
being built to prepare for some other long-duration mission. <P>
NASA's answer is that humans will one day want to go to Mars.
Levinthal insists, however, that building the space station is
premature even if people will eventually visit the red planet.
Long before astronauts could make such a perilous journey-which
would cost far more than the space station-robotic craft should
first explore the planet in detail and return samples from its
surface, Levinthal contends. That exploration might take
decades. <P>
Levinthal is also doubtful about the space station's supposed
purpose of keeping Russian technologists in peaceful employment.
That country's scientists would actually rather spend research
rubles on more down-to-earth work, he suggests: the U.S. could
keep Russian scientific unemployment lines short for far less
than the cost of the space station by simply sending money for
science. Levinthal recognizes that Russian politicians are
caught in the same bind as those in the U.S.; they are wedded to
human space flight as a symbol of technological prestige, and
they fear the wrath in the polling booth of unemployed former
defense workers. Levinthal nonetheless concludes that the space
station is "essentially purposeless." <P>
The choice for scientists, it appears, is whether or not to make
use of a one-of-a-kind microgravity laboratory that is going to
be built with or without their approval. And as long as there are
research grants, investigators will probably find something to do
in the high-priced facility. "The reason the space station got
into trouble in the first place is that we kept debating it,"
NASA chief Goldin says. "It is no longer a debatable issue. We
are saying no to redesign and no to changes. We are going to
build the space station."

Richard Weindruch rightfully points out that mouse data showing how a restricted diet increases longevity cannot be extended to humans at this time [see "Caloric Restriction and Aging," January]. But if the extrapolation is valid, look out, Social Security trust fund. If aging baby boomers like myself decide to embrace a spartan lifestyle, we'll be around until the year 2060.

Weindruch omitted any reference to work that examined the effect of the compound deprenyl [used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease] on the longevity of male rats. These studies showed an increase in both the average life span and the maximum life span of these rodents. In other words, pharmaceutical intervention can also slow aging in mammals.

The concern raised by Cornell is unwarranted: caloric restriction influences not only the length of life but also the quality of life. If vast numbers of baby boomers turn to caloric restriction, a new society would likely emerge in which energetic 85-year-olds change careers and Social Security would have to be entirely restructured. A Hungarian researcher, Jozsef Knoll, did report greatly extended average and maximum lifetimes in rats given deprenyl. Unfortunately, subsequent studies of the drug have found either a very mild increase in maximum life span or no effect at all. In contrast, caloric restriction extends maximum life span in a repeatable fashion worldwide.

In "Resisting Resistance" [Science and the Citizen, January], Tim Beardsley states that "the attention being focused on infectious disease indicates that a turning point may...be in sight in one of humankind's oldest struggles." Absent from the solutions discussed-including new infectious disease laboratories, more intense surveillance and investigation, more prudent use of antibiotics and development of new drugs-is one major preventative component: hand washing. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, "Hand washing is the single most important means of preventing the spread of infection."

<B>MIXED REVIEWS</B>
<P>
<P>
Thomas E. Lovejoy, who reviewed my book A Moment on the Earth ["Rethinking Green Thoughts," Reviews and Commentaries, February], is a prominent proponent of the bleak environmental outlook the book contests. Thus, Lovejoy has a professional self-interest in denying the book's validity: his work was criticized in the book, a point only obliquely disclosed to readers. Lovejoy's enmity is indicated by several inaccurate statements. He writes that I extol the recovery of the bald eagle "while ignoring its previous downward trend." Yet my chapter on species begins by noting that DDT and logging caused the decline of the southern bald eagle. Lovejoy says I do not credit Rachel Carson for inspiring environmental reforms. But on page 82, I write, "Society heeded Carson's warnings, enacted the necessary reforms...and realized such a prompt environmental gain that the day of reckoning Carson foresaw never arrived. This shows that environmental reform works."
<P>
Lovejoy accuses me of "innumerable errors" yet cites only two. One is a single-word copyediting glitch, and the other, according to Lovejoy, is an "absurd assertion, building from a misunderstanding of evolutionary biologist Lynn Margulis's work...that cooperation is dominant in nature." In fact, I present this notion as speculation: surely a reviewer for a science publication ought to be able to make the distinction between assertion and speculation. And good or bad, it's hard to believe my characterization of Margulis's work is "absurd," as Margulis herself read the book at the galley stage.
<P>
Of course, hostile reviews are an occupational hazard for writers. Yet Lovejoy's resort to false claims suggests that he seeks to divert attention from the book's central contention: namely, that most Western environmental trends are improving. The optimism I propose may be right or wrong, but the debate on it will not go forward if magazines such as Scientific American hand the concept over to those with a dull ax to grind.

Lovejoy replies:
<P>
I can understand why Easterbrook would not like my review, but I nonetheless believe it is objective and dispassionate. The review does highlight his main conclusions-positive environmental trends in some industrial nations and the neglect of clean air and water issues in developing countries. The book, in fact, contains little mention of my work (which is mostly about tropical forests and soaring extinction rates) and is critical of it in only one instance. My main lament is that his book, which has some really important points to make, does not make them better. For example, to equate cooperation with Lynn Margulis's work on symbiosis is simply an error.

<B>STRING THEORY</B>

In quoting Pierre M. Ramond, Madhusree Mukerjee ["Explaining Everything," January] deprived him of a superb simile. She has Ramond saying about string theory research, "It's as if you are wandering in the valley of a king, push aside a rock and find an enchanted staircase." Surely what was intended was "wandering in the Valley of the Kings," a reference to the sarcophagal region of Egypt that grudgingly yields its hermetic secrets.

<CENTER><H2>Right to Die</H2></CENTER>
<CENTER>Ethicists debate whether advanced directives have furthered<BR>the cause of death with dignity</CENTER>
<P>
When the U.S. Congress passed the Patient Self-Determination Act in 1990, many ethicists hailed it as an important step in the right of patients to choose how they are treated-and how they die. The possibility that the act might reduce health care costs by cutting down on futile and unwanted treatments was seen as an added bonus. It has been estimated that almost 40 percent of all deaths in the U.S. take place following the withdrawal of life-sustaining treatments-often from a sedated or comatose patient and after protracted, agonizing indecision on the part of family members and physicians.
<P>
The <A HREF="http://ccme-mac4.bsd.uchicago.edu/CCMEPolicies/Laws/PSDA/">Patient Self-Determination Act</A> was designed to reduce this indecision by giving patients more control over their destiny. It requires hospitals to inform patients and their families-upon a person's admission to the hospital-of their legal right to refuse various life-sustaining technologies and procedures through what are called advanced directives. The two most common advanced directives are living wills, in which individuals specify their choices concerning life-sustaining treatment, and documents authorizing a spouse, relative or other proxy to make such decisions, in the event that an individual becomes mentally incapacitated.
<P>
So far the act and advanced directives have not had the impact that proponents had hoped for. Only 10 to 20 percent of American adults, at most, have signed an advanced directive. Moreover, as a number of recent court decisions illustrate, conflicts and misunderstandings still arise between patients, relatives and health care providers over the proper treatment of critically ill patients.
<P>
Although some right-to-die advocates say that advanced directives can still fulfill their promise, others have their doubts. Arthur L. Caplan, director of the <A HREF="http://www.med.upenn.edu/%7Ebioethic/genetics.html">Center for Bioethics</A> at the University of Pennsylvania, predicted in 1990 that advanced directives and the Patient Self-Determination Act- and the notion of "patient empowerment" from which they stem-would prove to be a failure. Unfortunately, he says, recent events have proved him right.
<P>
The "nail in the coffin," Caplan notes, is a paper published last November in the <I><A HREF="http://www.ama-assn.org/register/welcome.htm">Journal of the American Medical Association</A></I>. The article presented the results of an experiment called SUPPORT, for Study to Understand Prognoses and Preferences for Outcomes and Risks of Treatments. The four-year study, which involved more than 9,000 patients at five hospitals, had two phases.
<P>
The initial, two-year phase of the study revealed "substantial shortcomings in care for seriously ill hospitalized adults." More often than not, patients died in pain, their desires concerning treatment neglected, after spending 10 days or more in an intensive care unit. Less than half of the physicians whose patients had signed orders forbidding cardiopulmonary resuscitation were aware of that fact. During the second phase of the study, each patient was assigned a nurse who had been trained to facilitate communication between patients, their families and physicians in order to make the patients' care more comfortable and dignified. The intervention failed dismally; the 2,652 patients who received this special attention fared no better, statistically speaking, than those in the control group or those in the previous phase of the investigation.
<P>
But given that doctors are the supreme authorities in hospitals, says Nancy Dubler, an attorney who heads an ethics committee at the Montefiore Medical Center in Bronx, N.Y., it was inevitable that the nurse-based intervention method employed by the study would fail. She insists that her own experience has shown that advanced directives can work-and particularly those that appoint a proxy, who can provide more guidance in a complex situation than can a "rigid" living will.
<P>
"I definitely feel advanced directives are useful," concurs Andrew Broder, an attorney specializing in right-to-die cases. Broder recently served as the lawyer for a Michigan woman, Mary Martin, who wanted to have a feeding tube removed from her husband, Michael Martin, who had suffered severe brain damage in an accident in 1987. Michael Martin's mother and sister opposed the removal of the life-sustaining treatment. Michigan courts turned down Mary Martin's request, and in February the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear her appeal. An advanced directive "might have made the difference" in the Martin case, Broder says.
<P>
Some ethicists fear that the problems revealed by SUPPORT will spur more calls for physician-assisted suicide, the legal status of which has been boosted by two recent decisions. In March a jury ruled that Jack Kevorkian, a retired physician who has admitted helping 27 patients end their lives, had not violated Michigan state law. (Kevorkian still faces another trial on similar charges.) That same week, a federal court of appeals struck down a Washington State law prohibiting euthanasia. Oregon has already passed a law permitting assisted suicide (although it has not come into effect), and eight other states are considering similar legislation.
<P>
"I see suicide as a symptom of the problem, not a solution to the problem," says Joseph J. Fins, a physician and director of medical ethics at New York Hospital. The lesson of SUPPORT, he says, is that doctors must learn to view palliative care-which focuses on the relief of suffering rather than on curing disease-as an important part of their job. Many physicians, Fins elaborates, need to become more aware of developments in the treatment of pain, such as alternatives to morphine that do not cause constipation, nausea, grogginess or other unpleasant side effects. If doctors take these steps, Fins contends, horror stories about terminally ill patients being subjected to unwanted treatment should diminish, and so should calls for assisted suicide.
<P>
Officials from Choice in Dying-a New York City-based group that created the first living wills almost 30 years ago (but does not advocate assisted suicide)-believe the problems identified by SUPPORT can be rectified through more regulation, litigation and education. According to executive director Karen O. Kaplan, Choice in Dying plans to further its cause with a documentary that will be aired by the Public Broadcasting Service this summer; with a page on the World Wide Web that will include living-will and proxy forms and educational materials; and with an electronic database that hospitals can consult to determine whether a patient has an advanced directive. The group also advocates legislation that would encourage physicians to bring up the issue of advanced directives with patients as a routine part of their care, rather than in a crisis.
<P>
Kaplan hopes the threat of lawsuits may force hospitals to pay more heed to the wishes of patients and their relatives. This past February, she notes, a jury in Flint, Mich., found that a hospital had improperly ignored a mother's plea that her comatose daughter not be placed on a respirator. The hospital was ordered to pay $16 million to the family of the woman, who emerged from the coma with severe brain damage.
<P>
But there is no "ideal formula" for preventing such incidents, according to Daniel Callahan, president of the <A HREF="http://cpn.journalism.wisc.edu/cpn/sections/affiliates/hastings_center.html">Hastings Center</A>, a think tank for biomedical ethics. These situations, he says, stem from certain stubborn realities: most people are reluctant to think about their own death; some patients and relatives insist on aggressive treatment even when the chances of recovery are minuscule; doctors' prognoses for certain patients may be vague or contradictory; and families, patients and health care providers often fail to reach agreement on proper treatment, despite their best efforts.
<P>
Callahan notes that these problems can be resolved only by bringing about profound changes in the way that the medical profession and society at large think about dying. "We thought at first we just needed reform," Callahan wrote in a special issue of the Hastings Center Report devoted to SUPPORT. "It is now obvious we need a revolution."<BR><I>-John Horgan</I>

<CENTER><H2>X Marks the Spots</H2></CENTER>
<CENTER>Researchers find a genetic marker for an<BR>uncommon form of epilepsy</CENTER>
<P>
Genetic mutations account for a number of neurological disorders, among them certain forms of mental retardation. By studying such illnesses, scientists have learned a great deal about normal brain development. Now they have new material to work with. In a <A HREF="http://www.cell.com/neuron/abstract/i0781.html">recent issue of <I>Neuron</I></A>, Boston researchers from Beth Israel Hospital and Harvard Medical School described a genetic marker for a rare form of epilepsy called periventricular heterotopia (PH). Some 0.5 percent of the population have epilepsy, and fewer than 1 percent of them have PH.
<P>
"The disease seemed to be expressed exclusively in females, and these families seemed to have a shortage of male babies," says team member Christopher Walsh. "So there was the suggestion that it was an X-linked defect." The group examined blood samples from four affected pedigrees and quickly confirmed the hypothesis. They singled out a common stretch of DNA along the X chromosome that contained many well-known genes, including <A HREF="http://alt-www.uia.ac.be/u/dnalab/l1.html">one dubbed <I>L1</I></A>.
<P>
Genes such as L1 that ordinarily help to assemble the brain are strong suspects in the search for PH's source, Walsh adds. Damage to L1 itself causes an array of developmental disorders often marked by some subset of symptoms, including hydrocephalus (water on the brain), enlarged ventricles, enlarged head, thinning of the corpus callosum, retardation, spasticity in the lower limbs, adducted thumbs and defects in cell migration. PH also produces certain telltale brain defects. In particular, neurons that should travel to the cerebral cortex-the outermost region of the brain- remain deep inside the organ instead.
<P>
 "We wondered why some of all cell types [in PH] failed to migrate, as opposed to all of one cell type," Walsh notes. "We think the answer is that the female brain is a mosaic." One of the two X chromosomes in each cell of a female fetus is shut off at random after the first third of gestation, he explains. So those with PH probably express normal X chromosomes in most cells and mutants in a few others. As a result, select representatives of all types of cortical cells are stalled in their movement. In contrast, affected male fetuses, which possess single, flawed X chromosomes in every cell, develop so abnormally that they are miscarried. 
<P>
Finding the precise gene should make it easier to diagnosis PH, Walsh says. Most patients have no outward symptoms other than frequent epileptic seizures, which are usually atypical. Also, whatever mechanism prompts PH may play some role in other forms of epilepsy. "There may be hundreds of gene mutations that confer risk for epilepsy," Walsh states. (Indeed, geneticists from Stanford and the University of Helsinki reported in March that mutations in the gene encoding for a protein called Cystatin B occurred in another uncommon inherited epilepsy, progressive myclonus epilepsy.) "But perhaps the gene products behind PH do something throughout the brain that causes seizures," Walsh adds, "and perhaps that same thing underlies all forms of epilepsy." 
<P>
In fact, the products of X-chromosome genes controlling development may stand behind even more neurological disorders than has been believed. Researchers at the J. C. Self Research Institute of the Greenwood Genetic Center in South Carolina are currently screening for L1 defects among the 40 to 50 percent of mentally retarded individuals in the state for whom no diagnosis has been found. To narrow the search, the group limited the survey to men having enlarged heads and spasticity in their gait. Already they have found a greater incidence of L1 mutations than expected. "L1-related retardation is not as prevalent as fragile-X [another form of retardation]," says Charles Schwartz, director of the Molecular Studies unit, "but it's probably still more common than previously thought."
<P>
Knowledge of the actual molecular mechanisms behind L1-related disorders has recently given workers insight into fetal alcohol syndrome as well. Several years ago Michael E. Charness of Harvard University noted several similarities between certain aspects of fetal alcohol syndrome, his area of expertise, and L1 disorders. Therefore, he tested the effects of alcohol on the L1 molecule, known to guide axon growth over long distances and connect neurons during development.
<P>
Last month, Charness released results showing that alcohol completely abolishes L1's adhesive properties in low doses-namely, amounts that would be present in a pregnant woman's bloodstream after she consumed one or two drinks. "Epidemiologists have suggested that there may be measurable effects of low amounts of alcohol on a fetus," Charness states. "This finding provides us with one potential molecular mechanism behind that observation." The hope is that the unraveling of more such mechanisms will lead to prevention or to better treatment for a wide range of neurological birth defects.<BR><I>-Kristin Leutwyler</I>

<BR>MEDICINE<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Not So Blind, After All</H2></CENTER>
<CENTER>Randomized trials-the linchpin of<BR>medicine-may often be rigged</CENTER>
<P>
To find out whether a daily dose of aspirin prevents heart attacks, you take 10,000 people from the general population, select half of them at random to take aspirin every day, and follow all 10,000 for five or 10 years to see how their cardiovascular systems hold up. This kind of randomized selection is at the center of the clinical trials used to test all manner of new medical treatments. In practice, however, it may be significantly flawed.
<P>
Kenneth P. Schulz of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and his colleagues have been raising questions about the quality of "allocation concealment"-the process of hiding information about which patients will be assigned new treatment versus which will get conventional care. For instance, if doctors know that all new patients registered on odd-numbered days get a new drug that is under investigation, whereas those registered on even-numbered days get a placebo, they could easily rearrange their appointment books-with only the best interests of their patients at heart-to undermine the intent of a randomized trial. Even when there is negligible evidence, doctors tend to believe they know what treatment is most effective, Schulz contends.
<P>
Researchers generally use significantly more sophisticated methods to allocate their patients, but the doctors who actually carry out trials may go to even greater lengths to subvert concealment. Schulz surveyed his co-workers anonymously and found that some will do anything-from opening sealed envelopes or holding them over a strong light to rifling a colleague's desk-for copies of the randomization sequence. 
<P>
According to work that Schulz and his collaborators published in the <I><A HREF="http://www.ama-assn.org/register/welcome.htm">Journal of the American Medical Association</A></I>, trials with inadequate concealment-half or more of those studied-yield estimates of effectiveness that on average are roughly 30 percent higher than those where allocation is properly controlled. In some trials, however, the effect of cheating can work against a treatment's apparent effectiveness, Schulz<B> </B>says: medical staff convinced that a new drug would not be in testing if it didn't work may try to help their sickest patients by sneaking them into the treatment group instead of the control group. The drug would then have to be significantly better than conventional treatment just to appear equal in efficacy.
<P>
Such irregularities highlight the importance of good statistical analysis of any difference between control and treatment groups. Schulz analyzed one set of papers and found that only 2 percent of tests indicated "statistically significant" differences between control and treatment patients. Because a statistically significant result is defined as one that would appear by chance one time in 20, the 2 percent figure immediately puts those trials' methods in doubt, he says.
<P>
Why do doctors who agree to enroll their patients in clinical trials turn around and effectively subvert them? "They understand the need for randomization on a cognitive level," but the gut feeling for it eludes them, Schulz explains. As a result, once a treatment has become respectable, it may be impossible to determine whether it actually works. When Canadian physicians explored the effectiveness of episiotomy to aid childbirth, he notes, a third of doctors employed the operation in 90 percent of the patients ostensibly slated for the surgery only as a last resort.
<P>
It can be difficult for doctors committed to the best possible care for their patients to give medical decisions over to a roll of the dice, especially if early results from a new treatment are promising, but it may be necessary. "If you think you know what's happening, you'll never allow it to play out, and you'll never know. But your notions aren't based on good data," Schulz observes. He recalls one randomized trial of antibacterial cream given to prevent premature births caused by vaginal infections: after initial indications that the cream was effective, reviewers moved to block the trial on the grounds that it would be unethical to withhold treatment-but when all the results were in, the control group had had fewer premature births.
<P>
Schulz and other medical statisticians around the world have developed guidelines, to be published later this year, for reporting safeguards, including the methods used in trials to ensure allocation concealment. Several major medical journals, including the Lancet and the <I>New England Journal of Medicine</I>, are proposing to reject manuscripts that do not conform, so that trials whose results are easily susceptible to jiggering will not be widely published and become part of what everybody knows.<BR><I>-Paul Wallich</I>

<CENTER><H2>Sowing Where You Reap</H2></CENTER>
<P><CENTER>Profits from biodiversity are neither<BR>easy to pinpoint nor
to protect</CENTER>
<P>That biodiversity is valuable enough to pay for itself has long been
recognized as a self-evident truth. Roughly half the drugs in clinical use
are estimated to derive from nature. The Biodiversity Convention, adopted
in 1992 at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development,
tried to ensure that profits from such goods return to the place of origin
to aid conservation and local communities. Despite some success, that goal
remains elusive. Although bioprospectors-those who seek potential products
in biota-number in the hundreds, the returns they promise to peoples in
developing countries appear highly variable. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;I've seen genuine outrage in parts of the world,&quot; attests Daniel
M. Putterman, a consultant who helps developing countries negotiate deals
with industry. The anger is cutting off parts of the world to bioprospectors.
In Thailand, public ire has forced a British foundation to stop seeking
the medicinal secrets of Karen tribes. In India, thousands of insects found
in the luggage of two German &quot;tourists&quot; have prompted legislation
regulating gene transfer; the Philippines recently passed just such a law.
<BR>
<BR>
Even when they agree to the transfer of such resources, some Third World
representatives remain uneasy about the power balance with their First World
partners. &quot;If you are a small fish swimming with a shark,&quot; says
Maurice M. Iwu of the Bioresources Development and Conservation Program
in Cameroon, &quot;it makes no difference if the shark has good intentions.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
These problems center on that special attribute of biological materials:
they reproduce. Thus, a handful of seeds or micrograms of microbes might
be enough to carry a genetic resource out of a country. Technological advances
allow tiny amounts of material to be screened, so a drug developer may never
have to return to the source country. &quot;The trick right now is monitoring
the flow of material,&quot; explains Walter V. Reid of the World Resources
Institute. <BR>
<BR>
When a benefit-sharing agreement is signed, local institutions must often
rely on the integrity of the foreign partner in sharing information. &quot;You
have no way of knowing&quot; what happened to a sample, notes Berhanu M.
Abegaz of the University of Botswana. On occasion, a drug developer may
offer to cultivate a plant in the source country, Abegaz says. Nevertheless,
he adds, this arrangement can have a double edge: the firm that holds the
patent can also control the price paid to farmers, and the producers are
kept at a subsistence level. <BR>
<BR>
The more land brought under cultivation, the greater may be the threat to
biodiversity. And if collected from the wild, the plant itself may become
endangered. That happened with the Pacific yew, which yields the anticancer
agent taxol. If a drug can be synthesized in the laboratory, the pressure
on biodiversity is eased (again, as with the yew), but then it can become
hard to ensure that some proceeds return. Roger Kennedy, director of the
National Park Service, has proposed that royalties from finds-such as the
bacterium <I>Thermus aquaticus</I>, which was discovered in Yellowstone
National Park and used in the enormously profitable polymerase chain reaction-be
used to protect the parks. <BR>
<BR>
This idea is disputed by some pharmaceutical companies and by other observers,
who point out the differences between property and intellectual property.
In the case of <I>T. aquaticus</I>, the counterargument goes, scientists
discovered PCR-the technique is the product of their effort and thought.
Thus, their intellectual work and financial investment deserve to be protected.
Many experts feel that the Biodiversity Convention (which the U.S. has still
not ratified) does not adequately protect patents or intellectual property.
<BR>
<BR>
At the same time that developing countries are demanding a share of the
royalties from drug discovery, many bioprospectors argue that the promise
of such revenue is overblown. One profitable drug is developed, after 10
or 15 years, from some 10,000 to 100,000 substances that are screened. &quot;The
royalties may never come,&quot; points out Ana Sittenfeld of INBio, a Costa
Rican organization that supplies extracts to several pharmaceutical firms,
including Merck. For instance, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) screened
nearly 80,000 biological materials between 1986 and 1991-only one major
lead has emerged so far. <BR>
<BR>
Small biotech companies have, however, discovered how to make money not
just from the end product-the drug-but also from the steps that lead to
it. Some rent out samples to pharmaceutical companies for screening; others
do the screening and provide leads to substances. The industry assigns well-defined
trade values to each step: extracts sell for $10 to $100, leads sell for
$100 to $1,000, and a drug candidate with animal toxicology data sells for
$1,000 to $10,000. &quot;Those countries that had access to this market
information have negotiated the best deals,&quot; Putterman notes. <BR>
<BR>
The most valuable benefit, Sittenfeld states, is technological training.
INBio, often cited as an example for future Third World institutions, functions
much like a biotech company, with attendant profits. In contrast, Abegaz
laments a &quot;failure to build capacity in Africa.&quot; Among the bioprospectors
in Africa is the NCI, which has been criticized for providing minimal up-front
benefits and no guarantee of royalties. <BR>
<BR>
INBio puts 10 percent of its research budget into conservation and trains
local parataxonomists, who might otherwise have been using the forests in
nonsustainable ways. The International Cooperative Biodiversity Groups Program,
set up by three U.S. agencies-the National Institutes of Health, the National
Science Foundation and the Agency for International Development-also tries
to build local capacity while bioprospecting. Joshua P. Rosenthal, who heads
the program for the NIH, comments that such training helps local scientists
in identifying areas rich in biodiversity. <BR>
<BR>
A handful of other bioprospectors have set up trust funds that promise returns
if royalties ever start to flow. But ensuring that biodiversity survives
its value to humanity remains a climb up a slippery slope. <I>-Madhusree
Mukerjee <BR>
<BR>
This is the second in a two-part series on profiting from biodiversity.

<CENTER><H2>Electric Smile Aid</H2></CENTER>
<CENTER>There's a new way to stave off cavities</CENTER>
<P>
Of all the diseases that afflict humankind, none is more prevalent than tooth rot. By the age of 17, almost 85 percent of adolescents in the U.S. have had multiple cavities, according to a recent article in the journal Public Health Reports. 
<P>
The basic reason for this pervasiveness is that dentists often cannot detect the onset of decay until it is too late. But researchers and dental professionals have high hopes for an experimental diagnostic tool that, if it ever goes into production, could detect problems while there is still time to prevent cavities.
<P>
Decay begins just under the tooth's surface, in the enamel coating. Bacterial fermentation of the carbohydrates from food creates acids that cause the loss of mineral in the enamel (which is about 90 percent mineral when healthy). If this demineralization reaches the underlying dentine, the enamel eventually caves in, forming a cavity.
<P>
If a dentist can catch demineralization before it becomes too advanced, fluoride treatments can heal the lesion. But dentists seldom can. "Decay has to be advanced to be seen or felt," explains George E. White of the Tufts University School of Dental Medicine. The only tools most dentists have are their eyes, the infamous metal pick-which they use to detect spots made fragile by demineralization-and the x-ray machine.
<P>
These methods do not work well. Recent studies have found that even with x-rays, dentists miss at least half of these precavity lesions. Tooth enamel is quite opaque to x-rays, so the demineralized regions are often obscured by adjacent healthy enamel. 
<P>
Now members of a research group from the universities of Dundee and of St. Andrews, both in Scotland, and the University of Nijmegen in the Netherlands say they have found a much better approach. They describe their findings in a recent issue of Nature Medicine. Their technique, which measures the electrical impedance of a tooth surface to determine whether it contains a demineralized region, was 100 percent accurate in trials on extracted teeth. 
<P>
The method exploits the fact that demineralization opens up pores that fill with a fluid that is much less electrically resistant than enamel. The technique is not new. But the Dundee team increased accuracy considerably by measuring impedance using alternating-current waveforms over a broad spectrum-from one hertz to about 300 kilohertz.
<P>
The procedure took 10 to 15 minutes to measure impedances separately on all four sides and the top surface of a single tooth. That time, however, could be cut to seconds by more selective application of the frequency bands used on each tooth, says Christopher Longbottom, one of the Dundee researchers. He and his colleagues are currently seeking funds to produce a version of their system that would be suitable for clinical use.<BR><I>-Glenn Zorpette</I>

<CENTER><H2>The More Species, the Merrier</H2></CENTER>
Environmentalists often call attention to the erosion of Earth's biodiversity. Yet even the most knowledgeable of them often has difficulty following such warnings with clear statements about the value of what has been lost. Now ecologists have demonstrated at least one benefit of biodiversity: a multiplicity of species makes some lands more productive.
<P>
<A HREF="http://biosci.cbs.umn.edu/eeb/faculty/TlmanDavid.html">G. David Tilman</A> and Johannes Knops of the University of Minnesota, along with David A. Wedin of the University of Toronto, recently published this report in Nature. Their investigation involved a set of 147 grassland plots; each measured three by three meters square and was planted with a controlled mixture of grasses (right). Using student labor for the frequent weeding, the researchers allowed only one kind of grass to grow on some squares, whereas in others they maintained many types. In some plots, 24 different species sprouted-seemingly a vast variety but still only a mere fraction of the natural variation. Wedin says native prairies easily have 40 to 50 species.
<P>
The point of the strangely quilted field was to determine how the richness of species affected the land. Charles Darwin long ago reported that a mixture of different grasses can support higher biological production than can a single type of plant. But according to biologist Peter Kareiva of the University of Washington, no one quite knows which experiments Darwin had in mind. 
<P>
Tilman and his co-workers demonstrated Darwin's point clearly by monitoring the effect of species richness on the peak standing crop (as measured, for example, by the amount of a plot covered by grass). Plant cover expanded from 33 to 49 percent as the number of species rose from one to six. Interestingly, with greater than six species, further productivity gains were hard to see; the researchers could find no indications of increasing productivity on plots for which the number of grass species surpassed 10.
<P>
"So do these results tell the policy maker to worry about preserving the first 10 species of prairie plant but not to bother once that quota has been satisfied?" asked Kareiva in a commentary in Nature. Clearly, more work would be necessary to gauge how a greater richness of species might offer other advantages, such as resilience to drought, predatory insects or disease. But Tilman and his team are keen to address such questions. They have established a group of 342 plots, each 13 by 13 meters square. "The bigger plots will be more valuable," Wedin remarks. But new results showing the other values of biodiversity will perhaps take quite a bit more time. As Tilman notes, "Hand weeding 20 acres is a slow process."

<CENTER>A new law aims to prevent software meltdown in federal agencies</CENTER>
<P>
Several hundred tons of plutonium, enriched uranium and other highly radioactive materials have been produced within the U.S. over the past two decades. For every ounce created, transported or sold, Department of Energy officials entered a record into a database. The tracking system ensures that no weapons-grade nuclear materials are stolen or misplaced and provides evidence that the U.S. is complying with international treaties. But in 1993 the software, written 20 years ago for an obsolete mainframe, had become impractical to maintain, so the DOE ordered a replacement. 
<P>
Because of the importance of the system, Congress asked the General Accounting Office (GAO) to check up on the project a year later. The GAO's report was disturbing. It warned that the DOE's contractor had started programming without adequately analyzing whether the new design would work as well as alternatives, meet users' needs or even save money. Despite the GAO's admonition, construction continued.
<P>
Last fall the GAO issued a follow-up review raising more serious concerns. The contractors, it found, could provide no specifications, no test results, no status reports. The DOE had no way of knowing whether the project was on track. Agency managers could not even estimate the size of the new system. Nevertheless, in September the DOE switched off the old tracking system and turned on the new one without ever requiring that the software pass a final test demonstrating that all its reports are accurate. GAO reviewers have recommended canceling the project, warning that "the history of software development is littered with systems that failed under similar circumstances."
<P>
Indeed, in the history of federal software procurement, expensive, time-consuming failures are the rule. The costs to taxpayers are threefold. First are direct losses from investments in technology that is never used, such as a Federal Bureau of Investigation fingerprint-scanning system ordered in 1993. Already late and more than 50 percent over budget, the system uses technology so outdated that police advisers recently voted to reject and rebid the contract.
<P>
Secondary costs go to pay salaries and maintenance fees to keep obsolete systems running while modernization projects drag on. The National Weather Service's upgrade of its observation and forecasting systems, for example, has slipped five years and doubled in cost because of poor design and management. 
<P>
Most painful, however, are the lost savings that could have been realized had agencies applied technology effectively. While the Internal Revenue Service has frittered eight years and $2.5 billion trying, with little success, to modernize its systems in order to combat fraud and noncompliance, an estimated $70 billion in uncollected taxes has slipped through the government's fingers.
<P>
No one knows what return executive agencies can expect from the $26.5 billion they plan to spend on information technology in 1996. But many industry experts are certain that it is lower than it ought to be. One major reason, an outdated law known as the Brooks Act, vanished in February, when President Bill Clinton signed a bill that radically reorganizes the way federal agencies purchase large software systems.
<P>
The 1965 Brooks Act funneled nearly all computer purchases through the General Services Administration (GSA) and forced agencies to pick contractors through a lengthy competition. The idea was to ensure that the government paid the lowest price for expensive mainframes. But as large machines yielded to the market for personal computers, the law became a costly anachronism.
<P>
The legislation that repeals the Brooks Act will require each federal agency to appoint a chief information officer (CIO). Although agencies will no longer need the GSA's (typically rubber-stamped) permission to buy information technology, they will have to report on the cost, status and success of their projects to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). The OMB will have the authority to kill runaway systems by withholding their funding-and the duty to send an annual report to Congress comparing the performance of the agencies.
<P>
In place of the Brooks Act's intricate rules is a new set of detailed directions. Big systems must be split into small independent chunks so that later sections can incorporate newer technology. Segments are supposed to be finished within 18 months-faster than most current projects. Perhaps the law's most ambitious provision insists that agencies analyze and redesign operations <I>before</I> investing in systems to automate them.
<P>
Senator William Cohen of Maine, who sponsored the legislation, maintains that it could save up to $175 billion over five years. Industry veterans suggest that estimate may be wildly optimistic, although they generally agree with Larry E. Druffel, head of the <A HREF="http://www.sei.cmu.edu/sei-home.html">Software Engineering Institute</A>, that "repeal of the Brooks Act has to be positive." Appointing CIOs, splitting projects into pieces and enforcing risk management could produce a more logical approach, he says. But Druffel warns that "these components could also produce a bureaucratic system in which the CIO becomes a bottleneck, security concerns inhibit the use of commercial products, and increments are built without any unifying framework, so that nothing works with anything else."
<P>
Richard A. DeMillo, former head of the Software Engineering Research Consortium, points out that the law "recycles old ideas that have always sounded good but haven't been followed by contractors." Indeed, the act gives agencies no new leverage to deal with firms that deliver poor work, fall behind schedule or raise their cost estimates midstream.
<P>
If Congress has neglected oversight in the past, "this goes to the other extreme, of micromanagement," complains Paul Strassmann, former CIO for Xerox, Kraft and General Foods. "The fundamental flaw here is that [Congress] prescribes inputs yet has very little interest in results." Congress, he suggests, should demand reductions in overall agency costs, not in the price of technology.
<P>
"Treating each systems acquisition as a separate [technological] solution," Strassmann testified in a Senate hearing, "has resulted in thousands of unintegrated, hard-to-maintain, impossible-to-manage, contractor-dependent islands of automation." Because the law "does not articulate what to do with what is already in place and what happens after new systems are installed," Strassmann warns, "this act may succeed in eliminating much of the existing regulatory chaos of acquisition only to become saddled with a more costly chaos of operations."

<BR>IMAGING<BR>
<CENTER><H2>On Permanent Displays</H2></CENTER>
<CENTER>Low-power, low-cost liquid crystals<BR>move to market</CENTER>
<P>
The failings of conventional flat-panel display technology are familiar to anyone who has used-or priced-laptop computers. Inexpensive models are limited to shades of gray or dim colors. More advanced versions capable of bright, fast-changing hues carry dizzying price tags. And all liquid-crystal screens suffer from a voracious appetite for power, sucking batteries dry within a few hours.
<P>
Researchers at the <A HREF="http://alcom.kent.edu/">Liquid Crystal Institute</A> of Kent State University have recently demonstrated a new kind of inexpensive liquid-crystal display (LCD) that can produce clearer images using much less energy. Commercial production of a high-resolution gray-scale version has already begun at Kent Display Systems. The researchers are now engineering a similar color device.
<P>
The displays do more with less because they affect light in a different way than conventional LCDs do. A standard liquid-crystal panel filters the light both going in and coming out. Dots, or pixels, of liquid crystal inside the panel naturally twist the light so that it can pass through the second filter. But when a pixel is turned on, it untwists, and the dot goes dark. Unfortunately, such polarized filters cut the light going in by half; changing bright pixels into colored ones requires yet another filter. LCDs are consequently too dim to use as computer displays unless lit by a lamp from behind. And lamps devour power.
<P>
Liang-Chy Chien and his colleagues got around this problem using a so-called cholesteric liquid-crystal material. Rather than twisting light, this material breaks incoming rays into two parts. One ray is reflected; the other is transmitted. Electrifying the chemical turns it clear. Because cholesteric LCDs reflect light without the need for polarizing filters, they can be as bright and legible in ambient light as conventional LCDs are when backlit.
<P>
Early cholesteric LCDs were limited to single colors, but Chien found that if he added small amounts of a second material, he could tune the color to anything from deep red to brilliant blue by shining various amounts of bright ultraviolet light on the panel. Mixing in a bit of polymer then locks in the chosen color. The engineers are now adapting masks such as those used to etch microscopic patterns onto computer chips to create millions of red, blue and green pixels on a cholesteric LCD panel.
<P>
At present, cholesteric LCDs are about 20 percent more expensive than conventional "passive matrix" displays, but their effects are worth far more. Pixels in the new displays stay on once they are turned on, eliminating the need to redraw the display several times each second, thus saving power. These panels should run more than 10 times longer on batteries than present displays can.
<P>
The stability also allows pixels to be much smaller-one prototype boasts 200 dots per inch-and it eliminates the flicker that makes laptop screens wearisome to read. But the biggest advantage of the new LCDs is that they do not require the "active matrix" electronics that triple the price of conventional panels in order to maintain high contrast and resolution. A wide range of electronics makers, including IBM, Sony and Toshiba, have reportedly expressed interest in licensing the technology.

<BR>BIOTECHNOLOGY<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Advantage: Nature</H2></CENTER>
<CENTER>Could escaped genes from bioengineered<BR>crops give weeds a crucial boost?</CENTER>
<P>
During the past two years, a dozen varieties of cotton, squash, soybeans, potatoes and tomatoes created by gene splicing have been approved for sale in the U.S. The added genes confer traits ranging from longer shelf life to pest resistance. The plants seem safe, but environmental watchdog groups<B> </B>fear that the spliced genes might spread into the crops' wild relatives. In such hosts, the genes might be less benign-and harder to control.
<P>
Researchers have long known that transgenic plants can form sterile hybrids with wild relatives. Now researchers in Denmark have shown that these hybrids can be fertile and can transmit a genetically engineered trait to subsequent generations in field conditions. Health concerns have also emerged: a report in the New England Journal of Medicine indicates that a gene taken from Brazil nuts and engineered into soybeans made the beans allergenic.
<P>
The Danish researchers, Thomas R. Mikkelsen and his colleagues at the Riso National Laboratory in Roskilde, crossed oilseed rape (also known as canola)<B> </B>that had genetically engineered resistance to a common herbicide, glufosinate, with a weedy relative of the crop, Brassica campestris. They then bred the hybrids with wild B. campestris to create glufosinate-resistant plants. Furthermore, the plants transmitted glufosinate resistance to the next generation. "I have been waiting for something like this to happen," comments Norman C. Ellstrand of the University of California at Riverside. "This demonstrates that you can get expression of a novel gene in a weed plant, and it has high fitness."
<P>
Resistance to herbicides has been a popular trait for genetic engineering, because the plant developers can sell the seeds with the promise that the crop will not be harmed by use of the proper herbicide.<B> </B>Plant Genetic Systems in Belgium has obtained marketing approval in Britain for glufosinate-resistant oilseed rape, and Monsanto sells soybeans that are resistant to the herbicide glyphosate. But if weeds acquire resistance genes from the crop, the commercial advantage will quickly evaporate.
<P>
That scenario is plausible only if there are weedy relatives in the area where the crop is grown. Gene spread from soybeans in North America seems unlikely, because the crop has no wild relatives. But soybeans in Asia do have such neighbors, and canola and squash have numerous wild relatives in North America.
<P>
Genes for herbicide resistance probably will not get far outside of a controlled agricultural setting,<B> </B>because they offer no advantage where the herbicide is not used. Genes for pest resistance are a different matter. Even seemingly innocuous traits such as altered oil composition might give a weed a boost if the traits were to spread<B>. </B>The Union of Concerned Scientists has called for more research on a virus-resistant crookneck squash marketed by Asgrow and a modified canola, sold by Calgene, that produces seeds with oil rich in lauric acid.
<P>
Beyond the threat of the spread of resistance lies the worry that other harmful attributes could be transferred between transgenic crops. Scientists have long been aware, for instance, that if a plant is given new genes, it produces new proteins, and some proteins<B> </B>can cause life-threatening allergic reactions in people.<B> </B>This possibility just became reality for Pioneer Hi-Bred International, which had engineered a Brazil-nut gene into soybeans intended for animal feed in order to provide extra methionine to supplement the animals' diet. The company called off the project before any beans were sold, after tests showed that the Brazil-nut protein it had used caused allergic reactions when extracts of the soybeans were tested on people.
<P>
Despite the discovery that transgenes can spread by hybridization into weedy relatives of crops, the U.S. Department of Agriculture has proposed streamlining the procedure companies follow to get approval for field tests of genetically engineered crops.<B> </B>"Sex does happen, and we know about it," says Arnold Foudin of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. "The question is: Does it pose risk elements that have not traditionally existed? The answer is, not really." Others are less sanguine. "I don't think there should be a class of genes or species that we assume are never going to cause problems," says C. Randal Linder of the University of Illinois. "The USDA is taking a bit of a fast track."

<BR>INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Remote Repair</H2></CENTER>
<CENTER>Internet technology may allow equipment<BR>to be fixed from afar</CENTER>
<P>
Your computer system is down, and you don't know why. Wouldn't it be convenient if the manufacturer could diagnose and fix the problem over the telephone lines or send you the needed spare even before your system bombed? Such a scheme could be in place within a year, at least for industrial manufacturing equipment. The idea is to have a kind of data recorder within a piece of equipment that would transmit information on operating conditions to the original manufacturer. The firm can use the data to dispatch a replacement or even send commands that restart the device.
<P>
That is the hope of Richard S. Post, head of Applied Science and Technology (ASTeX), a company in Woburn, Mass., that supplies components, such as plasma sources and microwave power generators, for semiconductor manufacturing. Currently semiconductor-making equipment remains down about 15 percent of the time for maintenance. To construct more durable machinery, Post says, one needs to know the conditions under which the machine failed, such as the temperature it reached or the voltage it drew. But that kind of information is rarely available. "You just get the component back in a bag with a note saying it doesn't work," Post complains. Monitoring over the Internet might also obviate the need for a return shipment: a command could be sent that simply resets the device or that confirms it has actually malfunctioned.
<P>
The idea of using networks to monitor a piece of equipment is not new. Telephone companies already employ a similar strategy, notes Ralph Wyndrum of AT&AMPT Bell Laboratories. They routinely test their lines and reroute calls around glitches before any disruption occurs.
<P>
The value of the Internet, however, is its economical utility: it is virtually free and has global reach. Moreover, no hardware needs to be invented. Microprocessors are often embedded in equipment (for every one personal computer, there are 10 home and business machines with a processor chip), and many of these chips can do diagnostic tests.
<P>
And software exists to connect these "intelligent" devices. For the past year, Novell in Orem, Utah, has been touting software called NEST, which links office machines so that, say, a single fax transmission can be dispersed to several locales. More important, it can collect real-time data about the devices and generate statistics on their use. At the end of March, Novell began selling a version that is compatible with the Internet. With the hardware and software available, the principle of remote monitoring over the Internet can be demonstrated in a matter of weeks, claims Post, who has only just begun floating the idea to colleagues and customers. Real systems could be had in a year.
<P>
Unfortunately, the ability to determine what a device is doing also suggests that information flow can be reversed, making sabotage a possibility. And sending proprietary operating data across the Internet makes it game for industrial espionage. Such security issues, though, are not that different from dealing with credit-card and other sensitive transactions over the Internet, Post remarks. He thinks that even a 5 percent increase in productivity would be worth the attempt: "We just have to decide what kinds of things to include in the next generation of devices."<BR><I>-Philip Yam</I>

<CENTER><H2>MIRIAM ROTHSCHILD</H2></CENTER>
<CENTER><I>Natural History of Fleas and Butterflies</I></CENTER>
<P>
The house at Ashton Wold is wild, outside and in. Although it is
muddy midwinter and the twisting branches and vines are bare, it
is clear that the garden is a lush, unruly tangle in the spring
and summer, that things are just let be. In the large living
room, too, things are everywhere: an imposing pine tree hung only
with its own cones, a sideboard with cakes and coffee, walls of
bookshelves as well as long tables piled high with books-about
fleas, birds in Israel, mother-daughter relations, Beatrix
Potter's botanical drawings, and memory. There are pictures of
birds and butterflies and photographs of the children and
grandchildren and one of Walter Rothschild on the back of his
giant tortoise Rotumah, a stuffed owl, vases of yellow flowers
and star lilies, many small jars of seeds, two barking dogs,
myriad couches. <P>
And Miriam Rothschild, whose interests, accomplishments and moods
are as diverse as her sitting room. She even has another last
name, Lane, that she uses when it suits her-sometimes when
callers ask if they are speaking to Miriam Rothschild, she will
answer, "It depends. Who are you?" ("Lane" was what the British
Commandos dubbed her husband during World War II, because his
Hungarian name sounded so decidedly un-English.) It is the name
"Rothschild," however, that appears on her some 350 papers about
entomology, neurophysiology, chemistry and zoology and on the
roster of the Royal Society. <P>
And it is as a Rothschild that she is known for her dozen books,
much of her conservation work, her advocacy for the better
treatment of animals, her gallery devoted to the artwork of
schizophrenics, her political activism on behalf of homosexuals,
and all the other hundreds of things she has done in her nearly
90 years. "I am a tilter at windmills," Rothschild asserts from
her wheelchair, where she is temporarily stuck because of an
injury. No matter that the furniture has been rearranged to
accommodate the large Christmas tree, Rothschild takes the same
path as ever to the ever ringing telephone, pushing chairs and
small tables out of her way. "I always have had some cause or
other which I really get terribly steamed up about." <P>
Her expansive interests, her energy and her activism are in
keeping with her lineage. The Rothschild family-famous for
banking and politics-has produced astounding naturalists: Walter,
whose collections included 2.25 million butterflies, 30,000 birds
and 300,000 beetles; and Charles, Miriam's father, who assembled
the most comprehensive flea inventory in the world. Rothschild's
first memories are of being obsessed with nature and with
collecting specimens. Her parents believed that a formal
education would be too stifling, so she was free to pursue her
interests and to read widely. At 17 she decided to take some
courses. <P>
"Right in the beginning of my university life, if you call it
that, I tried to take two degrees at once: English literature and
one in zoology. But it became impossible. You could never get the
lectures synchronized. You always wanted to hear somebody talk on
Ruskin, and at the same time you had to dissect the entrails of a
sea urchin. It was hopeless." <P>
Rothschild ultimately chose marine biology because of a field
trip to Plymouth and a chance meeting with naturalist G. C.
Robson. "He offered me the world if I would stick with his marine
snails," she recalls-and he packed her off to Italy to do so, as
the winner of an all-paid position. "I went home to my mother and
said, 'You will be very pleased to hear that I have been awarded
the London University Table in Naples.' I didn't tell her I was
the only applicant. I thought it was high time she thought I was
clever, instead of being the stupid one in the family." <P>
There were no such snails, but Rothschild had a wonderful time:
"My trouble at Naples was that I merely went into everything
because it was all so fascinating." She returned to England,
working on snail-borne parasites for seven years, until her lab
at Plymouth was bombed in 1940. Rothschild has written about the
sudden destruction as horrible but also liberating: "Without
realizing it I had gradually become an appendage of my trematode
life cycles." She then did some wartime work. "I made a food for
chickens out of seaweed, and I was asked, 'Do you think this is a
success?' And I said, 'I don't know. It gives me the hiccups.'"
Rothschild stops and listens as the dogs begin to bark,
high-pitched and persistent; when they calm down, she continues.
<P>
Rothschild was asked in the early 1940s to join Enigma (or Ultra,
a project to decode German communications) with, oddly, a bevy of
marine biologists. "There was the champion chess player of
Ireland, and there were all these top mathematicians. But on the
whole the marine biologists came out way ahead. It was very
funny." The work was worrying, she says tersely. "Look, I can sum
up my views on Enigma: we didn't win the war, but we shortened
it." <P>
She left Enigma to marry her husband and to work on an
agricultural council, studying wood pigeons. She discovered that
the birds carried bovine tuberculosis. "People said there was a
different breed of wood pigeon, a different strain, that came to
this country in the winter, which had darker plumage." To her,
the coloring suggested addisonism, which people have when their
adrenal glands are infected with TB. "I went to the meat market,
and I dissected an awful lot of pigeons there. And then I found
this TB in the adrenals." (She was not allowed to publish her
results, because, she confides, "it gave the enemy information,
which I thought was remarkably funny.") <P>
Rothschild does not characterize her hunch about the TB-or any of
her remarkable hunches-as intuitive. "I think if you had to
describe any talent I might have, it is that I am a good
observer. And that means that you don't only notice things, but
you think about what you have noticed." <P>
After the war, at the age of 44, she wrote her first book,
<I>Fleas, Flukes and Cuckoos, </I>about parasites, and then
concentrated on the family fetish: fleas. Charles, who, among
other things, identified the flea that carried the plague, had
housed his tiny millions at the Natural History Museum in London,
but they had yet to be catalogued.  Being the mother of six posed
no challenge to Rothschild. "I guess roughly I gave up 10 years
to the children. And I have always been quite honest about this:
I much prefer children to the fleas. It was not a sacrifice to me
at all. And I never really believed a word of these women who
said they could not give up their careers; it is obvious the
children are more interesting than the careers." <P>
She does admit that she is a chronic insomniac. "One thing that
made it easy was you could look after the children in the
daytime, and you could do your morphology and your microscopy at
night." She apparently also dispenses with time-consuming chores
like choosing clothes by wearing one outfit that she designed and
had made up in various fabrics. <P>
Working with a collaborator for 20 years, Rothschild catalogued
and investigated the peculiarities of fleas: "I discovered, just
by accident, that if you knew the histology of the flea you could
pretty much know the histology of any other insect." She points
to some drawings. "Look at their lovely mouthparts. They have got
such beautiful mouthparts, fleas. Really, they have." Rothschild
also discovered how fleas jump so well. They have a ball of
resilin between their back legs; this elasticlike substance
allows them to jump from bended knee off the ground at more than
140 times the force of gravity. Some do this 30,000 times without
stopping. <P>
In the midst of studying rabbit overpopulation in Australia,
Rothschild discovered the first example of a parasite relying on
its host's hormones. "I was able to show that the flea has turned
over the control of its breeding cycle to the rabbit. Its ovaries
only mature under the influence of the pregnant rabbit's
hormones," she explains in crisp, clear manner. "During
copulation between adult rabbits, the fleas all move off the buck
onto the doe-she seems to attract them at that stage. Then, when
she becomes pregnant and begins to mature her baby, so to speak,
the fleas gradually go through her cycle. And their ovaries begin
to develop. By the time she is ready to give birth, the fleas
respond to this and instead of remaining attached to the rabbit
ear, as they do normally, they break loose, run down the rabbit's
nose and drop off on the babies just as they are born. There they
receive another set of hormones that enables them to copulate."
(Rothschild has said that this synchronicity may explain why
women are more often bitten by fleas than men are.) <P>
She stopped her work on hormones when her collaborator at the
University of Oxford, Geoffrey W. Harris, died. "Somehow the gilt
was off the gingerbread, you know." Rothschild attributes much of
her luck to collaborators. "Without the enthusiasm, I mean, you
know. I am an amateur, I have no degrees." With Nobel laureate
Tadeus Reichstein, Rothschild determined that the poison of
monarch butterflies comes from their diet of milkweed. She
continues to study butterflies-her first love, she says, and the
subject of her most recent book, <I>Butterfly Cooing like a
Dove</I>-as well as toxins and chemical signaling in insects and
plants. <P>
Plants, in fact, are a current obsession. Rothschild is
revisiting 180 of 280 sites in the British Isles that her father
described in 1912 as areas vital to preserve. She hopes to
determine which forms of land management failed. She has also
devoted 150 acres of her estate to rare wildflowers and is
selling the seeds so as to preserve genetic diversity. Generally,
population growth and the destruction of the natural world
depress her. But "there is only one single, slight good thing.
And that is that a different class of person now is interested. I
hate the word 'lower classes,' it is a horrible word, but it is
true," she says. There are "more uneducated people who have
become interested in the environment." <P>
Her other concerns of the moment are memory (how certain
chemicals trigger recall) and the plight of animals. Rothschild
argues compellingly for animal consciousness and is trying to
reform how farm animals are housed and slaughtered in England.
She is remorseful about some of the experiments she conducted in
the past. "People should be taught when they are young that they
<I>have</I> to consider the value of the experiment before they
start in on it. It is absolutely not enough to be interested. But
you get so carried away with interest that you lose all sense of
proportion." <P>
Further, Rothschild is studying telepathy in several dogs and
cats that appear to be able to tell when their owners are
returning from a trip or are telephoning, even though no one else
in the household knows of these events. She has put out ads
("Anyone whose dog or cat anticipates their return, please
communicate") and is trying to design experiments to test her
theory. "There are quite a few funny things about dogs and
telepathy," Rothschild remarks and recounts how early one morning
she was awakened in London, far from home, by her dog barking.
She called her staff at Ashton Wold and discovered the dog had
been barking for a while. "Probably coincidence, but now I feel
as though I need to look into it." <P>
And then there is the paper on ladybirds she needs to look into,
as well as lost papers of her father's that have just been found
and the meadow of Biblical flowers she would like to create and
the book she is writing about Proust and the weather. "There
comes a moment when counting the bristles on fleas becomes a
bore," Rothschild says, explaining why she has always veered off
into "corny" writing. But then art and science are not really so
far apart. "My great thing is that I believe the two are very
similar and should go together," she says. "You see, I am an
amateur, not a professional zoologist. Because if I was one, life
would have made me specialize more severely."

<H2>WONDERS</H2>
<I>by Philip Morrison</I>       
<CENTER><H2>Planet-tude</H2></CENTER>
<P>

<P>
The East London Daily Dispatch enlightens many readers far from its city desk in that busy South African port. On the rural Fort Hare campus one Monday last October, I was exhilarated by a laconic front-page Dispatch story. It told of a planet orbiting the faintly visible sunlike star 51 Pegasi, a credible discovery just announced by two Geneva Observatory astronomers, Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz. Long wistful for just such a find, I eagerly queried my astronomical friends in California by e-mail. Did they believe this report? My ingenuous question from the far-off Eastern Cape put me into the loop; expert opinions and data poured overseas into our node @ufh.ac.za.
<P>
Within the month the Californians-R. Paul Butler, Geoffrey W. Marcy and their team at San Francisco State University, Berkeley and Lick Observatory-had fully verified the Geneva data during a sleepless week at their own telescope. By January 1996 that group had twice lengthened the planet tally. Now we can point to three sunlike stars that shine upon giant planets, as does our sun. All are on the lists of the few hundred candidate stars in our galactic neighborhood, rather freely dubbed sunlike. Observers have been searching these for indirect signs of planets. Groups are hard at work in several countries. The count of systems is sure to grow swiftly, maybe even to plenitude (planet-tude?).
<P>
Once I filled in the implications, tilting only a little toward optimism, I stood breathless. Star counts of the Milky Way offer quite adequate reason to set the total number of long-lived, stable, sunlike stars at a few percent of the entire star population of this galaxy's disk. You may prudently exclude from consideration sunlike stars much older or younger than the sun, as well as many more stars in binary systems. I estimate that easily a billion stars in our own galaxy resemble Sol. The sample of planets among them is still very small, yet it supports a reasonable bet that unless the stars nearby are somehow exceptional, 10 million such suns illuminate recognizable planets.
<P>
Why were the planets so hidden from us? Our own experience as planet dwellers allows a direct answer. In your sky after dusk this spring, an exceptional evening star blazes forth. This jewel of the wanderers, after the sun and the moon the brightest body of all, is still the "Lady of the Evening, radiant on the horizon," as she was for ancient Ur. Consider what you see. Bright Venus is roughly as far from us as is our sun. Her nature should not be assessed by comparison to the remote stars she so outshines, but to the dazzling disk of the sun hidden at night below the horizon. Imagine moving our sun out among the stars a few light-years away. That will transform its appearance from the hot disk we live by to a mere point of light in a dark sky, like its kin.
<P>
Then suppose Venus were sent to orbit that sun-star. The two lights, Venus and the sun, would still be at the same distance from you. If the sunlight is so dimmed by distance, the light of Venus is diminished in the same ratio. Venus placed near any other star will vanish, a point of light far fainter than the stars we see, a billion times dimmer than the starlike sun. It is patent that even with big telescopes we will have a hard time viewing directly the planets of other stars: someday, yes. Our news of distant planets has not come from seeing them. Planets are "dark matter"; all we can spot are silvery cloud tops or sunstruck lands passively returning a small amount of the light of their own glowing star. It is their suns we must watch, faintly visible proxies for their own much too faint satellites.
<P>

<P>
Our present success exploits the gravitational influence exerted by every planet on its more massive sun. Today's searchers ably detect minute changes in a star's speed as a planet pulls feebly against it. Indeed, the first credible extrasolar planets were well established in 1992 and 1993 by exquisitely timing the natural radio pulses emitted every six milliseconds by a certain very rapid pulsar. Timing those near uniform pulses, collected by the billion, allowed the precise measurement of very slight irregularities.
<P>
The recurring advances and delays in pulse arrival time could be fitted well by the pulsar response to forces produced by two planetary masses, plausibly near the pulsar. But a pulsar is a neutron star, a creature of catastrophic collapse. Its nature and history are so unlike our sun's that its mnage seems less than clearly relevant to our solar system. Those pulsar planets may even have been formed somehow during the explosive supernova event itself.
<P>
Normal stars emit no sharp ticks. The successful planet finders have been at work for years with simple starlight to measure the Doppler shifts of the familiar dark lines in the usual stellar spectrum, but now with startling sensitivity. Our account will draw on the procedure used by the Californians, but its virtuoso performance and that of other groups depend alike on modern instrumentation and similar insights into principles.
<P>
At the big Lick reflector (3.5 meters in diameter), a very fast, grating spectrograph accepts only a small range of the optical spectrum, albeit with very high resolution. All detection is done by counting the photons with a large charge-coupled device, or CCD. The positions of hundreds of absorption lines are compared with those of reference lines introduced by passing the incoming starlight through a cell filled with a little absorbing iodine vapor. The numerous sharp molecular lines of iodine throng every spectral chunk. They provide a constant basis for comparison with many closely adjoining lines from the star. The changing motions of Earth and the sun are corrected for, and the best fits to the observed Doppler speeds of the star lines are computed from the large sample of shifts.
<P>
The spectral lines of a star all shift together as its motion responds to the planet's force. No single line shift is very significant, but abundant statistics cancel random error in the atmosphere and within the instrument, while opening unprecedented sensitivity to small accelerations. Isolated stars nearby typically move through space toward or away from us at a constant rate of 10 or 20 kilometers per second, about the speed of a space probe. Only changes in that steady speed count.
<P>
For example, Jupiter enforces a changing reflex motion as it orbits our sun, because between the two, gravitational action and reaction are equal. Because the sun outweighs Jupiter 1,000-fold, its response to Jupiter is grudging, so its solar recoil orbit is both tiny and slow. The sun's speed changes are at most that of a racing cyclist, a minor change in any star drift. Note that rocky Earth, only 1/300 of Jupiter's gassy mass, can disturb

CONNECTIONS<BR>
by <B>James Burke</B>
<H2>Highbrow Stuff</H2>
<P>
I got one of those junk-mail fliers through the post the other day, urging me to sign up for study-by-mail on the subject of memory improvement. If only I knew where or what my memory was, I thought, I'd do anything to improve it!
<P>
Still, we know more than we used to about such neurophysiological matters, thanks in part to the kind of junk mail that was sent out in the 1850s by Isaac Pitman and his business partners in their efforts to promote a totali nu wei uv speling Inglish. Alas, their efforts came to naught (or nought), and they switched instead to selling correspondence courses for a phonetically based writing technique we now know as shorthand.
<P>
Pitman's original reason for attempting to turn English into WYSIWYG was because it isn't. Try pronouncing "Featherstonehaugh," if your mother tongue isn't British<B> </B>English. Go ahead and try, even if you speak English from parts American, Australian, New Zealander, Canadian or South African. (Give up? It's "Fanshaw.") Pitman believed that world peace would be more rapidly achieved if, by making words such as "Featherstonehaugh" simpler to read and pronounce, all those foreign "johnnies" could be more easily exposed to the "civilizing" influence of English English.
<P>
Harrumph. The idea took root, although on a much grander scale than the single-minded Pitman might have hoped for, and in 1897 it flowered as the International Phonetic Alphabet. Which made every language easier to read and pronounce.
<P>
Top gun in phonetics was Henry Sweet, after whom George Bernard Shaw modeled Professor Higgins in Pygmalion (a.k.a. My Fair Lady). As it happens, in the play, Higgins notes down the character Eliza's speech patterns using "visible speech," another set of symbols that had been developed long before by Alexander Graham Bell's father, an elocution teacher who had been a founding member of the British Phonetics Council. By the 1870s Bell, Jr., was busy visualizing sound, too, for the deaf students he was teaching in Boston.
<P>
It was at this juncture that he came across a thing called a phonautograph, developed by the otherwise entirely forgotten E. Leon Scott de Martinville. The device was fairly primitive: a membrane vibrated in reaction to speech, and a bristle attached to the other side of the membrane traced wiggly marks on a moving piece of smoked glass. With the phonautograph, Bell was able to show his pupils the correct "shape" of the sound they were trying to make, so that they could then compare their own attempts to imitate it.
<P>
The whole wiggly-line phenomenon probably had its origin in an invention years earlier by a French physiologist by the name of Etienne J. Marey, who fitted a membrane on a tiny drum (a "tambour") and placed this device wherever he wanted vital rhythms to be turned into graphs. When pressure of any kind depressed the membrane, the air in the tambour would be forced along a tube to push against a membrane fitted to another tambour at the far end of the tube. A stylus mounted on this second membrane would move in response and trace a line. With the tambour, still in general medical use as late as 1955, Marey could reduce virtually any kind of physiological vibrations to lines. He called his squiggles "the language of life."
<P>
That the innovation should have come from France made sense because in the early 1800s, Parisian hospitals were far in advance of those anywhere else. Even the English came over to take notes. Harrumph.
<P>
Paris was where ward rounds and charts and stethoscopic diagnosis and medical statistics first became commonly accepted. And along with all that, the unquestioned authority of doctors,<B> </B>stemming in part from Napoleon and his idea of winning wars by numbers. His million-strong army was the first to be established by nationwide conscription; inevitably, droves of young soldiers went from battlefield to hospital, ever obedient to discipline.
<P>
<P>
Numbers also did the trick for medical technology, because there were so many war-wounded that hospital staff could now easily gather really large-scale, statistically meaningful amounts of data on the efficacy of patient evaluation and treatment. And so those wiggly lines began to appear at the foot of the bed, charting the course<B> </B>of a patient's temperature, respiration and heart rate,<B> </B>or any other physical condition that could be reduced to lines and figures. 
<P>
Which, late in the century, left the uncharted field of<B> </B>psychological disorders and their treatment with a brand-new Viennese technique touted as "Mesmerism." Franz A. Mesmer's assistants would first examine patients to locate their "magnetic poles," whereupon Mesmer himself would appear (in feathered hat and long robes) to stroke relevant areas of their body, transmitting a mysterious, curative "influence" to the sufferer. 
<P>
Despite the fact that such hardheads as Benjamin Franklin officially pronounced Mesmer a fake, the concept of this influence persisted. The idea had, after all, already been around for 300 years. Even Descartes had thought a "vital spirit" flowed down the nerves from the pineal gland. For this reason, by 1820 two more hucksters, Franz J. Gall and Johann C. Spurzheim, were parlaying<B> </B>the new "science" of phrenology. This was based on the theory that an "influential liquid" originated in 37 separate organs in the brain, each responsible for a moral, sexual or intellectual trait; your character could be assessed by feeling the bumps in the skull above them. If you had a bump behind the left ear, for instance, you were a good lover. (Did you just check?) 
<P>
By 1876 a fellow called Cesare Lombroso, director of a lunatic asylum, had studied thousands of heads (living and dead) and had arrived at the conclusion that Charles Darwin's theory of human descent from apes was right. It was Lombroso who spread the word about criminals and the insane being "throwbacks" with sloping foreheads. "Neanderthal" had become the new buzzword occasioned by the recent German discovery of ancient human bones in the Neander Valley. 
<P>
Conservatives took Lombroso's remarks about "criminal characteristics" to mean that criminality was innate and from this inferred that for the "born" criminal, a life-term sentence or execution was the only option. Liberals saw in bump-reading the opportunity for rehabilitation and prison reform. The new welfare agencies found themselves with an extra tool for investigation and self-improvement. 
<P>
Perhaps the most startling outcome of Lombroso's work was the effect it had on a young man who was briefly Lombroso's assistant in 1872. The job required him to carry out postmortem dissections, and intrigued by talk about bumps of knowledge and lowbrows, he began to slice brains in his kitchen and peer at them with the microscope that his pathologist uncle-by-marriage happened to have. 
<P>
Sometime in 1873, perhaps stimulated by reading about the new chemistry of photography, he left a piece of brain to harden in a mix of potassium bichromate and osmium chloride, then dunked it in a solution of silver nitrate. When he cut very fine sections of the material, dried them and lit them from behind, he found something that would change how we think about how we think. What Camillo Golgi saw was a golden-yellow background of tissue, within which were visible, in glorious and finely detailed black, the brain cells that today bear his name. From that single experiment, the whole of modern neurophysiology was to emerge. 
<P>
So if somebody ever does succeed in discovering where your memory resides and how it can be improved, it'll probably be thanks to Golgi and the phrenology freaks. And that junk mail I mentioned at the start (remember?).

<P>
After the <A HREF="http://greatbend.com/%7Erob.graham/burdett.htm">discovery of Pluto</A> in 1930, many astronomers became intrigued by the possibility of finding a 10th planet circling the sun. Cloaked by the vast distances of interplanetary space, the mysterious "Planet X" might have remained hidden from even the best telescopic sight, or so these scientists reasoned. Yet decades passed without detection, and most researchers began to accept that the solar system was restricted to the familiar set of nine planets.
<P>
But many scientists began seriously rethinking their notions of the solar system in 1992, when we identified a <A HREF="http://earth.agu.org/revgeophys/muhlem01/node6.html">small celestial body</A> -just a few hundred kilometers across-sited farther from the sun than any of the known planets. Since that time, we have identified nearly three dozen such objects circling through the outer solar system. A host of similar objects is likely to be traveling with them, making up the so-called <A HREF="http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/faculty/jewitt/kb.html">Kuiper belt</A>), a region named for Dutch-American astronomer Gerard P. Kuiper, who, in 1951, championed the idea that the solar system contains this distant family.
<P>
What led Kuiper, nearly half a century ago, to believe the disk of the solar system was populated with numerous small bodies orbiting at great distances from the sun? His conviction grew from a fundamental knowledge of the behavior of certain comets-masses of ice and rock that on a regular schedule plunge from the outer reaches of the solar system inward toward the sun. Many of these comparatively small objects periodically provide spectacular appearances when the sun's rays warm them enough to drive dust and gas off their surfaces into luminous halos (creating large "comae") and elongate tails.
<P>
Astronomers have long realized that such active comets must be relatively new members of the inner solar system. A body such as <A HREF="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/halley.html">Halley's comet</A>, which swings into view every 76 years, loses about one ten-thousandth of its mass on each visit near the sun. That comet will survive for only about 10,000 orbits, lasting perhaps half a million years in all. Such comets were created during the formation of the solar system 4.5 billion years ago and should have completely lost their volatile constituents by now, leaving behind either inactive, rocky nuclei or diffuse streams of dust. Why then are so many comets still around--including the latest cosmic spectacle, <A HREF="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/comet/hyakutake/">Comet Hyakutake</A>-- to dazzle onlookers with their displays?
<P>

The comets that are currently active formed in the earliest days of the solar system, but they have since been stored in an inactive state-most of them preserved within a celestial deep freeze called the <A HREF="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/kboc.html">Oort cloud</A>. The Dutch astronomer Jan H. Oort proposed the existence of this sphere of cometary material in 1950. He believed that this cloud had a diameter of about 100,000 astronomical units (AU-a distance defined as the average separation between Earth and the sun, about 150 million kilometers) and that it contained several hundred billion individual comets. In Oort's conception, the random gravitational jostling of stars passing nearby knocks some of the outer comets in the cloud from their stable orbits and gradually deflects their paths to dip toward the sun.
<P>
For most of the past half a century, Oort's hypothesis neatly explained the size and orientation of the trajectories that the so-called long-period comets (those that take more than 200 years to circle the sun) follow. Astronomers find that those bodies fall into the planetary region from random directions-as would be expected for comets originating in a spherical repository like the Oort cloud. In contrast, Oort's hypothesis could not explain short-period comets that normally occupy smaller orbits tilted only slightly from the orbital plane of Earth-a plane that astronomers call the ecliptic. [<A HREF="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/comets.html">Resources for learning more about comets</A> are available through the Internet.]
<P>
Most astronomers believed that the short-period comets originally traveled in immense, randomly oriented orbits (as the long-period comets do today) but that they were diverted by the gravity of the planets-primarily Jupiter-into their current orbital configuration. Yet not all scientists subscribed to this idea. As early as 1949, Kenneth Essex Edgeworth, an Irish gentleman-scientist (who was not affiliated with any research institution) wrote a scholarly article suggesting that there could be a flat ring of comets in the outer solar system. In his 1951 paper, Kuiper also discussed such a belt of comets, but he did not refer to Edgeworth's previous work. 
<P>
Kuiper and others reasoned that the disk of the solar system should not end abruptly at Neptune or Pluto (which vie with each other for the distinction of being the planet most distant from the sun). He envisioned instead a belt beyond Neptune and Pluto consisting of residual material left over from the formation of the planets. The density of matter in this outer region would be so low that large planets could not have accreted there, but smaller objects, perhaps of asteroidal dimensions, might exist. Because these scattered remnants of primordial material were so far from the sun, they would maintain low surface temperatures. It thus seemed likely that these distant objects would be composed of water ice and various frozen gases-making them quite similar (if not identical) to the nuclei of comets.
<P>
Kuiper's hypothesis languished until the 1970s, when Paul C. Joss of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology began to question whether Jupiter's gravity could in fact efficiently transform long-period comets into short-period ones. He noted that the probability of gravitational capture was so small that the large number of short-period comets that now exists simply did not make sense. Other researchers were, however, unable to confirm this result, and the Oort cloud remained the accepted source of the comets, long and short period alike.
<P>
But Joss had sown a seed of doubt, and eventually other astronomers started to question the accepted view. In 1980 Julio A. Fernndez (then at the Max Planck Institute for Aeronomy in Katlenburg-Lindau) had, for example, done calculations that suggested that short-period comets could come from Kuiper's proposed trans-Neptunian source. In 1988 Martin J. Duncan of the University of Toronto, Thomas Quinn and <A HREF="http://www.physics.utoronto.ca/department/faculty/tremaine.html">Scott D. Tremaine</A> (both at the Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics) used computer simulations to investigate how the giant gaseous planets could capture comets. Like Joss, they found that the process worked rather poorly, raising doubts about the veracity of this well-established concept for the origin of short-period comets. Indeed, their studies sounded a new alarm because they noted that the few comets that could be drawn from the Oort cloud by the gravitational tug of the major planets should be traveling in a spherical swarm, whereas the orbits of the short-period comets tend to lie in planes close to the ecliptic.
<P>
Duncan, Quinn and Tremaine reasoned that short-period comets must have been captured from original orbits that were canted only slightly from the ecliptic, perhaps from a flattened belt of comets in the outer solar system. But their so-called Kuiper belt hypothesis was not beyond question. In order to make their calculations tractable, they had exaggerated the masses of the outer planets as much as 40 times (thereby increasing the amount of gravitational attraction and speeding up the orbital evolution they desired to examine). Other astrophysicists wondered whether this computational sleight of hand might have led to an incorrect conclusion.
<P>
<P>
<B><A NAME="Why">Why Not Just Look?</A>
<P>
</B>
<P>
Even before Duncan, Quinn and Tremaine published their work, we wondered whether the outer solar system was truly empty or instead full of small, unseen bodies. In 1987 we began a telescopic survey intended to address exactly that question. Our plan was to look for any objects that might be present in the outer solar system using the meager amount of sunlight that would be reflected back from such great distances. Although our initial efforts employed photographic plates, we soon decided that a more promising approach was to use an electronic detector (a charge-coupled device, or CCD) attached to one of the larger telescopes.
<P>
We conducted the bulk of our survey using the University of Hawaii's 2.2-meter telescope on Mauna Kea. Our strategy was to use a CCD array with this instrument to take four sequential, 15-minute exposures of a particular segment of the sky. We then enlisted a computer to display the images in the sequence in quick succession-a process astronomers call "blinking." An object that shifts slightly in the image against the background of stars (which appear fixed) will reveal itself as a member of the solar system.
<P>
For five years, we continued the search with only negative results. But the technology available to us was improving so rapidly that it was easy to maintain enthusiasm (if not funds) in the continuing hunt for our elusive quarry. On August 30, 1992, we were taking the third of a four-exposure sequence while blinking the first two images on a computer. We noticed that the position of one faint "star" appeared to move slightly between the successive frames. We both fell silent. The motion was quite subtle, but it seemed definite. When we compared the first two images with the third, we realized that we had indeed found something out of the ordinary. Its slow motion across the sky indicated that the newly discovered object could be traveling beyond even the outer reaches of Pluto's distant orbit. Still, we were suspicious that the mysterious object might be a near-Earth asteroid moving in parallel with Earth (which might also cause a slow apparent motion). But further measurements ruled out that possibility.
<P>
We observed the curious body again on the next two nights and obtained accurate measurements of its position, brightness and color. We then communicated these data to Brian G. Marsden, director of the International Astronomical Union's Central <A HREF="http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/cfa/ps/cbat.html">Bureau of Astronomical Telegrams</A> at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory in Cambridge, Mass. His calculations indicated that the object we had discovered was indeed orbiting the sun at a vast distance (40 AU)-only slightly less remote than we had first supposed. He assigned the newly discovered body a formal, if somewhat drab, name based on the date of discovery: he christened it "1992 QB1." (We preferred to call it "Smiley," after John Le Carr's fictional spy, but that name did not take hold within the conservative astronomical community.)
<P>
Our observations showed that QB1 reflects light that is quite rich in red hues compared with the sunlight that illuminates it. This odd coloring matched only one other object in the solar system-a peculiar asteroid or comet called 5145 Pholus. Planetary astronomers attribute the red color of 5145 Pholus to the presence of dark, carbon-rich material on its surface. The similarity between QB1 and 5145 Pholus thus heightened our excitement during the first days after the discovery. Perhaps the object we had just located was coated by some kind of red material abundant in organic compounds. How big was this ruddy new world? From our first series of measurements, we estimated that QB1 was between 200 and 250 kilometers across-about 15 times the size of the nucleus of Halley's comet.
<P>
Some astronomers initially doubted whether our discovery of QB1 truly signified the existence of a population of objects in the outer solar system, as Kuiper and others had hypothesized. But such questioning began to fade when we found a second body in March 1993. This object is as far from the sun as QB1 but is located on the opposite side of the solar system. During the past three years, several other research groups have joined the effort, and a steady stream of discoveries--including some <A HREF="http://www.stsci.edu/pubinfo/PR/95/26.html">confirming observations</A> from the Hubble Space Telescope--has ensued. The current count of trans-Neptunian, Kuiper belt objects is 32.
<P>
The <A HREF="http://www.ifa/hawaii.edu/%7Ejchen/kbo.html">known members of the Kuiper belt</A> share a number of characteristics. They are, for example, all located beyond the orbit of Neptune, suggesting that the inner edge of the belt may be defined by this planet. All these newly found celestial bodies travel in orbits that are only slightly tilted from the ecliptic-an observation consistent with the existence of a flat belt of comets. Each of the Kuiper belt objects is millions of times fainter than can be seen with the naked eye. The 32 objects range in diameter from 100 to 400 kilometers, making them considerably smaller than both <A HREF="http://bang.lanl.gov/solarsys/pluto.htm#views">Pluto</A> (which is about 2,300 kilometers wide) and its satellite, <A HREF="http://eisbahn.ucg.ie/nineplanets/pluto.html#charon">Charon</A>, (which measures about 1,100 kilometers across).
<P>
The current sampling is still quite modest, but the number of new solar system bodies found so far is sufficient to establish beyond doubt the existence of the Kuiper belt. It is also clear that the belt's total population must be substantial. We estimate that the Kuiper belt contains at least 35,000 objects larger than 100 kilometers in diameter. Hence, the Kuiper belt probably has a total mass that is hundreds of times larger than the well-known asteroid belt between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter.
<P>
<P>
<B><A NAME="Cold">Cold Storage for Comets</A>
<P>
</B>
<P>
The Kuiper belt may be rich in material, but can it in fact serve as the supply source for the rapidly consumed short-period comets? Matthew J. Holman and Jack L. Wisdom, both then at M.I.T., addressed this problem using computer simulations. They showed that within a span of 100,000 years the gravitational influence of the giant gaseous planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune) ejects comets orbiting in their vicinity, sending them out to the farthest reaches of the solar system. But a substantial percentage of trans-Neptunian comets can escape this fate and remain in the belt even after 4.5 billion years. Hence, Kuiper belt objects located more than 40 AU from the sun are likely to have held in stable orbits since the formation of the solar system.
<P>
Astronomers also believe there has been sufficient mass in the Kuiper belt to supply all the short-period comets that have ever been formed. So the Kuiper belt seems to be a good candidate for a cometary storehouse. And the mechanics of the transfer out of storage is now well understood. Computer simulations have shown that Neptune's gravity slowly erodes the inner edge of the Kuiper belt (the region within 40 AU of the sun), launching objects from that zone into the inner solar system. Ultimately, many of these small bodies slowly burn up as comets. Some-such as Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9, which collided with Jupiter in July 1994-may end their lives suddenly by striking a planet (or perhaps the sun). Others will be caught in a gravitational slingshot that ejects them into the far reaches of interstellar space.
<P>
If the Kuiper belt is the source of short-period comets, another obvious question emerges: Are any comets now on their way from the Kuiper belt into the inner solar system? The answer may lie in the Centaurs, a group of objects that includes the extremely red 5145 Pholus. Centaurs travel in huge planet-crossing orbits that are fundamentally unstable. They can remain among the giant planets for only a few million years before gravitational interactions either send them out of the solar system or transfer them into tighter orbits.
<P>
With orbital lifetimes that are far shorter than the age of the solar system, the Centaurs could not have formed where they currently are found. Yet the nature of their orbits makes it practically impossible to deduce their place of origin with certainty. Nevertheless, the nearest (and most likely) reservoir is the Kuiper belt. The Centaurs may thus be "transition comets," former Kuiper belt objects heading toward short but showy lives within the inner solar system. The strongest evidence supporting this hypothesis comes from one particular Centaur-2060 <A HREF="http://www.vub.ac.be/STER/www.astro/chihp.htm">Chiron</A>. Although its discoverers first thought it was just an unusual asteroid, 2060 Chiron is now firmly established as an active comet with a weak but persistent coma.
<P>
As astronomers continue to study the Kuiper belt, some have started to wonder whether this reservoir might have yielded more than just comets. Is it coincidence that Pluto, its satellite, Charon, and the Neptunian satellite Triton lie in the vicinity of the Kuiper belt? This question stems from the realization that Pluto, Charon and Triton share similarities in their own basic properties but differ drastically from their neighbors. The Hubble Space Telescope has recently produced the <A HREF="http://www.stsci.edu/pubinfo/PR/96/09.html">first direct images of Pluto</A> and Charon.
<P>
<P>
<B><A NAME="Peculiar">A Peculiar Trio</A>
<P>
</B>
<P>
The densities of both Pluto and Triton, for instance, are much higher than any of the giant gaseous planets of the outer solar system. The orbital motions of these bodies are also quite strange. Triton revolves around Neptune in the "retrograde" direction-opposite to the orbital direction of all planets and most satellites. Pluto's orbit slants highly from the ecliptic, and it is so far from circular that it actually crosses the orbit of Neptune. Pluto is, however, protected from possible collision with the larger planet by a special orbital relationship known as a 3:2 mean-motion resonance. Simply put, for every three orbits of Neptune around the sun, Pluto completes two.
<P>
The pieces of the celestial puzzle may fit together if one postulates that Pluto, Charon and Triton are the last survivors of a once much larger set of similarly sized objects. S. Alan Stern of the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder first suggested this idea in 1991. These three bodies may have been swept up by Neptune, which captured Triton and locked Pluto-perhaps with Charon in tow-into its present orbital resonance.
<P>
Interestingly, orbital resonances appear to influence the position of many Kuiper belt objects as well. Up to one half of the newly discovered bodies have the same 3:2 mean-motion resonance as Pluto and, like that planet, may orbit serenely for billions of years. (The resonance prevents Neptune from approaching too closely and disturbing the orbit of the smaller body.) We have dubbed such Kuiper belt objects <A HREF="http://ifa.hawaii.edu/faculty/jewitt/plutino.html">Plutinos</A> -"little Plutos." Judging from the small part of the sky we have examined, we estimate that there must be several thousand Plutinos larger than 100 kilometers across.
<P>
The recent discoveries of objects in the Kuiper belt provide a new perspective on the outer solar system. Pluto now appears special only because it is larger than any other member of the Kuiper belt. One might even question whether Pluto deserves the status of a full-fledged planet. Strangely, a line of research that began with attempts to find a 10th planet may, in a sense, have succeeded in reducing the final count to eight. This irony, along with the many intriguing observations we have made of Kuiper belt objects, reminds us that our solar system contains countless surprises.

Surfing the Internet is no longer just a seductive pastime. In rising numbers, organizations of all kinds, from computer companies to publishing firms, are turning to on-line services that operate much like the World Wide Web. These services can help manage important information, speed decision making and improve efficiency. But as more and more enterprises become dependent on this new technology, many are also exposed to the downside of computer networking. The drawbacks are particularly evident to users of distributed computing systems, which link programs, servers and data files dispersed across an extended network of computers and terminals.
<P>
As every computer user knows, programs that operate across networks are prone to failure. Indeed, Leslie B. Lamport, a pioneer in distributed computing at <A HREF="http://www.research.digital.com/SRC/org/distributed-systems.html">Digital Equipment Corporation</A>, defined a distributed computing system as "one in which the failure of a computer you didn't even know existed can render your own computer unusable." The Web is certainly not exempt from breakdowns, as one of us (Birman) explains in a <A HREF="0596birmanbox5.html">related story</A>. During late 1995, users of the Web reported several "brownouts," when communication on the Internet was largely impossible. Such lapses have been variously attributed to software errors, excessive traffic on transmission lines, and overload or complete failure of the Web servers, which are computers that store the documents users access from their workstations. Most likely, a combination of factors contributes to brownouts. Unfortunately, similar events will multiply as computer networks-not just the World Wide Web but also distributed computing systems serving banks, schools and many offices-continue to expand.
<P>
When computers crash, sometimes the only casualties are the user's time and temper. If the automated bank teller nearest you is not working, the one across the street from it may be. But the shutdown of very complicated networks can have dire consequences. On July 15, 1994, the NASDAQ stock exchange, an exclusively electronic stock market, opened two hours late because of a mysterious problem that compromised the entire system. Initially, workers thought a software bug triggered the shutdown, but the error was ultimately traced to a malfunctioning disk. Because trading was delayed only for a few hours, little revenue was lost. Yet the event could have been a catastrophe: the market would have faced enormous losses had trading not resumed when it did. 
<P>
In another example, from January 1990, the AT&AMPT telephone system experienced a large-scale outage when an electronic switch within the system failed. Calls were automatically shifted to a backup switch, but this switch also crashed because of a software bug. The failure rippled through the network, resulting in a nationwide shutdown that lasted for nine hours, during which 60,000 people lost all telephone service and 70 million telephone calls could not be completed. To anyone familiar with the challenges of managing even a simple network, the surprise is not that these mishaps occur but rather that they are not more frequent.

Even a brief distributed systems failure can pose a significant problem for applications that require around-the-clock operation. Air-traffic-control and financial computer networks must be exceedingly reliable and constantly updated. A message that a "host is not responding" or a misleading display that shows out-of-date information about an airplane's flight path or a stock's price could easily provoke an accident or financial misadventure. As the way people live and work continues to be transformed, the security and stability of their finances, property and even health will increasingly depend on distributed computer systems. Thus, although it is easy to talk about the potential benefits of the information superhighway, we believe the bridges that link computers must be inspected more closely. Various computer scientists, including the two of us, have been working since the late 1970s on developing software to improve distributed computer networks, making them more secure and resistant to failure-an activity that people in the field refer to as designing robust distributed computing systems.
<P>
Why do distributed systems crash? If we exclude systems that fail because they were mismanaged or poorly designed, the most common scenario involves an isolated problem at one site that triggers a chain of events in which program after program throughout the network eventually shuts down. One response to this threat might be to strengthen individual components-incorporating computers and disks specially designed to tolerate faults, for example. But ceilings can still leak, causing short circuits; power can fluctuate; and communications connections can be inadvertently cut. Acts of sabotage by hackers or disgruntled employees can also endanger distributed systems. Although engineers and computer programmers can improve the durability of hardware and software, no computer can ever be made completely reliable. 
<P>
Even if every component of a system were extremely dependable, the story would not end there. Merely interconnecting reliable computers and bug-free programs does not yield a robust distributed system. Instead it produces a network that works well under most conditions. Electronic-mail programs, bulletin boards and the Web were designed using components that, considered individually, are very trustworthy. Yet these systems frequently freeze when anything unexpected happens to an individual component of the system; for instance, the system may crash when one machine or a communications line becomes overloaded. Some additional form of protection is therefore needed.
<P>
During the past two decades, programmers have attacked the dependability problem by developing fault-tolerant software-programs that allow computer systems to restore normal operation even when problems occur. The technique eliminates the chains of internal dependencies that link the operation of a system as a whole to the operation of any single component. The resulting systems do not need to shut down even if some sites go off-line. Instead they resume service by rapidly reconfiguring to work around crashed servers. 
<P>
<P>
<B><A NAME="Saved">Saved by the Backup</A>
<P>
</B>
<P>
Computer scientists refer to these arrangements as highly available distributed systems. Because these systems are designed to replicate critical information continuously and to distribute multiple backup copies among their individual computers, they can adapt to changing conditions-a malfunctioning disk drive at one site, an overload at another, a broken communications connection and so forth. As long as failures do not occur so often that the software lacks time to react, these systems can respond by pulling up from elsewhere a duplicate copy of a needed file or a replica of an on-line program. In this way, a system as a whole remains available and, ideally, provides uninterrupted service to the users still connected.
<P>
A simple and popular method of building a highly available distributed system involves a primary and a backup system. If the primary machine fails, the backup can be called into service. Switching between the two is easy if the data never change. The conversion becomes difficult, however, if data or files change while the system is running. And in an extensive network of servers, data, files and programs, it can be difficult to distinguish between a system that has genuinely crashed and one that is merely experiencing communications difficulties.
<P>
Suppose that a computer is trying to update information on both the primary and backup servers, but one of them stops responding to messages. If the problem is merely in the communications lines, the messages will get through, given enough time. But if the server has actually failed, the computer doing the updating would wait indefinitely; in the meantime, the system would be unavailable. If the computer trying to carry out the update inappropriately stops waiting and sends the update to only one server, however, the primary and the backup will no longer be identical. Errors will arise if the system attempts to use the outdated server.
<P>
The NASDAQ financial market illustrates one way to resolve this conundrum. The network has two central trading servers. To prevent confusion, only one is active at any given time. The NASDAQ operators themselves decide when to switch to the replacement server. Unfortunately, very few distributed systems can rely on the wisdom of a human operator to detect failures and then to switch the entire network from one server to another. Rather programmers must automate this decision so that the transition can occur seamlessly. 
<P>
Moreover, highly available distributed systems often have large numbers of servers and programs. Consequently, these systems typically maintain a membership list, which keeps track of every program, noting whether it is working or not. If a program is unresponsive for any reason, it is marked as faulty. By recognizing a failure at one site, the system can then reconfigure itself and redirect work to operational sites.
<P>
The NASDAQ system also demonstrates a second concern about reliability in distributed systems. The two-hour trading delay in 1994 could have been avoided if the operators had switched immediately to the backup. They opted to wait, however, because of concerns that a software bug might have caused the primary system to malfunction. If such a bug were present, the backup might also crash, just as the AT&AMPT backup system did. Because it is impossible to guarantee that software is completely free of bugs, some form of protection is needed to reduce the risk that backup versions of a critical server will crash following the failure of a primary server.
<P>
Programmers have responded to this challenge with an approach known as active replication. In active replication, a system's software establishes redundant copies of vital programs or servers through the use of so-called process groups. A process group links a set of programs that cooperate closely. A distributed system may contain many process groups, and programs can belong to several of these groups. Each group is known by a name much like a file name and has its own list of current members. Most important, the process group provides a means for sending messages to its members. This message-passing function ensures that each member of the group receives every message in the same order, even if the sender crashes while transmitting the message.
<P>
If a particular program is necessary for maintaining availability, the system introduces a group of programs, each of which replicates the original. To update the data managed by the replicated program, the system sends a message to the process group. Each member reacts by updating its particular replica. Because all the programs see the same updates in the same order, they will remain in mutually consistent states. 
<P>
Active replication enables a system to tolerate faults because any group member can handle any request: if one machine crashes, work can be redirected to an operational site. Furthermore, if a request does not alter data, one site can process the query rather than tie up the entire system. In this way, multiple tasks can be worked on at once by different programs, speeding up the application by employing parallel processing.
<P>
Of course, if all members of a process group handle an incoming message in the same erroneous manner, all the members could, in theory, crash simultaneously. Although it would seem that active replication should be vulnerable to such failures, this turns out not to be the case. Programmers have often observed that the errors most likely to be missed in testing software are those involving the order in which data are received. These bugs can be provoked only by unlikely sequences or timings of events. When a system employs active replication, the replicas do see the same updates in the same order; however, updates are only a small part of the requests a program sees. Most of the time, replicated programs work in parallel, with each program handling its own set of queries in a unique order. Thus, even if a software bug slips through testing and interferes with a few parts of a networked application, it is unlikely to cause all the members of any particular process group to crash at the same time. 
<P>
The idea behind active replication is simple, but the software needed to support it is not. Managing dynamically changing membership lists and communicating with process groups is difficult, particularly in the face of inevitable crashes and lost messages. Although distributed computing has become commonplace over the past decade, active replication has only recently emerged from the laboratory.

<B><A NAME="Tool">Tool Kits for Robust Networks</A>
<P>
</B>
<P>
Over the past few years, more than a dozen software teams have developed packages for robust distributed computing systems. All provide high availability through active replication, although they each differ somewhat in their emphasis. Some packages focus on speed, for example; others on the need for security.
<P>
Our research efforts at Cornell University contributed two such packages. One of us (Birman) headed the team that introduced Isis in 1987; more recently, the two of us worked on Horus, introduced in 1994. Information about Isis and <A HREF="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/Info/Projects/ISIS/ISIS.html">Horus</A> is available on the Cornell server; there is also a <A HREF="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/Info/Projects/HORUS/">separate Horus site</A>. The names "Isis" and "Horus" allude to Egyptian mythology. The goddess Isis helped to revive the god Osiris after he was torn to pieces in a battle with the war god Set; Horus was Isis's son, who eventually triumphed over Set. By analogy, the Isis and Horus packages can help restore a distributed system that has been disrupted by a failure.
<P>
Packages such as Isis employ a set of software functions, or "tools," that replicate and update data, keep track of process groups and assist in handling membership changes. Isis can also parcel out data processing among servers (a procedure known as load sharing). Distributed systems that make use of load sharing exhibit many of the advantages of parallel computing but without requiring special-purpose parallel computers. By dividing up incoming work among multiple servers functioning in concert, Isis enables systems to manage large tasks quickly. Also, if a particular application requires additional computing power, one can add an extra server, and the load-sharing technique will adapt itself to the new group size. The possibility, offered by such tool kits as Isis and Horus, of improving both performance and reliability often surprises developers: they tend to assume that making a system more robust will also make it slower and more expensive.
<P>
Active replication has been applied in a number of settings, including several telecommunications networks, stock markets, banks and brokerages. In Norway, researchers have developed an <A HREF="http://www.cs.uit.no/DOS/StormCast/">environmental monitoring system</A> based on the technology. The French air-traffic-control agency is also exploring the technique for use in a new generation of air-traffic-control software. And manufacturing plants have used process groups to coordinate work and to reconfigure assembly lines when equipment is taken off-line to be serviced.
<P>
As computer scientists look to ever more demanding applications, however, they discover that active replication has important limitations. Load sharing is not always possible or desirable: some systems (notably, those in which data stored at a server change very rapidly) slow down when components are replicated. For example, in videoconferencing technology, active replication does improve the fault tolerance of the network of servers that must keep running even when some participants are cut off. But the technique would slow down the system-without improving dependability-if applied to the transmission of video data to remote users. 
<P>
The need for flexibility motivated us to develop Horus. Like the Isis tool kit, Horus supports active replication, but it also provides much greater versatility. The basic strategy behind Horus is modularity, resembling that of a child's set of Legos: different building blocks of Horus can fit together in any combination to support the specific needs of a particular process group. One block might encrypt data so that hackers cannot break into the system. Another block might address potential communications failures that can arise when messages are lost or corrupted. Programmers using Horus decide which properties their system actually needs, permitting them to customize the system for its intended use. Furthermore, Horus can be extended with custom-designed blocks for special needs that we may not have encountered or anticipated in our own work.
<P>
Horus has a growing group of users worldwide. At Cornell, Brian C. Smith has used it to build a videoconferencing system for "groupware" applications. Some <A HREF="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/Info/Projects/HORUS/links.html">projects related to Horus</A> are described within the Horus site.
<P>
<P>
<B><A NAME="Crisis">A Crisis of Will?</A>
<P>
</B>
<P>
Our work on Isis and Horus has convinced us that careful planning can ensure the dependability of computer networks. But making the information superhighway robust may take more time and money than computer makers and users are willing to commit. Software for distributed applications is typically built with existing technology that was not designed for dependability. Moreover, researchers need to seek better methods for designing large-scale systems that are robust and that provide very high performance: a system that is extremely robust when accessed by 50 users simultaneously may turn out to be unacceptably slow and hence unreliable if 5,000 people do so. 
<P>
Although programmers have applied the technology for robust distributed computing successfully in some instances, the public hears more about failures of nonrobust systems. For example, over the past few years, there have been dozens of reports on the problems with the current air-traffic-control system. In the fall of 1995 the Los Angeles system failed, leaving controllers unable to communicate with aircraft; a midair collision was avoided by seconds. 
<P>
To make matters worse, updated air-traffic-control software, commissioned in 1982 by the Federal Aviation Administration, has been repeatedly delayed and scaled back. The FAA selected the original proposal precisely because of its innovative approach to distributed computing; now it seems the highly available and distributed aspects of the proposed software have been almost entirely eliminated. Yet air-traffic controllers criticize the existing system as dangerously inadequate, particularly because it lacks a distributed software architecture and has become undependable with age. Highly publicized fiascoes such as these have fueled a common perception that there is a crisis in computer software [see "Software's Chronic Crisis," by W. Wayt Gibbs; Scientific American, September 1994].
<P>
But if we are really in the midst of a software development crisis, it is perhaps as much a crisis of will as of means. Not all developers are concerned with making their networking software robust, and the public pressure for reliability does not seem to extend beyond a few especially sensitive applications. Indeed, companies that market distributed computing packages often state in product licenses that their technologies may not be dependable enough for use in critical applications-implying that reliability is not a reasonable objective. In our opinion, this situation is analogous to the unlikely prospect of automakers selling cars with the warning that vehicles are unsafe for use on highways. The computer equivalents of safety belts and air bags are infrequently applied to software development. And the desire for sophisticated, user-friendly interfaces as well as improved speed and performance tends to dominate the attention both of the software developers and the people who use the programs.
<P>
Reliability often conjures up an image of slow, ponderous computer systems that is incompatible with the allure of effortless and instantaneous access to information on the data superhighway. Yet robust technology does not have to be slow and unpleasant to use: the Golden Gate Bridge is a model of stability as well as grace. With each passing hour, more and more uses are being found for the information bridges that link computers. Our enthusiasm to incorporate elegant electronic bridges in every conceivable application should not overshadow a reasonable degree of concern about whether or not such bridges will be able to support the resulting traffic of information. We believe that robust distributed systems provide a valuable tool for connecting computers quickly and dependably, creating opportunities for business and pleasure in the information society. But we also believe that in many cases, unless a distributed system can be engineered to function robustly, it may be better not to build-or use-one at all.

Color television looms large on the radio horizon: RCA has it but

"Predicating their conclusions on a price of $15 a ton for coal,
atomic energy experts recently predicted that atomic energy might
economically come into competition with coal for industrial power
production in from three to twenty-five years. According to a
director of the Bituminous Coal Institute, this quoted price is
greatly excessive, and coal is now being delivered to the power
producers at a national average price of less than $6 a ton;
therefore it would be 'something like two or three generations
before bituminous coal has anything to fear from atomic energy.'"

The first really practical solution to the problem of
artificial flight has been made by Prof. Samuel Langley, the
secretary of the Smithsonian Institution. Prof. Alexander Bell
describes the successful experiments, which were carried out near
Occoquan, Va., on May 6: 'The aerodrome, or flying machine, in
question was of steel, driven by a steam engine. It resembled an
enormous bird, soaring in the air with extreme regularity in
large curves, sweeping steadily upward in a spiral path, until it
reached a height of about 100 feet in the air, at the end of a
course of about a half mile, when the steam gave out and the
propellers which had moved it stopped. Then, to my further
surprise, the whole, instead of tumbling down, settled as slowly
and gracefully as it is possible for any bird to do.' The
supporting surfaces are but fourteen feet from tip to tip."

"Sound reproducing machines are no less wonderful than sound
transmitting apparatus, and, although the talking machine may not

perhaps more interesting and instructive. Our present engraving

inventor Mr. Emile Berliner. It is driven by a belt extending
around the larger pulley on the crank shaft, which is turned by
hand. On the turntable is placed the hard rubber disk bearing the
record. The sound box is mounted on a swinging arm, which also
supports the conical resonator. With five minutes' practice a
child can operate it so as to reproduce a band selection or a
song in perfect tune."

"Each year the laws of sea storms are understood more perfectly
through the indefatigable efforts of the United States
hydrographic office. The landsman hardly appreciates what has
been done by the government to protect ships from danger. In
order to measure the storms, it was necessary to obtain reliable
data from a wide extent of ocean territory. In the absence of
telegraph stations, forms for keeping observations were issued to
every captain of a vessel touching any American port, to be
filled out and mailed to the headquarters at Washington. In
return for this labor every captain received free the Monthly
Pilot Chart. From the pile of data received, a map of each storm
was constructed, and rules were compiled that are given to
mariners when encountering a storm at sea."

Audubon's 'Quadrupeds of North America'-This great 
work, now in course of publication (more than half of it is

of ordinary interest to general readers. The drawings are
Audubon's and are spirited and life-like beyond any thing we
have ever seen; not even excepting his other work, the 'Birds of
America.' In some animals-the raccoon, for instance-the fur is
so exquisitely wrought and transparent as to induce the belief,
at first sight, that it has been stuck on, instead of being

light. Latent caloric is commonly called 'latent heat,' but we
think it is not heat in any sense, until it is liberated and
becomes palpable."

<B>Conscious Comments</B><P>
I found David J. Chalmers's article, "The Puzzle of Conscious Experience" [December 1995], extremely interesting, but I question his statement that "to explain life...we need to describe how a physical system can reproduce, adapt and metabolize." Such knowledge would not explain what is unique about a single-cell organism that causes it to do these things. Chalmers also does not discuss whether simpler organisms--insects, plants or one-celled organisms--are aware or possess consciousness. I suggest that neither consciousness nor life can be explained without taking the other into consideration. Perhaps they are opposite sides of the same coin.<P>
<I>SYDNEY B. SELF, JR.<BR>

<HR WIDTH=50%>
Chalmers offers no compelling evidence of a scientific basis for his distinction between physical process and experience. It would seem more sensible to assume that conscious experiences are physical processes and then to get on with the study of those processes. Neuroscientists might make more progress if they were not being distracted by philosophers proposing modern versions of vitalism.<P>
<I>ROBERT IRWIN<BR>
Monument, Colo.</I><P>
<HR WIDTH=50%>
I am surprised that Chalmers classified the question "Why does consciousness exist?" as the "hard" problem. I'd take the simple Darwinian approach of observing what we use consciousness for. We use it to look out for our best interests, and it is working well, as evidenced by the human population explosion. Apparently, no "unconscious automaton" can outperform a worried mind at staying alive.<P>
<I>ROGER LASKEN<BR>
Gaithersburg, Md.</I><P>
<HR WIDTH=50%>
I believe the consciousness "problem" is inherently insoluble. To explain a phenomenon is to compare it with another phenomenon of which we have knowledge and which we believe to be in need of no explanation itself. Our consciousness cannot be subjected to such comparison, because we have nothing with which to compare it--it is, by definition, all that we know.<P>
<I>ROBERT J. SULLIVAN<BR>
Alpharetta, Ga.</I><P>
<HR WIDTH=50%>
Science requires communication. If you believe that conscious experience is something that can be communicated, you will end up working on Chalmers's "easy" problems. If you believe it cannot be communicated, you'd best shave your head, grab your saffron robe and run--don't walk--to the nearest Zen monastery. Perhaps to understand consciousness fully, you have to do both!<P>

<B>Fighting the Good Fight</B><P>
Familiarity with the Terminator movies may have taught Somali gunmen to fear U.S. laser sights, as suggested by Gary Stix in "Fighting Future Wars" [December 1995]. But the same movies may have also given them the idea for their "technicals," pickup trucks mounted with automatic weapons. Perhaps, too, our videos inspired them to think that ragged, ill-equipped guerrillas could inflict casualties on a sophisticated, heavily armed force; that antipersonnel devices could be defeated with discarded lumber; that telemetry intercepts could be frustrated with drums and handwritten notes. In preparing for future conflicts, we should pay attention to what our adversaries are watching on their VCRs.<P>

<B>Breast-feeding Bonus</B><P>
As a health care worker, I enthusiastically read Jack Newman's article, "How Breast Milk Protects Newborns" [December 1995]. It seems absurd that a majority of mothers do not choose to breast-feed. I believe an improvement could be made by emphasizing that a nursing mother loses the weight gained during pregnancy much more easily than one who chooses not to. A nursing mother produces a daily average of 30 ounces of breast milk--this amounts to 600 calories lost a day.<P>

James Boyk's essay, "The Endangered Piano Technician" [December 1995], describes one part of a more general decline in American purchases of musical instruments since the mid-1980s. This trend raises a larger issue. A connection between music and mathematics is frequently noted but never satisfactorily explained. If there is a cognitive constellation of music and math, what will be the effect on the sciences of a persistent decay in instrument sales?<P>

We need not question God's motives when a slice of bread falls buttered-side down, as Ian Stewart does in "The Anthropomurphic Principle" ["Mathematical Recreations," December 1995]. Paraphrasing an old Yiddish joke, a better conclusion is that we buttered the wrong side of the bread.<P>

<B>APRIL 1946</B><BR>
The Altitude Wind Tunnel at the new Cleveland Aircraft Engine Laboratory, operated by the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics, is probably the only one of its kind in the world. Here, flight testing is supplanted by operation of complete aircraft propulsion installations under precise temperature, humidity, and pressure conditions such as would be found at 30,000 feet. When the full 50,000 horsepower available to the tunnel is employed, air speeds as high as 500 miles per hour may be obtained."<P>
"In peace, the h-f d-f (high-frequency direction-finding) system, popularly known as 'huff-duff,' picks up any voice or code radio signal transmitted on short-wave channels, and within a split second shows on the screen of a cathode-ray tube the direction from which the signals are arriving. The h-f d-f is now a vital instrument in the air-sea rescue system of the United States Coast Guard."<P>
<B>APRIL 1896</B><BR>
The 776th Olympiad began on April 6, and, for the first time since they were abolished, fifteen centuries ago, the famous games were revived--games, however, in which our modern cosmopolitan spirit is apparent by the lists being thrown open to the athletes of the world. The games were not held at the old Olympia, a small plain in Elis, but in the Stadium of Athens."<P>
"Thomas Alva Edison has succeeded in devising a simple apparatus by means of which the skeleton of the limbs may be observed directly instead of photographically. The importance of the 'fluoroscope' to the surgeon cannot be over-estimated. It will give him an instant diagnosis of his case. The photographic method involves long exposure, in itself an evil, followed by the slow development and drying of the plate, and, worst of all, the uncertainty of getting any result whatever."<P>
"The overground power plant at Niagara Falls is already regarded as one of the local attractions of Niagara. But the casual visitor fails to see the best of the work. Out of his sight below the solid floor, and directly beneath the dynamos, a great rectangular pit descends nearly two hundred feet through the solid rock. Near the bottom, the power company has installed great turbine water wheels, from each of which a vertical shaft rises to ground level to directly drive the rotating fields of the 5,000 H.P. alternators.

<CENTER><H2>Embryo Overpopulation</H2>
Born into controversy, cryopreservation<BR>
again stirs debate as thousands<BR>
of frozen embryos grow old<P>
</CENTER>
Ever since physician Carl Wood and his Australian research
team demonstrated in 1984 that human embryos generated in the
laboratory could spend time in the deep freeze and go on to
develop normally in the womb, in vitro fertilization (IVF)
clinics around the world have been busily filling their squat,
aluminum cryopreservation tanks. Plucked out of petri dishes,
legions of embryos--technically termed pre-embryos at this
two- to eight-cell stage--have been placed in ampoules of
protective fluid and cooled to liquid air temperatures,
remaining in suspended animation until needed by couples for
subsequent IVF attempts.<P>
Cryopreservation has proved a boon to women, sparing them
multiple egg extractions. But as the number of frozen embryos
grows, it has become obvious that a sizable fraction of them
will never be required, and no one knows what to do with them.
Arthur Caplan, director of the Center for Bioethics at the
University of Pennsylvania, asks, "Is it more respectful to
destroy embryos that aren't wanted or freeze them forever--is
that dignified treatment?"<P>
Although a few IVF programs work assiduously to minimize the
number of embryos stored for longer than five years and have
succeeded in keeping turnover high, many people connected with
reproductive medicine expect the ranks in the tanks to keep
expanding. Alan Trounson of the Monash University Institute of
Reproduction and Development near Melbourne, who pioneered
embryo-freezing technology, has voiced his concern over the
buildup, as have ethicists and mental health professionals who
counsel infertile couples.<P>
Laboratory directors say the "Asch fiasco" has underscored the
issue. In May last year the University of California at Irvine
shut down the program run by infertility specialist Ricardo H.
Asch on suspicion that it had mishandled frozen embryos,
including giving them to other clinicians. The attendant press
coverage--including a segment on the "Oprah Winfrey Show"
accusing the Irvine team of "high-tech baby kidnapping"--has
caused patients to be extremely concerned about their embryos.
This wariness has further alerted reproductive specialists to
the medicolegal nightmares that can result from holding life
on ice.<P>
Asked how many embryos are currently stored internationally,
Michael Tucker, scientific director at Reproductive Biology
Associates in Atlanta, does a back-of-the-envelope calculation
and hazards a high guess: close to a million, with some
100,000 in the U.S. But no one, not even the Society for
Assisted Reproductive Technologies (SART), which maintains
statistics on 250 or so IVF programs, knows for sure. The
largest American programs, including, for example, those at
the Jones Institute of the Eastern Virginia Medical School and
New York Hospital-Cornell University Medical Center, tend to
have several thousand pre-embryos warehoused in liquid
nitrogen at -196 degrees Celsius (-320.8 degrees Fahrenheit);
smaller, newer programs have several hundred.<P>
Tucker arrived at his total by assuming each SART program has
300 embryos on store--and then throwing in a few extra. One
can reach a similar figure by looking at the percentage of
embryos consigned to cryopreservation: at Tucker's clinic, for
instance, about 33 percent are preserved. That percentage may
be higher at other programs, but using it, one can
conservatively estimate that embryos were frozen in at least
9,000 IVF cycles initiated by the clinics reporting to SART in
1993; if the average of three embryos were frozen for each
couple, that makes 27,000 embryos a year. If statistics
compiled at the Jones Institute by Jake Mayer, director of the
embryology lab there, can be taken as representative, the bulk
of embryos are held for two or three years before being thawed
for use in IVF attempts. So Tucker's tally looks about right.<P>
Clinics already spend a good deal of time and effort ensuring
that frozen embryos suffer no damage. Ethical and legal
considerations have driven most programs to install backup
liquid-nitrogen and power systems and to hone procedures for
wheeling embryos to safety in case of fire or natural
disasters. In addition, some clinics keep close track of the
whereabouts and wishes of the embryos' "owners" (a
precedent-setting 1989 federal district court decision held
that labs are merely custodians of patients' "property").
Profit-driven clinics thus view with some disquiet the steady
increase in the pre-embryo population; indeed, among
colleagues at a conclave last summer, one prominent
embryologist spoke of "harassing" patients to make them decide
what they wanted to do with embryos that had languished for
too long (some have been around since 1984).<P>
Couples are often extremely reluctant to okay disposal. Some
have strong feelings about the embryos' sanctity; some view
them as "children" or "family," an attitude that appears
rather odd but makes sense, infertility counselors say, given
that these couples may already be raising one or more children
conceived from stored embryos. Even patients who regard
embryos as potential beings, rather than fully human, may hold
on for long periods, regardless of whether or not they intend
to continue with IVF. Clinics have begun to use a mild form of
financial coercion: after a grace period of, say, six months,
many now charge storage fees, which can amount to more than
$300 annually.<P>
Dorothy Greenfeld, Yale University psychotherapist and former
president of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine's
Mental Health Professional Group, points out that patients are
not the only ones who become emotionally invested.
"Embryologists and physicians have their own complicated
issues with the technology," she says. "It seems that the
staff in clinics may become more attached to these embryos
than the couples do." At least one lab director admits--and
several others intimate--that they would not oust embryos
whose storage fees had not been paid, even though couples are
warned on consent forms that this will be done. "If these were
animal embryos, no one would hesitate," one embryologist
explains. "But they're of human origin, so one can be
sympathetic with lab directors who are reluctant to thaw
them." Apparently, some workers delay or refuse to thaw
embryos even when given explicit consent to do so.<P>
Caplan argues that labs, having created an overabundance of
embryos, can solve the problem easily by setting a strict time
limit on cryo-preservation and hewing to it. But some experts
maintain this would be unfair to patients. Jean Benward, a
private practitioner in San Ramon, Calif., says that "patients
are given consent forms as they come through the door, but
there is a way in which this isn't informed consent." When
they undertake IVF, Benward explains, couples cannot
reasonably be expected to know how they will feel about their
embryos down the line.<P>
Benward contends that clinics should establish permanent
patient advisory committees to provide feedback and to aid in
formulating policy. Another tack, which is expensive but which
is employed by the Cornell program, is to have physicians
counsel patients as they make a decision to have their embryos
thawed or donated to other couples or to researchers. (Few
programs are genuinely able to offer patients all three
choices: donated embryos are not in high demand, and so little
research is done on embryos that ticking off a box assigning
extra embryos to science is a fairly meaningless exercise.)<P>
Some researchers have suggested that the problem will go away
of its own accord with the advent of egg freezing, which is
fraught with fewer ethical and philosophical complications.
Egg freezing is still highly experimental, however, and may
never pass muster. It appears that if the throngs in the
cryotanks are to be kept in check, clinicians must work harder
to involve couples in the decision-making process--and then
abide by their dictates.<P>

<BR>PALEOANTHROPOLOGY<BR><BR>
<CENTER><H2>Out of Food?</H2>
Hominids, and cannibalistic ones<BR>
at that, may have reached<BR>
Europe almost a million years ago<P>
</CENTER>
The story of our earliest ancestors has long seemed to be one
about Africa. Virtually all the fossil hominids that are much
more than a million years old have come from that continent.
And until recently, researchers believed that only in the past
half million years or so did our forebears rove as far as
Europe. But finds made in the past couple of years have
steadily been building a strong case that early members of the
hominid clan ranged much farther abroad--and much
earlier--than had been thought.<P>
In 1994 Carl Swisher and Garnis Curtis, then at the Institute
of Human Origins in Berkeley, Calif., first cast serious doubt
on the chronology of the conventional theory when they
reported that the remains of Homo erectus specimens found
earlier in Java, Indonesia, were about 1.8 million years old.
Because that is 600,000 years older than any other dated
hominid fossils from the area, and more ancient than
comparable African H. erectus remains, Swisher and Curtis took
their find to support the idea that this upright-walking
hominid evolved in Asia rather than in Africa.<P>
Lingering questions about Swisher and Curtis's dating
techniques still had not been settled when paleontologists
received another surprise. Until last year, western Europe had
not yielded evidence of habitation by hominids before a mere
500,000 years ago. But in August a team directed by Eudald
Carbonell of the University Rovira i Virgili in Tarragona
announced the discovery of hominid fossils and primitive tools
that are at least 780,000 years old at Atapuerca in northern
Spain. Moreover, Carbonell, Yolanda Fernandez-Jalvo and their
colleagues recently reported finding cut marks on the bones
that make them easily the most disturbing remnants found so
far.<P>
The Spanish researchers believe the Atapuerca hominids
practiced cannibalism. Scanning electron microscopy reveals
V-shaped gouges in the bones--in exactly the locations that
might be expected if someone had used a stone tool to remove
meat from a corpse. Striations inside the cuts, together with
their characteristic shape, rule out the teeth of scavengers
as an explanation, Fernandez-Jalvo maintains. Although
Neanderthals carved up corpses some 200,000 years ago--whether
for food or ritualistic purposes is not known--the signs of
butchery in the Spanish bones seem to indicate a gruesome
early record of cannibalism.<P>
The Atapuerca finds are not the only ones pointing to an early
date for hominids in Europe. Soon after Carbonell's team
revealed their discovery, Josep Gibert of the Sabadell
Paleontology Institute announced the unearthing of a
1.8-million-year-old tooth fragment at Orce in southern Spain.
Gibert's truly ancient remnant--together with a jawbone of
roughly the same age that was found at Dmanisi in the Republic
of Georgia in 1991--lends credence to the notion that a
million and a half years before modern humans evolved,
creatures that walked on two legs had moved out of Africa into
Asia, where they had turned both left, toward Europe, and
right, toward China.<P>
Swisher and Curtis's dates for Asian hominids gained powerful
support last November, when Huang Wanpo and his colleagues
from the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and
Paleoanthropology in Beijing reported unearthing in Longgupo
Cave in Sichuan Province a jaw fragment, three teeth and stone
tools some 1.9 million years old. The investigators suggest
that the teeth are from a hominid possibly more primitive than
H. erectus. Accurate dating of such meager fragments is a
challenge, but a technique called electron spin resonance has
confirmed the age that the researchers originally inferred
from magnetic traces in surrounding rocks left by changes in
the earth's magnetic field.<P>
Roy Larick of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, who
collaborated with the Chinese team, says the recent finds
suggest hominids came out of Africa in several distinct
waves--the first about two million years ago. An advanced H.
erectus then seems to have left Africa between 500,000 and
600,000 years ago, whereas fully modern humans departed less
than 200,000 years ago. Ian Tattersall of the American Museum
of Natural History in New York City, though differing with
Larick on the exact interpretation of the Chinese discovery,
agrees that "the general trend of recent finds supports a
relatively early departure from Africa." Whether cannibalism
routinely sustained such migrations, or whether it was merely
an occasional expedient, remains to be seen.<P>

<CENTER><H2>Interview with a Parrot</H2>
Physicists hope to get antihydrogen<BR>
to live longer than 40 nanoseconds<P>
</CENTER>
For months, I have been waiting to meet Alex, the celebrity
African gray parrot who has given new meaning to the epithet
"birdbrain." Trained by Irene M. Pepperberg of the University
of Arizona, Alex may be the only nonhuman who speaks English
and means what he says. The 20-year-old bird is said to count
up to six and to recognize and name some 100 different
objects, along with their color, texture and shape; his
ability to categorize rivals that of chimpanzees.<P>
Walking into Pepperberg's small laboratory with a friend, I am
stopped short by a furious barrage of wolf whistles.
Flustered, I locate the source as a medium-size gray bird with
a knowing eye, standing on a table littered with fruit and
paper fragments. "Alex likes tall men," explains Pepperberg,
indicating my companion. Within minutes Alex is perched on his
shoulder, shivering, fluttering and hopping from foot to foot
with excitement. "If he really likes you," a student warns,
"he'll throw up into your ear"--referring to a parrot's
instinct for regurgitating food and stuffing it into a mate.
"You wanna grape?" Alex suddenly asks his new consort in a
nasal but perfectly clear voice. I am transfixed with
awe--until Pepperberg explains that Alex occasionally uses
phrases without meaning them.<P>
Sometimes he does mean them. Ill at ease on my hand, Alex
squawks, "Wanna go back," and climbs onto the back of a chair.
Watching the transactions are two other African grays--Kyaaro,
a nervous bird that Pepperberg likens to a child with
attention-deficit disorder, and Griffin, a fluffy, wide-eyed
six-month-old. It is mealtime, and while Kyaaro sips his
coffee--which, I am told, helps to calm him down--Griffin is
being coaxed with bits of banana. "Bread," announces Alex,
and, being handed a piece of muffin, proceeds to eat carefully
around the blueberries.<P>
My friend leaves so that Alex can concentrate, and we get to
work. "How many?" asks a student, displaying a tray with four
corks. But Alex is in an ornery mood and will not look. "Two,"
he says quickly; then, "Cork nut"--his designation for an
almond, his reward.<P>
"That's wrong, Alex. No cork nut. How many?"<P>
"Four," Alex replies. "Four," echoes Kyaaro melodically from
across the room. Griffin, on my shoulder, pulls out my
hairpins while I try to take notes. "You weren't looking," the
student sighs and fetches a metal key and a green plastic one.
"What toy?"<P>
"Key."<P>
"How many?"<P>
"Two."<P>
"What's different?"<P>
"Color."<P>
This time Alex gets his cork nut. While he nibbles, Griffin
hops off to steal the rest of Alex's food, and I take out my
camera. Instantly, Alex puffs out his feathers--or what is
left of them, given that he has pulled out most of his
tail--and straightens up. I have to put the device away before
he can get back to work. Alex goes on to identify a stone as
"rock," a square as "four corner," the letters "O" and "R"
placed together as "OR" and eventually to request in a small,
sad voice, "Cork nut."<P>
Pepperberg teaches her parrots by using a threesome--herself,
the bird and a student. One person holds up an object; the
other names and then receives it. Listening, watching and
practicing, the bird learns the word that will get him the new
toy. These days Alex often substitutes for a human in teaching
the younger birds. He rarely makes mistakes when in this role,
and Kyaaro and Griffin learn faster from him than from humans.<P>
For a long time, scientists believed that birds, with their
small brains, were capable of no more than mindless mimicry or
simple association. But Pepperberg has shown that Alex, at
least, can use language creatively--and also reason with a
complexity comparable to that demonstrated in nonhuman
primates or cetaceans. Next, Pepperberg hopes to teach Alex
that symbols such as "3" refer to a particular number of
objects.<P>
My friend returns, and Alex is distracted again. "I'm sorry,"
he says after a particularly poor session. "Wanna go back." It
is time to leave. The parting is eased by the arrival of a
tall male student. My last glimpse of the astonishing Alex
reveals a scruffy gray bird dancing in ecstasy on a man's
shoulder.<P>

<BR>MATHEMATICS<BR><BR>
<CENTER><H2>The Not so Enormous Theorem</H2>
Mathematicians are attempting to<BR>
make the world's longest proof shorter<P>
</CENTER>
It is called, perhaps with understatement, the Enormous
Theorem. More than 100 mathematicians toiled for 30 years to
produce the proof known formally as the classification of
finite, simple groups. Completed in the early 1980s, it
consists of some 500 published papers totaling 15,000 pages.<P>
Now two participants in that enterprise are leading an effort
to whittle the Enormous Theorem down to a paltry 3,000 or so
pages. Even at that size, the proof will still be too large
and complex for most mathematicians to grasp, acknowledges
Ronald M. Solomon of Ohio State University, a co-leader of the
so-called revision project. "Our hope is that people will be
inspired with new ideas to make more improvements" that shrink
the proof further, Solomon says. Ideally, even the shorter
proof "will be out of date in the not so distant future."<P>
A finite group consists of a limited number of elements linked
by a logical operation such as addition, multiplication or, in
the case of geometric objects, rotation around an axis. Since
groups were invented by Evariste Galois in the early 1830s,
they have become vital not only to mathematics but also to
particle physics and other highly mathematical fields of
science.<P>
The Enormous Theorem established that all finite simple groups
can fall into 17 infinite families or 26 so-called "sporadic"
forms. The groups are often compared with the elementary
particles, which combine to form more complex forms of matter.
The largest of the sporadic groups, called "the Monster," has
10[sup 54] elements.<P>
One of the few people thought to understand the entire proof,
Daniel Gorenstein, who served as the general contractor for
the proof's construction, died in 1992. Before he passed away,
Gorenstein and two of his lieutenants vowed to construct a
second-generation proof that would be much simpler and
shorter. The American Mathematical Society recently published
the second volume of what is expected to be a 15-tome set, to
be completed in a decade or so.<P>
Even disregarding its length, the original proof contained
numerous weaknesses. One major section, on the so-called
quasi-thin group, was never published. Several components also
relied on computer calculations, a practice on which many
mathematical purists still frown.<P>
Most of these weaknesses have already been addressed, says
Michael Aschbacher of the California Institute of Technology.
He rules out the possibility that the proof could be
dramatically compressed by showing that some groups are
different aspects of the same underlying group, just as
particle physicists showed that many subatomic particles were
manifestations of simpler particles called quarks. By
definition, the simple groups "can't be decomposed even
further," he says.<P>
The proof could be condensed by some other development that
reveals connections between groups or casts them in a clearer
light, adds Aschbacher, who helped to reconstruct the original
proof and remains active in the revision. "I don't think
that's going to happen, but anything is possible."<P>
The first three volumes of the revised theorem should be
accessible and interesting to anyone with a background in
group theory. Beyond that, "it's not for the fainthearted,"
says Richard N. Lyons of Rutgers University, co-leader with
Solomon of the revision project.<P>
Solomon notes that researchers in graph theory, combinatorics
and logic and in group theory have now begun to accept the
Enormous Theorem and to build on it. "Everybody--well, I hope
everybody--does this with a little bit of trepidation," he
says. "Mathematics is an evolving subject."<P>

<CENTER><H2>Rocking Rocks</H2>
Well-balanced boulders may<BR>
mark earthquake-free locales<P>
</CENTER>
What adolescent hiker has not been tempted to knock over a
boulder that is perched insecurely by the side of the trail?
With one quick shove, over goes a rock that may have
maintained itself in an upright but vulnerable position for
centuries--perhaps thousands of years. It seems that good
reason now exists to resist the impulse. Researchers have
started to use such "precarious rocks" to help them determine
whether a particular area may be prone to earthquakes.<P>
The basic premise of the technique is straightforward: seismic
shaking can easily topple delicately poised rocks; hence,
finding such rocks undisturbed indicates that no earthquakes
have occurred close by. The reasoning is elementary; however,
until now, few geologists have ever attempted to quantify the
relation between unstable rock formations and earthquake
ground motion.<P>
Recently James N. Brune and John W. Bell of the University of
Nevada at Reno, along with several colleagues, have started to
examine various sites in the American Southwest with an eye to
gauging what the existence of precariously balanced boulders
might indicate about the likelihood of earthquakes.<P>
Brune makes no claims about being the first to recognize that
suitably balanced rocks can act as natural seismometers: "I'm
sure many people have notices them and said, 'By gosh, an
earthquake could knock those over.'" But he and his co-workers
have lately invested considerable effort to make the method
more exact. For instance, they looked closely at the problem
of estimating just how much earthquake-induced motion a
particular rock could withstand before it toppled over. They
also employed several strategies to determine the length of
time a given top-heavy rock might have remained in place since
it eroded from the surrounding bedrock.<P>
One method of determining how long a boulder has rested
undisturbed is to examine its surface. In dry climates, one
commonly finds that rocks are encrusted with a microscopic
layer of "varnish," a clay-rich coating that slowly
accumulates through exposure to the atmosphere. Because rock
varnish contains organic substances, scientists can determine
its age with carbon 14 dating.<P>
Another method for finding the time a boulder has stood in the
open uses cosmic rays--swiftly moving particles that rain down
from the sky in a steady stream. Because cosmic rays create
distinctive kinds of atoms when they irradiate common
minerals, measurements of "cosmogenic isotopes" can serve to
determine how long a certain rock surface has been exposed.<P>
With these tools at the ready, Brune crisscrossed much of
southern California and Nevada, looking for sites with
precariously balanced rocks. Some teetering boulders, such as
those he found in California near Victorville and Jacumba,
would totter with a modest sideways push (about 20 percent of
the force of gravity), yet careful measurements indicate that
those rocks have not moved from their positions for more than
10,000 years--good markers for earthquake-free zones.<P>
Brune and his colleagues have also applied their technique
near Yucca Mountain in Nevada, where the nation's first
high-level nuclear-waste repository may be built. Their
studies provided a comforting result. Brune concludes, "There
has not been strong shaking at Yucca Mountain for thousands of
years."<P>
As convincing as this technique would appear, some researchers
are reserving judgment about its ultimate usefulness. Klaus H.
Jacob, a seismologist at Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty
Earth Observatory, is concerned about the problems involved in
estimating the amount of seismic shaking a site may have
endured from the position and shape of the rocks. He explains
the difficulties he encountered once when he tried to
calculate the motions of an earthquake that had overturned
several railroad cars: "The math I had to do to get at this
problem was so much more sophisticated than I expected, I
almost gave up."<P>
So Jacob remains unsure whether the "precarious rocks" method
yet provides reliable estimates of ground motion and cautions
that the technique needs to be fully tested in places where
earthquakes have recently occurred. Still, he applauds the
efforts of Brune and his colleagues to grapple with the
question of what these curious rocks can say about earthquake
hazards, and he regards their investigation as "brilliant,
basic and just the right thing to ask."<P>

The difference between male and female faces can largely be
captured by a single variable, state Alice J. O'Toole of the
University of Texas at Dallas and Thomas Vetter of the Max
Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics in Tubingen,
Germany. They analyzed heads of 65 men and 65 women, finding
an average head and a set of corrections to it, called
eigenheads [see SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN, December 1995]. The first
eigenhead, when added to the average head, yielded a male
face; when subtracted, a female face. Subtle variations were
coded for by a different eigenhead.<P>

<CENTER><H2>The Berry and the Parasite</H2>
A 30-year struggle to control<BR>
schistosomiasis has revealed<BR>
much about patents and profits<P>
</CENTER>
In 1964 Aklilu Lemma of Addis Ababa University traveled to
Adwa, Ethiopia, to study schistosomiasis. This debilitating
disease of the liver or bladder affects some 300 million
people in Africa, Asia and Latin America. The Schistosoma
parasite multiplies within snails that infest rivers and
ponds; when humans use the water, the organism enters their
skin. At one brook, Lemma saw women washing clothes with the
sudsy extract from the local endod berry. Downstream, the
snails were dead.<P>
Back in Addis Ababa, Lemma, who has a Ph.D. from Johns Hopkins
University, instituted a program to study whether the endod
berry could be safely used in controlling Schistosoma-bearing
snails. Although endod also kills mosquito larvae and fish, he
found that it is harmless to rats; in humans, it is an emetic.
"People grow it around their houses," Lemma reports. "They
have tested it for safety and adopted it as a useful plant."<P>
The subsequent saga of the berry attests to the difficulties
that developing countries experience in benefiting from their
own biodiversity. Each observer attributes endod's travails to
a different stumbling block, but one moral seems to be clear:
it takes a determined, politically savvy proponent to ensure
that the promise of a product is realized for its own local
community.<P>
Lemma's results attracted scientists from the National
Research Development Corporation in London, who offered to
collaborate. "They took sackfuls of berries," Lemma relates,
and he says he heard no more from them. Returning to Adwa, he
and his colleagues started a test to see if endod could halt
schistosomiasis. If the disease was not transmitted for five
years, they theorized, children between one to six years of
age should be free from it.<P>
In 1970 Lemma left for a sabbatical at the Stanford Research
Institute (SRI), stopping in London to check on his
"collaborators." The tests had been so encouraging, he was
informed, that the scientists had patented rather than
published. Lemma did not appear on the patent, which was for
an extraction process for endod. At SRI, he worked with Robert
M. Parkhurst, who isolated the active ingredient in endod,
naming it "lemmatoxin." Along with chemist Wilfred A. Skinner,
the researchers obtained a patent on a different method.<P>
But Lemma convinced his colleagues that because endod was
"poor man's medicine for a poor man's disease," it was
unseemly to profit from it. Accordingly, SRI donated its
patent to a nonprofit foundation that Lemma hoped to establish
in Ethiopia. "I felt we should get the farmers to grow it and
use it locally," Lemma explains. He challenged the British
scientists to donate theirs as well. The affair became
diplomatically embarrassing; the scientists capitulated.<P>
In 1974 the results from Adwa came out: among 3,500 children
between one and six years in age, the prevalence of
schistosomiasis had fallen from 50 to 7 percent. Yet to become
widely adopted, endod needed the blessing of the World Health
Organization. That was not forthcoming. Ken E. Mott, who heads
the WHO's schistosomiasis project, says the problem was
Lemma's patents: "It was uncertain how endod should be
developed, because somebody had a personal [and financial]
agenda in this."<P>
The WHO instead recommended a chemical molluscicide marketed
by Bayer at $27,000 a ton in hard currency. (Endod sells for
about $1,000 a ton.) The WHO questioned the safety of the
berry, requiring that it pass tests costing millions of
dollars. But the WHO would not help fund such tests, and in
1987 Mott advised the Italian government not to provide
research grants for endod.<P>
The endod patents then belonged to the Ethiopian Science
Foundation, which was eventually subsumed by the Ethiopian
government. Lemma attributes the WHO's animosity to a
difficulty believing that good science can emanate from
developing nations. "The things done in Africa did not hold
any weight in the U.S. or Canada," Parkhurst agrees.<P>
In 1976 Lemma joined the United Nations, serving on the
Science and Technology Commission. He convened two endod
conferences; funding started to trickle in from foreign-aid
agencies and private organizations. The International
Development Research Center (IDRC) in Ottawa offered to
conduct the toxicity tests required by the WHO--provided the
Ethiopian government renounced the endod patents. The test
results, published in 1990, surprised no one. "It's as
harmless as soap," states the IDRC's Don de Savigny.<P>
Along with a colleague, Lemma received the Right Livelihood
Award from the Swedish parliament in 1989 and was finally able
to establish the nonprofit Endod Foundation. In 1990 the
University of Toledo in Ohio granted Lemma an honorary degree.
After Lemma's acceptance speech, his host, Harold Lee, asked
if endod might be effective against zebra mussels. These
mussels choke submerged pipes in the Great Lakes, racking up
billions of dollars in damage. Lemma demonstrated how to apply
the berries: the mussels died. In 1993 and 1994 the university
obtained patents on this use of endod, with Lemma as an
investigator. The university agreed to donate 10 percent of
its earnings to the Endod Foundation.<P>
Last year Lemma requested that the University of Toledo donate
the patents to the foundation, which would make them freely
available to African ventures. The university responded with
an offer to either sell the patents for $125,000 or license
them for a $50,000 fee, plus 2.5 percent royalties and $10,000
in legal expenses, reserving the right to withdraw the license
if net sales were less than $10 million in five years. Such
terms, Lemma says, are impossible. "It is not university
policy to give things away," Lee retorts. "Lemma can develop
endod for another use and get [his own] patent." But no one is
benefiting from these patents: lemmatoxin is too costly to
synthesize, and no African country will sell endod to the
Toledo group.<P>
Meanwhile work on schistosomiasis goes on. The IDRC is
conducting a field test to ensure that endod is efficacious in
checking the disease. The Agronomic Institute in Florence is
encouraging farmers to grow endod on wastelands. The
University of Oslo is working with Addis Ababa University to
check whether simply using endod as a soap can control the
disease.<P>
"Endod," Mott says, "has ended up not benefiting anybody
except a few personalities who have extended their careers by
presenting themselves as advocates for the Third World."
Diverse reasons are offered for endod's tortuous history.
Parkhurst opines that "bureaucracy is what killed it more than
anything," along with a distrust of Third World science. De
Savigny points out that endod is not an expensive cure backed
by the biomedical industry: "Something you pick off a bush
doesn't have that kind of support." Lee charges that Lemma
does not work hard enough: "Why do you think I spent two years
and got a patent, and he spent 30 years and got nothing?"
Lemma counters that endod may yet end up benefiting rural
Africans: "That is my wish and my dream."<P>
This is the first of a two-part series on the legal and
ethical issues that arise when patenting biodiversity.<P>

<CENTER><H2>Attack of the Killer Neutrinos</H2>
</CENTER>
Incoming asteroids, nuclear war, deadly viruses--how many ways
are there to destroy life on Earth? Thanks to physics,
obsessive apocalyptists now have another possibility: lethal
neutrinos. Neutrinos are those ghostly little rascals that
appeared in experiments in the 1930s but were invisible, that
might have some mass but then again might not, that can shift
from one form to another but might not, and that hardly react
with anything but--guess what?--sometimes do.<P>
That last feature is why physicists must resort to unusual
detection methods such as filling up tanks with nearly half a
million liters of dry-cleaning fluid. Not that neutrinos leave
unsightly stains; rather a huge target is necessary for that
rare occasion when a neutrino bangs into a dry-cleaning-fluid
atom and thus reveals its elusive presence. And if you think
that some neutrinos might be killers, as does Juan I. Collar
of the University of Paris, you need to know how frequently
they interact with other kinds of matter.<P>
Here's Collar's argument. The vast numbers of neutrinos
produced by the sun and other celestial bodies generally pass
through Earth each day without a peep. Yet once every 100
million years, a massive star collapses "silently" within a
couple dozen light-years of Earth. (It just so happens that
everything in space happens silently, but Collar is referring
to a stellar collapse that does not produce any visible
supernova.)<P>
The silent ones may be the deadly ones. As the star collapses,
it releases prodigious quantities of hyperactive neutrinos.
These energetic neutrinos could ricochet off atoms in organic
tissue, causing the atoms to tear through cells, rip apart
DNA, and thereby induce cancer and cellular mutations severe
enough to wipe out many species of animals.<P>
Collar even derives specific figures. He calculates that for
every kilogram of tissue, the neutrinos would send 19,000
atoms flying, leading to 12 tumors. That's about six cancer
sites for the average turtle, 350 for the typical dog, 800 for
the adult human--in short, enough to wipe out many species. To
bolster his case, Collar also deduced that the
100-million-year period of these stellar collapses is
consistent with the known extinctions in Earth's historical
record.<P>
Paleontologists do not take Collar's theory too seriously,
because there are plenty of other, more likely killing
mechanisms (including some that actually leave evidence). But
neutrino bombardment does provide another source of
consternation. Other apocalyptic scenarios at least leave hope
for salvation. Asteroids could be diverted; nuclear war could
be avoided; viruses could be contained. But with neutrinos,
even the dry cleaners won't be spared.

<CENTER><H2>A Smattering of Antimatter</H2>
Physicists hope to get antihydrogen<BR>
to live longer than 40 nanoseconds<P>
</CENTER>
The stuff of science fiction has finally become science fact:
physicists at CERN, the European laboratory for particle
physics near Geneva, have made the first atoms of antimatter.
Although there were only about nine of them, all moving close
to the speed of light and surviving just 40 billionths of a
second, the results prove that antiatoms can exist.
Researchers are now trying to trap and probe them.<P>
Antimatter is identical to ordinary matter except that the
electrical charges are reversed. An electron is negative,
whereas an antielectron, or positron, is positive. With
particle accelerators, physicists have had an easy time
cooking up the constituents of antiatoms--namely, antiprotons
and positrons.<P>
Only now, however, have they managed to combine the two types
of particles to create an antiatom. Using the antiprotons from
the Low Energy Antiproton Ring (LEAR) at CERN, Walter Oelert
of the Institute for Nuclear Physics Research in Julich,
Germany, and his collaborators have succeeded in making the
antimatter version of hydrogen, the simplest and most common
element in the universe. They directed a beam of antiprotons,
moving near the speed of light, through a jet of xenon atoms.
Most of the antiprotons passed through the jet, but on
occasion one interacted with a xenon atom.<P>
The energy of the interaction gave birth to pairs of electrons
and positrons. Sometimes a newly created positron moved close
to the velocity of an antiproton, enabling the antiproton to
capture it and forming antihydrogen. The antiatoms lived for
40 nanoseconds before colliding with a target and vanishing in
a telltale burst of energy. Fermi National Accelerator
Laboratory in Batavia, Ill., is planning to duplicate the feat
this summer.<P>
Moving nearly at the speed of light and surviving only
fleetingly, the antihydrogens are impossible to study. "Our
method is not the right way to go," Oelert remarks. "We just
did it for fun. To really do high-precision physics, you
probably have to have a different method." That technique
involves trapping the antihydrogen for seconds, even days, at
a time. Gerald Gabrielse of Harvard University, Michael
Holzscheiter of Los Alamos National Laboratory and Theodor W.
Hansch of the Max Planck Institute for Quantum Optics in
Garching, Germany, lead the main research groups trying to do
just that. Electrical and magnetic fields can in theory hold
extremely cold antiprotons and positrons closely together so
that the antiparticles bond. But Gabrielse feels that such
antimatter creation and trapping is still a few years away.<P>
The purpose of containing antihydrogen is to check fundamental
theories and to help explain why matter predominates in the
universe. Of course, there are other ways to probe the
symmetry between matter and antimatter. Physicists have
compared protons with antiprotons, finding that in terms of
their charge-to-mass ratios, they are the same to about one
part in 10 billion.<P>
Other kinds of tests, though, have proved impossible with
antiprotons. For instance, antimatter might free-fall at a
rate different from that of ordinary matter, an outcome that
would upset conventional physics wisdom. But exploring the
effects of gravity on antiprotons has so far proved
impossible. The antiproton's electrical charge reacts
sensitively to other charges, a process that overwhelms the
effects of gravity. Antihydrogen could sidestep the problem
because, being neutral, it would not act on external
electrical impulses. Such antiatom research might complement
studies at the so-called B factory being built at the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center because it would check different
aspects of symmetry in physical laws, Gabrielse says.<P>
Given that matter and antimatter annihilate themselves in a
burst of energy, could the combination power future space
vehicles, as "Star Trek" and other science-fiction venues have
it? Oelert cites calculations proving that production methods
would consume all the fossil fuel on the earth to make just
enough antihydrogen to run one average-size automobile for a
year. The warp drive will have to stay off-line.<P>

<BR>INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY<BR><BR>
<CENTER><H2>Battling the Enemy Within</H2>
A billion-dollar fiasco<BR>
is just the tip of the military's<BR>
software problems<P>
</CENTER>
A major U.S. Army initiative to modernize thousands of aging
computer systems has hit the skids, careening far beyond
schedule and well over budget. The 10-year project, known as
the Sustaining Base Information Services (SBIS) program, is
supposed to replace some 3,700 automated applications by the
year 2002. The current systems automate virtually every
business function--from payroll and personnel management to
budgeting and health care--at more than 380 installations
worldwide. But after investing almost three years and about
$158 million, the army has yet to receive a single replacement
system.<P>
The failure is significant not only because it strands the
army with outdated software but also because SBIS is just one
casualty among many. In January top Pentagon officials
reportedly killed the larger Corporate Information Management
(CIM) initiative, which for six years had tried to consolidate
and modernize thousands of the armed services' old and
redundant computer systems.<P>
The Pentagon has not been tracking either costs or savings of
CIM. But the Department of Defense projected in 1992 that CIM
would help it cut $36 billion by 1997. The General Accounting
Office (GAO), in contrast, concluded last July that "Defense
continues to spend about $3 billion annually to develop and
modernize automated information systems with little
demonstrable benefit. Few redundant systems have been
eliminated, and significant savings have not yet
materialized."<P>
Why is one of the most technologically advanced organizations
so consistently humbled in its attempts to master business
software? A close look at the troubles of SBIS reveals that
inadequate software technology, industry incompetence, a
flawed procurement process and naive expectations all play a
role.<P>
The army conceived SBIS in 1992 to solve a long-festering
problem: most of the computer systems that the armed services
rely on to raise, organize, train, equip, deploy and sustain
their forces are growing obsolete. Designed 20 or more years
ago to run on equally ancient mainframes, the systems are
becoming prohibitively expensive to maintain. The antiquated
programs typically cannot share information with one another,
and many force the army to work in ways that no longer make
sense.<P>
SBIS was to replace 3,700 largely incompatible systems with
about 1,500 new applications. The new systems would all run on
the same kinds of computers and networks and would store data
in compatible ways. By eliminating duplication, shutting down
mainframes and allowing information to flow smoothly, billions
would be saved. And best of all, the systems would be based on
the industry standards and so would be cheap and easy to
upgrade.<P>
The army wisely decided to split its ambitious program into
phases. The first contract called only for the common
infrastructure and 89 applications, which would take three
years to develop. In June 1993 a team of companies led by IBM
Federal Systems (which was sold to Loral six months later)
beat out several competitors for the contract with a bid of
$474 million.<P>
IBM's winning proposal included techniques touted in the
industry for their ability to make software development
faster, less costly and less risky. Automated tools would
boost programmer productivity. Designers would enlist users to
help craft prototypes of the applications, so as to avoid
expensive design changes later. Computer code already written
for other systems would be reused.<P>
Parts of the proposal should have raised questions, however.
To back up claims that it could reuse more than 70 percent of
existing code (about three times the industry average), IBM
cited its work for the Federal Aviation Administration and
Westpac Bank of Australia. But the FAA was forced to abandon
much of IBM's work, at a loss of nearly $1 billion. Westpac
was likewise left with little to show for its nearly
$150-million investment and dropped IBM, with some critics
accusing IBM of promising technology it could not deliver.<P>
IBM and its successor Loral again face that charge, this time
made by a former army official. "IBM had a conflict of
interest from the beginning" because it has lucrative
contracts to keep the old mainframes running, says Russell D.
Varnado, who managed information technology acquisition for
the Army Material Command until 1992.<P>
Last December Varnado and a small software firm called
Pentagen Technologies filed a federal whistle-blower suit
against IBM, Loral and the army officials who manage SBIS. The
action accuses IBM and Loral of contracting to perform tasks
that they knew were beyond their abilities; it also accuses
army officials of failing to enforce the contract. IBM and
Loral are fighting the suit.<P>
The charges are based in part on a report filed by Charlotte
J. Lakey, who managed the SBIS program from its inception
until April 1994. The report describes how the project slipped
behind schedule from the outset. "[Loral] missed most of their
deliverables," Lakey recalled in an interview, including
"their system design plan, software development plan,
communications plans--basic things like that."<P>
Annoyed by the delays and alarmed when Loral proposed a
software price that was "a lot higher" than expected, Lakey
decided that the army should threaten to terminate the
contract. But her superior overruled her, and several months
later Lakey was removed from her post. In her final report,
she suggested that "there needs to be a better contract
mechanism...than hoping you get an honorable contractor."<P>
Although Colonel Charles Mudd, the current SBIS program
manager, says Loral is using the promised state-of-the-art
techniques and limiting systems' designs to fit the budget,
the estimated expense has skyrocketed. About $114 million of
the $165 million set aside for software and services in the
contract has already been obligated, even though no systems
have been delivered (four are in testing). The latest estimate
released by the army puts the life-cycle costs of SBIS's first
phase at $1.4 billion.<P>
For its extra billion, the DOD now expects considerably less:
the army has cut back the number of applications to be built
from 89 to just 19 and the number of installation sites from
128 to 43. So rather than replacing 985 of the army's 3,700
systems, this phase will apparently upgrade only about 180.
Mudd attributes the reductions to budget cuts. But according
to House Appropriations Committee staff, the SBIS budget
increased 56 percent last year, from $62 million to $97
million. Mudd responds that he has been handed a "major budget
cut" for next year. Paradoxically, cutting losses now could
raise the price for SBIS, by prolonging the time until
expensive old systems are replaced.<P>
One lesson the DOD should learn from this experience--as it
casts about for a strategy to replace CIM--is the virtue of
patience, says Sanford F. Reigle, who has been investigating
the initiative for the GAO. "It took them 30 years to get this
screwed up," he says. "We got there slowly, and we'll get out
of it slowly."<P>
Indeed, in 1993, four days after William Perry, then deputy
secretary of defense, ordered CIM to be accelerated so that
all systems would be complete in three years, former director
of defense information Paul Strassman objected in a memorandum
to Perry. The DOD maintains some 11,000 major applications and
perhaps 50,000 databases, he wrote: "The CIM goal to reverse
engineer this inventory is 20 to 50 times bigger and twice as
fast than anything ever attempted in the commercial sector.
The DOD record to date in delivering on time even one million
lines of code on schedule and on budget shows a 100% failure
rate." Strassman's warning might have had more impact had he
not resigned eight months earlier.<P>

<CENTER><H2>A Discerning Eye</H2>
</CENTER>
In the James Bond movie, "Never Say Never Again," a camera
zooms up to a character to identify him by the unique
appearance of his eye. At that time, there was no device that
could accomplish such a thing. But now Sensar, a subsidiary of
the David Sarnoff Research Center, has announced a
$25.8-million agreement with OKI Electric Industry Ltd. in
Tokyo, one of the world's leading suppliers of automated
teller machines (ATMs). This means iris recognition could be
coming to an ATM near you.<P>
Unlike signature verification, voice recognition or
fingerprinting, iris recognition requires little cooperation.
A person simply walks up to the machine and inserts his or her
bankcard. Meanwhile an ordinary video camera captures an image
of the customer's right or left eye. This image is converted
into a digital code, which is compared with one already stored
for that individual. If the system perceives a match, the
customer can proceed. The process takes about five seconds.<P>
Although color is the first thing we notice about someone's
eyes, recognition is based only on immutable structures of the
iris. These include the trabecular meshwork of connective
tissue, collagenous stromal fibers, ciliary processes,
contraction furrows, crypts, vasculature, rings, corona,
coloration and freckles. As with fingerprints, most of these
characteristics are established by random processes before
birth, says John G. Daugman of the Computer Laboratory at the
University of Cambridge, who developed the algorithm behind
the process. The iris's pattern--which is different in each
eye--appears to persist virtually unchanged throughout life.
Even identical twins have unique iris morphology. What is
more, no prosthesis can defeat the system because it detects
the minute pulsations and pupil changes that indicate living
tissue, contends Sensar's Kevin B. McQuade.<P>
Experts in high security have shown a keen interest in
iris-based identification: McQuade speaks in hushed tones
about inquiries from the Central Intelligence Agency. Frank
Bouchier of the Security Systems and Technology Center at
Sandia National Laboratories tested an early version on 199
eyes and found zero false accepts and less than 5 percent
false rejects.<P>
The first ATMs equipped with iris recognition are expected by
the end of this year. And if the technology catches on, it
could protect users of "smart" cards. The customer's iris code
could be stored on the card, and the merchant would be unable
to access the data unless the customer--or more precisely, the
customer's eye--were present.<P>

<CENTER><H2>Augmenting Discord</H2>
The real science of silicone<BR>
breast implants is hard to see<P>
</CENTER>
Last October a jury in Reno, Nev., ordered Dow Chemical
Company to pay Charlotte and Marvin Mahlum $14.1 million to
compensate the couple for Charlotte Mahlum's
illnesses--allegedly caused by the silicone in her breast
implants. Yet only a few days before, jurors in Texas voted to
exonerate Baxter Health Care, another company facing implant
liability lawsuits: the panel decided that silicone had not
caused immune disorders. And despite the magnitude of the
Mahlum settlement, all the subsequent jury rulings on breast
implants have rejected the plaintiffs' arguments of a health
hazard--reversing a nearly 15-year tendency to penalize the
makers of silicone.<P>
This legal trend suggests that a scientific consensus has
emerged on the overall safety of implants. Indeed, studies
have not found evidence for a link between silicone implants
and autoimmune disorders such as lupus, scleroderma and
rheumatoid arthritis. But researchers remain uncertain about
other side effects implants may have. If history is any
measure, legal, financial and emotional factors may outweigh
scientific ones in determining the future of implants--and not
only those for breasts.<P>
Silicone breast implants have been available since the early
1960s, but questions regarding their safety were raised only
recently. In 1992 the Food and Drug Administration removed
implants from the market until they could be reviewed further,
citing concern about the potential hazards of ruptured
implants, hardening of the breasts, and women's increased risk
for contracting autoimmune disorders. The agency restricted
their use to reconstructive surgery for mastectomy patients
participating in clinical trials. At the time, FDA
commissioner David A. Kessler explained the agency's decision
in the "New England Journal of Medicine": "Even after 30 years
of use involving one million women, adequate data to
demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of these devices do
not exist."<P>
Investigators at Harvard Medical School and the Mayo Clinic
have come to a different conclusion--at least about implants
and autoimmune conditions. Last summer Matthew H. Liang and
his colleagues from Brigham and Women's Hospital at Harvard
Medical School released a study of more than 87,000
women--with and without autoimmune diseases--1,183 of whom had
implants. According to Liang, the findings "should reassure
women with breast implants." In the Mayo Clinic study,
published in 1994, Sherine E. Gabriel and her colleagues
surveyed more than 2,000 women, including 749 with breast
implants. These researchers also found no link between
implants and autoimmune diseases.<P>
Despite such results, implants remain under FDA scrutiny.
Kessler testified before the U.S. House of Representatives
last year, saying that "neither of these studies...rules out a
small but significant increase in risk for rare connective
tissue disease." Critics of the two studies point out that
autoimmune diseases affect only a small percentage of the
population anyway, so a noticeable increase in the number of
cases would be apparent only in studies that consider a much
larger number of women. Currently the FDA is conducting
clinical trials to assess the short-term risks of implants,
such as rupture or hardening of the breasts.<P>
Although implants still have not been approved for widespread
use, the height of the panic over their safety appears to have
subsided. Roxanne J. Guy, a plastic and reconstructive surgeon
in Melbourne, Fla., states that the first stories about a
possible link between implants and autoimmune disorders
created among her patients a period of "almost hysteria." Now
she finds they tend to take the more circumspect attitude that
nothing is completely safe. Yet the scare has left some of her
patients unsure about where the truth lies, and this
uncertainty may be putting them at needless risk. Doctors
worry that women may be requesting unnecessary operations to
have safe implants removed.<P>
For their part, chemical companies appear to be feeling more
confident about proving their cases in court. Nevertheless,
the cost of defending themselves has been steep. To sidestep
future losses, some businesses have stopped making silicone
and other materials used in medical implant devices, ranging
from pacemakers to hormone-releasing implants for
postmenopausal women.<P>
According to Stephanie Burns of Dow Corning, mounting lawsuits
also present the possibility of a "biomaterials crisis in the
U.S. as companies withdraw raw materials for certain devices
from the market." Dow Corning, one of the leading producers of
silicone used in medical devices, has stopped supplying
implant companies with the material. According to the FDA,
there has not been a scarcity of critical products, but the
agency has expressed concern about the potential for
shortages.<P>
At the heart of both the scientific and legal debate about the
safety of breast implants lies a fundamental tension over
whether the benefits of breast augmentation outweigh the
risks. Although proponents can recount a list of benefits
resulting from the procedure--improved body image, more
self-confidence--these advantages may seem frivolous to
others.<P>
Even so, says Roberta Gartside, a plastic surgeon in the
Washington, D.C., area, "doctors must be careful about putting
their own value system on patients" and must provide them with
the safest treatment possible. But the legacy of the
controversy might make that goal medically impossible. On that
issue, the jury is still out.<P>

<B>Symmetries and Civilizations</B><BR>
This is the second half of our report on our sabbatical in South Africa. Last month we recounted the intriguing parallels and divergences between the earth's northern and southern halves. In this column, we reflect on a sadder kind of symmetry-breaking. South Africa has pursued for more than 80 years an unusual, fateful social asymmetry, profoundly dividing our single sentient species by decree.<P>
For a couple of months, we have lived in the zip code of Alice 5700, eastern Cape Province, South Africa. Alice was an old British settlement, a political and military strong point during the Victorian colonial wars that raged in this Border region. The town--no longer so single in purpose, in ancestry or in speech--now spans a square mile or more. Perhaps 1,000 dwellings, some set along old tree-lined roads, some along dusty recent ones, surround the fragmented sidewalks that mark out the half-dozen business blocks.<P>
 
Here the informal and formal economies of a very poor province are on daily, side-by-side display. The ladies in the market chat among their crates of bananas, potatoes and tomatoes, while the shoppers effortlessly balancing headloads stop or pass by. Hand trolleys carrying more varied goods roll out from the Saveway and the other storefronts, mostly transporting cargo to the crowded vans that perform as unscheduled, unofficial buses.<P>
A short distance from Alice, past the BP petrol station and across the river bridge, lies the University of Fort Hare and its 4,000 resident students. The university opened at the end of World War I as a place of higher education for black Africans, then unique in South Africa. We spent many of our hours at the university, teaching physics, forging new relationships and receiving lessons in the distorted legacy of apartheid.<P>
At first blush, Alice seems surprisingly well wired. The best evidence of this connectivity is the robot bank (what Americans call an automatic teller machine) that dispenses bundles of cash in rand. The machine reads our Bostonian bank card and accesses our account data after a delay of less than 30 seconds, no longer than the familiar wait back home in Cambridge, Mass. You can see 16 open pairs of telephone wires loop from pole to pole, strung along next to route R63 on their crowded metal racks of porcelain insulators. Follow the wires, however, and a picture of South African asymmetry begins to appear.<P>
Half of the pages in the regional telephone directory list the phone lines in the large "township" that adjoins the port city of East London. It is the residence of the black Africans who work in East London, a smaller counterpart of Soweto. In all, 10,000 phones are listed for a population that numbers perhaps a quarter of a million. Among the Alice listings--fewer than 800 in total--more than 100 are clearly connected with the university, and about as many are for other public and private organisms: the police, the furniture and the hardware stores, the textbook shop, the town waterworks, a noisy hotel-bar (alas, no cinema). Maybe 350 telephone lines serve Alice households.<P>
Nearly 300 of those connect to the "locations," a term of some small impoliteness for the rural villages of cement-block or daub-and-wattle houses, augmented by some shacks, that lie across the ridges and rolling hills of this semiarid region. The phone lines reach schools, churches, clinics, a store or two, and a few local leaders. In our region, telephones are as scarce as paved roads, electrical power, piped water and the rest of the basics that most of the people in these somewhat isolated villages lack--including jobs and arable land.<P>
Almost all the residents of the locations are Xhosa speakers (say "kosa" if you can't begin the word with a click), members of one of the largest South African polities. These African people came to these parts a millennium ago, to build a society first of cattle growers and later of farmers--a musical, religious and articulate culture. Much later, after a century of deadly conflict with the European settlers, the Xhosa were evicted just before World War I, from their own wide lands to less fertile locations. They now make up 85 percent of the provincial population.<P>
By common report, three quarters of the Xhosa adults now have no work. They eke out a living by drawing on the diversity of their extended families, stretching thin the income from someone's pension, another's wage check from a distant city, or some trading or craft skill. Goats and sheep still manage pretty well here; husbandry stands as a major economic activity of the region. But reliable means of life are no longer at hand for most Xhosa people in this hard and beautiful land.
National statistics support our local observations. There are roughly 42 million people in South Africa, two thirds of them urban and one in seven of them white. By a 1995 survey, four million of the nation's seven million dwellings are grossly deficient, lacking running water and electrical power. About 99.9 percent of the homes of whites have piped water, but a modest majority of nonwhite houses, most of them rural, need to fetch water daily. Seventy percent of white homes have home telephones; fewer than 1 percent of the black ones do.<P>
In this lopsided country, the digital global village lives side by side with the impoverished local village. Around Alice it is not uncommon to see a woman carrying an auto battery on her head emerge from the BP station. She is not helping out a stranded car; she is carrying a charged battery to an unelectrified home, where it will run a small black-and-white television for a few evenings' entertainment. A tall new mast on the ridge behind Alice promises vast bandwidth to come, a bonanza of bits for the roomful of PCs at Fort Hare.<P>
We are overjoyed that the petty apartheid of public humiliation and overt disrespect has gone from public view. It is Grand Apartheid, the asymmetrical economic and social privation of a landless and unserved majority, that remains a primary challenge for this energetic country, blessed with resources and watched by the eyes of the world.<P>
The technology that documents South Africa's asymmetries also holds the potential to restore some balance. Far from little Alice, the express highways stretch uncrowded, their fast motorists fueled mostly by coal dug by the miners of Natal. Coal is converted into gasoline in the world's only commercial fuel-synthesis program, developed to escape sanctions on imported oil. Modest offshore finds of gas and oil now augment the miners' work. High-power lines abound, feeding cities and industry, trickling off a little electricity to run security lights in the villages they pass.<P>
The rich mines that still earn most of the country's foreign exchange by winning gold, platinum metals and diamonds are under rapid computerization. Sweaty workers deep underground will carry laptop computers that map the three-dimensional volume of the mine for quick and precise reference amid the very rock. It is now possible to map and monitor the actual distribution of ore, a promise of great economy in labor and life. Miners need no longer blindly excavate too-large chambers while the data they need languish in aging ledgers and drawings far above.<P>
History issues no warranties. But the broken symmetry of human beings is here under restoration--more slowly than we might hope, but more easily than we might have expected. The symmetry of this rainbow nation with its optimistic, six-colored symmetrical flag will grow before us all. Travelers who yearn for new sights would do well to visit South Africa, a special zone for wide-open nature and among humans, a Zone of Hope.<P>

Not long ago, while I was wandering through that treasure-house of
technological history, the <a href ="http://www.si.edu/start.htm">Smithsonian
Institution</a> in Washington, D.C., I was reminded that evolution seems to
have made us the only animal on the planet with a conscious appreciation of
its own past.<p>
Which may be why, in 1801, James Macie,
scientific dabbler and the illegitimate son of the duke of Northumberland,
took on the aristocratic family name when the death of his father meant
there was nobody left to prevent him from doing so. Macie had two notable
claims to fame: he (a) wrote one of those monographs-you-can't-pick-up about
a bamboo-joint juice called <a href="http://www.kauai.net/bambooweb/bambooa2z.html">tabasheer</a> and (b)
devised a better way to make <a href="http://www.bid.com/bid/coffeezine/perfectcup.html">coffee</a>. That he was
elected to the prestigious <a href="http://www.maths.heriot-watt.ac.uk/RSE/">Royal Society</a> may have had
more to do with the influence of his immensely rich scientific pal Henry,
Lord Cavendish, discoverer of <a href="http://www.paltech.com/ttc/nha/">hydrogen</a>, who took Macie under his
wing and gave him free run of his private lab in London.<p>
Cavendish himself had a historical fetish, dressing in clothes of his
grandfather's time. He also became enmeshed in one of those "Who did it
first?" rows, about the composition of water. It all boiled down to the
Royal Society's misdating by a year (late) Cavendish's 1783 paper,
"Experiments on Air." And because everybody and his dog was then
investigating the same thing, the society's error led to charges that
Cavendish had plagiarized the paper from a similar one by James Watt. In the
end, Cavendish and Watt settled the dispute amicably over dinner at the
Royal Society, and Watt went back to his steam engines at the Birmingham
factory that he owned with his partner Matthew Boulton.<p>
In 1777 Boulton had taken on a job applicant named William Murdock, a handy
man on the lathe who went on to invent the "sun and planet" gearing system
that transformed the back-and-forth thrusts of Watt's steam-pump shafts into
the rotary motion that would drive the wheels of the industrial revolution.
And then he made that revolution work a little harder by adding a night
shift. In 1802, thanks to a process with which Murdock had been
experimenting for 11 years, the Boulton and Watt's Soho Engineering Works
became the first industrial premises to be lit by Murdock's amazing, if
rather smelly, new coal gas.<p>
Well, not that amazing to a Heidelberg chemist who, 52 years later, wanted a
flame free of all those malodorous impurities. Robert Bunsen was fascinated
by things that gave off fumes, like volcanoes in <a href="http://rvik.ismennt.is/~thorthor/iceland.html">Iceland</a> or factory
chimneys in Germany. Bunsen was especially concerned with devising ways to
recycle the heat being lost up the flues at iron foundries. So he was hot
stuff on hot stuff. Which is why his name is familiar to any schoolkid who
has ever done any lab work: the Bunsen burner that he invented produced a
nonluminous coal-gas flame, free of anything except what you chose to burn
in it. In fact, Bunsen chose quite a few materials, aided by his sidekick,
<a href ="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Kirchhoff.html">Gustav
Kirchhoff</a>, who was the one who gave him the idea.<p>
As ever, Kirchhoff got the idea from somebody else: optician <a href ="http://www.fhg.de/history.html">Joseph von Fraunhofer</a>, who some decades
earlier had been checking his lenses for imperfections using the fine, dark
lines he saw in the rainbow of colors that appeared when he passed light
through a prism; flaws made the lines wavy or smeared. Kirchhoff and Bunsen
chose the Bunsen burner as their light source and started burning
everything. The upshot of all this conflagration was the discovery, among
other things, of <a href ="http://hydrogen.cchem.berkeley.edu/Table/Cs.html">cesium</a> 
and <a href="http://hydrogen.cchem.berkeley.edu/Table/Rb.html">rubidium</a>. Today we
call what they were up to "<a href ="http://www-wilson.ucsd.edu/education/spectroscopy/spectroscopy.html">spectroscopy</a>."
You pass the light from a burning substance through a prism, and you see
dark lines in the resulting spectrum at a set of frequencies (or colors)
unique to the stuff being burned. Look up the lines in your tables, and you
know what the material is. If they're not in there, you've found something
new. And all you need to perform this trick is a tiny amount of the material
you want to identify.<p>
In 1864 this last fact excited the Brit Henry Sorby, who traveled everywhere
with his mother and who was a freak for the very small. Sorby had pioneered
the technique of slicing rocks so thin that you could read a newspaper
through them; he then subjected them to microscopic examination to see how
they had been formed. As soon as he found out what was going on at Bunsen's
lab in Heidelberg, Sorby broadened his field by sticking a <a href="http://desargues.ucsd.edu/step_projects/spectroscope.lab.html">spectroscope</a>
on the end of his microscope and analyzing the microconstituents of
everything from poison chemicals to autumn leaves. It was while peering at
the latter that Sorby found what makes them go russet: <a href="http://www.chemie.fu-berlin.de/chemistry/oc/terpene/carotin.html">carotene</a>,
the pigment responsible for the vivid coloration of nearly every
red-yellow-orange living thing.<p>
Then, in 1876, Franz Boll, a German professor studying <a href="http://george.lbl.gov/vfrog/dissect.html">frog</a> retinas in Rome, came
across that same material when he discovered the visual pigment that enables
the eye to see in both bright and dim light. Boll found that bright light
bleached light-sensitive "rods" in the retina from red-purple to orange and
finally to white. Further examination revealed that the substance that
reverses the process when the light level drops again was a form of
carotene. Meanwhile Boll visited Berlin, where he explained his work to
various scientific-establishment godfathers, including Ernst Pringsheim.<p>
Radiation physics was Pringsheim's particular line--<a href="http://bolero.gsfc.nasa.gov/astro/cobe/cobe_home.html">infrared
radiation</a> in very particular. For the investigation of infrared rays, he
developed a special version of the radiometer, an instrument for measuring
radiant energy. The radiometer (today a toy known as a light-mill) had been
invented by the eminent Victorian sage and experimenter Sir William Crookes.
It consisted of four tiny vanes, each lampblacked on one side, attached to
crossed arms that were delicately balanced atop a steel spindle resting in a
cup; the whole was encased in a glass vessel that had been pumped out to a
high vacuum. When a light was brought close to the little gizmo, it
revolved, a behavior that Crookes (and most others, including Pringsheim)
attributed to particles of light hitting the black vanes. Wrong. As was
embarrassingly revealed by a British expert on flow called Osborne Reynolds.
What was really happening was that the blackened side of the vanes heated
up, causing tiny amounts of gas trapped in the pith to expand and leak out.
It was this escaping gas, and not the light, that was doing the pushing.
Infrared faces all around.<p>
Crookes, unperturbed, was busy with other inquiries. Apart from inventing
the cathode-ray tube and being elected president of the Royal Society,
Crookes hired himself out as a freelance chemistry consultant; after all, he
had 10 children to support. Crookes also had another, less public side to
his character. He got his kicks from a ghost, name of Katie King. This lady
would appear at seances, where she was photographed arm in arm with the
infatuated inventor (who also frequently witnessed other paranormalities,
such as self-playing accordions and self-levitating water jugs).
<p>
Now, Cookes's fascination with spiritualism was shared by many of his
contemporaries, including a young man whose writings on the subject were
quite well known. Less so was his other principal area of interest. <a href
=gopher://gopher.vt.edu:10010/11/156S>Alfred Russel Wallace</a> had spent
several years in the Malay Archipelago, where, among other pursuits, he
identified a peculiar dividing line; to the east and west of that line,
there appeared to be species entirely unrelated to one another. As part of
his investigations into this unusual phenomenon, he formulated a theory of
life that would have put him on the scientific front page, but for the
deferential nature of his character. He let himself be persuaded to allow
another naturalist, who had come to the same conclusions, read a paper in
their joint names at the London Linnean Society, and then publish their
thesis as a book. The publication shook the world of natural history to its
roots and carried only the other guy's name.
<p>
Which is why my opening Smithsonian thoughts about evolution were "<a href=gopher://gopher.vt.edu:10010/02/69/2S>Darwinian</a>" and not "<a href=gopher://gopher.vt.edu:10010/11/156S>Wallacean</a>." And also why I kicked
off talking about James Macie. He was the fellow who left the endowment that
founded the Smithsonian and forever recorded his proud sense of history; the
family name Macie adopted upon his ducal father's death was <a href="http://www.si.edu/welcome/musovrvw/sihistry.htm">Smithson</a>.

Imagine a house that always knows where your kids are and
tells you if they are getting into trouble. Or an office that
sees when you are having an important meeting and shields you
from interruptions. Or a car that senses when you are tired
and warns you to pull over. Scientists have long tried to
design computer systems that could accomplish such feats.
Despite their efforts, modern machines are still no match for
baby-sitters or secretaries. But they could be.<P>
The problem, in my opinion, is that our current computers are
both deaf and blind: they experience the world only by way of
a keyboard and a mouse. Even multimedia machines, those that
handle audiovisual signals as well as text, simply transport
strings of data. They do not understand the meaning behind the
characters, sounds and pictures they convey. I believe
computers must be able to see and hear what we do before they
can prove truly helpful. What is more, they must be able to
recognize who we are and, as much as another person or even a
dog would, make sense of what we are thinking.<P>
To that end, <A HREF="http://www-white.media.mit.edu/vismod">my
group at the Media Laboratory</A> at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology has recently developed a family of
computer systems for recognizing faces, expressions and
gestures. The technology has enabled us to build environments
that behave somewhat like the house, office and car described
above. These areas, which we call smart rooms, are furnished
with cameras and microphones that relay their recordings to a
nearby network of computers. The computers assess what people
in the smart room are saying and doing. Thanks to this
connection, visitors can use their actions, voices and
expressions-instead of keyboards, sensors or goggles-to
control computer programs, browse multimedia information or
venture into realms of virtual reality.
The key idea is that because the smart room knows something
about the people in it, it can react intelligently to them.
Working together with <A
HREF="http://pattie.www.media.mit.edu/people/pattie/">Pattie
Maes</A> and me, graduate students <A HREF="http://www-white.media.mit.edu/vismod/people/students/darrell.html">Trevor Darrell</A>
and Bruce M. Blumberg constructed the first smart room in 1991
at M.I.T. The initiative quickly grew into a collaborative
experiment and now involves five such rooms, all linked by
telephone lines, around the world: three in Boston, one in
Japan and one in the U.K. (Installations are also planned for
Paris, New York City and Dallas.)<P>
Each room contains several machines, none more powerful than a
personal computer. These units tackle different problems. For
instance, if a smart room must analyze images, sounds and
gestures, we equip it with three computers, one for each type
of interpretation. If greater capabilities are needed, we add
more machines. Although the modules take on different tasks,
<A HREF="0496pentlandbox3.html"><IMG SRC="0496pentlandbox3.gif" ALIGN=left BORDER=0 HSPACE=5 VSPACE=5></A> they all rely on the same statistical method, known as maximum
likelihood analysis: the computers compare incoming
information with models they have stored in memory. They
calculate the chance that each stored model describes the
observed input and ultimately pick the closest match. By
making such comparisons, our smart-room machines can answer a
range of questions about their users, including who they are
and sometimes even what they want.<P>
<B><A NAME="where">Where?</A></B><P>
Before a smart room can begin to figure out what people are
doing, it needs to locate them. So graduate students
<A
HREF="http://www-white.media.mit.edu/vismod/people/students/wren.html">Christopher
R. Wren</A>, <A HREF="http://www-white.media.mit.edu/vismod/people/students/azerbayejani.html">Ali Azarbayejani</A> and Darrell and I
developed a system called <A HREF="http://www-white.media.mit.edu:80/vismod/pfinder">Person Finder</A> (Pfinder for short) that can track one person as he or she moves around in
the room. As do our other systems, Pfinder adopts the maximum
likelihood approach. First, it models the person the camera
records as a connected set of blobs-two for the hands, two for
the feet and one each for the head, shirt and pants. It
describes each blob in two ways: as a distribution of values
for the blob's color and placement, and as a so-called
support map, essentially a list indicating which image pixels
belong to the blob (pixels are "picture elements," similar to
the dots that make up a television image). Next, Pfinder
creates textured surfaces to model the background scene. Each
point on one of these surfaces correlates to an average color
value and a distribution around that mean.
<A HREF="0496pentlandbox1.html"><IMG
SRC="0496pentlandbox1.gif" ALIGN=left BORDER=0 HSPACE=5
VSPACE=5></A> Whenever the camera in the smart room picks up a
new picture in the video stream, Pfinder compares that image
with the models it has made and with other references as well.
To start, the system guesses what the blob model should look
like in the new image. If, for example, a person's upper body
was moving to the right at one meter per second a tenth of a
second ago, then Pfinder will assume that the center of the
upper body blob has moved a tenth of a meter to the right.
Such estimates are also checked against typical patterns of
movement that we have derived from testing the system on
thousands of people. For instance, we know that blobs
corresponding to the torso must move slowly, whereas those
relating to hands and feet generally move much faster.<P>
Predictions finished, Pfinder then measures the chance that
each pixel in the new image belongs to each blob. It does so
by subtracting the pixel's color and brightness values from
each blob's mean color and brightness values. It compares the
result with each blob's distribution to determine how likely
it is that the difference happened by chance. If, for example,
the brightness difference between a pixel and a blob were 10
percent, and the blob's statistics said that such a difference
happened only 1 percent of the time, the chance that the pixel
belonged to the blob would be a mere one in 100. Shadows
present a minor problem in that they cause brightness
differences that have nothing to do with the probability that
some pixel belongs to some blob. So Pfinder searches out
shadows, areas that are darker than expected, and evens out
their color hue and saturation using the area's overall
brightness.<P>
Pfinder must also overcome slight changes in the lighting or
arrangement of objects in the room, either of which might make
it place certain pixels in the wrong models. To avoid this
difficulty, the system continuously updates the pixels that
are visible behind the user, averaging the old color
information with the new. In this way, it keeps track of
changes that occur, for instance, when the user moves a book
and thus alters the scene in two places: where the book was
and where it now is. After completing these various
calculations and compensations, Pfinder at last assigns each
pixel in the new image to the model that most likely contains
it. Finally, it updates the statistics describing the blob
model and the background scene, as well as those anticipating
which way the blobs will move.<P>
<B>Who and How?</B><P>
Aside from knowing where people are, a smart room must also
know who they are and what they are saying. Many workers have
invented algorithms that allow computers to understand speech.
Virtually all those systems work well only when the user wears
a microphone or sits near one. A room that interpreted your
actions only when you stood in a particular spot would not
seem so smart. So graduate students <A
HREF="http://www-white.media.mit.edu/
vismod/people/students/basu.html">Sumit Basu</A> and Michael
Casey and I looked for another solution-one that would let a
computer decode a user's speech as he or she moved freely
about some room, even if the room were quite noisy. Our end
product takes advantage of the fact that Pfinder follows the
user's position at all times. Borrowing this information, the
speech-recognition system electronically "steers" an array of
fixed microphones so that they reinforce only those sounds
coming from the direction of the user's mouth. It is an easy
job. Because sound travels at a fixed speed, it arrives at
different locations at slightly different times. So each sound
location yields a different pattern of time delays. Thus, if
the system takes the outputs from a fixed array of microphones
and adds them to time delays that characterize a certain
location, it can reinforce the sound from that location. Then
it need only compare the sound with those of known words until
a match is found.<P>
A smart room must also know who is speaking in it or to it. To
act with seeming intelligence, it is absolutely vital that a
system know its users' identity. Who gives a command is often
as important as the command itself. The fastest way to
identify someone may well be to recognize his or her face. So
we developed a system for our rooms to do just that. To employ
the maximum likelihood approach, this system first needed to
build models of all the faces it "knew." Working with M.I.T.
graduate students Matthew A. Turk and <A
HREF="http://www.white.media.mit.edu/vismod/people/students/moghaddam.html">Baback
Moghaddam</A>, we found that it was important to focus on
those features that most efficiently described an entire set
of faces. We used a mathematical technique called eigenvector
analysis to describe those sets, dubbing the results
"eigenfaces." To model a face, the system determined how
similar that face was to each eigenface.<P>
The strategy has worked well. When the camera detects a
person, the identifying system extracts his or her
face-located by Pfinder-from the surrounding scene and
normalizes its contrast. The system then models the face in
terms of what similarities it bears to the eigenfaces. Next,
it compares the model with those of known people. If any of
the similarity scores are close, the system assumes that it
has identified the user. Using this method, our smart rooms
have accurately recognized individual faces 99 percent of the
time amid groups of several hundred.<P>
Facial expression is almost as important as identity. A
teaching program, for example, should know if its students
<A HREF="0496pentlandbox2.html"><IMG SRC="0496pentlandbox2.gif" ALIGN=left BORDER=0 HSPACE=5 VSPACE=5></A>
look bored. So once our smart room has found and identified
someone's face, it analyzes the expression. Yet another
computer compares the facial motion the camera records with
maps depicting the facial motions involved in making various
expressions. Each expression, in fact, involves a unique
collection of muscle movements. When you smile, you curl the
corners of your mouth and lift certain parts of your forehead;
when you fake a smile, though, you move only your mouth. In
experiments conducted by scientist Irfan A. Essa and me, our
system has correctly judged expressions-among a small group of
subjects-98 percent of the time.<P>
<B>What?</B><P>
Recognizing a person's face, expression and speech is just the
first step. For houses, offices or cars to help us, they must
be able to put these basic perceptions in context. The same
motions, after all, can be interpreted quite differently
depending on what the person making them intends. When you
drive a car, for example, you sometimes take your foot from
the gas pedal because you want to slow down. But you do the
same when you get ready to make a turn. The difference is that
in preparing for a turn, you adjust the steering wheel as you
move your foot. So a computer system would need to consider
how your movements had changed over time, in combination with
other movements, to know what you were doing at any one
moment.<P>
In designing such a system, we borrowed ideas from the
scientists working on speech recognition. They model
individual words as sequences of sounds, or, as they call
them, internal states. Each word has a characteristic
distribution of internal states, which are sometimes phonemes
(the smallest distinguishable units of speech) and sometimes
just parts of phonemes. A computer system tries to identify
words by comparing the sequence of sounds they contain with
word models and then selecting the most likely matches.<P>
We generalized this approach in the hope of determining
people's intentions from their movements. We devised a
computer system that can tell, for example, whether a person
with one arm extended is pointing or merely stretching. The
system recognizes the action involved in pointing by referring
to a model having three internal states: raise the hand, hold
it steady and return it quickly. The system sees stretching as
one continuous movement. So by observing these internal
states-characterized by the acceleration of the hand and the
direction of its movement-our system works out what someone is
doing.<P>
To date, we have built several different systems for
interpreting human actions in this way. The simplest allow
people to use their body to control virtual environments. One
such application is the <A
HREF="http://alive.www.media.mit.edu/projects/alive">Artificial
Life Interactive Video Environment (ALIVE)</A>, a joint
project of Maes's group and my own. ALIVE utilizes the smart
room's description of the user's shape to place a video model
of the user into a virtual-reality scene, where
computer-generated life-forms reside. These virtual critters
analyze information about a user's gestures, sounds and
positions to decide how to interact with him or her. Silas the
virtual dog, for example, plays fetch.<P>
When a smart-room user
mimics the motions involved in picking up and throwing Silas's
virtual ball, the dog sees the video image in the ALIVE
environment do the same and gets ready to chase after its toy.
Silas also sits and rolls over on command.
The smart room's output can be put to work in an even more
direct manner. The user's body position can be mapped into a
control space of sorts so that his or her sounds and gestures
change the operating mode of a computer program. Game players,
for example, have used this interface, instead of a joystick
or trackball, to navigate three-dimensional virtual
environments. If opponents appear on the left, the player need
only turn to the left to face them; to fire a weapon, the
player need only say, "Bang."<P>
<B>Why?</B>
<P>
Virtual-reality games aside, many more practical applications of smart-room technology exist. Consider 
<A
HREF="http://babel.uoregon.edu/yamada/guides/asl.html">American
Sign Language (ASL)</A>, a set of sophisticated hand gestures
used by deaf and mute people. Because the gestures are quite
complex, they offer a good test of our room's abilities.
Hence, graduate student Thad Starner and I set out to build a
system for interpreting ASL. We first built models for each
sign, observing many examples of the hand motions involved, as
described by Pfinder. We found that if we compared these
models with Pfinder's models of an actual user while he or she
was signing, we could translate a 40-word subset of ASL in
real time with an accuracy rate of 99.2 percent. If we can
increase the size of the vocabulary that our system
understands-and it seems very likely that we will be able to
do so-it may be possible to create interfaces for deaf people
as reliable as the speech-recognition systems that are now
being introduced for people who can hear.
Automobile drivers, too, stand to benefit from smart-room
technology. In many parts of the U.S., the average worker
spends 10 hours a week in a car. More than 40,000 motorists
die in traffic accidents each year, the majority of which can
be attributed to driver error. So together with 
<A HREF="http://pathfinder.cbr.com/people/andy/andy.html">Andy
Liu</A>, a scientist at <A
HREF="http://pathfinder.cbr.com/">Nissan Cambridge Basic
Research</A>, we have been building a smart-room version of a
car interior. The ultimate goal is to develop a vehicle that
can monitor what the driver is doing and provide useful
feedback, such as road directions, operating instructions and
even travel warnings.
To compile a set of driving models-including what actions
people took when they were passing, following, turning,
stopping, accelerating or changing lanes-we observed the hand
and leg motions of many drivers as they steered their way
through a simulated course. We used the resulting models to
classify a test driver's action as quickly as possible.
Surprisingly, the system could determine what the driver was
doing almost as soon as the action had started. It classified
actions with an accuracy of 86 percent within 0.5 second of
the start of an action. Given two seconds, the accuracy rose
to 97 percent.<P>
We have shown that, at least in simple situations, it is
possible to track people's movements, identify them and
recognize their expressions in real time using only modest
computational resources. By combining such capabilities, we
have built smart rooms in which, free from wires or keyboards,
individuals can control computer displays, play with virtual
creatures and even communicate by way of sign language. Such
perceptual intelligence is already beginning to spread to a
wider variety of situations. For instance, we are now building
prototypes of eyeglasses that recognize your acquaintances and
whisper their names in your ear. We are also working on
television screens that know when people are watching them.
And we plan to develop credit cards that can recognize their
owners and so know when they have been stolen.<P>
Other research groups at the Media Lab are working to grant
our smart rooms the ability to sense attention and emotion and
thereby gain a deeper understanding of human actions and
motivations. <A
HREF="http://www.white.media.mit.edu/vismod/people/students/picard.html">Rosalind
W. Picard</A> hopes to devise a system that can tell when
drivers or students are not paying attention. <A HREF="http://www.white.media.mit.edu:80/vismod/people/faculty/bobick.html">Aaron
Bobick</A> is writing software to interpret the human motions used in
sports-imagine a television camera that could discriminate
between two football plays, say, a quarterback sneak and an
end run, and follow the action. As smart-room technology
develops even further, computers will come to seem more like
attentive assistants than insensible tools. In fact, it is not
too far-fetched to imagine a world in which the distinction
between inanimate and animate objects actually begins to
blur.<P>

<FONT size=4>"It seemed as if the world was coming to an end... I could not believe my eyes; I saw the reactor ruined by the explosion. I was the first man in the world to see this. As a nuclear engineer I realized all the consequences of what had happened. It was a nuclear hell. I was gripped by fear."</FONT>
</CENTER><HR SIZE=5 WIDTH=25%>
<P>
These words were written to me in 1986 by the head of the shift operating the reactor that exploded at the <A HREF="http://polyn.net.kiae.su/polyn/manifest.html">Chornobyl nuclear power plant </A> in northern Ukraine. The explosion and a resulting fire showered radioactive debris over much of eastern Europe. The author of the words above, along with several others, was later jailed for his role in the disaster, although he never admitted guilt.
<P>
Subsequent official investigations have shown, however, that responsibility for this extraordinary tragedy reaches far beyond just those on duty at the plant on the night of April 25 and early morning of April 26, 1986. The consequences, likewise, have spread far beyond the nuclear energy industry and raise fundamental questions for a technological civilization. Before the explosion, Chornobyl was a small city hardly known to the outside world. Since then, the name-often known by its Russian spelling, Chernobyl has entered the chronicle of the 20th century as the worst technogenic environmental disaster in history. It is an internationally known metaphor for catastrophe as potent as "Stalingrad" or "Bhopal." Indeed, it is now clear that the political repercussions from Chornobyl accelerated the collapse of the Soviet empire.
<P>
Because of the importance of this calamity for all of humanity, it is vital that the world understands both the reasons it happened and the consequences. The events that led up to the explosion are well known. Reactor number four, a 1,000-megawatt <A HREF="http://www.polyn.net.kiae.su/polyn/rbmksht.html">RBMK-1000 design</A>, produced steam that drove generators to make electricity. On the night of the accident, operators were conducting a test to see how long the generators would run without power. For this purpose, they greatly reduced the power being produced in the reactor and blocked the flow of steam to the generators.
<P>
Unfortunately, the RBMK-1000 has a design flaw that makes its operation at low power unstable. In this mode of operation, any spurious increase in the production of steam can boost the rate of energy production in the reactor. If that extra energy generates still more steam, the result can be a runaway power surge. In addition, the operators had disabled safety systems that could have averted the reactor's destruction, because the systems might have interfered with the results of the test. 
<P>
At 1:23 and 40 seconds on the morning of April 26, realizing belatedly that the situation had become hazardous, an operator pressed a button to activate the automatic protection system. The action was intended to shut the reactor down, but by this time it was too late. What actually happened can be likened to a driver who presses the brake pedal to slow down a car but finds instead that it accelerates tremendously.
<P>
Within three seconds, power production in the reactor's core surged to 100 times the normal maximum level, and there was a drastic increase in temperature. The result was two explosions that blew off the 2,000-metric-ton metal plate that sealed the top of the reactor, destroying the building housing it. The nuclear genie had been liberated.
<P>
Despite heroic attempts to quell the ensuing fire, hundreds of tons of graphite that had served as a moderator in the reactor burned for 10 days. Rising hot gases carried into the environment aerosolized fuel as well as fission products, isotopes that are created when uranium atoms split apart. The fuel consisted principally of uranium; mixed in with it was some plutonium created as a by-product of normal operation. Plutonium is the most toxic element known, and some of the fission products were far more radioactive than uranium or plutonium. Among the most dangerous were iodine 131, strontium 90 and cesium 137.
<P>
A <A HREF="http://www-ep.es.llnl.gov/www-ep/atm/ras/chernob.html">plume containing these radioisotopes</A> moved with prevailing winds to the north and west, raining radioactive particles on areas thousands of miles away. Regions affected included not only Ukraine itself but also Belarus, Russia, Georgia, Poland, Sweden, Germany, Turkey and others. Even such distant lands as the U.S. and Japan received measurable amounts of radiation. In Poland, Germany, Austria and Hungary as well as Ukraine, crops and milk were so contaminated they had to be destroyed. In Finland, Sweden and Norway, carcasses of reindeer that had grazed on contaminated vegetation had to be dumped.
<P>
<P>
<B>Widespread Effects</B>
<P>
<P>
The total amount of radioactivity released will never be known, but the official Soviet figure of 90 million curies represents a minimum. Other estimates suggest that the total might have been several times higher. It is fair to say that in terms of the amount of radioactive fallout-though not, of course, the heat and blast effects-the accident was comparable to a medium-size nuclear strike. In the immediate aftermath of the explosion and fire, 187 people fell ill from acute radiation sickness; 31 of these died. Most of these early casualties were firefighters who combated the blaze.
<P>
The destroyed reactor liberated hundreds of times more radiation than was produced by the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The intensity of gamma radiation on the site of the power plant reached more than 100 roentgens an hour. This level produces in an hour doses hundreds of times the maximum dose the International Commission on Radiological Protection recommends for members of the public a <I>year. </I>On the roof of the destroyed reactor building, radiation levels reached a frightening 100,000 roentgens an hour.
<P>
The human dimensions of the tragedy are vast and heartbreaking. At the time of the accident, I was working as a medical researcher at the Institute of Epidemiology and Infectious Diseases in Kiev, some 60 miles from the Chornobyl plant. Sometime on April 26 a friend told me that people had been arriving at hospitals for treatment of burns sustained in an accident at the plant, but we had no idea of its seriousness. There was little official news during the next few days, and what there was suggested the danger was not great. The authorities jammed most foreign broadcasts, although we could listen as Swedish radio reported the detection of high levels of radioactivity in that country (<A HREF="http://www.radek.slu.se/radio/chern.htm">click here</A> for information on Swedish effects) and elsewhere. I and some other physicians decided to drive toward the accident site to investigate and help as we could.
<P>
We set off cheerfully enough, but as we got closer we started to see signs of mass panic. People with connections to officialdom had used their influence to send children away by air and rail. Others without special connections were waiting in long lines for tickets or occasionally storming trains to try to escape. Families had become split up. The only comparable social upheaval I had seen was during a cholera epidemic. Already many workers from the plant had been hospitalized.
<P>
The distribution of the fallout was extremely patchy. One corner of a field might be highly dangerous, while just a few yards away levels seemed low. Nevertheless, huge areas were affected. Although iodine 131 has a half-life of only eight days, it caused large radiation exposures during the weeks immediately following the accident. Strontium 90 and cesium 137, on the other hand, are more persistent. Scientists believe it is the cesium that will account for the largest radiation doses in the long run.
<P>
All told, well over 260,000 square kilometers of territory in Ukraine, Russia and Belarus (see <A HREF="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/sircxsar/chernobyl.html">radar map</A>) of this region) still have more than one curie per square kilometer of contamination with cesium 137. At this level, annual health checks for radiation effects are advised for residents. In my own country of Ukraine, the total area with this level of contamination exceeds 35,000 square kilometers-more than 5 percent of the nation's total area. Most of this, 26,000 square kilometers, is arable land. In the worst affected areas there are restrictions on the use of crops, but less contaminated districts are still under cultivation.
<P>
The heavily contaminated parts of Ukraine (see <A HREF="http://www.osc.edu/ukraine_nonpubl/htmls/maps.html">maps</A>) constitute 13 administrative regions (oblasts). In these oblasts are 1,300 towns and villages with a total population of 2.6 million, including 700,000 children. Within about 10 days of the accident, 135,000 people living in the worst-affected areas had left their homes; by now the total has reached 167,000. Yet it is clear that the authorities' attempts to keep the scale of the disaster quiet actually made things worse than they need have been. If more inhabitants in the region had been evacuated promptly during those crucial first few days, radiation doses for many people might have been lower.
<P>
The region within 30 kilometers of the Chornobyl plant is now largely uninhabited; 60 settlements outside this zone have also been moved. Formerly busy communities are ghost towns. The government has responded to this unprecedented disruption by enacting laws giving special legal status to contaminated areas and granting protections to those who suffered the most. Yet the repercussions will last for generations.
<P>
<P>
<B>Multiple Illnesses
<P>
</B>
<P>
The medical consequences (described by the <A HREF="http://laplace.ee.latrobe.edu.au:8080/%7Ekhorsell/radiation/chernobyl/who/pr95-84.html">World Health Organization</A>) are, of course, the most serious. Some 30,000 people have fallen ill among the 400,000 workers who toiled as "liquidators," burying the most dangerous wastes and constructing a special building around the ruined reactor that is universally referred to as "the sarcophagus." Of these sick people, about 5,000 are now too ill to work.
<P>
It is hard to know, even approximately, how many people have already died as a result of the accident. Populations have been greatly disrupted, and children have been sent away from some areas. By comparing mortality rates before and after the accident, the environmental organization Greenpeace Ukraine has estimated a total of 32,000 deaths. There are other estimates that are higher, and some that are lower, but I believe a figure in this range is defensible. Some, perhaps many, of these deaths may be the result of the immense psychological stress experienced by those living in the contaminated region.
<P>
One medical survey of a large group of liquidators, carried out by researchers in Kiev led by Sergei Komissarenko, has found that most of the sample were suffering from a constellation of symptoms that together seem to define a new medical syndrome. The symptoms include fatigue, apathy and a decreased number of "natural killer" cells in the blood.
<P>
Natural killer cells, a type of white blood cell, can kill the cells of tumors and virus-infected cells. A reduction in their number, therefore, suppresses the immune system. Some have dubbed this syndrome "Chornobyl AIDS." Besides having increased rates of leukemia and malignant tumors, people with this syndrome are susceptible to more severe forms of cardiac conditions as well as common infections such as bronchitis, tonsillitis and pneumonia.
<P>
As a consequence of inhaling aerosols containing iodine 131 immediately after the accident, 13,000 children in the region experienced radiation doses to the thyroid of more than 200 roentgen equivalents. (This means they received at least twice the maximum recommended dose for nuclear industry workers for an entire year.) Up to 4,000 of these children had doses as high as 2,000 roentgen equivalents. Because iodine collects in the thyroid gland, these children have developed chronic inflammation of the thyroid. Although the inflammation itself produces no symptoms, it has started to give rise to a wave of cases of thyroid cancer.
<P>
The numbers speak for themselves. Data gathered by the Kiev researcher Mykola D. Tronko and his colleagues indicate that between 1981 and 1985-before the accident-the number of thyroid cancer cases in Ukraine was about five a year. Within five years of the disaster the number had grown to 22 cases a year, and from 1992 to 1995 it reached an average of 43 cases a year. From 1986 to the end of 1995, 589 cases of thyroid cancer were recorded in children and adolescents. (In Belarus the number is even higher.) Ukraine's overall rate of thyroid cancer among children has increased about 10-fold from preaccident levels and is now more than four cases per million. Cancer of the thyroid metastasizes readily, although if caught early enough it can be treated by removing the thyroid gland. Patients must then receive lifelong treatment with supplemental thyroid hormones.
<P>
Other research by Ukrainian and Israeli scientists has found that one in every three liquidators-primarily men in their thirties-has been plagued by sexual or reproductive disorders. The problems include impotence and sperm abnormalities. Reductions in the fertilizing capacity of the sperm have also been noted. The number of pregnancies with complications has been growing among women living in the affected areas, and many youngsters fall prey to a debilitating fear of radiation.
<P>
The optimists who predicted no long-term medical consequences from the explosion have thus been proved egregiously wrong. These authorities were principally medical officials of the former Soviet Union who were following a script written by the political bureau of the Communist Party's Central Committee. They also include some Western nuclear energy specialists and military experts.
<P>
It is also true that the forecasts of "catastrophists"-some of whom predicted well over 100,000 cancer cases-have not come to pass. Still, previous experience with the long-term <A HREF="http://www.rerf.or.jp/">effects of radiation</A>  much of it derived from studies at Hiroshima and Nagasaki-suggests that the toll will continue to rise. Cancers caused by radiation can take many years before they become detectable, so the prospects for the long-term health of children in the high-radiation regions are, sadly, poor.
<P>
The hushing up of the danger from radiation in Soviet propaganda has produced quite the opposite effects from those intended. People live under constant stress, fearful about their health and, especially, that of their children. This mental trauma has given rise to a psychological syndrome comparable to that suffered by veterans of wars in Vietnam and Afghanistan. Among children evacuated from the reactor zone, there has been a 10- to 15-fold increase in the incidence of neuropsychiatric disorders.
<P>
The catastrophe and the resulting resettlement of large populations have also caused irreparable harm to the rich ethnic diversity of the contaminated areas, particularly to the so-called <I>drevlyany,</I> woodland people, and <I>polishchuks,</I> inhabitants of the Polissya region. Unique architectural features and other artifacts of their spiritual and material culture have been effectively lost as abandoned towns and villages have fallen into disrepair. Much of the beautiful landscape is now unsafe for humans.
<P>
The Ukrainian government, which is in a severe economic crisis, is today obliged to spend more than 5 percent of its budget dealing with the aftermath of Chornobyl. The money provides benefits such as free housing to about three million people who have been officially recognized as having suffered from the catastrophe, including 356,000 liquidators and 870,000 children. Ukraine has introduced a special income tax corresponding to 12 percent of earnings to raise the necessary revenue, but it is unclear how long the government can maintain benefits at current levels.
<P>
Today the Chornobyl zone is one of the most dangerously radioactive places in the world. In the debris of the ruined reactor are tens of thousands of metric tons of nuclear fuel with a total radioactivity level of some 20 million curies. The radiation level in the reactor itself, at several thousand roentgens per hour, is lethal for any form of life. But the danger is spread far and wide. In the 30-kilometer zone surrounding the reactor are about 800 hastily created burial sites where highly radioactive waste, including trees that absorbed radioisotopes from the atmosphere, has been simply dumped into clay-lined pits.
<P>
These dumps may account for the substantial contamination of the sediments of the Dnieper River and its tributary the Pripyat, which supply water for 30 million people. Sediments of the Pripyat adjacent to Chornobyl contain an estimated 10,000 curies of strontium 90, 12,000 curies of cesium 137 and 2,000 curies of plutonium. In order to prevent soluble compounds from further contaminating water sources, the wastes must be removed to properly designed and equipped storage facilities-facilities that do not yet exist.

The two reactors that are still in operation at the Chornobyl plant also pose a major problem (a fire put a third out of action in 1992). These generate up to 5 percent of Ukraine's power; the nuclear energy sector (a map of Ukrainian reactors can be seen <A HREF="http://www.ida.net/users/pbmck/xsovnuc/images/ukraine.jpg">here</A> altogether produces 40 percent of the country's electricity. Even so, Ukraine and the Group of Seven industrial nations last December signed a formal agreement on a cooperative plan to shut down the whole Chornobyl plant by the year 2000. The agreement establishes that the European Union and the U.S. will help Ukraine devise plans to mitigate the effects of the shutdown on local populations. It also sets up mechanisms to allow donor countries to expedite safety improvements at one of the reactors still in use. In addition, the agreement provides for international cooperation on decommissioning the plant, as well as on the biggest problem of all: an ecologically sound, long-term replacement for the sarcophagus that was built around the ruin of reactor number four.
<P>
The 10-story sarcophagus, which is built largely of concrete and large slabs of metal and has walls over six meters thick, was designed for a lifetime of 30 years. But it was constructed in a great hurry under conditions of high radiation. As a result, the quality of the work was poor, and today the structure is in need of immediate repair. Metal used in the edifice has rusted, and more than 1,000 square meters of concrete have become seriously cracked. Rain and snow can get inside. If the sarcophagus were to collapse-which could happen if there were an earthquake-the rubble would very likely release large amounts of radioactive dust.
<P>
In 1993 an international competition was held to find the best long-term solution. Six prospective projects were chosen for further evaluation (out of 94 proposals), and the next year a winner was selected-Alliance, a consortium led by Campenon Bernard of France. The consortium's proposal, which entails the construction of a "supersarcophagus" around the existing one, unites firms from France, Germany, Britain, Russia and Ukraine. The group has already conducted feasibility studies. If the project goes forward, design work will cost $20 million to $30 million, and construction-which would take five years-upwards of $300 million. Final disposal of the waste from the accident will take 30 years. One possibility being explored is that the waste might be encased in a special glass.
<P>
Chornobyl was not simply another disaster of the sort that humankind has experienced throughout history, like a fire or an earthquake or a flood. It is a global environmental event of a new kind. It is characterized by the presence of thousands of environmental refugees; long-term contamination of land, water and air; and possibly irreparable damage to ecosystems. Chornobyl demonstrates the ever growing threat of technology run amok.
<P>
The designers of the plant, which did not conform to international safety requirements, are surely culpable at least as much as the operators. The RBMK-1000 is an adaptation of a military reactor originally designed to produce material for nuclear weapons. There was no reinforced containment structure around the reactor to limit the effects of an accident. That RBMK reactors are still in operation in Ukraine, Lithuania and Russia should be cause for alarm.
<P>
The disaster illustrates the great responsibility that falls on the shoulders of scientific and other experts who give advice to politicians on technical matters. Moreover, I would argue that the former Soviet Union's communist leadership must share the blame. Despite then President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's professed support for glasnost, or openness, the regime hypocritically closed ranks in the aftermath of the tragedy in a futile and ultimately harmful attempt to gloss over the enormity of what had occurred.
<P>
The event offers a vivid demonstration of the failures of the monopolistic Soviet political and scientific system (documented <A HREF="http://sunsite.unc.edu/ expo/soviet.exhibit/chernobyl.html">here</A>. The emphasis under that regime was on secrecy and on simplifying safety features in order to make construction as cheap as possible. International experience with reactor safety was simply disregarded as described <A HREF="http:// www.uic.com.au/nip22.htm">here</A>. The calamity underscores, further, the danger that nuclear power plants could pose in regions where wars are being fought. Of course, all such plants are potentially vulnerable to terrorist attack.
<P>
Chornobyl has taught the nations of the world a dreadful lesson about the necessity for preparedness if we are to rely on nuclear technology. Humankind lost a sort of innocence on April 26, 1986. We have embarked on a new, post-Chornobyl era, and we have yet to comprehend all the consequences.

<TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH=336>

In the past few decades the human species has begun, seriously and
systematically, to look for evidence of life elsewhere. While no one has yet
found living organisms beyond the earth, there are some reasons to be encouraged.
Robotic space probes have identified worlds where life may once have gained a
toehold, even if it does not flourish there today. The Galileo spacecraft found
clear signs of life during its recent flight past the earth--a reassurance that
we really do know how to sniff out at least certain kinds of life. And rapidly
accumulating evidence strongly suggests that the universe abounds with planetary
systems something like our own.<P>

In practice, the community of scientists concerned with finding life elsewhere in
the solar system has contented itself with a chemical approach. Human beings, as
well as every other organism on the earth, are based on liquid water and organic
molecules. (Organic molecules are carbon-containing compounds other than carbon
dioxide and carbon monoxide.) A modest search strategy--looking for necessary if
not sufficient criteria--might then begin by looking for liquid water and organic
molecules. Of course, such a protocol might miss forms of life about which we are
wholly ignorant, but that does not mean we could not detect them by other
methods. If a silicon-based giraffe had walked by the Viking Mars landers, its
portrait would have been taken.<P>

Actually, focusing on organic matter and liquid water is not nearly so parochial
and chauvinistic as it might seem. No other chemical element comes close to
carbon in the variety and intricacy of the compounds it can form; liquid water
provides a superb, stable medium in which organic molecules can dissolve and
interact. What is more, organic molecules are surprisingly common in the
universe. Astronomers find evidence for them everywhere, from interstellar gas
and dust grains to meteorites to many worlds in the outer solar system.<P>

Some other molecules--hydrogen fluoride, for example--might approach water in
their ability to dissolve other molecules, but the cosmic abundance of fluorine
is extremely low. Certain atoms, such as silicon, might be able to take on some
of the roles of carbon in an alternative life chemistry, but the variety of
information-bearing molecules they provide seems comparatively sparse.
Furthermore, the silicon equivalent of carbon dioxide (silicon dioxide, the major
component of ordinary glass) is, on all planetary surfaces, a solid, not a gas.
That distinction would certainly complicate the development of a silicon-based
metabolism.<P>

On extremely cold worlds, where water is frozen solid, some other solvent--liquid
ammonia, for instance--might be a key to a different form of biochemistry. At low
temperatures, certain classes of molecules require very little activation energy
to undergo chemical reactions, but because our laboratories are at room
temperature and not, say, at the temperature of Neptune's satellite Triton, our
knowledge of those molecules may well be inadequate. For the moment, though,
carbon- and water-based life-forms are the only kinds we know or can even
imagine.<P>

On the earth the signature molecules of life are the nucleic acids (DNA and RNA),
which constitute the hereditary instructions, and the proteins, which, as
enzymes, catalytically control the chemistry of cell and organism. The codebook
for translating nucleic acid information into protein structure is essentially
identical for all life on the earth. This profound uniformity in the hereditary
chemistry suggests that every organism on our planet has evolved from a common
instance of the origin of life. If so, we have no way of knowing which aspects of
terrestrial life are necessary (required of all living things anywhere) and which
are merely contingent (the results of a particular sequence of happenstances
that, had they gone otherwise, might have led to organisms having very different
properties). We may speculate, but only by examining life elsewhere can
biologists truly determine what else is possible.<P>

The obvious place to start the search for life is in our own solar system. Robot
spacecraft have explored more than 70 planets, satellites, comets and asteroids
at distances varying from about 100 to about 100,000 kilometers. These ships have
been equipped with magnetometers, charged-particle detectors, imaging systems,
and photometric and spectrometric instruments that sense radiation ranging from
ultraviolet to kilometer-wavelength radio. For the moon, Venus and Mars,
observations from orbiters and landers have confirmed and expanded on findings
transmitted back from flyby spacecraft.<P>

None of these encounters has yielded compelling, or even strongly suggestive,
indications of extraterrestrial life. Still, such life, if it exists, might be
quite unlike the forms with which we are familiar, or it might be present only
marginally. Or the remote-sensing techniques used for examining other worlds
might be insensitive to the conceivably subtle signs of life on another world.
The most elementary test of these techniques--the detection of life on the earth
by an instrumented flyby spacecraft--had, until recently, never been attempted.
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Galileo has rectified that
omission.<P>

Galileo is a dual-purpose spacecraft that incorporates a Jupiter orbiter and
entry probe; it is currently in interplanetary space and is scheduled to reach
the Jupiter system in December 1995. For technical reasons, NASA was unable to
send Galileo on a direct course to Jupiter; instead the mission incorporated
three gravitational assists--two from the earth and one from Venus--to send it on
its journey. This looping course greatly lengthened the transit time, but it also
permitted the spacecraft to make close-up observations of our planet. Galileo's
instruments were not designed for an earth-encounter mission, so circumstance
fortuitously arranged a control experiment: a search for life on the earth using
a typical modern planetary probe. The results of Galileo's December 1990
encounter with the earth proved quite enlightening.<P>

An observer looking at the data from Galileo would immediately notice some
unusual facts about the earth. When my co-workers and I examined spectra taken by
Galileo at near-infrared wavelengths (just slightly longer than red light), we
noted a strong dip in brightness at 0.76 micron, a wavelength at which molecular
oxygen absorbs radiation. The prominence of the absorption feature implies an
enormous abundance of molecular oxygen in the earth's atmosphere, many orders of
magnitude greater than is found on any other planet in the solar system.<P>

Oxygen slowly combines with the rocks on the earth's surface, so the oxygen-rich
atmosphere requires a replenishing mechanism. Some oxygen is freed when
ultraviolet light from the sun splits apart molecules of water (H<sub>2</sub>O),
and the low-mass hydrogen atoms preferentially escape into space. But the great
concentration of oxygen (20 percent) in the earth's dense atmosphere is very hard
to explain by this process.<P>

If visible light, rather than ultraviolet, could split water molecules, the
abundance of oxygen could be understood, because the sun emits many more photons
of visible light than of ultraviolet. But photons of visible light are too feeble
to sever the H-OH bond in water. If there were a way to combine two visible light
photons to break apart the water molecule, then everything would have a ready
solution. Yet so far as we know, there is no way to accomplish this feat--except
through life, specifically through photosynthesis in plants. The prevalence of
molecular oxygen in the earth's atmosphere is our first clue that the planet
bears life.<P>

When Galileo photographed the earth, it found unmistakable evidence of a sharp
absorption band painting the continents: some substance was soaking up radiation
at wavelengths around 0.7 micron (the far red end of the visible spectrum). No
known minerals show such a feature, and it is found nowhere else in the solar
system. The mystery substance is in fact just the kind of light-absorbing pigment
we would expect if visible photons were being added together to break down water
and generate molecular oxygen. Galileo detected this pigment--which we know as
chlorophyll--covering most of the land area of the earth. (Plants appear green
precisely because chlorophyll reflects green light but traps the red and blue.)
The prevalence of the chlorophyll red band offers a second reason to think that
the earth is an inhabited planet.<P>

Galileo's infrared spectrometer also detected a trace amount, about one part per
million, of methane. Although that might seem insignificant, it is in startling
disequilibrium with all that oxygen. In the earth's atmosphere, methane rapidly
oxidizes into water and carbon dioxide. At thermodynamic equilibrium,
calculations indicate that not a single molecule of methane should remain. Some
unusual processes (which we know to include bacterial metabolism in bogs, rumina
and termites) must steadily refresh the methane supply. The profound methane
disequilibrium is a third sign of life on the earth.<P>

Finally, Galileo's plasma-wave instrument picked up narrow-band, pulsed,
amplitude-modulated radio emissions coming from the earth. These signals begin at
the frequency at which radio transmissions on the earth's surface are first able
to leak through the ionosphere; they look nothing like natural sources of radio
waves, such as lightning and the earth's magnetosphere. Such unusual, orderly
radio signals strongly suggest the presence of a technological civilization. This
is a fourth sign of life and the only one that would not have been apparent to a
similar spacecraft flying by the earth anytime within the past two billion
years.<P>

The Galileo mission served as a significant control experiment of the ability of
remote-sensing spacecraft to detect life at various stages of evolutionary
development on other worlds in the solar system. These positive results encourage
us that we would be able to spot the telltale signature of life on other worlds.
Given that we have found no such evidence, we tentatively conclude that
widespread biological activity now exists, among all the bodies of the solar
system, only on the earth.<P>

Mars is the nearest planet whose surface we can see. It has an atmosphere, polar
ice caps, seasonal changes and a 24-hour day. To generations of scientists,
writers and the public at large, Mars seemed the world most likely to sustain
extraterrestrial life. But flybys past and orbiters around Mars have found no
excess of molecular oxygen, no substances--whatever their nature--enigmatically
and profoundly departing from thermodynamic equilibrium, no unexpected surface
pigments and no modulated radio emissions. In 1976 NASA set down two Viking
landers on Mars. I was an experimenter on that mission. The landers were equipped
with instruments sensitive enough to detect life even in unpromising deserts and
wastelands on the earth.<P>

One experiment measured the gases exchanged between Martian surface samples and
the local atmosphere in the presence of organic nutrients carried from the earth.
A second experiment brought a wide variety of organic foodstuffs marked by a
radioactive tracer, to see if there were life-forms in the Martian soil that ate
the food and oxidized it, giving off radioactive carbon dioxide. A third
experiment exposed the Martian soil to radioactive carbon dioxide and carbon
monoxide to determine if any of it was taken up by microbes.<P>

To the initial astonishment of, I think, all the scientists involved, each of the
three Viking experiments gave what at first seemed to be positive results. Gases
were exchanged; organic matter was oxidized; carbon dioxide was incorporated into
the soil.<P>

But there are reasons that these provocative results are not generally thought to
provide a convincing argument for life on Mars. The putative metabolic processes
of Martian microbes occurred under a wide range of conditions: wet and dry, light
and dark, cold (only a little above freezing) and hot (almost the normal boiling
point of water). Many microbiologists deem it unlikely that Martian microbes
would be so capable under such varied conditions. Another strong reason for
skepticism is that an additional experiment to look for organic molecules in the
Martian soil gave uniformly negative results, even though the instruments could
detect such molecules at a sensitivity of around one part per billion. We
expected that any life on Mars--as with life on the earth--would be an expression
of the chemistry of carbon-based molecules. To find no such molecules at all was
daunting for the optimists among the exobiologists.<P>

The apparent positive results of the life-detection experiments on the two Viking
landers is now generally attributed to chemicals that oxidize the soil. These
chemicals form when solar ultraviolet light irradiates the Martian atmosphere. A
handful of Viking scientists still wonder whether extremely tough and resilient
organisms might exist, so thinly spread over the Martian soil that their organic
chemistry could not be detected but their metabolic processes could. Those
scientists do not deny the presence of ultraviolet-generated oxidants, but they
emphasize that nobody has yet been able to explain fully the Viking
life-detection results on the basis of oxidants alone. A few researchers have
made tentative claims of finding organic matter in a class of meteorites (the SNC
meteorites) that are thought to be bits of the Martian surface blasted into space
during ancient impacts. More likely, the organic material consists of
contaminants that entered the meteorite after its arrival on our world. So far
there are no claims of discovering Martian microbes in these rocks from the
sky.<P>

For the moment, it is safe to say that Viking found no compelling case for life
on Mars. No unambiguous signatures of life emerged from four very different,
extremely sensitive experiments conducted at two sites 5,000 kilometers apart on
a planet where fast winds transport fine particles around the globe. The Viking
findings suggest that Mars is, today at least, a lifeless planet.<P>

Could Mars have supported life in the distant past? The answer depends very much
on how quickly life can arise, a topic about which we remain sadly ignorant.
Astronomers are quite certain that, initially, the earth was inhospitable to life
because of the collisions of planetesimals, the planetary building blocks that
accreted together to form the earth. Early on, the earth was covered by a deep
layer of molten rock. After that magma froze, the occasional arrival of large
planetesimals would have boiled the oceans and sterilized the earth, if life had
already arisen.<P>

Things did not calm down until about 4.0 billion years ago. And yet fossils
reveal that by 3.6 billion years ago the earth abounded with microbial life
(including large, basketball-size stromatolites, colonies of microorganisms).
These early forms of life seem to have been biochemically very adept. Many were
photosynthetic, slowly contributing to the earth's bizarre oxygen-rich
atmosphere. Manfred Schidlowski of the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry in
Mainz has studied carbon isotope ratios preserved in ancient rocks; that work
provided (disputed) evidence that life was already flourishing 3.8 billion years
ago.<P>

The inferred time available for the origin of life on the earth is thus being
squeezed from two directions. According to current knowledge, that amount of time
may be as brief as 100 million years. When I first drew attention to this
"squeeze"--in 1973, after lunar samples returned by Apollo clarified the
chronology of impacts on the moon--I argued that the rapidity with which life
arose on the earth may imply that it is a likely process. It is dangerous to
extrapolate from a single example, but it would be a truly remarkable
circumstance if life arose quickly here while on many other, similar worlds,
given comparable time, it did not.<P>

Between 4.0 and 3.8 billion years ago, conditions on Mars, too, may have favored
the emergence of life. The surface of Mars is covered with evidence of ancient
rivers, lakes and perhaps even oceans more than 100 meters deep. The Mars of 4.0
billion years ago was much warmer and wetter than it is today. Taken together,
these pieces of information suggest, although they hardly prove, that life may
have arisen on ancient Mars as it did on the ancient earth. If so, as Mars
evolved from congenial to desolate, life would have held on in the last remaining
refugia--perhaps saline lakes or places where the interior heat had melted the
permafrost. Most planetary scientists agree that searching for chemical or
morphological fossils of ancient life should have high priority in future Martian
exploration. Although it is a long shot, searching for life in contemporary
Martian oases might also be a productive endeavor.<P>

It is now clear that organic chemistry has run rampant through the solar system
and beyond. Mars has two small satellites, Phobos and Deimos, which, because of
their dark color, seem to be made of (or at least covered by) organic matter.
They are widely thought to be captured asteroids from farther out in the solar
system. Indeed, there seems to be a vast population of small worlds covered with
organic matter: the so-called C- and D-type asteroids in the main asteroid belt
between Jupiter and Mars; the nuclei of comets such as Halley's Comet; and the
newly discovered class of asteroids near the outermost planets. In 1986 the
European Space Agency's Giotto spacecraft flew directly into the cloud of dust
surrounding Halley's Comet, revealing that its nucleus may be made of as much as
25 percent organic matter.<P>

A fairly abundant type of meteorite on the earth, known as carbonaceous
chondrite, is thought to consist of fragments from C-type asteroids in the main
belt. Carbonaceous meteorites contain an organic residue rich in aromatic and
other hydrocarbons. Scientists have also identified a number of amino acids (the
building blocks of the proteins) and nucleotide bases (the "rungs" of the DNA
double helix, which spell out the genetic code).<P>

Asteroidal and cometary fragments plunging into the atmosphere of the early earth
carried with them vast stores of organic molecules. Some of these survived the
intense heating on entry and therefore may have made a significant material
contribution to the origin of life. Impacts would have delivered similar supplies
of organic matter, along with water, to other worlds. Those worlds need not be as
richly endowed with liquid water as is the earth for critical steps in
prebiological chemistry to occur. The water could be found in ponds, in
subsurface reservoirs, as thin films on mineral grains or as ice melts formed by
impacts.<P>

One of the most fascinating and instructive worlds illustrating prebiological
organic chemistry is Saturn's giant moon, Titan (which is as large as the planet
Mercury). Here we can see the synthesis of complex organic molecules happening
before our eyes. Titan has an atmosphere 10 times as massive as the earth's,
composed mainly of molecular nitrogen, along with a few percent to 10 percent
methane. When <I>Voyager</I> 2 approached Titan in 1981, it could not see the
surface, because this world is entirely socked in by an opaque, reddish orange
haze. The surface temperature is very low, about 94 kelvins, or -179 degrees
Celsius. If we can judge from its density (much lower than that of solid rock)
and from the composition of nearby worlds, Titan should have a great deal of
water ice on and near its surface. A few simple organic molecules--hydrocarbons
and nitriles--are found to be minor constituents of Titan's atmosphere.<P>

Ultraviolet light from the sun, charged particles trapped in Saturn's
magnetosphere and cosmic rays all bombard Titan's atmosphere and initiate
chemical reactions there. When W. Reid Thompson of Cornell University and I
considered the effects of ultraviolet irradiation and simulated those of auroral
electron bombardment, we found the results agree well with the observed
abundances of gaseous organic constituents.<P>

My colleague Bishun N. Khare and I at Cornell simulated the pressure and
composition of the appropriate levels in Titan's atmosphere and irradiated the
gases with charged particles. The experiment produced a dark, organic solid that
we call Titan tholin, from the Greek word for "muddy." When we measure the
optical constants of Titan tholin, we find that it beautifully matches the
optical constants derived from observations of the Titan haze. No other proposed
material comes close.<P>

Organic molecules continually form in the upper atmosphere of Titan and slowly
fall out as new tholins are generated in the upper air. If this process has
continued over the past four billion years, Titan's surface must be covered by
tens, maybe even hundreds, of meters of tholin and other organic products.
Moreover, Thompson and I have calculated that over the history of the solar
system, a typical location on Titan has something like a 50-50 chance of having
experienced centuries of liquid water from the heat released by impacts. When we
mix Titan tholin with water in the laboratory, we make amino acids. There are
also traces of nucleotide bases, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and a wonderful
brew of other compounds. If 100 million years is enough for the origin of life on
the earth, could 1,000 years be enough for it on Titan? Could life have started
on Titan during the centuries following an impact, when lakes of water or
water-ice slurries briefly formed? The first close-up examination of Titan--by a
Saturn orbiter and Titan entry probe--is scheduled to occur when the ESA-NASA
Cassini mission reaches the Saturn system in about 2004.<P>

When we look beyond our solar system, into the gas and grains that populate
interstellar space, again we find striking signs of the prevalence of organic
chemistry. Astronomers examining microwaves emitted and absorbed by molecules at
distinctive frequencies have identified more than four dozen simple organic
compounds in interstellar space--hydrocarbons, amines, alcohols and nitriles,
some of them having long, straight carbon chains, such as HC11N. When a cloud of
interstellar dust grains lies between the earth and some more distant infrared
source, it is possible to determine which infrared wavelengths are absorbed by
the grains and hence to learn about their composition. <P>

Some of the missing infrared light is widely presumed to have been absorbed by
polycyclic aromatics, complex hydrocarbons similar to the compounds found in coal
tar. In the part of the infrared spectrum near 3.4 microns, three distinct
absorption features are seen. The same patterns appear in the spectra of comets,
in tholins made from the irradiation of hydrocarbon ices and in meteoritic
organic matter. That infrared fingerprint is probably caused by linked
(aliphatic) groups of carbon and hydrogen: -CH<sub>3</sub> and -CH<sub>2</sub>.
Yvonne Pendleton and her colleagues at the NASA Ames Research Center find that
the best spectral fit seems to be with meteoritic organic matter.<P>

The infrared match among comets, asteroids and interstellar clouds may represent
the first direct evidence that asteroids and comets contain organic matter that
originated on interstellar grains before gathering together in the infant solar
system. But the data are also amenable to an opposite interpretation--that some
of the organic matter that formed in the early solar nebula accumulated into
asteroids and comets, while some was ejected by the sun into interstellar space.
If 100 billion other stars did likewise, they could account for a significant
fraction of the organic matter in all the interstellar grains in the galaxy. The
prevalence of organic material in the outer solar system, in comets that come
from far beyond the outermost planets and in interstellar gas and grains strongly
suggests that complex organic matter-- relevant to the origin of life--is widely
spread throughout the Milky Way.<P>

Organic molecules on bone-dry interstellar grains fried by ultraviolet light and
cosmic rays seem an unlikely habitat for the origin of life, however. Life seems
to need liquid water, which in turn seems to require planets. Astronomical
observations increasingly indicate that planetary systems are common. A
surprisingly large number of nearby young stars of roughly solar mass are
surrounded by just the kind of disks of gas and dust that scientists going back
to Immanuel Kant and Pierre Simon, the Marquis de Laplace, say is needed to
explain the origin of the planets in our system. These disks provide a persuasive
though still indirect indication that there is a multitude of planets, presumably
including earthlike worlds, around other stars.<P>

George W. Wetherill of the Carnegie Institution of Washington has developed
detailed models for predicting the distribution of the planets that should be
formed in such circumstellar disks. Meanwhile James F. Kasting of Pennsylvania
State University has calculated the range of distances from their suns at which
planets can support liquid water on their surfaces. Taken together, these two
lines of inquiry suggest that a typical planetary system should contain one and
maybe even two earthlike planets circling at a distance where liquid water is
possible.<P>

Recently Alexander Wolszczan, also at Pennsylvania State, unambiguously detected
earthlike planets in a place where most astronomers least expected to find them:
around a pulsar, the swiftly spinning neutron-star remnant from a supernova
explosion. Based on variations in the timing of radio emissions from the pulsar
PSR B1257+12, Wolszczan has deduced the presence of three planets (so far called
only A, B and C) orbiting the pulsar.<P>

These worlds are closer to their star than the earth is to ours, and PSR B1257+12
emits in charged particles several times as much energy as does the sun in
electromagnetic radiation. If all the charged particles intercepted by A, B and C
are transformed into heat, these worlds must almost certainly be too hot for
life. But Wolszczan finds hints of at least one additional planet situated
farther from the pulsar. For all we know, this superficially unpromising system,
1,400 light-years from the earth, may contain a dark but habitable planet. It is
not clear whether these planets survived from before the supernova explosion or,
more likely, formed afterward from surrounding debris. Either way, their presence
suggests that planetary formation is an unexpectedly common and widespread
process.<P>

Numerous searches for planets in infant and mature sunlike systems are under way.
The pace of exploration is becoming so quick, and so many new techniques are
about to be employed, that it seems likely that in the next few decades
astronomers will begin accumulating a sizable inventory of planets around nearby
stars.<P>

We have every reason to believe that there are many water-rich worlds something
like our own, each provided with a generous complement of complex organic
molecules. Those planets that circle sunlike stars could offer environments in
which life would have billions of years to arise and evolve. Should not there be
an immense number and diversity of inhabited worlds in the Milky Way? Scientists
differ about the strength of this argument, but even at its best it is very
different from actually detecting life elsewhere. That monumental discovery
remains to be made.<P>

<BR>Imagine that the earth has been watched over the millenniums by a careful and
extremely patient extraterrestrial observer. Some 4.6 billion years ago the
planet completes its aggregation out of interstellar gas and dust. The last
planetesimals that fall in to make the earth produce enormous impact craters; the
planet heats up internally from the gravitational potential energy of its
accretion and from the decay of its radioactive elements; the heavy liquid iron
core separates from the lighter silicate mantle and crust; hydrogen-rich gases
and condensable water are released from the interior to the surface and a fairly
straightforward organic chemistry yields complex molecules that combine into
self-replicating molecular systems: the first terrestrial organisms. The rain of
interplanetary boulders dwindles, and in time running water, wind, mountain
building and other geological processes erase the scars of the earth's origin. A
vast planetary convection engine is established that carries mantle material up
through rifts in the ocean floor to form great crustal plates and then drives the
material back into the mantle at the margins of the continents; collisions
between plates push up chains of folded mountains, and the general configuration
of land and sea, of icy and tropical regions shifts continuously. Meanwhile
natural selection nominates from a wide range of alternative candidates those
varieties of self-replicating molecular systems best suited to the latest change
in the environment. Plants evolve that use visible light to break down water into
hydrogen and oxygen, and the hydrogen escapes into space, changing the atmosphere
from a reducing medium to an oxidizing one. Organisms of moderate complexity and
modest intelligence eventually arise.<P>

Throughout this sequence our imaginary observer is struck above all by the
earth's isolation. Sunlight, starlight and cosmic rays, and occasionally some
interplanetary debris, arrive at the earth's surface, but in all those eons
nothing save a little hydrogen and helium leaves the planet. And then, less than
20 years ago, the planet suddenly begins, like a dandelion gone to seed, to fire
tiny capsules throughout the inner solar system. First they go into orbit round
the earth and then to the plant's lifeless natural satellite, the moon. Six tiny
capsules, larger than the rest, set down on the moon and from each two small
organisms emerge, briefly explore their immediate surroundings and then sprint
back to the earth, having tentatively extended a toe into the cosmic ocean. <P>

Five little spacecraft enter the hellhole of Venus' atmosphere and three of them
survive some tens of minutes on the surface before being destroyed by the heat.
More than a dozen spacecraft are dispatched to Mars; one sends back information
for a full year from its orbit around the planet. Another swings by Venus to
encounter Mercury, on a trajectory that will cause it to pass close to the
innermost planet many times. Two more successfully traverse the asteroid belt,
fly close to Jupiter and are ejected by its gravity into interstellar space. It
is clear, the observer might report, that something interesting is happening on
the planet earth.<P>

We have entered, almost without noticing it, an age of exploration and discovery
unparalleled since the Renaissance, when in just 30 years European man moved
across the Western ocean to bring tile entire globe within his ken. Our new ocean
is beyond that globe: it is the shallow disk of space occupied by the solar
system. Our new worlds are the sun, the moon and the planets. In less than 20
years of space exploration we have learned more about those worlds than we have
in all the preceding centuries of earthbound observation. We are beginning to
assemble that information into a new picture of our solar system.<P>

It is useful--and somewhat humbling--to start by placing our small solar
neighborhood in its proper cosmic perspective. The earth is a tiny hunk of rock
and metal that rides in a flood of sunlight through the innermost recess of the
solar system. Other tiny spheres of rock and metal--Mercury, Venus and Mars--move
in orbit around the sun nearby. These inner planets and their satellites do not
bulk very large in the solar system as a whole. Most of the mass, angular
momentum and (from any extraterrestrial astronomer's viewpoint) ostensible
interest of the solar system resides in the Jovian planets: four immense and
rapidly rotating spheres. The inner two, Jupiter and Saturn, consist largely of
hydrogen and helium; indeed, Jupiter is something like a star that failed. The
outer two, Uranus and Neptune, are composed less of the lightest gases and more
of such heavier gases as methane and ammonia. Jupiter takes almost 12 years to
complete its trip around the sun at a mean distance of some five astronomical
units. (An astronomical unit is the mean distance of the earth from the sun,
about 93 million miles or 150 million kilometers.) Beyond the Jovian planets,
Pluto, smaller and less familiar, orbits eccentrically at about 40 astronomical
units. Much farther, at about 100,000 astronomical units, are some billions of
tailless comets, kilometer-size snowballs slowly circling the distant sun. <P>

From somewhat farther away, say a few hundred thousand astronomical units, the
sun would appear to the uninitiated eye as a bright star with no hint of its
retinue of planets. That would be a distance of a few light years (a light year
is about 60,000 astronomical units), or the characteristic separation between
stars in our galaxy. From a few dozen light years away, the sun would be quite
undetectable to the unaided human eye--and a distance of a few dozen light years
is only about a thousandth of the distance from the sun to the center of our
galaxy. The galaxy is a vast, ponderously rotationg pinwheel of some 250 billion
suns, and the dense central plane of the galaxy, seen edge on, is the diffuse
band across the sky that we call the Milky Way. Our galaxy is one of at least
billions, and perhaps hundreds of billions, of galaxies. Our particular sun and
its companion planets constitute no more than one example of a phenomenon that
must surely be repeated innumerable times in the vastness of space and time.<P>

If the 4.6 billion years of earth history were compressed into a single year, the
flurry of space exploration would have begun less than a tenth of a second ago.
The fundamental changes in attitude and knowledge responsible for the remarkable
transformation would have filled only the past few seconds, since the first
widespread applications of simple lenses and mirrors for astronomical purposes in
the 17th century. Before that, the planets had been recognized for millenniums as
being different from the "fixed stars," which appeared not to move with respect
to one another. The planets (the word comes from the Greek for "wanderer") were
brighter than most stars, and they moved against the stellar background. Since
the sun and the moon manifestly influenced the earth, astrological doctrine held
that the planets must affect human life too, but in more subtle ways. Almost none
of the ancients speculated that the planets were worlds in some sense like the
earth. With the first astronomical telescope, however, Galileo was astonished and
delighted to see Venus as a crescent lighted by the sun and to make out the
mountains and craters of the moon. Johannes Kepler thought the craters were the
constructions of intelligent beings inhabiting the moon, but Christiaan Huygens
disagreed. He argued that the construction of such great depressions would
require an unreasonably great effort--and he thought he could see natural
explanations for them. <P>

Huygens exemplified the marriage of advancing technology and experimental skills
with a reasonable, skeptical mind and an openness to new ideas. He was the first
to suggest that on Venus we are looking at an atmosphere and clouds, the first to
understand something of the true nature of the rings of Saturn (which had seemed
to Galileo like two "ears" enveloping the planet), the first to draw a picture of
a recognizable marking on the surface of Mars (Syrtis Major) and the second
(after Robert Hooke) to draw the Great Red Spot of Jupiter. The last two
observations are of current significance because they establish the continuity of
prominent planetary surface features over at least three centuries. (Huygens was,
to be sure, not a thoroughly modern astronomer; he could not entirely escape the
modes of belief of his time. Consider the curious argument by which he deduced
the existence on Jupiter of hemp. Galileo had observed four moons traveling
around Jupiter. Huygens asked a question of a kind few astronomers would ask
today: Why is it that Jupiter has four moons? Well, why does the earth have one
moon? Our moon's function, Huygens reasoned, apart from providing a little light
at night and raising the tides, is to aid mariners in navigation. If Jupiter has
four moons, there must be as many mariners on that planet. Mariners imply boats;
boats imply sails; sails imply ropes. And ropes imply hemp. I sometimes wonder
how many of our own prized scientific arguments will appear equally foolish from
the vantage of three centuries.)<P>

A useful index of our knowledge about a planet is the number of bits of
information necessary to characterize what we know of its surface--in effect, the
number of black and white dots in halftone photographic reproductions summarizing
all existing imagery. Back in Huygens' day, about 10 bits of information, all
obtained by brief glimpses through telescopes, would have characterized man's
knowledge of the surface of Mars. By the time of the close approach of Mars to
the earth in 1877 that number had risen to perhaps a few thousand (if we exclude
a large amount of erroneous information, such as the drawings of "canals" that we
now know were entirely illusory). With further visual observations and the rise
of astronomical photography the amount of information grew slowly until the
advent of space-vehicle exploration of the planet provided a surge of new data.
<P>

Just 22 photographs obtained in 1965 by the <I>Mariner </I>4 flyby mission
represented five million bits of information, roughly comparable to all previous
photographic knowledge of the planet, although they covered only a tiny fraction
of the planet's area. The dual flyby mission of <I>Mariner </I> 6 and <I>Mariner
</I>r 7 in 1969 extended the coverage, increasing the bit total by a factor of
100, and in 1971 and 1972 the <I>Mariner </I> 9 orbiter increased it by another
factor of 100. The <I>Mariner </I>9 photographic results from Mars correspond
roughly to 10,000 times the total previous photographic knowledge of Mars
gathered over the history of mankind. The infrared and ultraviolet spectroscopic
data and other information obtained by <I>Mariner </I>  9 represent a similar
enhancement.<P>

The vast amount of new photographic information involves not only an advance in
coverage, or quantity, but also a spectacular advance in resolution, or quality.
Before the voyage of <I>Mariner </I> 4 the smallest feature reliably detected on
the surface of Mars was several hundred kilometers across. With the completion of
the <I>Mariner </I> 9 mission several percent of the planet's area has been
observed at an effective resolution of 100 meters, an improvement in resolution
by a factor of 1,000 in the past 10 years and by a factor of 10,000 since
Huygens' time. It is only because of this improvement in resolution that we know
of vast volcanoes, laminated polar formations, sinuous channels; great rift
valleys, dune fields, crater-associated dust streaks and many other instructive
and mysterious features of the Martian environment.<P>

Both resolution and coverage are required in order to provide adequate
information about a newly explored planet. For example, by an unlucky coincidence
the <I>Mariner </I> 4, <I>Mariner </I> 6 and <I>Mariner </I> 7 spacecraft
observed the old, cratered and comparatively uninteresting part of Mars and gave
no hint of the young and geologically active third of the planet that was
revealed by <I>Mariner </I> 9. Intelligent life on the earth would be entirely
undetectable by photography in reflected sunlight unless about 100-meter
resolution was achieved, at which point the urban and agricultural geometry of
our technological civilization would become strikingly evident. This means that
if there had been a civilization on Mars comparable in extent and level of
development to our own, it would not have been detected photographically until
the <I>Mariner </I> 9 mission. There is no reason to expect such civilizations on
other planets in our solar system; my point is that we are only now beginning an
adequate reconnaissance of our neighboring worlds. There is no question that
astonishments and delights await us as both resolution and coverage are
dramatically improved in photography, and in spectroscopic and other methods, by
future space-probe missions.<P>

The vigor of the burgeoning planetary sciences and the volume and detail of
recent findings will impress anyone who attends a meeting of the Division for
Planetary Sciences of the American Astronomical Society. At the 1975 meeting in
February there were reports on the discovery of water vapor in the atmosphere of
Jupiter, of ethane on Saturn, of possible hydrocarbons on the asteroid Vesta, of
an atmospheric pressure approaching that of the earth on Saturn's moon Titan and
of radio bursts in the decameter-wavelength range from Saturn. Jupiter's moon
Ganymede had been detected by radar, and the radio-emission spectrum of another
Jovian moon, Callisto, had been elaborated. And spectacular new views of Jupiter
and Mercury and their magnetospheres were presented by the <I>Pioneer</I> 11 and
<I>Mariner </I> 10 experimenters.<P>

Such discoveries are important and exciting in themselves, but it is their
implications and interrelations that are most significant. Every new finding adds
to the accumulation of evidence that is required before we can write an authentic
history of the origin and evolution of the solar system. No complete version of
that history has yet been accepted, but this field of study is now rich in
provocative hints and ingenious surmises. Apart from an understanding of the
solar system as a whole, it is becoming clear that information about any planet
or satellite illuminates our knowledge of the others. In particular, if we are to
understand the earth, we must have a comprehensive knowledge of the other
planets. Let me give a few examples of what might be called comparative
planetology.<P>

There is now observational evidence to support an idea I first proposed in 1960:
that the high temperatures on the surface of Venus are due to a runaway
"greenhouse effect" in which water and carbon dioxide in the planetary atmosphere
impede the emission of thermal radiation from the surface to space. The surface
temperature rises to the point where there is an equilibrium between the visible
sunlight arriving at the surface and the infrared radiation leaving it; this
higher surface temperature results in a higher vapor pressure of the greenhouse
gases, carbon dioxide and water, and the process continues until all the carbon
dioxide and water is in the vapor phase, producing a planet with a high
atmospheric pressure and a high surface temperature. The reason Venus has such an
atmosphere and the earth does not seems to be that Venus receives a little more
sunlight than the earth. If the sun were to become brighter or the earth's
surface and clouds were to become darker, could the earth become a replica of
this classical vision of hell? Venus may be a cautionary tale for our technical
civilization, which has the capability to profoundly alter the environment of our
small planet.<P>

In spite of the expectations of almost ill planetary scientists, Mars turns out
to be covered with thousands of sinuous, tributaried channels that are probably
one or two billion years old. Whether they were formed by running water or by
running carbon dioxide, such channels could not be carved under present
atmospheric conditions; they require much higher pressures and probably higher
polar temperatures. And so the channels bear witness to at least one epoch and
perhaps many previous epochs of milder conditions on Mars, implying that there
have been major climatic variations over the history of the planet. We do not
know whether such variations are the result of internal causes or of external
ones. If the causes are native to Mars, it becomes important to learn whether the
earth might, perhaps even as a result of the activities of man, be subject to
climatic excursions of Martian magnitude. If the Martian climatic variations were
the result of external causes (perhaps variations in the luminosity of the sun),
then a correlation of Martian paleoclimatology and terrestrial paleoclimatology
would be extremely interesting.<P>

<I>Mariner </I> 9 arrived at Mars in the midst of a great global dust storm, and
its data make it possible to determine whether such storms heat a planetary
surface or cool it. Any theory with pretensions to predicting the climatic
consequences of an increase in the abundance of finely divided particles in the
earth's atmosphere had better be able to provide the correct answer for that dust
storm on Mars. In fact, drawing on our<I>Mariner </I> 9 experience, James B.
Pollack of the Ames Research Center of the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration and Owen B. Toon and I at Cornell University have calculated the
effects of single and multiple volcanic explosions on the earth's climate and
have been able to reproduce, within the limits of experimental error, the
climatic effects that were observed after actual volcanic explosions. The
perspective of planetary astronomy, which alone enables us to view a planet as a
whole, seems to be good training for studies of the earth. As another example of
the contribution made by planetary studies to terrestrial problems, one of the
main groups investigating the effect on the earth's ozone layer of the injection
into the atmosphere of fluorocarbon propellants from aerosol cans is one headed
by Michael B. McElroy of Harvard University-a group that cut its teeth on the
physics and chemistry of the atmosphere of Venus.<P>

We now know from space-vehicle observations something of the density of impact
craters of different sizes on Mercury, the moon, Mars and its satellites, and
radar studies are beginning to provide such information for Venus. Although the
surface of the earth has been heavily altered by wind and water and by crustal
folding and faulting, we also have some information about craters on the surface
of the earth. If the population of objects that produced such impacts were the
same for all these planets, it might be possible to work out both the absolute
and the relative chronology of various cratered surfaces. The trouble is that we
do not yet know whether the impacting objects are from a common source (for
example the asteroid belt) or are of local origin (for example rings of debris
swept up in the final stages of planetary accretion).<P>

The heavily cratered lunar highlands speak to us of an early epoch in the history
of the solar system, when the frequency of cratering was much higher than it is
today; the present population of interplanetary debris fails by a large factor to
account for the density of the highland craters. On the other hand, the lunar
maria, or "seas," show a much lower crater density, which can be explained quite
well by the present population of interplanetary debris: mostly asteroids and
possibly dead comets. For planetary surfaces that are not so heavily cratered it
is possible to determine something of the absolute age, a great deal about the
relative age and in certain cases even something about the distribution of sizes
in the population of objects that made the craters. On Mars, for example, we find
that the flanks of the large volcanic mountains are almost free of impact
craters, implying their comparative youth: they have not been around long enough
to have accumulated much in the way of impact scars. That is the basis for the
hypothesis of comparatively recent Martian volcanism.<P>

The ultimate objective of comparative planetology, it might be said, is something
like a vast computer program into which we insert a few input parameters perhaps
the initial mass, composition and angular momentum of a protoplanet and the
population of neighboring objects that strike it) and then derive the complete
evolution of the planet. We are far from having such a deep understanding of
planetary evolution at present, cut we are much closer than would have been
thought possible only a few decades ago.<P>

In addition every new set of discoveries raises a host of questions we were not
until now even able to ask. I shall mention just a few of them.<P>

The initial radar glimpse of the craters of Venus shows them as being extremely
shallow. There is no liquid water to erode Venus' surface, and the lower
atmosphere seems to move so slowly that its winds may not be strong enough to
fill the craters with dust. Could the craters of Venus be filled by the slow
collapse of very slightly molten walls, flowing like pitch?<P>

The most popular explanation for the generation of planetary magnetic fields
invokes rotation-driven convection currents in an electrically conducting
planetary core. Mercury, which rotates only once every 59 days, was expected to
have no detectable magnetic field, but Mariner 10 discovered one. Apparently a
serious reappraisal of theories of planetary magnetism is in order.<P>

Only Saturn has rings. Why?<P>

There is an exquisite array of longitudinal sand dunes on Mars, nestling against
the interior ramparts of the large eroded crater Procter. In Colorado, in the
Great Sand Dunes National Monument, similar sand dunes nestle in a curve of the
Sangre de Cristo Mountains. The Martian dunes and the terrestrial ones have the
same total extent, the same dune-to-dune spacing and the same dune heights. Yet
the Martian atmospheric pressure is only a two-hundredth of the pressure on the
earth, so that the winds needed to push the sand grains around must be 10 times
stronger than those on the earth; moreover, the distribution of particle sizes
may be quite different on the two planets. How then can the dune fields produced
by windblown sand be so similar?<P>

Observations made from <I>Mariner </I> 9 imply that the winds on Mars at least
occasionally exceed half the local speed of sound. Are the winds ever much
stronger? And if they are, what is the nature of a transonic meteorology?<P>

There are pyramids on Mars that are about three kilometers across at the base and
one kilometer high. They are not likely to have been constructed by Martian
pharaohs. The rate of sandblasting by wind-transported grains on Mars is perhaps
10,000 times greater than the rate on the earth because of the greater speeds
necessary to move particles in the thinner Martian atmosphere. Could the Facets
of the Martian pyramids have been eroded by millions of years of such
sandblasting from more than one prevailing wind direction?<P>

The moons of the outer solar system are almost certainly not replicas of our own
rather dull satellite. Many of them have such a low density that they must
consist largely of ices of methane, ammonia or water. What will their surfaces be
like close up? How do impact craters erode on an icy surface? Might there be
volcanoes of solid ammonia with lavas of liquid ammonia trickling down their
sides? Why is Io, the innermost large satellite of Jupiter, enveloped in a cloud
of gaseous sodium? Why is one side of Saturn's moon Iapetus six times brighter
than the other? Is it because of a particle-size difference? A chemical
difference? How did such differences become established, and why did they become
established on Iapetus and nowhere else in the solar system in such a symmetrical
way? The gravity of Saturn's largest moon, Titan, is low enough and the
temperature of the upper atmosphere is high enough for the hydrogen in the
atmosphere to escape rapidly into space. Yet the spectroscopic evidence suggests
that a substantial quantity of hydrogen remains on Titan. Why?<P>

Beyond Saturn the solar system is still almost literally clouded in ignorance.
Our feeble telescopes have not even reliably determined the periods of rotation
of Uranus, Neptune and Pluto, much less the character of their clouds and
atmospheres and the nature of their satellite systems.<P>

One of the most tantalizing issues, and one that we are just beginning to
approach seriously, is the question of organic chemistry and biology elsewhere in
the solar system. The issue of whether there are organisms both large and small,
on Mars in particular, is entirely open. The Martian environment is by no means
so hostile as to exclude life, but we do not know enough about the origin and
evolution of life to guarantee its presence there-or anywhere else. The three
microbiology experiments, the organic chemistry experiment and the camera systems
aboard the two Viking vehicles scheduled to land on Mars next summer may provide
the first experimental evidence on the matter. The hydrogen-rich atmospheres of
places such as Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Titan are in significant respects
similar to the atmosphere of the earth at the time of the origin of life. From
laboratory simulation experiments we know that organic molecules are synthesized
in high yield under those conditions. (In the atmospheres of Jupiter and Saturn
such molecules would be carried by convection to depths where they would be
decomposed by heat, but even there the steady-state concentration of organic
molecules may be significant.) In all simulation experiments the application of
energy to such atmospheres produces a brownish polymeric material that in many
respects resembles the brownish coloring matter in the clouds of Jupiter and
Saturn. Titan may be completely covered with a brownish organic material. It is
possible that the next few years will see major and unexpected discoveries in the
infant science of exobiology.<P>

The principal means for the continued exploration of the solar system over the
next decade or two will surely be unmanned planetary missions. Scientific space
vehicles have now been launched successfully to all the planets known to the
ancients. If even a small fraction of the missions that are scheduled and have
been proposed are implemented, it is clear that the present golden age of
planetary exploration will continue.<P>

Yet even a preliminary reconnaissance of the entire solar system out to Pluto and
the more detailed exploration of a few planets (by, for example, vehicles that
will traverse the surface of Mars or penetrate the atmosphere of Jupiter) will
not solve the fundamental problem of solar-system origins. What we need is to
discover other solar systems, perhaps at various stages in their evolution.
Advances in ground-based and spaceborne instruments over the next two decades may
make it possible to detect dozens of planetary systems around nearby single
stars. Recent observational studies of multiple-star systems by Helmut Abt and
Saul Levy of the Kitt Peak National Observatory suggest that as many as a third
of all stars have planetary companions. We do not know whether such systems will
be like ours or will be built on very different principles. Richard Isaacman of
Cornell and I have calculated a range of possible planetary systems based on a
theoretical model originally devised by Stephen H. Dole of the Rand Corporation.
The assumptions behind these models are so simple as to make us believe they are
unrealistic, and yet the range of systems to which they give rise is intriguing
The time may not be far off when we shall have observational information on the
distribution in space of various types of planetary systems. We may then be able
to echo Huygens: "What a wonderful and amazing Scheme we have here of the
magnificent Vastness of the Universe! So many Suns, so many Earths"<P>

Centuries hence, when current social and political problems may seem as remote as
the problems of the Thirty Years' War are to us, our age may be remembered
chiefly for one fact: It was the time when the inhabitants of the earth first
made contact with the vast cosmos in which their small planet is embedded.<P>

Is mankind alone in the universe? Or are there somewhere other intelligent
beings looking up into their night sky from very different worlds and asking the
same kind of question? Are there civilizations more advanced than ours,
civilizations that have achieved interstellar communication and have established
a network of linked societies throughout our galaxy? Such questions, bearing on
the deepest problems of the nature and destiny of mankind, were long the
exclusive province of theology and speculative fiction. Today for the first time
in human history they have entered into the realm of experimental science.<P>

From the movements of a number of nearby stars we have now detected unseen
companion bodies in orbit around them that are about as massive as large planets.
From our knowledge of the processes by which life arose here on the earth we know
that similar processes must be fairly common throughout the universe. Since
intelligence and technology have a high survival value it seems likely that
primitive life forms on the planets of other stars, evolving over many billions
of years, would occasionally develop intelligence, civilization and a high
technology. Moreover, we on the earth now possess all the technology necessary
for communicating with other civilizations in the depths of space. Indeed, we may
now be standing on a threshold about to take the momentous step a planetary
society takes but once: first contact with another civilization..<P>

In our present ignorance of how common extraterrestrial life may actually be, any
attempt to estimate the number of technical civilizations in our galaxy is
necessarily unreliable. We do, however, have some relevant facts. There is reason
to believe that solar systems are formed fairly easily and that they are abundant
in the vicinity of the sun. In our own solar system, for example, there are three
miniature "solar systems": the satellite systems of the planets Jupiter (with 13
moons), Saturn (with 10) and Uranus (with five). [EDITORS' NOTE: the number of
known satellites has increased greatly since the time that this article was
written.] It is plain that however such systems are made, four of them formed in
our immediate neighborhood.<P>

The only technique we have at present for detecting the planetary systems of
nearby stars is the study of the gravitational perturbations such planets induce
in the motion of their parent star. Imagine a nearby star that over a period of
decades moves measurably with respect to the background of more distant stars.
Suppose it has a nonluminous companion that circles it in an orbit whose plane
does not coincide with our line of sight to the star. Both the star and the
companion revolve around a common center of mass. The center of mass will trace a
straight line against the stellar background and thus the luminous star will
trace a sinusoidal path. From the existence of the oscillation we can deduce the
existence of the companion. Furthermore, from the period and amplitude of the
oscillation we can calculate the period and mass of the companion. The technique
is only sensitive enough, however, to detect the perturbations of a massive
planet around the nearest stars.<P>

The single star closest to the sun is Barnard's star, a rather dim red dwarf
about six light-years away. (Although Alpha Centauri is closer, it is a member of
a triple-star system.) Observations made by Peter van de Kamp of the Sproul
Observatory at Swarthmore College over a period of 40 years suggest that
Barnard's star is accompanied by at least two dark companions, each with about
the mass of Jupiter.<P>

There is still some controversy over his conclusion, however, because the
observations are very difficult to make. Perhaps even more interesting is the
fact that of the dozen or so single stars nearest the sun nearly half appear to
have dark companions with a mass between one and 10 times the mass of Jupiter. In
addition many theoretical studies of the formation of planetary systems out of
contracting clouds of interstellar gas and dust imply that the birth of planets
frequently if not inevitably accompanies the birth of stars.<P>

We know that the master molecules of living organisms on the earth are the
proteins and the nucleic acids. The proteins are built up of amino acids and the
nucleic acids are built up of nucleotides. The earth's primordial atmosphere was,
like the rest of the universe, rich in hydrogen and in hydrogen compounds. When
molecular hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>), methane (CH<sub>4</sub>), ammonia
(NH<sub>3</sub>) and water (H<sub>2</sub>0) are mixed together in the presence of
virtually any intermittent source of energy capable of breaking chemical bonds,
the result is a remarkably high yield of amino acids and the sugars and
nitrogenous bases that are the chemical constituents of the nucleotides. For
example, from laboratory experiments we can determine the amount of amino acids
produced per photon of ultraviolet radiation, and from our knowledge of stellar
evolution we can calculate the amount of ultraviolet radiation emitted by the sun
over the first billion years of the existence of the earth. Those two rates
enable us to compute the total amount of amino acids that were formed on the
primitive earth. Amino acids also break down spontaneously at a rate that is
dependent on the ambient temperature. Hence we can calculate their steady-state
abundance at the time of the origin of life. If amino acids in that abundance
were mixed into the oceans of today, the result would be a 1 percent solution of
amino acids. That is approximately the concentration of amino acids in the better
brands of canned chicken bouillon, a solution that is alleged to be capable of
sustaining life.<P>

The origin of life is not the same as the origin of its constituent building
blocks, but laboratory studies on the linking of amino acids into molecules
resembling proteins and on the linking of nucleotides into molecules resembling
nucleic acids are progressing well. Investigations of how short chains of nucleic
acids replicate themselves in vitro have even provided clues to primitive genetic
codes for translating nucleic acid information into protein information, systems
that could have preceded the elaborate machinery of ribosomes and activating
enzymes with which cells now manufacture protein.<P>

The laboratory experiments also yield a large amount of a brownish polymer that
seems to consist mainly of long hydrocarbon chains. The spectroscopic properties
of the polymer are similar to those of the reddish clouds on Jupiter, Saturn and
Titan, the largest satellite of Saturn. Since the atmospheres of these objects
are rich in hydrogen and are similar to the atmosphere of the primitive earth,
the coincidence is not surprising. It is nonetheless remarkable. Jupiter, Saturn
and Titan may be vast planetary laboratories engaged in prebiological organic
chemistry.<P>

Other evidence on the origin of life comes from the geological record of the
earth. Thin sections of sedimentary rocks between 2.7 and 3.5 billion years old
reveal the presence of small inclusions a hundredth of a millimeter in diameter.
These inclusions have been identified by Elso S. Barghoorn of Harvard University
and J. William Schopf of the University of California at Los Angeles as bacteria
and blue-green algae. Bacteria and blue-green algae are evolved organisms and
must themselves be the beneficiaries of a long evolutionary history. There are no
rocks on the earth or on the moon, however, that are more than four billion years
old; before that time the surface of both bodies is believed to have melted in
the final stages of their accretion.. Thus the time available for the origin of
life seems to have been short: a few hundred million years at the most. Since
life originated on the earth in a span much shorter than the present age of the
earth, we have additional evidence that the origin of life has a high
probability, at least on planets with an abundant supply of hydrogen-rich gases,
liquid water and sources of energy. Since those conditions are common throughout
the universe, life may also be common.<P>

Until we have discovered at least one example of extraterrestrial life, however,
that conclusion cannot be considered secure. Such an investigation is one of the
objectives of the Viking mission, which is scheduled to land a vehicle on the
surface of Mars in the summer of 1976, a vehicle that will conduct the first
rigorous search for life on another planet. The Viking lander carries three
separate experiments on the metabolism of hypothetical Martian microorganisms,
one experiment on the organic chemistry of the Martian surface material and a
camera system that might just conceivably detect macroscopic organisms if they
exist.<P>

Intelligence and technology have developed on the earth about halfway through the
stable period in the lifetime of the sun. There are obvious selective advantages
to intelligence and technology, at least up to the present evolutionary stage
when technology also brings the threats of ecological catastrophes, the
exhaustion of natural resources and nuclear war. Barring such disasters, the
physical environment of the earth will remain stable for many more billions of
years. It is possible that the number of individual steps required for the
evolution of intelligence and technology is so large and improbable that not all
inhabited planets evolve technical civilizations It is also possible-some would
say likely-that civilizations tend to destroy themselves at about our level of
technological development. On the other hand, if there are 100 billion suitable
planets in our galaxy, if the origin of life is highly probable, if there are
billions of years of evolution available on each such planet and if even a small
fraction of technical civilizations pass safely through the early stages of
technological adolescence, the number of technological civilizations in the
galaxy today might be very large.<P>

It is obviously a highly uncertain exercise to attempt to estimate the number of
such civilizations. The opinions of those who have considered the problem differ
significantly. Our best guess is that there are a million civilizations in our
galaxy at or beyond the earth's present level of technological development. If
they are distributed randomly through space, the distance between us and the
nearest civilization should be about 300 light-years. Hence any information
conveyed between the nearest civilization and our own will take a minimum of 300
years for a one-way trip and 600 years for a question and a response.<P>

Electromagnetic radiation is the fastest and also by far the cheapest method of
establishing such contact. In terms of the foreseeable technological developments
on the earth, the cost per photon and the amount of absorption of radiation by
interstellar gas and dust, radio waves seem to be the most efficient and
economical method of interstellar communication. Interstellar space vehicles
cannot be excluded a priori, but in all cases they would be a slower, more
expensive and more difficult means of communication.<P>

Since we have achieved the capability for interstellar radio communication only
in the past few decades, there is virtually no chance that any civilization we
come in contact with will be as backward as we are. There also seems to be no
possibility of dialogue except between very long-lived and patient civilizations.
In view of these circumstances, which should be common to and deducible by all
the civilizations in our galaxy, it seems to us quite possible that one-way radio
messages are being beamed at the earth at this moment by radio transmitters on
planets in orbit around other stars.<P>

To intercept such signals we must guess or deduce the frequency at which the
signal is being sent, the width of the frequency band, the type of modulation and
the star transmitting the message. Although the correct guesses are not easy to
make, they are not as hard as they might seem.<P>

Most of the astronomical radio spectrum is quite noisy. There are contributions
from interstellar matter, from the three-degree-Kelvin background radiation left
over from the early history of the universe, from noise that is fundamentally
associated with the operation of any detector and from the absorption of
radiation by the earth's atmosphere. This last source of noise can be avoided by
placing a radio telescope in space. The other sources we must live with and so
must any other civilization..<P>

There is, however, a pronounced minimum in the radio-noise spectrum. Lying at the
minimum or near it are several natural frequencies that should be discernible by
all scientifically advanced societies. They are the resonant frequencies emitted
by the more abundant molecules and free radicals m interstellar space. Perhaps
the most obvious of these resonances is the frequency of 1,420 megahertz
(millions of cycles per second). That frequency is emitted when the spinning
electron in an atom of hydrogen spontaneously flips over so that its direction of
spin is opposite to that of the proton comprising the nucleus of the hydrogen
atom. The frequency of the spin-flip transition of hydrogen at 1,420 megahertz
was first suggested as a channel for interstellar communication in 1959 by Philip
Morrison and Giuseppe Cocconi. Such a channel may be too noisy for communication
precisely because hydrogen, the most abundant interstellar gas, absorbs and emits
radiation at that frequency. The number of other plausible and available
communication channels is not large, so that determining the right one should not
be too difficult.<P>

We cannot use a similar logic to guess the bandwidth that might be used in
interstellar communication. The narrower the bandwidth is, the farther a signal
can be transmitted before it becomes too weak for detection.. On the other hand,
the narrower the bandwidth is, the less information the signal can carry. A
compromise is therefore required between the desire to send a signal the maximum
distance and the desire to communicate the maximum amount of information. Perhaps
simple signals with narrow bandwidths are sent to enhance the probability of the
signals' being received. Perhaps information-rich signals with broad bandwidths
are sent in order to achieve rapid and extensive communication. The
broad-bandwidth signals would be intended for those enlightened civilizations
that have in vested major resources in large receiving systems.<P>

When we actually search for signals it is not necessary to guess the exact
bandwidth, only to guess the minimum bandwidth. It is possible to communicate on
many adjacent narrow bands al once. Each such channel can be studies
individually, and the data from several adjacent channels can be combined to
yield the equivalent of a wider channel without any loss of information or
sensitivity. The procedure is relatively easy with the aid of a computer; it is
in fact routinely employed in studies of pulsars. In any event we should observe
the maximum number of channels because of the possibility that the transmitting
civilization is not broadcasting on one of the "natural" frequencies such as
1,420 megahertz.<P>

We do not, of course, know now which star we should listen to. The most
conservative approach is to turn our receivers to stars that are rather similar
to the sun, beginning with the nearest. Two nearby stars, Epsilon Eridani and Tau
Ceti, both about 12 light-years away, were the candidates for Project Ozma, the
first search with a radio telescope for extraterrestrial intelligence, conducted
by one of us (Drake) in 1960. Project Ozma, named after the ruler of Oz in L.
Frank Baum's children's stories, was "on the air" for four weeks at 1,420
megahertz. The results were negative. Since then there have been a number of
other studies. In spite of some false alarms to the contrary, none has seen
successful. The lack of success is lot unexpected. If there are a million
technical civilizations m a galaxy of some 200 billion stars, we must turn our
receivers to 200,000 stars before we have a fair statistical chance of detecting
a single extraterrestrial message. So or we have listened to only a few more than
200 stars. In other words, we have mounted only .1 percent of the required
effort.<P>

Our present technology is entirely adequate for both transmitting and receiving
messages across immense interstellar distances. For example, if the ,000-foot
radio telescope at the Arecibo observatory in Puerto Rico were to transmit
information at the rate of one it (binary digit) per second with a bandwidth of
one hertz, the signal could be received by an identical radio telescope anywhere
in the galaxy. By the same token, the Arecibo telescope could detect a similar
signal transmitted from a distance hundreds of times greater than our estimate of
300 light-years to the nearest extraterrestrial civilization..<P>

A search of hundreds of thousands of stars in the hope of detecting one message
would require remarkable dedication and would probably take several decades. It
seems unlikely that any existing major radio telescope would be given over to
such an intensive program to the exclusion of its usual work. The construction of
one radio telescope or more that would be devoted perhaps half-time to the search
seems to be the only practical method of seeking out extraterrestrial
intelligence in a serious way. The cost would be some tens of millions of
dollars.<P>

So far we have been discussing the reception of messages that a civilization
would intentionally transmit to the earth. An alternative possibility is that we
might try to "eavesdrop" on the radio traffic an extraterrestrial civilization
employs for its own purposes. Such radio traffic could be readily apparent On the
earth, for example, a new radar system employed with the telescope at the Arecibo
Observatory for planetary studies emits a narrow-bandwidth signal that, if it
were detected from another star, would be between a million and 10 billion times
brighter than the sun at the same frequency. In addition, because of radio and
television transmission, the earth is extremely bright at wavelengths of about a
meter. If the planets of other civilizations have a radio brightness comparable
to the earth's from television transmission alone, they should be detectable.
Because of the complexity of the signals and the fact that they are not beamed
specifically at the earth, however, the receiver we would need in order to
eavesdrop would have to be much more elaborate and sensitive than any
radio-telescope system we now possess.<P>

One such system has been devised in a preliminary way by Bernard M. Oliver of the
Hewlett-Packard Company, who directed a study sponsored by the Ames Research
Center of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.. The system, known
as Cyclops, would consist of an enormous radio telescope connected to a complex
computer system. The computer system would be designed particularly to search
through the data from the telescope for signals bearing the mark of intelligence,
to combine numerous adjacent channels in order to construct signals of various
effective bandwidths and to present the results of the automatic analyses for all
conceivable forms of interstellar radio communication in a way that would be
intelligible to the project scientists.<P>

To construct a radio telescope of enormous aperture as a single antenna would be
prohibitively expensive. The Cyclops system would instead capitalize on our
ability to connect many individual antennas to act in unison. This concept is
already the basis of the Very Large Array now under construction in New Mexico.
The Very Large Array consists of 27 antennas, each 82 feet in diameter, arranged
in a Y-shaped pattern whose three arms are each 10 miles long. The Cyclops system
would be much larger. Its current design calls for 1,500 antennas each 100 meters
in diameter, all electronically connected to one another and to the computer
system. The array would be as compact as possible but would cover perhaps 25
square miles.<P>

The effective signal-collecting area of the system would be hundreds of times the
area of any existing radio telescope, and it would be capable of detecting even
relatively weak signals such as television transmissions from civilizations
several hundred light-years away. Moreover, it would be the instrument par
excellence for receiving signals specifically directed at the earth. One of the
greatest virtues of the Cyclops system is that no technological advances would be
required m order to build it. The necessary electronic and computer techniques re
already well developed. We would need only to build a vast number of items we
already build well. The Cyclops system not only would have enormous power for
searching for extraterrestrial intelligence but also would be In extraordinary
tool for radar studies If the bodies in the solar system, for traditional radio
astronomy outside the solar system and for the tracking of pace vehicles to
distances beyond the each of present receivers.<P>

The estimated cost of the Cyclops system, ranging up to $10 billion, may make it
prohibitively expensive for the time being. Moreover, the argument in favor of
eavesdropping is not completely persuasive. Half a century ago, before radio
transmissions were commonplace, the earth was quiet at radio wavelengths. Half a
century from now, because of the development of cable television and
communication satellites that relay signals in a narrow beam, the earth lay again
be quiet. Thus perhaps for only a century out of billions of years do planets
such as the earth appear remarkably bright at radio wavelengths. The odds of our
discovering a civilization during that short period in its history lay not be
good enough to justify the construction of a system such as Cyclops. It may well
be that throughout the universe beings usually detect evidence of
extraterrestrial intelligence with more traditional radio telescopes. It
nonetheless seems clear that our own dances of finding extraterrestrial
intelligence will improve if we consciously attempt to find it.<P>

How could we be sure that a particular radio signal was deliberately sent by an
intelligent being? It is easy to design a message that is unambiguously
artificial. The first 30 prime numbers, for example, would be difficult to
ascribe to some natural astrophysical phenomenon. A simple message of this kind
might be a beacon or announcement signal. A subsequent informative message could
have many forms and could consist of an enormous number of bits. One method of
transmitting information, beginning simply and progressing to more elaborate
concepts, is pictures.<P>

One final approach in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence deserves
mention. If there are indeed civilizations thousands or millions of years more
advanced than ours, it is entirely possible that they could beam radio
communications over immense distances, perhaps even over the distances of
intergalactic space. We do not know how many advanced civilizations there might
be compared with the number of more primitive earthlike civilizations, but many
of these older civilizations are bound to be in galaxies older than our own. For
this reason the most readily detectable radio signals from another civilization
may come from outside our galaxy. The relatively small number of such
extragalactic transmitters might be more than compensated for by the greater
strength of their signals. At the appropriate frequency they could even be the
brightest radio signals in the sky. Therefore an alternative to examining the
nearest stars of the same spectral type as the sun is to examine the nearest
galaxies. Spiral galaxies such as the Great Nebula in Andromeda are obvious
candidates, but the elliptical galaxies are much older and more highly evolved
and could conceivably harbor a large number of extremely advanced
civilizations.<P>

There might be a kind of biological law decreeing that there are many paths to
intelligence and high technology, and that every inhabited planet, if it is given
enough time and it does not destroy itself, will arrive at a similar result. The
biology on other planets is of course expected to be different from our own
because of the statistical nature of the evolutionary process and the
adaptability of life. The science and engineering, however, may be quite similar
to ours, because any civilization engaged in interstellar radio communication, no
matter where it exists, must contend with the same laws of physics, astronomy and
radio technology that we do.<P>

Should we be sending messages ourselves? It is obvious that we do not yet know
where we might best direct them. One message has already been transmitted to the
Great Cluster in Hercules by the Arecibo radio telescope, but only as a kind of
symbol of the capabilities of our existing radio technology. Any radio signal we
send would be detectable over interstellar distances if it is more than about 1
percent as bright as the sun at the same frequency. Actually something close to
1,000 such signals from our everyday internal communications have left the earth
every second for the past two decades. This electromagnetic frontier of mankind
is now some 20 light-years away, and it is moving outward at the speed of light.
Its spherical wave front, expanding like a ripple from a disturbance in a pool of
water and inadvertently carrying the news that human beings have achieved the
capacity for interstellar discourse, envelops about 20 new stars each year.<P>

We have also sent another kind of message: two engraved plaques that ride aboard
Pioneer 10 and Pioneer 11. These spacecraft, the first artifacts of mankind that
will escape from the solar system, will voyage forever through our galaxy at a
speed of some 10 miles per second. Pioneer 10 was accelerated to the velocity of
escape from the solar system by the gravitational field of Jupiter on December 3,
1973. Pioneer 11 swung past Jupiter on December 4, 1974, and will travel on to
Saturn before it is accelerated on a course to the far side of the galaxy.<P>

Identical plaques for each vehicle were designed by us and Linda Salzman Sagan.
Each plaque measures six by nine inches and is made of gold-anodized aluminum.
These engraved cosmic greeting cards bear the location of the earth and the time
the spacecraft was built and launched. The sun is located with respect to 14
pulsars. The precise periods of the pulsars are specified in binary code to allow
them to be identified. Since pulsars are cosmic clocks that are running down at a
largely constant rate, the difference in the pulsar periods at the time one of
the spacecraft is recovered and the periods indicated on the plaque will enable
any technically sophisticated civilization to deduce the year the vehicle was
sent on its epic journey. Units of time and distance are specified in terms of
the frequency of the hydrogen spin-flip at 1,420 megahertz. <P>

In order to identify thethe exact location of the spacecraft's launch a diagram
of the solar system is given The trajectory of the spacecraft is shown as it
leaves the third planet, the earth, and swings by the fifth planet, Jupiter. (The
diversion of Pioneer 11 past Saturn had not been planned when the plaques were
prepared.) Last, the plaques show images of a man and a woman of the earth in
1973. An attempt vas made to give the images panracial characteristics. Their
heights are shown with respect to the spacecraft and are also given by a binary
number stated in terms of the wavelength of the spectral line at 1,420 megahertz
(21 centimeters).<P>

These plaques are destined to be the longest-lived works of mankind. They will
survive virtually unchanged for hundreds of millions, perhaps billions, of years
in space. When plate tectonics has completely rearranged the continents, when all
the present landforms on the earth have been ground down, when civilization has
been profoundly transformed and when human beings may have evolved into some
other kind of organism, these plaques will still exist. They will show that in
the year we called 1913 there were organisms, portrayed on the plaques, that
cared enough about their place in the hierarchy of all intelligent beings to
share knowledge about themselves with others.<P>

How much do we care? Enough to devote an appreciable effort with existing
telescopes to search for life elsewhere in the universe? Enough to take a major
step such as Project Cyclops that offers a greater chance of carrying us across
the threshold, to finally communicate with a variety of extraterrestrial beings
who, if they exist, would inevitably enrich mankind beyond imagination? The real
question is not how, because we know how; the question is when. If enough of the
beings of the earth cared, the threshold might be crossed within the lifetime of
most of those alive today.<P>

CARL SAGAN and FRANK DRAKE are professors of astronomy at Cornell University,

director of the National Astronomy and Ionospheric Center. "In returning from the
International Astronomical Union meetings in Sydney in 1973," they write, "we
spent some days skin-diving in Bora Bora in Tahiti, where our <I>Scientific
American</I> article was first devised. Since Polynesia had been settled by
voyagers crossing thousands of kilometers of ocean, we thought a two-kilometer
journey by outrigger canoe would be a modest homage to those intrepid explorers,
particularly since we were assured that such canoes are unsinkable. We discovered
that this is true; when they are swamped, they only sink as far as the shoulders
of the passenger, and the outrigger affords some discouragement to those sharks
that are to starboard. The experience confirmed our belief that radio
communication is easier than direct contact."

<BR CLEAR=ALL><FONT SIZE="2"><B>ONSI fuel cell.</B>  Seventy-four of these units, each
the size of a minivan, are now in operation, often in locations
such as hospitals and remote hotels where grid power is
expensive and reliability is worth a premium.</FONT><P></CENTER>

Phosphoric-acid fuel cells (PAFC) are the most mature fuel cell
technology and are commercially available now. Sizes range from
200 kW to 11 MW. This type of fuel cell has been operating successfully
in Japan for several years. Current phosphoric-acid fuel cell
design has an electrical conversion efficiency of 41 percent.
Major improvements await in the areas of capital cost reduction,
stack life extension, and O&amp;M cost reduction.<P>

Phosphoric-acid fuel cells use liquid phosphoric-acid
as an electrolyte. At the anode, hydrogen gas is
ionized to produce hydrogen ions and electrons. The electrons
travel from anode to cathode through an external circuit. Hydrogen
ions travel to the cathode through the electrolyte. At the cathode,
oxygen reacts with the hydrogen ions and the electrons to form
water.<P>

The ONSI 200-kW PAFC plant is contained in three preassembled
modules. The complete operational system requires an area of less
than 84 m<sup>2</sup>; (900 ft<sup>2</sup>). <P>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>MOLTEN CARBONATE FUEL CELLS</H2>

<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="IMG/122396explorationsbox2.gif" WIDTH="346" HEIGHT="174"
BORDER="1">

<BR CLEAR=ALL><FONT SIZE="2"><B>Santa Clara Demonstration.</B> 
Energy Research Corporation of Danbury, Conn., built this two-megawatt
pilot molten carbonate plant for the municipality of Santa Clara, Calif. It is the highest-powered fuel cell
unit in the U.S.</FONT><P></CENTER>

Molten-carbonate fuel cells
are a type of direct fuel cell that eliminate external fuel processors.
Methane (the main ingredient of natural gas) and steam are converted
into a hydrogen-rich gas in the reforming anode or in a reforming
chamber, which are part of the fuel cell stack. The fuel cell
stack comprises two porous electrodes in contact with a molten
salt of lithium-potassium carbonate (LiKCO<sub>3</sub>). It operates at
approximately
650&#176;C. <P>

At the cathode, oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) and carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) are
converted
into carbonate ions. The electrolyte allows carbonate ions to
migrate to the anode. At the anode, hydrogen reacts with carbonate
ions to form water and CO<sub>2</sub>, and two electrons are released. Connecting
the two electrodes through an external circuit completes the flow
of electrons to generate DC electricity. Molten-carbonate fuel cell plants can achieve an electric efficiency
of 50 percent, which is considerably higher than that of a phosphoric-acid fuel
cell plant. <P>

<BR CLEAR=ALL><FONT SIZE="2"><B>Zircronia ceramic tubes</B> are the key to Westinghouse Electric's design for a solid oxide fuel cell. Each tube (right) is made up of multiple ceramic layers bonded together.
Multiple tubes can be linked (left) to form power modules that can be combined to build small generators or larger power
plants.</FONT></CENTER><P>

Solid Oxide Electrolyte Fuel Cells utilize a solid oxide, usually
doped zirconia, as the electrolyte. It operates at atmospheric
or elevated pressures at a temperature of approximately 1000&#176;C.
At this temperature, the electrolyte material becomes sufficiently
conductive to oxide ions. The temperature of exhaust gases from
the cells is 500&#176;C to 850&#176;C - a temperature which is
attractive for cogeneration applications or for use in bottoming
cycles for all-electric power plants. <P>

The SOFC conducts oxygen ions (O<sub>2</sub>) from an air electrode
(cathode), where they are formed, through a solid electrolyte
to a fuel electrode (anode). There, they react with carbon monoxide
(CO) and hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) contained in the fuel gas to deliver electrons
and produce electricity. Reformation of natural gas or other fuels
containing hydrocarbons can be accomplished within the generator,
thus eliminating the need for an external reformer. Individual
cells are bundled into an array of series-parallel electrically
connected cells forming a semi-rigid structure that comprises
the basic generator building block.<P>

There are several features of SOFC technology that make it
very attractive for utility and industrial applications. One is
high tolerance to fuel contaminants. The high temperature of the
reaction does not require expensive catalysts and permits direct
fuel processing in the fuel cells. The solid oxide electrolyte
is very stable. Because no liquid phases are present in the electrolyte,
many of the problems associated with electrode flooding, electrolyte
migration, and catalyst wetting are avoided. Cell components of
the solid oxide electrolyte fuel cell can be fabricated into a
variety of self-supporting shapes and configurations that may
not be feasible with fuel cells employing liquid electrolytes.<P>

Analyses and operations of experimental units have shown that
an SOFC plant can achieve an electric efficiency of 50 percent.
SOFC technology also has very low emissions. Because sulfur is
removed from the fuel, no SO<sub>x</sub> is emitted. The gas-impervious electrolyte
does not allow nitrogen to pass from the air electrode to the
fuel electrode, hence the fuel is oxidized in a nitrogen-free
environment, averting the formation of NO<sub>x</sub>. The temperatures of
exhaust gases are not high; this also helps reduce NO<sub>x</sub>. NOx emissions
measured at the testing plant have been fewer than 0.5 ppm. <P><BR>

The X-ray Timing Explorer was launched on December 30th, 1995 to
study the time variability in the emission of X-ray sources.
Time scales from microseconds to months are covered in an
instantaneous spectral range from 2 to 250 keV. The mission
carries two instruments that can be pointed at sources of interest: the
Proportional Counter Array (PCA) to cover the
lower part of the energy range, and the High Energy X-ray Timing
Experiment (HEXTE) covering the upper energy
range. In addition, XTE carries an All-Sky
Monitor (ASM) that scans about 80% of the sky every
orbit, allowing monitoring at time scales of 90 minutes or
longer.<P>

Section of the brain of a sheep with scrapie shows changes seen in all of the spongiform
encephalopathies, including BSE in cattle and CJD in
humans. Large empty spots, called vacuoles, can be seen in two
neurons. They are actually located within the cytoplasm of the cells, pushing the nucleus and the
normal contents of the cytoplasm to the margins of the cells. It is these cavities that make infected
brains seem to resemble a sponge, hence the name "spongiform." Normal brain tissue is quite compact,
with no holes and no spaces between the cells. <BR>

<CENTER><H1>The Prion Diseases</H1>
<H3>Prions, once dismissed as an impossibility, have now gained wide recognition as extraordinary agents that cause a number of infectious, genetic and spontaneous disorders</H3>

</FONT> </TD>
<TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH=340><P>Fifteen years ago I evoked a good deal of skepticism when I proposed that the infectious agents causing certain degenerative disorders of the central nervous system in animals and, more rarely, in humans might consist of protein and nothing else. At the time, the notion was heretical. Dogma held that the conveyers of transmissible diseases required genetic material, composed of nucleic acid (DNA or RNA), in order to establish an infection in a host. Even viruses, among the simplest microbes, rely on such material to direct synthesis of the proteins needed for survival and replication.
<P>
Later, many scientists were similarly dubious when my colleagues and I suggested that these "proteinaceous infectious particles"-or "prions," as I called the disease-causing agents-could underlie inherited, as well as communicable, diseases. Such dual behavior was then unknown to medical science. And we met resistance again when we concluded that prions (pronounced "pree-ons") multiply in an incredible way; they convert normal protein molecules into dangerous ones simply by inducing the benign molecules to change their shape.
<P>
Today, however, a wealth of experimental and clinical data has made a convincing case that we are correct on all three counts. Prions are indeed responsible for transmissible and inherited disorders of protein conformation. They can also cause sporadic disease, in which neither transmission between individuals nor inheritance is evident. Moreover, there are hints that the prions causing the diseases explored thus far may not be the only ones. Prions made of rather different proteins may contribute to other neurodegenerative diseases that are quite prevalent in humans. They might even participate in illnesses that attack muscles.
<P>
The known prion diseases, all fatal, are sometimes referred to as spongiform encephalopathies. They are so named because they frequently cause the brain to become riddled with holes. These ills, which can brew for years (or even for decades in humans) are widespread in animals. 
<P>
The most common form is scrapie, found in sheep and goats. AfBicted animals lose coordination and eventually become so incapacitated that they cannot stand. They also become irritable and, in some cases, develop an intense itch that leads them to scrape off their wool or hair (hence the name "scrapie"). The other prion diseases of animals go by such names as transmissible mink encephalopathy, chronic wasting disease of mule deer and elk, feline spongiform encephalopathy and bovine spongiform encephalopathy. The last, often called mad cow disease, is the most worrisome.
<P>
Gerald A. H. Wells and John W. Wilesmith of the Central Veterinary Laboratory in Weybridge, England, identified the condition in 1986, after it began striking cows in Great Britain, causing them to became uncoordinated and unusually apprehensive. The source of the emerging epidemic was soon traced to a food supplement that included meat and bone meal from dead sheep. The methods for processing sheep carcasses had been changed in the late 1970s. Where once they would have eliminated the scrapie agent in the supplement, now they apparently did not. The British government banned the use of animal-derived feed supplements in 1988, and the epidemic has probably peaked. Nevertheless, many people continue to worry that they will eventually fall ill as a result of having consumed tainted meat.
<P>
The human prion diseases are more obscure. Kuru has been seen only among the Fore highlanders of Papua New Guinea. They call it the "laughing death." Vincent Zigas of the Australian Public Health Service and D. Carleton Gajdusek of the U.S. National Institutes of Health described it in 1957, noting that many highlanders became aUeicted with a strange, fatal disease marked by loss of coordination (ataxia) and often later by dementia. The affected individuals probably acquired kuru through ritual cannibalism: the Fore tribe reportedly honored the dead by eating their brains. The practice has since stopped, and kuru has virtually disappeared.
<P>
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, in contrast, occurs worldwide and usually becomes evident as dementia. Most of the time it appears sporadically, striking one person in a million, typically around age 60. About 10 to 15 percent of cases are inherited, and a small number are, sadly, iatrogenic-spread inadvertently by the attempt to treat some other medical problem. Iatrogenic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease has apparently been transmitted by corneal transplantation, implantation of dura mater or electrodes in the brain, use of contaminated surgical instruments, and injection of growth hormone derived from human pituitaries (before recombinant growth hormone became available).
<P>
The two remaining human disorders are Gerstmann-Str...ussler-Scheinker disease (which is manifest as ataxia and other signs of damage to the cerebellum) and fatal familial insomnia (in which dementia follows diUculty sleeping). Both these conditions are usually inherited and typically appear in midlife. Fatal familial insomnia was discovered only recently, by Elio Lugaresi and Rossella Medori of the University of Bologna and Pierluigi Gambetti of Case Western Reserve University.
<P>
<P>
In Search of the Cause
<P>
<P>
I first became intrigued by the prion diseases in 1972, when as a resident in neurology at the University of California School of Medicine at San Francisco, I lost a patient to Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. As I reviewed the scientific literature on that and related conditions, I learned that scrapie, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and kuru had all been shown to be transmissible by injecting extracts of diseased brains into the brains of healthy animals. The infections were thought to be caused by a slow-acting virus, yet no one had managed to isolate the culprit.
<P>
In the course of reading, I came across an astonishing report in which Tikvah Alper and her colleagues at the Hammersmith Hospital in London suggested that the scrapie agent might lack nucleic acid, which usually can be degraded by ultraviolet or ionizing radiation. When the nucleic acid in extracts of scrapie-infected brains was presumably destroyed by those treatments, the extracts retained their ability to transmit scrapie. If the organism did lack DNA and RNA, the finding would mean that it was not a virus or any other known type of infectious agent, all of which contain genetic material. What, then, was it? Investigators had many ideas-including, jokingly, linoleum and kryptonite-but no hard answers.
<P>
I immediately began trying to solve this mystery when I set up a laboratory at U.C.S.F. in 1974. The first step had to be a mechanical one-purifying the infectious material in scrapie-infected brains so that its composition could be analyzed. The task was daunting; many investigators had tried and failed in the past. But with the optimism of youth, I forged ahead [see "Prions," by Stanley B. Prusiner; SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN, October 1984]. By 1982 my colleagues and I had made good progress, producing extracts of hamster brains consisting almost exclusively of infectious material. We had, furthermore, subjected the extracts to a range of tests designed to reveal the composition of the disease-causing component.
<P>
<P>
Amazing Discovery
<P>
<P>
All our results pointed toward one startling conclusion: the infectious agent in scrapie (and presumably in the related diseases) did indeed lack nucleic acid and consisted mainly, if not exclusively, of protein. We deduced that DNA and RNA were absent because, like Alper, we saw that procedures known to damage nucleic acid did not reduce infectivity. And we knew protein was an essential component because procedures that denature (unfold) or degrade protein reduced infectivity. I thus introduced the term "prion" to distinguish this class of disease conveyer from viruses, bacteria, fungi and other known pathogens. Not long afterward, we determined that scrapie prions contained a single protein that we called PrP, for "prion protein."
<P>
Now the major question became, Where did the instructions specifying the sequence of amino acids in PrP reside? Were they carried by an undetected piece of DNA that traveled with PrP, or were they, perhaps, contained in a gene housed in the chromosomes of cells? The key to this riddle was the identification in 1984 of some 15 amino acids at one end of the PrP protein. My group identified this short amino acid sequence in collaboration with Leroy E. Hood and his co-workers at the California Institute of Technology.
<P>
Knowledge of the sequence allowed us and others to construct molecular probes, or detectors, able to indicate whether mammalian cells carried the PrP gene. With probes produced by Hood's team, Bruno Oesch, working in the laboratory of Charles Weissmann at the University of Zurich, showed that hamster cells do contain a gene for PrP. At about the same time, Bruce Cheseboro of the NIH Rocky Mountain Laboratories made his own probes and established that mouse cells harbor the gene as well. That work made it possible to isolate the gene and to establish that it resides not in prions but in the chromosomes of hamsters, mice, humans and all other mammals that have been examined. What is more, most of the time, these animals make PrP without getting sick.
<P>
One interpretation of such findings was that we had made a terrible mistake: PrP had nothing to do with prion diseases. Another possibility was that PrP could be produced in two forms, one that generated disease and one that did not. We soon showed the latter interpretation to be correct. 
<P>
The critical clue was the fact that the PrP found in infected brains resisted breakdown by cellular enzymes called proteases. Most proteins in cells are degraded fairly easily. I therefore suspected that if a normal, nonthreatening form of PrP existed, it too would be susceptible to degradation. Ronald A. Barry in my laboratory then identified this hypothetical protease-sensitive form. It thus became clear that scrapie-causing PrP is a variant of a normal protein. We therefore called the normal protein "cellular PrP" and the infectious (protease-resistant) form "scrapie PrP." The latter term is now used to refer to the protein molecules that constitute the prions causing all scrapielike diseases of animals and humans.
<P>
<P>
Prion Diseases Can Be Inherited
<P>
<P>
Early on we had hoped to use the PrP gene to generate pure copies of PrP. Next, we would inject the protein molecules into animals, secure in the knowledge that no elusive virus was clinging to them. If the injections caused scrapie in the animals, we would have shown that protein molecules could, as we had proposed, transmit disease. By 1986, however, we knew the plan would not work. For one thing, it proved very difficult to induce the gene to make the high levels of PrP needed for conducting studies. For another thing, the protein that was produced was the normal, cellular form. Fortunately, work on a different problem led us to an alternative approach for demonstrating that prions could transmit scrapie without the help of any accompanying nucleic acid.
<P>
In many cases, the scrapielike illnesses of humans seemed to occur without having been spread from one host to another, and in some families they appeared to be inherited. (Today researchers know that about 10 percent of human prion diseases are familial, felling half of the members of the affected families.) It was this last pattern that drew our attention. Could it be that prions were more unusual than we originally thought? Were they responsible for the appearance of both hereditary and transmissible illnesses?
<P>
In 1988 Karen Hsiao in my laboratory and I uncovered some of the earliest data showing that human prion diseases can certainly be inherited. We acquired clones of a PrP gene obtained from a man who had Gerstmann-Str...ussler-Scheinker disease in his family and was dying of it himself. Then we compared his gene with PrP genes obtained from a healthy population and found a tiny abnormality known as a point mutation.
<P>
To grasp the nature of this mutation, it helps to know something about the organization of genes. Genes consist of two strands of the DNA building blocks called nucleotides, which differ from one another in the bases they carry. The bases on one strand combine with the bases on the other strand to form base pairs: the "rungs" on the familiar DNA "ladder." In addition to holding the DNA ladder together, these pairs spell out the sequence of amino acids that must be strung together to make a particular protein. Three base pairs together-a unit called a codon-specify a single amino acid. In our dying patient, just one base pair (out of more than 750) had been exchanged for a different pair. The change, in turn, had altered the information carried by codon 102, causing the amino acid leucine to be substituted for the amino acid proline in the man's PrP protein.
<P>
With the help of Tim J. Crow of Northwick Park Hospital in London and Jurg Ott of Columbia University and their colleagues, we discovered the same mutation in genes from a large number of patients with Gerstmann-Str...ussler-Scheinker disease, and we showed that the high incidence in the affected families was statistically significant. In other words, we established genetic linkage between the mutation and the disease-a finding that strongly implies the mutation is the cause. Over the past six years work by many investigators has uncovered 18 mutations in families with inherited prion diseases; for five of these mutations, enough cases have now been collected to demonstrate genetic linkage.
<P>
The discovery of mutations gave us a way to eliminate the possibility that a nucleic acid was traveling with prion proteins and directing their multiplication. We could now create genetically altered mice carrying a mutated PrP gene. If the presence of the altered gene in these "transgenic" animals led by itself to scrapie, and if the brain tissue of the transgenic animals then caused scrapie in healthy animals, we would have solid evidence that the protein encoded by the mutated gene had been solely responsible for the transfer of disease. Studies I conducted with Hsiao, Darlene Groth in my group and Stephen J. DeArmond, head of a separate laboratory at U.C.S.F., have now shown that scrapie can be generated and transmitted in this way [see box on pages 56 and 57].
<P>
These results in animals resemble those obtained in 1981, when Gajdusek, Colin L. Masters and Clarence J. Gibbs, Jr., all at the National Institutes of Health, transmitted apparently inherited Gerstmann-Str...ussler-Scheinker disease to monkeys. They also resemble the findings of Jun Tateishi and Tetsuyuki Kitamoto of Kyushu University in Japan, who transmitted inherited Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease to mice. Together the collected transmission studies persuasively argue that prions do, after all, represent an unprecedented class of infectious agents, composed only of a modified mammalian protein. And the conclusion is strengthened by the fact that assiduous searching for a scrapie-specific nucleic acid (especially by Detlev H. Riesner of Heinrich Heine University in DYesseldorf) has produced no evidence that such genetic material is attached to prions.
<P>
Scientists who continue to favor the virus theory might say that we still have not proved our case. If the PrP gene coded for a protein that, when mutated, facilitated infection by a ubiquitous virus, the mutation would lead to viral infection of the brain. Then injection of brain extracts from the mutant animal would spread the infection to another host. Yet in the absence of any evidence of a virus, this hypothesis looks to be untenable.
<P>
In addition to showing that a protein can multiply and cause disease without help from nucleic acids, we have gained insight into how scrapie PrP propagates in cells. Many details remain to be worked out, but one aspect appears quite clear: the main difference between normal PrP and scrapie PrP is conformational. Evidently, the scrapie protein propagates itself by contacting normal PrP molecules and somehow causing them to unfold and Bip from their usual conformation to the scrapie shape. This change initiates a cascade in which newly converted molecules change the shape of other normal PrP molecules, and so on. These events apparently occur on a membrane in the cell interior.
<P>
We started to think that the differences between cellular and scrapie forms of PrP must be conformational after other possibilities began to seem unlikely. For instance, it has long been known that the infectious form often has the same amino acid sequence as the normal type. Of course, molecules that start off being identical can later be chemically modified in ways that alter their activity. But intensive investigations by Neil Stahl and Michael A. Baldwin in my laboratory have turned up no differences of this kind.
<P>
<P>
One Protein, Two Shapes
<P>
<P>
How, exactly, do the structures of normal and scrapie forms of PrP differ? Studies by Keh-Ming Pan in our group indicate that the normal protein consists primarily of alpha helices, regions in which the protein backbone twists into a specific kind of spiral; the scrapie form, however, contains beta strands, regions in which the backbone is fully extended. Collections of these strands form beta sheets. Fred E. Cohen, who directs another laboratory at U.C.S.F., has used molecular modeling to try to predict the structure of the normal protein based on its amino acid sequence. His calculations imply that the protein probably folds into a compact structure having four helices in its core. Less is known about the structure, or structures, adopted by scrapie PrP.
<P>
The evidence supporting the proposition that scrapie PrP can induce an alpha-helical PrP molecule to switch to a beta-sheet form comes primarily from two important studies by investigators in my group. Mar'a Gasset learned that synthetic peptides (short strings of amino acids) corresponding to three of the four putative alpha-helical regions of PrP can fold into beta sheets. And Jack Nguyen has shown that in their beta-sheet conformation, such peptides can impose a beta-sheet structure on helical PrP peptides. More recently Byron W. Caughey of the Rocky Mountain Laboratories and Peter T. Lansbury of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have reported that cellular PrP can be converted into scrapie PrP in a test tube by mixing the two proteins together.
<P>
PrP molecules arising from mutated genes probably do not adopt the scrapie conformation as soon as they are synthesized. Otherwise, people carrying mutant genes would become sick in early childhood. We suspect that mutations in the PrP gene render the resulting proteins susceptible to Bipping from an alpha-helical to a beta-sheet shape. Presumably, it takes time until one of the molecules spontaneously Bips over and still more time for scrapie PrP to accumulate and damage the brain enough to cause symptoms.
<P>
Fred Cohen and I think we might be able to explain why the various mutations that have been noted in PrP genes could facilitate folding into the beta-sheet form. Many of the human mutations give rise to the substitution of one amino acid for another within the four putative helices or at their borders. Insertion of incorrect amino acids at those positions might destabilize a helix, thus increasing the likelihood that the affected helix and its neighbors will refold into a beta-sheet conformation. Conversely, Hermann Sch...tzel in my laboratory finds that the harmless differences distinguishing the PrP gene of humans from those of apes and monkeys affect amino acids lying outside of the proposed helical domains-where the divergent amino acids probably would not profoundly inBuence the stability of the helical regions.
<P>
<P>
Treatment Ideas Emerge
<P>
<P>
No one knows exactly how propagation of scrapie PrP damages cells. In cell cultures, the conversion of normal PrP to the scrapie form occurs inside neurons, after which scrapie PrP accumulates in intracellular vesicles known as lysosomes. In the brain, filled lysosomes could conceivably burst and damage cells. As the diseased cells died, creating holes in the brain, their prions would be released to attack other cells.
<P>
We do know with certainty that cleavage of scrapie PrP is what produces PrP fragments that accumulate as plaques in the brains of some patients. Those aggregates resemble plaques seen in Alzheimer's disease, although the Alzheimer's clumps consist of a different protein. The PrP plaques are a useful sign of prion infection, but they seem not to be a major cause of impairment. In many people and animals with prion disease, the plaques do not arise at all.
<P>
Even though we do not yet know much about how PrP scrapie harms brain tissue, we can foresee that an understanding of the three-dimensional structure of the PrP protein will lead to therapies. If, for example, the four-helix-bundle model of PrP is correct, drug developers might be able to design a compound that would bind to a central pocket that could be formed by the four helices. So bound, the drug would stabilize these helices and prevent their conversion into beta sheets.
<P>
Another idea for therapy is inspired by research in which Weissmann and his colleagues applied gene-targeting technology to create mice that lacked the PrP gene and so could not make PrP. By knocking out a gene and noting the consequences of its loss, one can often deduce the usual functions of the gene's protein product. In this case, however, the animals missing PrP displayed no detectable abnormalities. If it turns out that PrP is truly inessential, then physicians might one day consider delivering so-called antisense or antigene therapies to the brains of patients with prion diseases. Such therapies aim to block genes from giving rise to unwanted proteins and could potentially shut down production of cellular PrP [see "The New Genetic Medicines," by Jack S. Cohen and Michael E. Hogan; SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN, December 1994]. They would thereby block PrP from propagating itself.
<P>
It is worth noting that the knockout mice provided a welcomed opportunity to challenge the prion hypothesis. If the animals became ill after inoculation with prions, their sickness would have indicated that prions could multiply even in the absence of a preexisting pool of PrP molecules. As I expected, inoculation with prions did not produce scrapie, and no evidence of prion replication could be detected.
<P>
The enigma of how scrapie PrP multiplies and causes disease is not the only puzzle starting to be solved. Another long-standing question-the mystery of how prions consisting of a single kind of protein can vary markedly in their effects-is beginning to be answered as well. Iain H. Pattison of the Agriculture Research Council in Compton, England, initially called attention to this phenomenon. Years ago he obtained prions from two separate sets of goats. One isolate made inoculated animals drowsy, whereas the second made them hyperactive. Similarly, it is now evident that some prions cause disease quickly, whereas others do so slowly.
<P>
<P>
The Mystery of "Strains"
<P>
<P>
Alan G. Dickinson, Hugh Fraser and Moira E. Bruce of the Institute for Animal Health in Edinburgh, who have examined the differential effects of varied isolates in mice, are among those who note that only pathogens containing nucleic acids are known to occur in multiple strains. Hence, they and others assert, the existence of prion "strains" indicates the prion hypothesis must be incorrect; viruses must be at the root of scrapie and its relatives. Yet because efforts to find viral nucleic acids have been unrewarding, the explanation for the differences must lie elsewhere.
<P>
One possibility is that prions can adopt multiple conformations. Folded in one way, a prion might convert normal PrP to the scrapie form highly eUciently, giving rise to short incubation times. Folded another way, it might work less eUciently. Similarly, one "conformer" might be attracted to neuronal populations in one part of the brain, whereas another might be attracted to neurons elsewhere, thus producing different symptoms. Considering that PrP can fold in at least two ways, it would not be surprising to find it can collapse into other structures as well.
<P>
Since the mid-1980s we have also sought insight into a phenomenon known as the species barrier. This concept refers to the fact that something makes it diUcult for prions made by one species to cause disease in animals of another species. The cause of this diUculty is of considerable interest today because of the epidemic of mad cow disease in Britain. We and others have been trying to find out whether the species barrier is strong enough to prevent the spread of prion disease from cows to humans.
<P>
<P>
Breaking the Barrier
<P>
<P>
The barrier was discovered by Pattison, who in the 1960s found it hard to transmit scrapie between sheep and rodents. To determine the cause of the trouble, my colleague Michael R. Scott and I later generated transgenic mice expressing the PrP gene of the Syrian hamster-that is, making the hamster PrP protein. The mouse gene differs from that of the hamster gene at 16 codons out of 254. Normal mice inoculated with hamster prions rarely acquire scrapie, but the transgenic mice became ill within about two months.
<P>
We thus concluded that we had broken the species barrier by inserting the hamster genes into the mice. Moreover, on the basis of this and other experiments, we realized that the barrier resides in the amino acid sequence of PrP: the more the sequence of a scrapie PrP molecule resembles the PrP sequence of its host, the more likely it is that the host will acquire prion disease. In one of those other experiments, for example, we examined transgenic mice carrying the Syrian hamster PrP gene in addition to their own mouse gene. Those mice make normal forms of both hamster and mouse PrP. When we inoculated the animals with mouse prions, they made more mouse prions. When we inoculated them with hamster prions, they made hamster prions. From this behavior, we learned that prions preferentially interact with cellular PrP of homologous, or like, composition. 
<P>
The attraction of scrapie PrP for cellular PrP having the same sequence probably explains why scrapie managed to spread to cows in England from food consisting of sheep tissue: sheep and bovine PrP differ only at seven positions. In contrast, the sequence difference between human and bovine PrP is large: the molecules diverge at more than 30 positions. Because the variance is great, the likelihood of transmission from cows to people would seem to be low. Consistent with this assessment are epidemiological studies by W. Bryan Matthews, a professor emeritus at the University of Oxford. Matthews found no link between scrapie in sheep and the occurrence of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in sheep-farming countries.
<P>
On the other hand, two farmers who had "mad cows" in their herds have recently died of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Their deaths may have nothing to do with the bovine epidemic, but the situation bears watching. It may turn out that certain parts of the PrP molecule are more important than others for breaking the species barrier. If that is the case, and if cow PrP closely resembles human PrP in the critical regions, then the likelihood of danger might turn out to be higher than a simple comparison of the complete amino acid sequences would suggest.
<P>
We began to consider the possibility that some parts of the PrP molecule might be particularly important to the species barrier after a study related to this blockade took an odd turn. My colleague Glenn C. Telling had created transgenic mice carrying a hybrid PrP gene that consisted of human codes Banked on either side by mouse codes; this gene gave rise to a hybrid protein. Then he introduced brain tissue from patients who had died of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease or Gerstmann-Str...ussler-Scheinker disease into the transgenic animals. Oddly enough, the animals became ill much more frequently and faster than did mice carrying a full human PrP gene, which diverges from mouse PrP at 28 positions. This outcome implied that similarity in the central region of the PrP molecule may be more critical than it is in the other segments.
<P>
The result also lent support to earlier indications-uncovered by Shu-Lian Yang in DeArmond's laboratory and Albert Taraboulos in my group-that molecules made by the host can inBuence the behavior of scrapie PrP. We speculate that in the hybrid-gene study, a mouse protein, possibly a "chaperone" normally involved in folding nascent protein chains, recognized one of the two mouse-derived regions of the hybrid PrP protein. This chaperone bound to that region and helped to refold the hybrid molecule into the scrapie conformation. The chaperone did not provide similar help in mice making a totally human PrP protein, presumably because the human protein lacked a binding site for the mouse factor.
<P>
<P>
The List May Grow
<P>
<P>
An unforeseen story has recently emerged from studies of transgenic mice making unusually high amounts of normal PrP proteins. DeArmond, David Westaway in our group and George A. Carlson of the McLaughlin Laboratory in Great Falls, Mont., became perplexed when they noted that some older transgenic mice developed an illness characterized by rigidity and diminished grooming. When we pursued the cause, we found that making excessive amounts of PrP can eventually lead to neurodegeneration and, surprisingly, to destruction of both muscles and peripheral nerves. These discoveries widen the spectrum of prion diseases and are prompting a search for human prion diseases that affect the peripheral nervous system and muscles.
<P>
Investigations of animals that overproduce PrP have yielded another benefit as well. They offer a clue as to how the sporadic form of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease might arise. For a time I suspected that sporadic disease might begin when the wear and tear of living led to a mutation of the PrP gene in at least one cell in the body. Eventually, the mutated protein might switch to the scrapie form and gradually propagate itself, until the buildup of scrapie PrP crossed the threshold to overt disease. The mouse studies suggest that at some point in the lives of the one in a million individuals who acquire sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, cellular PrP may spontaneously convert to the scrapie form. The experiments also raise the possibility that people who become aUeicted with sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease overproduce PrP, but we do not yet know if, in fact, they do.
<P>
All the known prion diseases in humans have now been modeled in mice. With our most recent work we have inadvertently developed an animal model for sporadic prion disease. Mice inoculated with brain extracts from scrapie-infected animals and from humans afflicted with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease have long provided a model for the infectious forms of prion disorders. And the inherited prion diseases have been modeled in transgenic mice carrying mutant PrP genes. These murine representations of the human prion aUeictions should not only extend understanding of how prions cause brain degeneration, they should also create opportunities to evaluate therapies for these devastating maladies.
<P>
<P>
Striking Similarities
<P>
<P>
Ongoing research may also help determine whether prions consisting of other proteins play a part in more common neurodegenerative conditions, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. There are some marked similarities in all these disorders. As is true of the known prion diseases, the more widespread ills mostly occur sporadically but sometimes "run" in families. All are also usually diseases of middle to later life and are marked by similar pathology: neurons degenerate, protein deposits can accumulate as plaques, and glial cells (which support and nourish nerve cells) grow larger in reaction to damage to neurons. Strikingly, in none of these disorders do white blood cells-those ever present warriors of the immune system-infiltrate the brain. If a virus were involved in these illnesses, white cells would be expected to appear.
<P>
Recent findings in yeast encourage speculation that prions unrelated in amino acid sequence to the PrP protein could exist. Reed B. Wickner of the NIH reports that a protein called Ure2p might sometimes change its conformation, thereby affecting its activity in the cell. In one shape, the protein is active; in the other, it is silent.
<P>
The collected studies described here argue persuasively that the prion is an entirely new class of infectious pathogen and that prion diseases result from aberrations of protein conformation. Whether changes in protein shape are responsible for common neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's, remains unknown, but it is a possibility that should not be ignored.<P>

<H1>Companions to Young Stars</H1>
<H3>The surprising finding that even the youngest stars
commonlyexist in sets of two or three has revised thinking
about the birth of star systems.</H3>
by Alan P. Boss</CENTER>
<P>A minor revolution in astronomy occurred on April 6,
1992. It did not take place at a mountaintop observatory but
happened at anunlikely location the Callaway Gardens Inn on
Georgia's Pine Mountain (elevation: 820 feet). Astronomers
had gathered therefor an international meeting on the
normally slow-paced researchtopic of double stars, a field
where discoveries often require decades to allow for many of
these systems to complete their orbits. While azaleas
flowered outside in the spring rain, astronomers inside
presented results pointing to the startling conclusion that
even the youngest stars are frequently surroundedby stellar
companions. This realization was the product of painstaking
observations by many different people using a host of clever
techniques and new devices. That morning in Georgia,
theseparate works of these numerous researchers appeared
magically to dovetail.<P> The finding that binary systems
are at least as common for youngstars as for older ones
might seem reasonable enough, but for astronomers it came as
a shock. Most notions of double star formation had predicted
that stellar companions are produced orcaptured well after a
star has formed; hence, the youngest starswould be expected
to exist singly in space. Such theories no longer bear
weight. There remains, however, at least one idea forthe
formation of double stars that holds up to the recent
observations. It may be the sole explanation for why binary
starsystems are so abundant in the universe.<P>The sun,
a mature star, has no known stellar companions, even though
most stars of its age are found in groups of two or more.In
1984 Richard A. Muller of Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory and
his colleagues hypothesized that the sun is not truly a
single starbut that it has a distant companion orbiting it
with a period of about 30 million years. He reasoned that
gravitational forces from this unseen neighbor could disturb
material circling in the outermost reaches of the solar
system, sending a shower of comets toward the inner planets
every time the star neared. Muller suggested that this
effect might explain periodic massextinctions: comets
generated by the sun's companion would hit the earth every
30 million years or so and as with the demise ofthe
dinosaurs would have wiped out much of life on earth.
Because its approach would have sparked such widespread
destruction, Muller called the unseen star "Nemesis."<P>
Most scientists have not accepted Muller's interesting idea.
Forone, the closest known stars (the Alpha Centauri triple
star system, at a distance of 4.2 light-years) are much too
far away to be bound to the sun by gravity. In fact, there
is no astronomical evidence that the sun is anything other
than a single star whose largest companion (Jupiter) is
1,000 times less massive than the sun itself. But living on
a planet in orbit around a solitary sun gives us a distorted
view of the cosmos; wetend to think that single stars are
the norm and that double stars must be somewhat
odd. For stars like the sun, this turnsout to be far from
true.<P> <B>Doubles, Anyone?</B> <P>In 1990 the late Antoine
Duquennoy and Michel Mayor of the Geneva Observatory
completed an exhaustive, decade-long survey of nearby binary
stars. They considered every star in the sun's "G-dwarf"
class within 72 light-years, a sample containing 164
primarystars that are thought to be representative of the
disk of ourgalaxy. Duquennoy and Mayor found that only about
one third of these systems could be considered true single
stars; two thirdshad companions more massive than one
hundredth the mass of the sun, or about 10 Jupiters.<P>
Binary star systems have widely variable characteristics.
Starsof some double G-dwarf systems may be nearly touching
one another; others can be as far apart as a third of a
light-year. Those in contact may circle each other in less
than a day, whereas the most widely separated double stars
may take tens ofmillions of years to complete a single
orbit. Duquennoy and Mayorshowed that triple and quadruple
G-dwarf stars are considerably rarer than double stars. They
counted 62 distinct doubles, seven triples and two quadruple
groupings. They further determined that each of the triple
and quadruple sets had a hierarchical structure, composed of
a relatively close double orbited by either a more distant
single star (forming a triple system) or another close
double star (forming a quadruple system). The separation
between distant pairs needs to be at least five
times the gap of the close doubles for the group to survive
for long. Arrangements with smaller separations are named
Trapezium systems, after a young quadruple system in the
Orion nebula. These arrangements are orbitally unstable they
will eventually flyapart. For instance, if the three stars
of a triple system comeclose enough together, they will tend
to eject the star of lowestmass, leaving behind a stable
pair. <P>Double stars thus seem to be the rule rather than
the exception. This conclusion does not, however, mean that
planets must berare. A planet could travel around a double
star system provided that it circles either near one of the
two stars or far away fromboth of them. Imagine living on
such a world orbiting at a safe distance from a tightly
bound binary, where the two stars complete an orbit every
few days. The daytime sky would contain apair of suns
separated by a small distance. Sunrises and sunsetswould be
fascinating to watch as first one and then the other glowing
orb crossed the horizon. Other strange celestial
configurations might also occur. If, for example, the planet
orbited in the same plane as did two stars of equal mass,
the two suns periodically would appear to merge as they
eclipsed eachother, briefly halving the amount of combined
sunlight reaching the planet.<P> <B>Stellar Nurseries</B>
<P>The sun formed about 4.6 billion years ago and has about
five billion years remaining of its so-called main-sequence
lifetime. After it reaches the end of
its main sequence, it will expand tobecome a red giant that
will engulf the inner planets. This configuration will be
somewhat akin to one that occurred early in the sun's
history, when it extended far beyond its presentradius. At
that time, before it had contracted to its currentsize, the
sun was similar to the T Tauri class of stars that can be
seen in those regions of our galaxy where stars are now
forming. During its T Tauri stage, the sun's radius was
about four times greater than its present measurement of
some 700,000 kilometers. Still earlier, the protosun must
have extended out to about 1.5 billion kilometers, or 10
times the distance betweenthe earth and the sun (that span,
150 million kilometers, is known as an astronomical unit, or
AU). <P>Present-day T Tauri stars offer astronomers an
opportunity to learn what the sun was like early in its
evolution. The nearest T Tauri stars are in two locations,
known as the the Taurus molecular cloud and the Rho
Ophiuchus
molecular cloud, both about 460 light-years from the earth.
The fact that young stars are always embedded in such dusty
concentrations of gas gives convincing testimony to their
origin-stars are born from the contraction and collapse of
the dense cores of molecular hydrogenclouds. <P>Because
young stars are typically enshrouded by dust, astronomers
usually have difficulty viewing them in visible light, no
matterhow powerful the telescope. But these sites can be
detected readily using infrared wavelengths that are
characteristic of the emission from heated dust grains
surrounding the nearby star. Progress in understanding the
formation of stars has thus be endependent to a large extent
on the development of detectors capable of sensing infrared
radiation. At the 1992 meeting in Georgia, the first results
were presented for several different infrared surveys
specifically designed to detect companions tothe T Tauri
stars in Taurus and Ophiuchus.<P> Andrea M. Ghez, now at the
University of California at Los Angeles, and her colleagues
Gerry F. Neugebauer and Keith Matthews, both at the
California Institute of Technology, used a new indium
antimony array camera on the five-meter Hale telescope to
photograph the regions around known T Tauri stars at then
ear-infrared wavelength of 2.2 microns. (Visible light has a
wavelength between about 0.4 and 0.7 micron.) Using a
so-called speckle imaging technique to minimize the noise
introduced by fluctuations in the earth's atmosphere
above the telescope, Ghezand her colleagues found that
almost half of the 70 T Tauri starsin their sample showed
stellar companions. For the limited range of separations
considered, about 10 to 400 AU, this study indicated that
for the youngest systems, binaries are twice as common as
for main-sequence stars. Christoph Leinert of the Max Planck
Institute for Astronomy in Heidelberg also presented results
of a near-infrared speckle imaging survey. Leinert and his
colleagues found that 43 of the 106 T Tauri stars they
examined had nearby companions, again implying that binaries
were much more common in these stars than in G-dwarf stars
like oursun. <P>Hans Zinnecker and Wolfgang Brandner of the
University of Wrzburg in Germany and Bo Reipurth of the
European Southern Observatory in Chile used a
high-resolution digital camera in combination with the
European New Technology Telescope to image 160 T Tauri stars
at an infrared wavelength (one micron). They uncovered 28
companions lying from 100 to 1,500 AU from the T Tauri
stars, about a third more than circle around older,
solar-type stars in that distance range.<P> Michel J. Simon
of the State University of New York at Stony
Brook, along with Wen Ping Chen (now at National Central
University in Taiwan) and their colleagues, reported a novel
way to find young double stars. When the moon passes over,
oroccults, a distant star system, careful monitoring of the
light received can reveal the presence of two or more
sources, as first one and then another star slips behind the
sharp edge of the lunar face. Simon and Chen's measurements
detected companions much closer to T Tauri stars than was
possible with infrared imaging. Their work again showed that
a large fraction are binaries. Robert D. Mathieu of the
University of Wisconsin employed a more traditional means
for detecting close doublestars, the same as that used by
Duquennoy and Mayor. Mathieu usedspectroscopic measurements
of the periodic Doppler shift to show that some T Tauri
stars have companions within 1 AU. Once more, closely spaced
binaries proved more common in young T Tauri systems than
for solar-type stars.<P> <B>Search for a Theory</B> <P>How
did all these stellar companions come to be? Why did they
form so abundantly and so early in their evolution? The
wealth of observations of young
stars presented in Georgia requires that binary stars must
form well before even their pre-main-sequence (T Tauri)
phase. Moreover, the finding that binaries are socommon
demands that the mechanism generating them whatever it is
must be very efficient. <P>In principle, a double star
system could arise from two stars that pass close enough
together so that one forces the other into a stable orbit.
The celestial mechanics of such an event, however, requires
the intervention of a third object to removethe excess
energy of motion between the two stars and leave them
trapped in a gravitationally bound system. But such
three-bodyencounters are too rare to account for very many
binary stars. Cathy J. Clarke and James E. Pringle of the
University of Cambridge studied a more likely way that
companion stars might
have paired up. They investigated the gravitational coupling
between two young stars that still had flattened disks of
dust and gas surrounding them. That geometry would be far
more common than three-body encounters and could, in theory,
remove enough energy from the stars' motions. But in their
analysis they found thatsuch interactions are much more
likely to end up ripping apartthe circumstellar disks than
to result in one star's neatly orbiting with the other. So
this embellishment seems to help little in explaining the
existence of binary star systems. <P>Failure of the capture
mechanism has forced most astronomers to think about
processes that might
form binary stars more directly. In fact, consideration of
this notion goes back over a century.In 1883 Lord Kelvin
proposed that double stars result from rotational fission.
Based on studies of the stability of bodiesin rapid
rotation, Kelvin suggested that as a star contracted,
itwould spin faster and faster until it broke up into a
binary star. Astronomers now know that pre-main-sequence
stars contractconsiderably as they approach the
hydrogen-burning main sequence, but T Tauri stars do not
rotate fast enough to become unstable. Furthermore, Kelvins
fissioning would act too late to explain
the frequency of binaries among young stars. Richard H.
Durisenof Indiana University and his colleagues showed that
fission fails on theoretical grounds as well a reasonable
calculation of this instability shows that the ejected
matter would end up astrailing spiral arms of gas rather
than as a separate cohesivestar.<P> In contrast to the
century-old fission theory, there is an idea for creating
binary stars that is only a decade old, called
fragmentation. This concept supposes that binary stars are
born during a phase when dense molecular clouds collapse
under their own gravity and become protostars. The obscuring
gas and dustthen clear away, and a newly
formed binary star (of the T Tauri class) emerges. In
contrast to older theories of the birth of binary systems,
fragmentation fully agrees with the latest observations of
young stars.<P> The protostellar collapse that enables
fragmentation occurs relatively suddenly in the scale of a
several-billion-yearstellar lifetime; the event takes place
in a few hundred thousandyears. This violent transformation
of a diffuse cloud into acompact star thus offers a special
opportunity for a single objectto break into several
distinct members. Astrophysicists have identified two
mechanisms that might operate. Very cold cloud scan fragment
directly into binaries, whereas warmer clouds with
substantial rotation can first settle into thin disks that
later break up as they gain more mass or become
progressively flattened.<P> <B>Cloudy Ideas</B>
<P>A key objection to the fragmentation theory involved the
distribution of matter in protostellar clouds. It was
previously thought that this material was distributed
according to aso-called power law. That is, there would be
an extremely high concentration of material near the center
of the cloud and arapid decrease in density with distance.
This objection appears, however, to have been removed
recently by high-resolution radio observations made using
submillimeter wavelengths. Last year Derek Ward-Thompson of
the Royal Observatory in Edinburgh and hiscolleagues
determined the distribution of material inside several
precollapse clouds. They found that the density follows a
Gaussian (bell-shaped) distribution rather than a power law.
Hence, matter would be less tightly concentrated toward a
centralpoint when the star system began to form.
Elizabeth A. Myhill,then at the University of California at
Los Angeles, and I had shown separately that the high
density at the center of a cloudthat follows a power law
makes it almost impossible for a secondor third star to
coalesce. It proves much easier for fragmentation to occur
with an initial Gaussian distribution.<P> Astrophysicists
can predict whether multiple fragments will ultimately form
by solving the set of equations that govern the flow of gas,
dust and radiation in a protostellar cloud. The calculations
are sufficiently complex to require accurate software and a
powerful computer for their solution. I beganmodeling the
collapse of dense clouds with Gaussian density profiles in
1986 and found that fragmentation could readily occur
provided certain conditions were met. As long as a Gaussian
cloudhas sufficient rotation to give the binary system the
angular momentum it requires and the precollapse material is
cold enough (less than 10 kelvins) to make its thermal
energy less than about half its gravitational energy, the
cloud will fragment during its
gravitational contraction. The conditions appear to be
nothingout of the ordinary for the clouds found in stellar
nurseries.<P> Whether a binary, triple or quadruple system
eventually forms depends on many details, including the
three-dimensional shape ofthe original cloud, how lumpy it
is and the precise amount of thermal and rotational energy
available. In general, prolate, or football-shaped, clouds
tend to form bars that fragment into binary systems, whereas
more oblate, or pancake-shaped, clouds flatten to disks that
later fragment into several members.<P> The collapse is
thought to occur in two separate steps. The first phase
generates protostars with a radius on the order of 10 AU.
Thus, the first phase of fragmentation can produce only
binary systems with separations of about 10 AU or larger.
These bodies then undergo a second collapse to form the
final protostars of stellar dimensions. Ian A. Bonnell and
Matthew R. Bate of the University of Cambridge have shown
that fragmentation can happen during the second collapse
phase as well, and this process can lead to the formation of
protostellar cores separated by distances comparable with
those of the closest main-sequencestars. Fragmentation
appears to be capable of generating the
entire range of separations observed in young binary stars,
from the closest to the widest systems.<P> <B>Brown Dwarfs
and Giant Planets</B> <P>What about finding companions of
even lower mass? Duquennoy and Mayor produced evidence that
as many as 10 percent of solar-typestars are bound to brown
dwarfs that is, they have stellar companions with masses
from 0.01 to 0.08 times the mass of the sun. Brown dwarfs
are too small to ignite hydrogen the way the sun does but
could be massive enough to burn deuterium soon after
formation. After that, their radiation would cease, and they
would become cool and extremely difficult to detect.
Although the evidence offered by Duquennoy and Mayor is
intriguing, there is as yet no confirmed example of a brown
dwarf star, in spite of the many efforts to detect one. The
search is also on for planetary companions, although again
astronomers have yet found no convincing candidates. But in
the next
decade, experimental techniques should improve to the point
that planets the size of Jupiter could be detected (or else
demonstrated not to exist) around a number of nearby stars.
Whether it is reasonable to examine binaries or restrict the
search to single stars like thesun is an open question;
astronomers will probably target some of both in their
ongoing effort to uncover a planetary system comfortingly
similar to our own.

Stahler</CENTER><P>Looking up at a clear night sky, farfrom city lights, one seesthat the universe is filled with stars. Somehow nature hasmanaged to create untold numbers of these objects--an estimated100 billion in the Milky Way alone. Furthermore, stars continueto be born, 10 to 20 billion years after the universe began. Howare stars created? What changes does a young star undergo beforeit settles into the relatively stable state now exhibited by thesun?<P>From a physicist's perspective, a star is a ball of hot gas heldtogether by its own gravity. The heat and pressure generated byinternal nuclear reactions--chiefly the fusion of hydrogen intohelium--prevent the star from collapsing under the gravitationalforce. This relatively simple system has a well-defined lifespan. It begins with the star's condensation from a diffuse cloudof interstellar gas and ends when the star, having exhausted itsnuclear fuel, fades from sight as a white dwarf, neutron star orblack hole.<P>From this description, it might seem that detailing the formationand early evolution of stars should present no essentialdifficulties. But the subtle ways in which gravity and thermalpressure interact cause young stars to behave in a manner thatsometimes defies intuition. Consider, for example, the evolutionof luminosity, the amount of energy emitted by the stellarsurface per unit time. The internal temperature of a young staris too low to fuse hydrogen, so its luminosity would also beexpected to be relatively low. It might increase when the fusionof hydrogen begins and then gradually fade.<P>In fact, a very young star is extremely bright. Its luminositydecreases as age advances, reaching a temporary minimum at thetime of hydrogen ignition. The early life of stars involves arich variety of physical processes, some of which remain poorlyunderstood. Only within the past two decades have astronomersbegun to piece together, through theory and observation, acoherent and detailed picture.<P>Stars condense under their own gravity from large, opticallyinvisible clouds found throughout the disks of spiral galaxies.Such aggregates are called giant molecular cloud complexes. Theterm "molecular" refers to the fact that the gas consists mostlyof hydrogen in its molecular form [see "Giant Molecular-CloudComplexes in the Galaxy," by Leo Blitz; SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN,April 1982]. The complexes are the most massive structures in thegalaxy, sometimes measuring more than 300 light-years across.<P>Closer inspection reveals that stars develop from isolatedcondensations within the giant molecular cloud complexes. Suchcondensations are called dense cores. Philip C. Myers of theHarvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, who coined the termin 1983, was the first to observe their properties systematicallyand to emphasize their role in star formation.<P>Astronomers investigate the properties of dense cores by usinglarge radio telescopes, the only instruments capable of detectingthe weak, millimeter-wavelength radiation that the clouds emit.The radiation comes not from the molecular hydrogen but from thetrace amounts of other substances in the cores, such as carbonmonoxide and carbon monosulfide. The emissions from these tracegases reveal that a typical dense core has a diameter of a fewlight-months, a density of 30,000 hydrogen molecules per cubiccentimeter, and a temperature of 10 kelvins [see illustration onpage 53].<P>From these numbers, investigators inferred that the gas pressurein a dense core is just about the right magnitude to withstandthe compressive force of the core's own gravity. To form a star,therefore, the core must collapse from a marginally unstablestate--that is, one in which gravity is only slightly strongerthan pressure.<P>How the core itself condensed from its parent molecular cloudcomplex to arrive at this marginally unstable state is still notwell understood. Nevertheless, astrophysicists had the tools tomodel stellar formation even before the discovery of dense cores.In the 1960s theorists had used computer simulations to determinehow clouds in unstable states collapse.<P>Although the simulations assumed widely varying initialconditions, each one showed that clouds that are not violentlyunstable collapse in an inside-out manner. That is, material atthe center first enters into a true free-fall collapse while theoutlying gas remains static. Gradually the region of collapsespreads outward through the rest of the cloud.<P>Deep within the collapsing region, a star begins to form from thecollisions of gas. The star itself is only about one light-secondin diameter--one ten-millionth that of the dense core. For a starof such a relatively small size, the overall pattern of collapseis insignificant. What counts is the mass accretion rate.<P>This rate is the amount of matter per unit time crossing animaginary spherical shell near the center of the cloud. In hiselegant and influential 1977 paper, Frank H. Shu of theUniversity of California at Berkeley demonstrated a remarkableresult: the mass-accretion rate depends solely on the initialcloud temperature. The higher the temperature, the greater therate of accretion. Shu's result indicates that an amount of massequal to the sun's accumulates at the center of a collapsingdense core in 100,000 to one million years.<P>The object forming at the center of the collapsing cloud is knownas a protostar. The modern theory of protostars began to takeshape in 1969, when Richard Larson of Yale University was able toobserve stellar buildup in a computer simulation of cloudcollapse. Researchers developing Larson's pioneering work havefound an advantage in conceptually separating the protostar fromthe cloud as they model the collapse. In other words,investigators examine the protostar in isolation as an ordinarystar with an extraordinary outer boundary condition--the incomingaccretion flow.<P>Astronomers running these simulations can vary the properties ofthe accretion flow to gauge its effect on the evolution of theprotostar. In 1980 Shu, Ronald Taam of Northwestern Universityand I first used this approach to establish the properties ofprotostars of about one solar mass. More recently, incollaboration with Francesco Palla of Arcetri Observatory inFlorence, I have turned to the method once again to study moremassive protostars.<P>Through such simulations, astronomers have now developed a modelthat describes the protostar phase. Workers have found that theincoming gas hits the protostar at a very high speed, so highthat it cannot decelerate gradually before reaching the stellarsurface. Instead it encounters a strong shock front (a sharptransition to very high pressure) that rapidly halts the gas.Within the shock, the gas is heated to nearly one millionkelvins. The gas quickly cools by radiation to about 10,000kelvins and settles down, layer by layer, to form the protostar.<P>The shock front explains why young stars are so luminous. If aprotostar attains one solar mass, the luminosity that the gasgenerates when it encounters the shock front exceeds solarbrightness by a factor of six to 60. Thus, the acute brightnessof these young stars stems not from nuclear fusion, as inordinary stars, but from the kinetic energy of matter as it ispulled in by gravity.<P>The luminosity from protostars is observable, but not withoptical telescopes. All the gas in interstellar space, includingthat which forms stars, contains "dust," a mixture of solidparticles of submicron size. As photons stream outward from theshock front, they eventually encounter massive amounts of thesedust grains falling in along with the gas of the original densecore.<P>The dust cannot reach the protostar surface, because the intenseheat from the shock front vaporizes it. Astronomers refer to thevolume of space within which the dust is vaporized as the opacitygap. Farther upstream, beyond the opacity gap, temperatures arelow enough to enable the grains to exist. The cold grains absorbthe shock-generated photons and reemit them at longerwavelengths. These long-wavelength photons are in turn absorbedby dust grains lying farther away.<P>The photons thus tortuously make their way through the cloudmaterial, until their average wavelength lies deep in theinfrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum. At a radius thatShu, Taam and I call the dust photosphere, located a fewlight-hours from the protostar, the photons have too long awavelength to be absorbed by the dust and can finally flyunimpeded to earth-based infrared telescopes.<P>Despite the capabilities of modern detectors, astronomers cannotdefinitively say that telescopes have actually recorded theinfrared signals of protostars. After its launch in 1983, theInfrared Astronomical Satellite generated hundreds of thousandsof images of pointlike infrared sources of radiation [see "TheInfrared Sky," by Harm J. Habing and Gerry Neugebauer; SCIENTIFICAMERICAN, November 1984]. Many sources appear to be located deepwithin the radio-imaged dense cores; some must undoubtedly beprotostars. The uncertainty arises because detectors cannotdistinguish the protostars from somewhat older stars, also buriedin dust and gas.<P>For a positive identification, infrared or radio telescopes mustbe able to detect the Doppler shift of spectral lines very closeto an infrared point source. The Doppler shift would representthe actual motion of the gas as it falls onto the stellarsurface.<P>Once the protostar accretes sufficient material to reach a fewtenths the mass of the sun, the temperature at the center becomessufficient to induce nuclear fusion. Fusion in protostars,however, is quite different from that of main-sequencestars--that is, middle-aged stars like the sun existing in along-lived state of equilibrium. The primary reaction that powersa mature star involves the fusion of hydrogen nuclei.<P>Hydrogen is the most common chemical constituent of the universe.The big bang created this element primarily in its normalisotopic form, as an atom whose nucleus consists of a singleproton. But about two out of every 100,000 hydrogen nucleiconsist of deuterium, a nucleus of one proton and one neutron.Deuterium persists today in the interstellar gas that becomesincorporated in new stars.<P>Remarkably, this tiny impurity plays a dominant role in the lifeof protostars. The interiors of protostars are not yet hot enoughto fuse ordinary hydrogen, a reaction that occurs at about 10million kelvins. But protostars can easily attain, as a result ofthe compressive force of gravity, the temperature of one millionkelvins required to initiate the fusion of deuterium, which alsoliberates large amounts of energy. The protostellar material istoo opaque to transmit this energy by radiation. Instead the starbecomes convectively unstable: bubbles of gas heated by thenuclear fire rise up toward the surface.<P>This upward motion is balanced by the sinking of cooler gastoward the center. The same sort of convective circulation, on amuch smaller scale, occurs in the air in a radiator-heated room.But in a protostar, the circulating eddies drag down freshdeuterium that has landed on the surface. These deuterium atomsare quickly transported to the center, where they fuse togetherand release more heat. Thus, the return stroke of the convectioncycle continuously resupplies the fuel needed to maintain bothburning and convection.<P>If the protostar gains enough matter to become about twice asmassive as the sun, the convection cycle begins to operate in aslightly different manner. Palla and I recently found that a thinshell of gas in the interior region becomes transparent enough totransport heat through radiation rather than convection. Neitherrising nor sinking gas can penetrate this radiative barrier.Consequently, fusion quickly consumes all the deuterium insidethe barrier. Fresh deuterium falling onto the protostar piles upon its surface. The compressed surface layers become hotter untilthey, too, ignite the deuterium, which then burns in a shelloverlying the depleted interior. Hot bubbles rise up from thisburning shell, make their way to the surface and then sink backdown to the shell, completing the refueling cycle.<P>Despite the small concentration of deuterium nuclei, the heatreleased by their fusion has a considerable impact on theprotostar. The chief effect of the burning of deuterium is tocause the protostar to swell. Because convection efficientlyspreads the heat, deuterium burning enlarges each protostar to acharacteristic size, determined by the object's mass. A protostarof one solar mass has a radius five times that of the presentsun. A protostar of three solar masses, in which deuterium burnsin a subsurface shell, swells even more dramatically: its radiusis 10 times the solar value.<P>A typical dense core encompasses more mass than the star itultimately produces. Therefore, some mechanism must expel theextra mass and halt the accretion. Most astronomers have nowbecome convinced that a strong wind erupting at the surface ofthe protostar is responsible. The wind blows back the incominggas and eventually disperses the entire dense core.<P>The wind idea did not come from any theoretical calculation. Thephenomenon was suggested to surprised theorists by widespreadobservation of molecular gas streaming away from infrared sourcesof radiation [see "Energetic Outflows from Young Stars," byCharles J. Lada; SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN, July 1982]. The agent ofthe outflow would appear to be the protostellar wind. This wind,which has not yet been directly observed, must drive off matterand energy at a vastly greater rate than do winds emanating frommain-sequence stars. The cause of the protostellar wind is one ofthe deepest mysteries in the study of young stars.<P>Once the dense core disperses, the exposed object, now opticallyvisible, is known as a pre-main-sequence star. Like a protostar,a pre-main-sequence star is highly luminous. Once again, gravityrather than nuclear fusion accounts for the luminosity. Thepressure within the star prevents it from going into a truefree-fall collapse. The heat maintaining this pressure, however,is radiated from the stellar surface, so that the star shinesvery brightly and shrinks slowly.<P>Like protostars, pre-main-sequence stars are convectivelyunstable. The underlying physics, however, is quite different. Ingeneral, convection in a star begins whenever the temperaturedrops very rapidly from the center to the surface. In protostars,deuterium burning at the center creates the convection cycle. Butby the time a protostar evolves to the pre-main-sequence stage,it has exhausted its supply of deuterium.<P>The great luminosity of pre-main-sequence stars accounts for thesteep temperature gradient within the star. The high levels ofradiant energy given off cool the outer layers quickly, whereasthe interior region remains insulated by the overlying matter. Asthe star ages and luminosity diminishes, the region of convectiveinstability decreases. In the present sun, convection stillsurvives over the outer 30 percent of the radius. The rising andsinking eddies create the granulated texture of the solarsurface.<P>As the star becomes more compact, its internal temperaturesteadily rises and eventually reaches about 10 million kelvins.At this point, ordinary hydrogen begins to fuse into helium. Theheat released from the fusion builds up the pressure to halt thecontraction, and the star enters the main sequence. It took oursun, a typical hydrogen-burning star, about 30 million years tocontract from its large protostar radius to its present size. Theheat released from the subsequent hydrogen fusion has maintainedthis size for about five billion years.<P>The descriptions of stellar evolution I have just given areconsistent with physical theories and known nuclear processes.But theory needs to be supported by data. The data consist ofmeasurements of the properties of many stars at different stagesof their evolution. The most convenient way to express such datais to display graphically the evolution of optically visiblestars in the Hertzsprung-Russell (H-R) diagram.<P>The H-R diagram is a graph that plots stellar luminosity on thevertical axis and surface temperature on the horizontal axis.Main-sequence stars like the sun, which fuse ordinary hydrogen,lie along a diagonal curve. Theoretical calculations show thatthe luminosity and surface temperature of a hydrogen-burningstar--and thus its position on the curve--depend only on itsmass.<P>This theory agrees well with observation. Astronomers determinethe luminosity of a star by measuring its brightness (providedthat the distance to the star is also known) and deduce thesurface temperature by analyzing the star's spectrum. When onemeasures these two quantities for a given cluster of stars andplots the data on the H-R diagram, most of the stars indeed liealong the theoretical main-sequence curve.<P>Because a pre-main-sequence star is more luminous than amain-sequence one of the same mass, it will lie above themain-sequence line in the H-R diagram. The luminosity decreaseswith time because the shrinking of the star diminishes thesurface area from which the radiation can be emitted. As aresult, the star's representative point slides along a definitepath that is the same for all stars of its mass. Astronomersrefer to this path as a Hayashi track, in honor of ChushiroHayashi of Kyoto University, who first calculated the propertiesof pre-main-sequence stars in the early 1960s.<P>Observations of nearby young clusters--that is, stars with a lotof interspersed molecular gas between them--have revealed thatmany of the stars lie above the main sequence. Those that lienear Hayashi tracks corresponding to one solar mass or less areknown as T Tauri stars. Their more massive counterparts arecalled Herbig Ae and Be stars. (The latter group was named forGeorge Herbig of the University of Hawaii, the astronomer whopioneered the observational study of young stars.)<P>Although theorists are gratified that many stars lie above themain sequence, it is a more difficult matter to prove that thesestars are actually descending their appropriate Hayashi tracks.Recall that deuterium burning in protostars gives them a definiteradius for each value of mass. In 1983 I used this relation,together with the set of known Hayashi tracks, to make aprediction: once pre-main-sequence stars become opticallyvisible, they should all appear along another curve in the H-Rdiagram. From this curve, called the birthline, each stardescends along its appropriate Hayashi track to the mainsequence.<P>Observations appear to bear out the idea of the birthline. In1979 Martin Cohen and Leonard V. Kuhi of Berkeley published asystematic study of hundreds of T Tauri stars. In 1984 UlrichFinkenzeller of the Landessternwarte Konigstuhle (the stateobservatory) in Heidelberg and Reinhard Mundt of the Max PlanckInstitute for Astronomy presented a similar survey for the rarerHerbig Ae and Be stars. The measured luminosities and surfacetemperatures of these stars lie on or below a well-definedboundary in the H-R diagram. The boundary coincides well with thetheoretical birthline. Furthermore, those visible stars at thecenter of molecular gas outflows also lie along the birthline.Their location in the diagram confirms the fact that the outflowphase is associated with the beginning of pre-main-sequencecontraction.<P>Palla and I have shown that the birthline must intersect the mainsequence at some point. We calculated that the two curves meet ata position corresponding to a stellar mass of eight solar masses.In physical terms, the finding means that any star more massivethan this critical value actually begins to fuse ordinaryhydrogen while its parent dense core is still collapsing onto itssurface. These massive stars should therefore never exhibit avisible pre-main-sequence phase. So far this prediction alsoseems to be in accord with existing observations.<P>Despite this encouraging success of the theory, many of the knownproperties of young stars are still not entirely understood. Mostyoung stars, for example, are irregular variables: theirluminosities fluctuate over periods ranging from hours to months.The spectra of many T Tauri stars, the group that has beenparticularly well monitored, show far more infrared andultraviolet radiation than do main-sequence stars of similarmass. Yet Frederick Walter of the State University of New York atStony Brook has found that other T Tauri stars, with very similarmasses and ages, exhibit almost no excess emission. Finally,there is much evidence for strong stellar winds. These windscould well be the remnants of the much more powerful onesbelieved to end the protostar phase.<P>The models describing the birth of stars indicate an importantby-product: the circumstellar disk. Investigators believe suchdisks provide the raw materials from which planetary systems form[see "Worlds around Other Stars," by David C. Black; SCIENTIFICAMERICAN, January]. A disk forms because not all the materialcollapsing inside a dense core directly joins the protostar.Whatever process formed the dense core almost certainly impartedsome degree of rotation as the collapse began. Within therotating core, the gas with the highest angular momentum liesfarthest from the polar axis. As the region of collapse spreadsoutward, it engulfs the more distant gas. This material begins tofall inward but misses the protostar. The gas goes into orbitaround the protostar, assuming the form of a circumstellar disk.<P>The manner in which the direction of the falling gas graduallyshifts from the protostar to the disk was first worked outmathematically in 1976 by Roger Ulrich of the University ofCalifornia at Los Angeles and, independently, in 1981 by PatrickCassen and Anne Moosman of the National Aeronautics and SpaceAdministration Ames Research Center. Cassen and Moosman alsofirst investigated the theoretical physical properties of disks,such as their sizes and surface densities. Great interestcurrently exists in extending their work to the older diskssurrounding pre-main-sequence stars. This focus has arisen notonly because such research promises to illuminate how planetsform but also because recent observational evidence indicates theexistence of disks.<P>One kind of evidence consists of actual images that showcircumstellar matter around young stars. In 1987, for example,Steven Beckwith of Cornell University and Anneila Sargent of theCalifornia Institute of Technology detected extended emissionfrom carbon monoxide gas surrounding the T Tauri star HL Tau.They attributed this emission to a low-mass disk with a diameterof several light-weeks.<P>Another kind of evidence for disks is more indirect and hencemore controversial. The evidence is actually a deduction:theorists assert that certain observed properties of T Tauristars can best be explained by the presence of disks. Followingthe original suggestion in 1974 by Donald Lynden-Bell and JamesPringle of the University of Cambridge, investigators havecommonly attributed both the infrared and ultraviolet excesses ofthese stars to luminous disks that are continuously transportingmass onto their host stars.<P>Material must somehow lose angular momentum if it is to spiralonto the star. Lynden-Bell and Pringle assumed that anunspecified friction exists throughout the disk. As two adjacentrings of gas rub against each other, the friction would cause theinner, more rapidly rotating ring to slow down and contract, justas the orbit of a satellite above the earth slowly decays becauseof atmospheric drag.<P>According to this picture, the excess infrared emissionrepresents the heat generated by the friction. The ultravioletradiation, on the other hand, is supposed to arise from a narrow,hot region between the disk and the star, in which an evenstronger frictional force brakes the orbiting gas. Using modelsof this kind, workers have successfully matched many spectralfeatures of T Tauri stars. They are Lee W. Hartmann and ScottKenyon of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, GiborBasri of Berkeley and Claude Bertout of the University of Paris.<P>Yet despite the best efforts of theorists over many years, noplausible explanation exists for the internal friction that thesemodels posit. Calculations show, for example, that ordinarymolecular viscosity is far too small to cause appreciablespiraling of the gas onto the central star.<P>In my opinion, the failure to explain the source of the frictionimplies that the underlying model is inadequate. A betterapproach may be to drop the assumption of internal frictionaltogether. Theorists should look again at the structure of disksthat can actually form during the collapse of rotating densecores. During the past several years, my students and I haveundertaken just such an investigation. Thus far the models ofdisk formation we have obtained are different from the frictionalones.<P>All current observations of disks, both direct and indirect,indicate masses that are merely a fraction of the central star'smass, perhaps a few percent or less. Theorists find this factdisturbing and challenging. For if the accumulation of collapsingmaterial with excess rotation builds up disks, why should theprocess stop so soon after the star itself was formed? If indeedprotostellar winds halt the collapse phase, do the small diskmasses indicate a causal link between disk formation and thetriggering of these energetic outflows?<P>Such questions still have no answers. But these unsolved problemsshould be viewed as gaps in a chain whose main links have alreadybeen forged, through an extraordinary interplay of experimentaland theoretical work. We can close these gaps and complete thestory of young stars if we can but read the clues nature hasgiven. And those clues are right over our heads, winking in theclear night sky.<P>The Author<P>STEVEN W.

Astronomical searches are closing in on planetsthat may orbit some nearby stars.</H3>by David C. Black</CENTER><P>Do planets like our own orbit around other stars? The answerlinks intimately with the question of whether life exists beyondthe earth. The most promising place for life to arise is on thesurface of a planet, which functions as a "cosmic petri dish"where life can begin and be nurtured as it evolves to morecomplex states. A search for other planetary systems shouldtherefore be a major component of any effort to understand theprospects for extraterrestrial life. Moreover, the results fromsuch a search are essential for understanding the origin of theearth and the surrounding solar system.<P>Over many years, astronomers have built up a detailed picture ofthe origin of the sun and its retinue of planets. Unfortunately(but until now inseparably), the specific elements of thatpicture are based entirely on features found in a singleplanetary system--our own. Finding statistically significantevidence regarding the plentitude and nature of other planetarysystems undoubtedly would provide many unexpected details aboutthe process by which stars and planets are born.<P>Prospects for such a discovery have recently grown brighter. Anumber of researchers have possibly detected planetary companionscircling other stars, although all the sightings remain highlytentative. A new generation of detectors and telescopes, alongwith some innovative detection techniques, should improve thesituation.<P>The current view of the origin of the solar system has its rootsin concepts developed by Immanuel Kant and Pierre Simon Laplacelate in the 18th century. They proposed a nebular hypothesis ofthe solar system's origin, wherein the sun and planets condensedout of a large, lumpy cloud. Over the decades, the nebularhypothesis has been greatly refined and modified, but the basicconcept remains. It shapes current thinking on how and whereplanets form and, therefore, how one might go about searching forthem.<P>Some notable regularities and variations in the structure of thesolar system hint at its nebular origin. The planets all orbit innearly the same plane: the orbits of all planets except Mercuryand Pluto lie within three degrees of the ecliptic, the plane ofthe earth's orbit. The mean orbital plane of the planets alsosits within six degrees of the equatorial plane of the sun. Theseproperties suggest that the planets formed from a common disklikestructure, known as the solar nebula.<P>If viewed from above the earth's North Pole, the planets allrevolve about the sun counterclockwise, the same direction inwhich the sun rotates on its axis. The planets also travel innearly circular orbits (Mercury and Pluto again are mildexceptions). Such orderly movements fit with the notion that theancestral disk was dynamically ordered, not chaotic or irregular,and that motions within the disk were dominated by rotation aboutthe sun.<P>Another noteworthy pattern in the solar system is that planetarycomposition varies according to distance from the sun. Thegaseous outer planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune)primarily contain relatively light, volatile elements. This isparticularly true for Jupiter, whose composition, being dominatedby hydrogen and helium, is similar to that of the sun. The otherouter planets contain less hydrogen but are rich in hydrogencompounds, such as ammonia.<P>In contrast, the inner, or terrestrial, planets (Mercury, Venus,Earth and Mars) consist mostly of heavier elements, such assilicon and iron, which cosmically are far less abundant thanhydrogen. If enough light elements were added to the earth tomake its composition match that of the sun, its mass would becomparable to Jupiter's. It seems that the outer planets are moremassive because they were able to hold on to more light, volatileelements and compounds in the solar nebula when the planetsformed.<P>The generally accepted explanation for this difference is thatthe inner part of the solar nebula was sufficiently hot thatvolatile elements existed only in gaseous form. Critical earlystages of planet formation are most likely controlled by theaccumulation of solid material into progressively larger objects.Water is cosmically abundant and condenses at high temperaturescompared with the average nebular temperatures, so it probablyplayed an important role in planetary formation. Regions of thenebula where the temperature was 170 kelvins or lower (thecondensation point for water ice) should have contained anadequate supply of solid material for giant planets to form.<P>Therefore, one might reasonably assume that the largest planetsalways form in the cool, outer regions of a circumstellar disk.This hypothesis helps to define where, relative to the centralstar, astronomers should look for giant extrasolar planets.<P>Circumstellar disks seem to be a natural outgrowth of the mannerin which stars are born. Stellar formation begins with thegravitational collapse of dense, cool cores of material withinclouds of molecular gas and dust. As the core shrinks, randommotions cancel out, and the core's overall rotation creates aflattened gaseous disk. Evidence suggests that such disks arehighly stiff, or dissipative, causing angular momentum totransfer outward in the disk and mass to flow inward into theinfant star.<P>Planets coalesce during the brief interval--no more than a fewmillion years--between when the disk forms and when itdisappears, either swallowed or expelled by the newborn star.Various evidence hints that the planets did not simply collapseout of the solar nebula. For instance, the rotational axes of theplanets are not generally perpendicular to the ecliptic, whichsuggests that the planets grew through a complicated, chaoticprocess involving the accretion of smaller units. The implicationis that a fundamental difference exists between stars and planetsin the way that they form, an important distinction to keep inmind when searching for planetary systems.<P>If current understanding of stellar birth is broadly correct,then disks should be found in association with many young stars.Some fraction of these disks may then pass through evolutionarystages similar to those inferred to have occurred in the youngsolar system. The diffuse, low temperature and often heavilyobscured nature of disks around forming stars make them difficultto study visually, and so astronomers have concentrated onobservations made at radio or infrared frequencies. These longerwavelengths of electromagnetic radiation can penetrate thickclouds of dust far more effectively than visible light.<P>The first convincing indication that disk structures do indeedsurround young stars was the discovery that these objects aresources of energetic jets or winds of gas and dust. The outflowspresumably represent material ejected from an evolving disk, butthey provide only circumstantial evidence of disks around formingstars.<P>More recent and direct studies have bolstered this evidence. Whendust particles absorb light from a star, they grow hot andreradiate the light as less energetic infrared radiation. Thewavelength of the infrared rays depends on the size of theparticles. A number of young stellar objects (most notably theobjects known as HL Tauri, R Monoceros and L1551/IRS 5) emitabnormally large amounts of infrared radiation, indicating thepresence of dust particles. Infrared observations of the aboveobjects, both from earthbound telescopes and from the NationalAeronautics and Space Administration's Infrared AstronomySatellite (IRAS), imply that these dust particles are one to afew tens of microns across. Small as the particles may seem, theyare significantly larger than those that exist in interstellarclouds, hinting that the building-up process that leads toplanets may have begun around these stars. Some researchers arguethat the dust is produced by collisions between cometlikebodies--the precursors of planets, perhaps--revolving aroundthese stars.<P>A particularly powerful observation technique, known as speckleinterferometry, freezes out blurring from the earth's atmosphereby using very short exposures from which the undistorted image ismathematically reconstructed. Even this technique cannot producea clear picture of the dust clouds surrounding young stars, butit does permit astronomers to determine that the shape and sizeof the clouds is consistent with those expected for a disk.Images from IRAS confirmed that many stars, including older starssuch as Vega and Beta Pictoris, are surrounded by disklike dustystructures. Observations of radio emission indicate the presenceof gas in the disks, particularly carbon monoxide, which radiatesprominently at radio wavelengths of a few millimeters.<P>Additional evidence for condensing disks around other stars comesfrom infrared observations of young stars known as T Tauri stars.As they age, these stars radiate less at short infraredwavelengths, as if the hottest particles--those closest to thestar--are being swept up or vaporized.<P>Efforts to search for other planetary systems employ eitherdirect or indirect methods. Direct methods involve detectingreflected light or infrared radiation from the planetsthemselves. The primary difficulty with this approach is thatemission from a planet tends to be drowned out by the vastlybrighter emission of its nearby parent star.<P>Indirect methods involve scrutinizing a star for signs that it isresponding to the gravitational tug of an orbiting planet. As theplanet moves from one side of the star to the other, it pulls thestar back and forth. This pull manifests itself as a slightwobble superposed on the star's overall motion across the sky. Itcan also be detected as a slight, periodic change in the star'svelocity with respect to the earth.<P>Any motion toward or away from the earth causes the star's lightto be slightly compressed or stretched. When light is compressed,it becomes slightly bluer; when stretched, it becomes slightlyredder, a phenomenon known as the Doppler effect. Carefulmeasurement of absorption lines in a star's spectrum can inprinciple reveal any periodic changes in its motion.<P>Indirect searches can be facilitated by some simplifyingassumptions. Many researchers have guessed that giant planetsaround other stars will have orbital periods similar toJupiter's, about one decade. Fixing the orbital period allows oneto determine the size of the orbit as a function of stellar massand thus to calculate an expected angular or velocityperturbation (given the distance to the star and assuming acertain mass for the planet).<P>An alternative possibility, which I think is more logical, isthat giant planets form at distances from their stars where thetemperature is at or below the condensation point of water. Inthis case, the star's luminosity determines the size of the orbitfor giant planets. One can then proceed as before to determinehow much the planet is likely to affect the star's velocity andapparent path [see table on this page].<P>The size of the angular disturbance, or wobble, grows withincreasing distance between planet and star but shrinks withincreasing stellar mass. If planetary systems form in such amanner that giant planets always tend to have more or lesssimilar orbital periods, then faint low-mass stars should be moststrongly perturbed by planets, because giant planets would orbitfar from these stars relative to the stars' mass. If, however,giant planets normally form at distances where temperatures arebelow the condensation point of water, the opposite should betrue because giant planets would orbit far from bright, massivestars relative to the stars' mass. (In either case, low-massstars experience the largest velocity perturbation.)<P>If temperature is the determining factor, then typical orbitalperiods of giant planets may be much shorter than those commonlyexpected. The average star is cooler and much less luminous thanthe sun, so giant planets could orbit in relatively close, fastorbits. For a typical nearby star with a mass of about 0.3 solarmass, the orbital period for a giant planet would be less thanone year, compared with Jupiter's orbital period of about 12years.<P>Even with the use of simplifying assumptions, detecting otherplanetary systems remains an extremely difficult task. Currenttelescopes and instruments operate at the limits of theircapabilities when they scan for stellar companions having massescomparable to or less than the mass of Jupiter. As a result, thehistory of planetary searches is full of false leads and phantomdiscoveries.<P>Perhaps the best-known star to those who search for otherplanetary systems is the faint, cool, low-mass (M-type) starknown as Barnard's star, named after the American astronomer E.E. Barnard, who noticed its unusual attributes in 1916. Barnard'sstar has the highest-known apparent motion across the sky; it isalso, after the Centauri triple-star system, the second closeststar system to ours, lying only six light-years away.<P>Peter van de Kamp, working at the Sproul Observatory, realized in1937 that these two properties make Barnard's star ideal forindirect searches because any apparent wobble would be relativelylarge and well defined. Van de Kamp examined positional data onBarnard's star dating back to 1916 and began collecting his owndata using the telescope at Sproul.<P>In the 1960s van de Kamp concluded that Barnard's star had twoJupiter-mass companions, one completing an orbit every 12 years,the other every 24 years. Yet studies during the past decade byGeorge D. Gatewood of Allegheny Observatory in Pittsburgh and,independently, by Robert S. Harrington of the U.S. NavalObservatory find that the motion of Barnard's star isinconsistent with the existence of van de Kamp's planets. Indeed,the observations by these two researchers exclude the possibilitythat Barnard's star has any companion much in excess of Jupiter'smass, although lower-mass companions could still be present.<P>Another widely reported substellar object was the companion tothe nearby star Van Biesbroeck 8, dubbed VB8-b, which wasindependently discovered in 1984 by Harrington and by DonaldMcCarthy and co-workers at the University of Arizona. Thissighting seemed especially persuasive because two differenttechniques were used to find the object: Harrington usedastrometric observations to infer a kink in the motion of VB8-b,and McCarthy observed what appeared to be a faint object close toit by means of infrared speckle interferometry techniques.<P>After considerable debate a consensus emerged that VB8-b was anintermediate-class object having about one twentieth the mass ofthe sun, or about 50 times that of Jupiter. Such an object, knownas a brown dwarf, would be too small to trigger the nuclearreactions that power stars, and so it would be nearly impossibleto observe at visible wavelengths. A few years after thediscovery of VB8-b, several research teams undertook moresensitive observations to confirm and characterize better itsproperties. Despite considerable effort, they found no trace ofthe much publicized object. Astronomers now generally think thatVB8-b does not exist, at least not as described by the earlyobservations.<P>An extremely precise technique for detecting tiny velocityperturbations has been developed recently by Bruce T. E. Campbellof the University of Victoria and his co-workers. This techniqueinvolves comparing the spectrum of stars with a very highresolution reference spectrum from an unlikely and rather nastycompound, hydrogen fluoride. In principle, Campbell's instrumentshows far smaller Doppler shifts, and hence far slighter velocitydisturbances, than previously could be detected.<P>Campbell and his colleagues at the Canada-France-Hawaii telescopelocated on Mauna Kea have measured the radial velocities of 15stars six times a year with a stated accuracy of about 10 metersper second. (This accuracy is remarkable given that convectivecurrents at the surfaces of sunlike stars typically move on theorder of 1,000 meters per second.) Campbell's group has stoppedshort of overtly claiming to have discovered another planetarysystem, but they have found signs of long-term accelerations--apotential indicator of the presence of planets--in nearly half ofthe stars studied.<P>The most intriguing object studied by Campbell's group is thestar Gamma Cephei, an old, orange subgiant star (class III-IV,spectral type K1) whose mass is estimated to be slightly greaterthan that of the sun. Spectral measurements collected since 1981led Campbell to conclude that Gamma Cephei experiences a cyclicvelocity variation having an amplitude of 25 meters per secondand a period of 2.6 years. This period, combined with the star'sestimated mass, implies that the companion orbits roughly 300million kilometers from Gamma Cephei, or about twice the earth'sdistance from the sun. To produce the observed velocityperturbation, the companion must have at least 1.5 times the massof Jupiter.<P>It would be surprising to find a giant planet orbiting so closeto a relatively luminous star, but surprises are the brood stockof scientific inquiry. A more troubling aspect of Campbell'sfinding is that the more recent and accurate data from the studyof Gamma Cephei show significant deviations from the motions thatwould be expected as the putative planet orbits its star. Notuntil Gamma Cephei has been observed through several 2.6-year"orbits" will the data appear truly convincing. Nevertheless,this work and similar, equally sensitive and accurate effortsbeing conducted at the University of Arizona by Robert S.McMillan and co-workers hold great potential.<P>David Latham and his collaborators at the Harvard-SmithsonianCenter for Astrophysics, using less accurate but moreconventional velocity measurement techniques, have collected someof the strongest evidence yet for the existence of a substellarcompanion. Latham's group observed the solar-type star HD114762for more than 12 years and found that it undergoes periodicvelocity variations. In this case, measurements made at Europeanobservatories have confirmed the data.<P>Latham and his colleagues find a consistent velocity variationhaving a period of about 84 days and an amplitude of about 550meters per second. Assuming the star has the same mass as the sun(which is consistent with its temperature and luminosity), theperceived period implies that a companion orbits at a meandistance of about 60 million kilometers, similar to the distanceof Mercury from the sun. The lower limit to the mass of thecompanion is 11 times the mass of Jupiter. Recent, more accurateobservations by W. D. Cochran and co-workers at the University ofTexas at Austin confirm the period and imply that the orbit iseccentric. Their work also suggests that the companion's mass issignificantly greater than previously estimated.<P>Many researchers understandably tend to view this companion as atrue extrasolar planet, but I have doubts. The companion is farmore massive than any planet in the solar system. It mayrepresent not a planet but the very low mass end of thepopulation of starlike objects, and HD114762 may be an extremetype of binary star. Although the process by which binary starsform is not well understood, it seems unlikely that the processdepends on whether the objects are large enough to ignite fusionreactions in their cores. There is no reason to suppose thatnature would not make binary systems in which one member is astar and the other a brown dwarf.<P>Objects more than 10 or 20 times the mass of Jupiter probablyform like stars, not like planets--that is, they condensedirectly from a gas cloud rather than from the disk around astar. In my view, the different modes of formation are manifestedin the fact that planetary systems (at least the one known)contain a multitude of bodies, whereas stars are predominantlydouble or triple systems. The reason for the cutoff betweenplanets and brown dwarfs is mysterious but seems to be real. Thisinformation leads to an important principle of search efforts forplanetary systems: the object of these searches is to discoverplanetary systems, not brown dwarfs. Systems composed of a starand a single substellar companion are not planetary systems.<P>Nevertheless, studies of brown dwarfs may elucidate how stars andplanets form. Direct searches currently lack the sensitivity todetect Jupiter-size or smaller planets around other stars, butthey can provide significant information about larger substellarcompanions. Most of these searches are conducted in the infraredpart of the spectrum.<P>Studies using sophisticated new infrared array detector systemshave revealed faint, cool companions around a small number ofstars. Ben Zuckerman and Eric E. Becklin of the University ofCalifornia at Los Angeles, among others, have detected dwarfcompanions by looking for excess infrared radiation that cannotbe explained by a normal star's emission. All the objects foundso far can be modeled as brown dwarfs weighing several tens ofJupiter masses. Sightings of brown dwarfs remain highlyuncertain, however.<P>Various groups, such as McCarthy and his co-workers at Arizonaand Geoffrey Marcy and colleagues at San Francisco StateUniversity, are compiling statistics on the abundance of browndwarfs. The Arizona group has examined 27 nearby M-type, reddwarf stars. The researchers used speckle interferometry atinfrared wavelengths of 1.6 and 2.2 microns (known as the H and Kbands) to search for companions too dim to be detected at visiblewavelengths.<P>The number of stars in the infrared survey grew greater withincreasing faintness (larger magnitudes denote fainter stars) upto a K-band magnitude of about 10.0, at which point the numbersfell off abruptly. The Arizona group found no objects with K-bandmagnitudes between +10.0 and +11.5. A brightness of +11.5 (thelimit of the survey) corresponds to the expected infraredluminosity of a brown dwarf 70 to 80 times the mass of Jupiterand several billion years old, as seen from a distance of fiveparsecs (16 light-years). The apparent absence of such objectssuggests that no continuous population of objects extends all theway from stars to planets.<P>This view was confirmed by Marcy and K. Benitz, a student at SanFrancisco State, who recently surveyed 70 low-mass stars usingradial velocity techniques precise to 230 meters per second. Themeasurements should have revealed any substellar companions downto a mass of about seven Jupiter masses, so long as thecompanions' orbital periods were less than four years. The surveyuncovered six hitherto unknown stellar companions to the starsstudied but gave no evidence for the presence of substellarcompanions. Indeed, the radial velocity survey, combined withresults from long-term astrometric studies of stellar positions,indicates that less than 2 percent of all stars have substellarcompanions whose mass is greater than 10 times that of Jupiter.<P>In some instances, the absence of a discovery can itself be animportant discovery. I have long felt that such is the case withsubstellar objects. As a rule, lightweight stars are more commonthan massive ones. Extrapolating downward, many theoristsexpected that brown dwarfs would be sprinkled liberallythroughout the galaxy, like dust. The paucity of substellarcompanions is nature's way of telling us that it is time torethink some of the physics associated with the formation ofextremely low mass stars.<P>It is clear that current facilities are inadequate to conduct acomprehensive search for other planetary systems. The detailedobservations necessary to conduct this project in ascientifically adequate manner will require a new set of advancedinstruments. In general, dedicated searches should be conductedwith sufficient accuracy and sensitivity that a null resultunambiguously advances the understanding of planetary-systemformation. This principle should help with assessing facilitiesthat might be used to search for other planetary systems. Manypromising design concepts have already emerged, some groundbased, others based in space.<P>Radial velocity (velocity perturbation) measurements arerelatively impervious to the blurring caused by the earth'sturbulent atmosphere. Larger, dedicated telescopes permit acareful survey of tens to hundreds of stars for the presence ofplanetary companions. Telescopes now in operation at theUniversity of Arizona and the University of Texas could serve asprototypes for the next generation of radial velocity systems.<P>Another class of ground-based systems would use very largeaperture (seven to 10 meters) telescopes incorporating activeoptics that physically manipulate the mirror to compensate foratmospheric distortion. These instruments, which would be used tosearch for other planetary systems directly at infraredwavelengths, could revolutionize understanding of the structureand evolution of the disks that surround young stars.<P>Most of the techniques for planetary searches would function bestin space. NASA's Space Infrared Telescope Facility, currentlyplanned for launch in the late 1990s, will provide infraredobservations of circumstellar disks and newborn planetary systemsthat will greatly improve on the images returned by IRAS in 1983.<P>Astrometry--the ultraprecise measurement of stellarposition--will gain greatly by being conducted in space. The goalis to be able to measure stellar angular deflections with anaccuracy of ten millionths of an arc second--the angular extentof a dime on the moon as viewed from the earth! Such accuracywould permit the detection of companions as small as 10 earthmasses around any star within 10 parsecs (30 light-years) of thesun.<P>Telescopes with precisely ground mirrors and masks to blot outthe bright light of a central star might be able to capturedirect visible-light images of planets around other stars. Anexciting possibility is that both astrometry and imaging could bedone by a single telescope. A study of the feasibility ofbuilding such a combined instrument is now under way at the JetPropulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif.<P>The next generation of planetary search instruments undoubtedlywill be optical interferometers, networks of telescopes placedfar apart that combine their images to create, in effect, asingle enormous telescope. Such devices could offer thousands oftimes the resolving power of existing instruments. The moon wouldbe an ideal location for an optical interferometer and many otherastronomical instruments. It is conceivable that the lunar farside will be the site of a suite of scientific facilities thatwill search not only for other planetary systems but also forsignals from intelligent life elsewhere in the universe [see"Observatories on the Moon," by Jack O. Burns, Nebojsa Duric, G.Jeffrey Taylor and Stewart W. Johnson; SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN, March1990].<P>Throughout the ages, humans have wondered about the possibleexistence of worlds other than their own. The search for otherplanetary systems has been going on in earnest for more than halfa century, during which time astronomers have edged tantalizinglyclose to their goal. An explosion of interest in this field ofresearch, along with the development of more accurateinstruments, promises that the next few decades will beespecially exciting. The first positive sighting of a planetarysystem other than our own will be a landmark, completing therevolution in thought begun some 450 years ago by NicolausCopernicus.<P>The Author<P>DAVID C. BLACK has done extensive research in theoreticalastrophysics and planetary science, focusing on studies of starand planetary system formation. Black received his Ph.D. inphysics from the University of Minnesota.

<P>This spring
was a frenzied tornado season in the U.S. In Mayalone, an estimated
484 tornadoes killed some 16 people and ravaged millions of dollars of
property. Day after day, forecasts of severe storms sent me and my
colleagues rushing from the National Severe Storms Laboratory (NSSL) in
Norman, Okla., to Texas or Kansas, returning sometimes at three in the
morning. After the day's briefing at 9 A.M., we might set off
again, fatigued but hoping once more to collect precious data on
the birth of tornadoes.
<P>On Tuesday, May 16, the weather maps revealed
the threat of afternoon tornadoes in Kansas. By 5 P.M. a menacing
thunderstorm had erupted, fed by warm, moist southerly winds that rose
and rotated in an updraft. The storm was a highly organized "supercell,"
an ideal tornado breeding ground. As William Gargan, a graduate student
at the University of Oklahoma, and I approached from the southeast in
our instrumented car, called Probe 1, we glimpsed the 10-mile-high top
of the monstrous storm,60 miles away. The thunderstorm was sweeping
east-northeast at 30 miles per hour, a quite typical motion in the
Great Plains.
<P>As we closed to within 10 miles along Route 50, we saw
for the first time the long, dark cloud base. Within a few miles
we spotted a twister, shaped like an elephant's trunk, hanging from the
rear of the main cloud tower, near Garden City. In trying to maneuver
closer on minor paved roads, we lost sight of the twister but spied it
again four miles to our northwest. It was thin and trailed horizontally
behind its parent cloud before bending abruptly toward the ground at a
right angle. Clearly, it was being pushed away from the cloud by the
cold air flowing down from the storm, and nearing the end of its
life.
<P><B><A NAME="Supercells">Supercells</A></B>
<P>Most tornadoes
have damage paths 150 feet wide, move at about 30 miles per hour and
last only a few minutes. Extremely destructive ones may be over a mile
wide, travel at 60 miles per hour and maybe on the ground for more
than an hour. Tornadoes in the Northern Hemisphere, such as the
devastating ones that occur in the U.S., northeastern India and
Bangladesh, nearly always rotate counterclockwise when viewed from
above. Southern Hemisphere tornadoes, such as those that form in
Australia, tend to rotate clockwise. These directions are called
cyclonic.
<P>In 1949 Edward M. Brooks of St. Louis University
discovered, by examining how air pressure changes at weather stations
near tornadoes, that the twisters usually form within larger masses
of rotating air known as mesocyclones. In 1953 a mesocyclone appeared on
a radar screen at Urbana, Ill., as a hook-shaped appendage on the
southwest side of a storm's radar echo. Because rain reflects the
microwaves emitted by radar, the hook shape indicated that the rain was
being drawn into a cyclonically rotating curtain. And in 1957 T.
Theodore Fujita of the University of Chicago examined photographs and
movies taken by local residents of the base and sides of a North Dakota
tornadic storm and found that the entire cloud tower was
rotating cyclonically.
<P>In the 1960s Keith A. Browning, a British
meteorologist visiting the NSSL's precursor, the National Severe Storms
Project, pieced together from radar data a remarkably accurate picture
of tornadic storms. He realized that most tornadoes are spawned inside
particularly large and vicious storms that he dubbed supercells. These
powerful systems develop in very unstable environments in which the
winds vary markedly with height and cool, dry air lies atop warm, moist
air about a mile deep over the earth's surface. A thin stable layer
separates the two air masses, bottling up the instability.
<P>This lid
can be pried open if the low-level air is warmed by the sun or if a
weather system invades. Fronts, jet streams and upper-level
disturbances, common visitors to the Great Plains during tornado
season, all may force low-level air upward. Because air pressure falls
with height, the rising parcels of air expand and cool. At suocient
height they become cold enough that their water vapor starts to
condense into misty droplets, forming a flat cloud base.
<P>In
condensing, the vapor releases latent heat, warming the air parcels.
They reach a level at which they become warmer than their environment
and rise freely to great heights at speeds up to 150 miles per hour,
forming a towering thunderhead. Shearing winds tilt the updraft to the
northeast.
<P>As they ascend, cloud droplets coalesce into raindrops.
The buoyancy of the air parcels is partly offset by the weight of their
own water and ice. The parcels lose momentum in the stratosphere, sink
down to about eight miles and flow out sideways, forming the storm's
"anvil." Rain falling out of the tilted updraft evaporates in dry,
mid-level air on the northeast side of the supercell, causing this air
to cool and sink to the earth. With time the rain and cool downdraft
are pulled around the updraft by the storm's rotation. The cool air has
higher relative humidity than the warm air and if forced upward
becomes cloudy at lesser heights. Thus, when some of this air is
sucked into the updraft, a lowered wall cloud forms.
<P>In contrast with
most thunderstorms, which contain several updrafts and downdrafts that
interfere with one another, supercells contain one or two cells, each
with its own coexisting downdraft and broad rotating updraft. The high
level of organization allows a supercell to live a long time in an
almost steady and intense state that is conducive to tornado
formation. A region of updraft one to three miles in radius may begin
to rotate with wind speeds of 50 miles per hour or more, forming
a mesocyclone. The storm may then develop low-level rotation and even a
tornado-usually to the southwest side of the updraft and close to an
adjacent downdraft, while the mesocyclone is mature or
decaying.
<P>Ultimately, the mesocyclone dies in a shroud of rain as
its updraft is cut off near the earth's surface by very cold air flowing
out of the heart of the downdraft. In persistent supercells, a new
mesocyclone may have already formed a few miles southeast of the dying
one, along the gust front-the boundary between the warm and cool air. A
new tornado may develop rapidly.
<P><B><A NAME="Tornado">Tornado
Chasing</A></B>
<P>To pin down when and where a twister is most likely
to appear, the NSSL conducted a Tornado Intercept Project from 1972 to 1986.
The intercept teams initially acquired film footage for measuring
extreme wind speeds and provided "ground truth" for radar observations.
But other benefits ensued. The chasers observed that tornadoes often
develop in parts of a storm that are free of rain and lightning,
eliminating theories that relied on these stimuli to trigger tornadoes.
And in 1975 a rare anticyclonic tornado was recorded. Its rotation,
being opposite to that of the earth, was not simply an amplification of
the planet's spin.
<P>During the past two springs, the NSSL has been
hosting another project, the Verification of the Origins of Rotation in
Tornadoes experiment (VORTEX). Measurements are being made in and
near supercells by an armada of vehicles. One of these vans is
piloted by the field coordinator, Erik N. Rasmussen of the NSSL,
who works with meteorologists at headquarters in Norman to choose
a target storm and coordinate the entire data collection. Five vans are
equipped to obtain upper-air balloon soundings in and near storms, and
12 others have weather stations mounted on their roofs. These
instruments are supported 10 feet above the ground,well above the
vehicles' slip stream, with the data being stored and displayed on
laptop computers inside.
<P>One of these 12 cars aims to obtain film
footage of tornadoes for analysis; two others deploy nine Turtles.
Named thus because they resemble sea turtles in shape, Turtles are
40-pound instrument packages that are designed to withstand a tornado.
They have well-shielded sensors to measure temperature and pressure and
are placed on the ground ahead of tornadoes, at
100-yard intervals.
<P>The remaining nine vans are called Probes; their
sole mission is to collect weather data in specified regions of the
storm. Probe 1's mission is to measure temperature gradients close to
and north of the tornado or mesocyclone, a region where large
hail frequently falls. Twice this season softball-size hail has smashed
Probe 1's windshield.
<P>That Tuesday in Kansas, as the twister died,
we raced eastward to stay abreast of the storm and find a new
mesocyclone. As we zigzagged in rain along the gravel roads, we
encountered two rows of up to eight power poles that were lying in the
fields, snapped off two feet above the ground. There must have been a
strong tornado hidden in the rain to our northeast. (The next day I
read in the newspaper that 150 poles had been downed.)
<P>About 30 miles
further east, we spotted a wall cloud, a rotating, pedestal-like
lowering, a few miles across, of the main cloud base. A narrow tornado
appeared, not out of the dark wall clouds as usual but from an
adjacent higher cloud base. This vortex touched down briefly, raising
debris, but lived out its few minutes of existence mainly as a funnel
cloud aloft, without visible signs of contact with the ground.
<P>A new
wall cloud, which became ominously large and low, developed to the
northeast. That, however, failed to produce a tornado. Near Jetmore, a
fresh storm developed to the south of the one we were following. We
went north to confirm that this older storm was indeed losing its
tornado potential, then retraced our pat hand dropped south to the new
one.
<P><B><A NAME="Signature">Signature of a Vortex</A></B>
<P>In
addition to the aforementioned armada, VORTEX also uses two airplanes
flying around a storm, as well as three more vehicles.All of these
deploy Doppler radar, instruments that yield vital information about
the airflow in tornadic storms. The newest, mobile Doppler radar, built
this year by Joshua Wurman and Jerry M. Straka of the University of
Oklahoma, has already yielded unprecedented details of tornadoes. 
<P>Doppler weather radars measure wind speeds from afar by
emitting pulses of microwave radiation and catching their reflections
off a group of raindrops or ice particles. If the drops are moving toward
the radar, the reflected pulse has a shorter wavelength that betrays
this component of the drops' velocity. (State troopers use similar
instruments to catch speeding cars.)
<P>The first Doppler measurements
in 1971 confirmed that the winds within a "hook" are indeed rotating,
at speeds of about 50 miles per hour. This circulation, first apparent
at a height of about three miles, is followed by rotation at much lower
levels, preceding the development of any intense tornado. In 1973 a
small anomaly on the Doppler velocity map of a tornadic storm at
Union city, Okla., turned out to coincide in time and space with
a violent tornado. The radar could not "see" or resolve the
tornado directly but showed high winds changing direction abruptly
across the twister and its precursor in the clouds. This
vortex signature typically forms at around 9,000 feet 10 to 20
minutes before touchdown. It may extend upward as well as
downward, occasionally reaching seven miles high for large
tornadoes.
<P>Although the vortex signature can be used to warn the
public to seek shelter in a basement or an interior closet, it can
be observed only at quite close range, generally 60 miles or less.At
longer ranges of up to 150 miles, tornado warnings can be issued on the
basis of Doppler radar detection of the parent mesocyclone. Federal
agencies are currently installing a network of sophisticated Doppler
radars across the country to improve warning capabilities.
<P>In 1991,
using a portable Doppler radar near a tumultuous tornado at Red Rock,
Okla., Howard B. Bluestein of Oklahoma University measured wind speeds
of up to 280 miles per hour. Although high,these speeds are a far cry
from the 500 miles per hour postulated 40 years ago to explain freak
happenings such as pieces of straw stuck in trees. (A more likely
explanation for this phenomenon is that the wind forces apart the wood
grains, which then snap shut, trapping the straw.)
<P>Individual Doppler
radar suoces for local warnings, but a second Doppler device that is
about 25 to 35 miles away and views astorm from a significantly
different angle supplies a far more complete picture for research. Such
a dual-Doppler system, usedby the NSSL and others since 1974, measures
the velocity of the rain in two different directions. Knowing that the
mass of air is conserved, and estimating the speed with which rain is
falling relative to the moving air, meteorologists can reconstruct
the three-dimensional wind field and compute quantities such
as vorticity (or local spin in the air). Such data have led them
to discover that a tornado is located to one side of its parent updraft,
near a downdraft, and to verify that air flowing into a mesocyclone
spins about its direction of motion.
<P><B><A NAME="Spinning">Spinning
Up</A></B> 
<P>A major breakthrough in understanding the complex
rotations intornadic storms came in 1978, when computer simulations
made by Robert Wilhelmson of the University of Illinois and Joseph
B.Klemp of the National Center for Atmospheric Research
(NCAR) reproduced realistic supercells complete with such features
as hook-shaped precipitation patterns. Proceeding in small time steps,
the scientists numerically solved the equations governing temperature,
wind velocity and conservation of mass for air and water in various
forms--vapor, cloud droplets and rain drops--on a three-dimensional array
of points emulating space.
<P>In the simulated world at least,
scientists were in control. Even without any lateral variations in the
initial environment, they were able to create supercells, thereby
debunking the popular explanation that tornadoes are caused by
colliding air masses. And by "turning off" the earth's rotation, they
established that it had little e>ect during the first few hours of a
storm's life. Rather wind direction that at low levels veered with
height was crucial to the development of rotation.
<P>In a typical
supercell environment the wind near the ground is from the southeast,
the wind half a mile above the ground is from the south, and the wind
one mile high is from the southwest. Wind that changes speed or
direction with height also contains spin. Envision how the wind would
make an initially vertical stick rotate: if a south wind blows slowly
near the ground and faster higher up, the stick will spin about an
east-west axis.
<P>But what if the wind, instead of changing speed,
changes direction from southeast to southwest? Imagine the stick
moving north, along with the mid-level wind, half a mile up. Then
its top is pushed eastward and its bottom westward, so that it will turn
about a north-south axis. Therefore, this air has"stream wise"
vorticity-it spins about its direction of motion, much like a spiraling
American football.
<P>Air parcels with streamwise vorticity have their
spin axes tilted upward as they enter an updraft. Thus, the updraft as
a whole rotates cyclonically. First proposed by Browning in 1963
and proved analytically in the 1980s by Douglas K. Lilly of
the University of Oklahoma and me, this theory explains how theupdraft
rotates at mid-levels. But it does not explain how rotation develops
very close to the ground. As simulations by Klemp and Richard Rotunno
of NCAR showed in 1985, low-level rotation depends on the supercell's
evaporatively cooled downdraft: it does not occur when the evaporation
of rain is "switched off."
<P>The simulations revealed, surprisingly,
that the low-level rotation originates north of the mesocyclone, in
moderatelyrain-cooled, subsiding air. As the mid-level rotation draws
the downdraft cyclonically around the updraft, some of the downdraft's
cool air travels southward with warm air on its left and much colder
air on its right. Warm air, being buoyant, pulls the left sides of the
air parcels upward; the cold air pulls their right sides downward. Then
the cool air starts to rotateabout its horizontal direction of motion.
But as it descends, its spin axis is tilted downward, giving rise to
anticyclonicspin.
<P>Harold E. Brooks, also at the NSSL, and I showed
in 1993 that, by a rather complex mechanism, the spin in the subsiding
cool air reverses direction before the air completes its
descent. Eventually, this cyclonically rotating air is present at
very low levels. This moderately cool air flows along the surface andis
sucked up into the southwest side of the updraft. Because theflow to
the updraft is convergent, the air rotates faster, likean ice skater
who spins more rapidly by drawing in her arms. 
<P>Despite
understanding well how large-scale rotation develops atmiddle and low
levels of a mesocyclone, we have yet to pin downwhy tornadoes are
formed. The simplest explanation is that theyare the result of surface
friction. This observation seems paradoxical because friction generally
reduces wind speeds. Butthe net effect of friction is much like that in
a stirred cup oftea. Drag does reduce speeds and therefore centrifugal
forces ina thin layer near the bottom. It causes the fluid to move
inwardalong the cup's base, as made apparent by tea leaves bunching
upat the center. But fluid near the top of this inflow spins fasteras
it falls in toward the axis because of the ice-skater effect.The result
is a vortex along the axis of the cup. W. StephenLewellen of West
Virginia University concludes that the highestwind speeds in a tornado
are located in the lowest 300 feet.
<P>Friction also explains the
persistence of twisters. A tornado has a partial vacuum in its core;
centrifugal forces prevent the airfrom spiraling inward through the
sides of the tornado. In 1969 Bruce R. Morton of Monash University in
Australia explained how the vacuum survives. Strong buoyancy forces
prevent air from entering the core through the top. Close to the
ground, friction reduces tangential velocity and hence centrifugal
forces, allowing a strong but shallow inflow into the core. But
friction also acts to limit the inflow winds, not allowing enough air
into fill up the core. Tornadoes intensify and become more stableafter
they make strong contact with the ground because their inflows become
restricted to a thin boundary layer.
<P>The friction theory does not
explain, however, why a tornadic vortex signature up in the clouds
sometimes foreshadows the touchdown of a tornado by 10 to 20
minutes.
<P><B><A NAME="Touchdown">Touchdown</A></B>
<P>Many of the
classic features of tornadoes were unexpectedly demonstrated to us on
that May day in Kansas. By the time we had moved to the southern storm
in the small town of Hanston, it was getting dark, and operations were
ending. But then the field coordinator advised the teams of a rapidly
rotating wall cloud in our vicinity. As the warning sirens started
wailing, we watched a skinny, serpentine tornado touch down three miles
to our southeast.
<P>We took off to the north to place ourselves ahead of
the tornado, unaware in the excitement of a deep drainage ditch in the
street.It damaged our wheel and tilted our weather station, but we
kept going. We turned on to a dirt road to take us east on the
northside of the tornado, which had now become a wide column of
dust with a bowl-shaped lowering of the cloud base above it. As we
got ahead of the tornado, it transformed itself into several
smaller vortices, all circling furiously around the tornado's
central axis. (In 1967 Fujita observed that some tornadoes left
behind beheaded cornstalks in several overlapping swaths. Neil B.
Wardof the NSSL later attributed these curious patterns to
such subsidiary twisters. Like a point on the rim of a bicycle
wheel that circles the center as the wheel moves forward, these frenetic
subvortices trace out cycloidal paths.)
<P>Low on gas, we raced ahead
of the twister, apprehensive because we did not know if and where the
road ended. The tornado was perhaps a mile away and not moving
perceptibly across our field of view, indicating that it was heading
directly for us at 30 miles per hour. The field coordinator came to our
rescue by informing us of a road north, toward Burdett, which we
gratefully took. We stopped after a mile to watch the tornado, which
had been on the ground for at least 14 miles and now had a
classic stovepipe appearance, pass by to our south and recede into
the darkness to our east.
<P>We limped home, our car damaged, our data
uncertain and our pulses racing, buoyed by the news that great radar
data had been obtained from the air and from the new portable ground
radar. Looking back, we should have just kept pace with the
tornado instead of passing it and turning ourselves, the hunters,
into the hunted.

<H2>Creating a New Cross-Discipline</H2>
Researchers struggle to<BR>
define commong ground.<P>
</CENTER>
What is this new field called "smart materials"? <A
HREF="http://www.enme.umd.edu/sirkis.html">James S. Sirkis</A>,
head of the <A HREF="http://www.enme.umd.edu/smart.html">Smart
Materials and Structures Research Center</A> at the University
of
Maryland, addressed that nagging question in a keynote speech at
the San Diego conference. A palpable tension hung over the
several hundred engineers and scientists in the room as they too
struggled to define their common ground.<P>
Sirkis began his talk with a challenge, pointing out that few of
the ideas these researchers are pursuing are new. "All of these
things we're working on (he cited electrorheological fluids,
fiber optic sensors, and shape-memory alloys as examples) were
in existence even before we were born. The bane of smart
structures is that we tend to rediscover things that have been
around for years." Knocking down some of the walls that tend to
isolate academic and government researchers in one discipline
from those in others might save a lot of needless duplication of
effort, he suggested.<P>
Sirkis then proceeded to quibble with the label "smart
materials"
that is commonly applied to the field. "The materials themselves
are not smart," Sirkis said. "They just provide a certain
function by converting energy from one form to another," turning
electricity into movement or vice versa, a chemical bond into a
voltage, and so on. In some cases, the fascination with the idea
of making ordinary things more intelligent has led to waste, he
argued. "We as a community tend to focus on the exotic.
Sometimes
we ought to say, 'why don't we just use a lawnmower engine?' We
should be willing to embrace more pedestrian technologies."<P>
In the end, Sirkis offered his own view of what smart materials
and structures are all about--a view that seemed to generate
broad consensus in the audience. "Smart structures," he argued,
"is a design philosophy"--not a specific research discipline.
One
of the reasons the field gets no respect, he suggested, is that
"we've been trying to prove to our colleagues that we are a
viable field, yet it's really hard to sell design."<P>
Sirkis ticked off several tenets that he thought characterize
the
smart structures philosophy:
<UL TYPE=DISC>
<LI>machines should behave as if they were sentient; 
<LI>structures should adapt automatically to their physical
environment; 
<LI>autonomy should be an integral part of the object's design
and function;
<LI>the structures should perform novel functions or do their
job in non- traditional ways.
</UL>
As examples, he cited such futuristic technologies as
intelligent
RAM chips, DNA-based computers, quantum-dot computing and
biological (protein-based) data storage. To some in the
audience,
the design features Sirkis described sounded rather weak and
redundant, the applications rather speculative. But most of the
researchers seemed relieved to have a clearer sense of their
mission.<P>

Advanced Liquid Crystal Displays
</H2>
New technology may lead to
<BR>
brighter, cheaper computer screens
</CENTER>
<P>
The failings of conventional flat panel display technology are familiar
to anyone who has used--or priced--laptop computers. Inexpensive models
have screens that are limited to shades of gray or dim, dingy colors.
More advanced versions, which are capable of showing bright,
fast-changing hues, carry dizzying price tags. (IBM's newest ThinkPad
laptop, which reviewers have cited as one of the first to offer a
display comparable to that of a desktop monitor, lists for about
$8,000.) And all liquid crystal screens suffer from a voracious
appetite for power, sucking batteries dry within a few hours. 
<P>Researchers at Kent State University's
<AHREF="http://alcom.kent.edu/"> Liquid Crystal Institute </A>
have recently demonstrated a new kind of inexpensive display that can
produce clearer images using alot less energy than existing designs.
Commercial production of a high-resolution grayscale version has already
begun at Kent Display Systems in Kent, Ohio. The researchers are now
engineering a low-power, high-contrast color device. 
<P> The displays
can do more with less because they affect light in a different way than
do conventional LCDs. A standard liquid crystal panel filters the light
both going in and coming out. Dots, or "pixels," of liquid crystal
inside the panel naturally twist, or polarize, the light so that it can
pass unimpeded through the second filter. When a pixel is turned on,
it untwists, creating a dark spot where light is
completely blocked. Unfortunately, such polarizing filters reduce the
amount of light going in by half. Changing bright pixels into colored
ones requires yet another filter, which absorbs even more of
the incoming light. LCDs are consequently too dim to use as
computer displays unless illuminated by a lamp from behind. And
lamps devour electricity. 
<P>
<A HREF="http://scorpio.kent.edu/ILCS/Members/Chien_L.C._0013.html">
Liang-Chy Chien </A> and his colleagues at Kent State got around this
problem using a so-called cholesteric liquid crystal material. Rather
than twisting light from one orientation to another, this
material naturally breaks incoming light rays into two parts. One ray
isreflected; the other is transmitted. Electrifying the materialturns
it clear. Because cholesteric LCDs reflect light directly without the
need for polarizing filters, they can appear as bright and legible in
ambient light as conventional LCDs do when electrically backlit. 
<P>
Early cholesteric LCDs were limited to single colors, but Chien found
that if he added small amounts of a second material, he could tune the
color to anything from deep red to brilliant blue by shining various
amounts of ultraviolet light on the panel. He and his collaborators
then locked in the desired color by mixing in a bit of polymer that
fixed the liquid-crystal orientation.The engineers are now adapting
ultraviolet masks like those used to etch microscopic patterns onto
computer chips to create millions of red, blue and green pixels on a
high-resolution cholesteric LCD panel. 
<P> At present, cholesteric LCDs
are about 20 percent more expensivethan conventional "passive matrix"
displays, but there are considerable compensations. Pixels in the new
displays stay on once they are turned on. That permanence eliminates
the need to redraw the display several times each second, saving even
more power. As a result, such panels should run more than 10
times longer on a set of batteries than do present displays. 
<P> The
stability of cholesteric LCDs also makes it possible todesign smaller
pixels--one prototype display boasts 200 dots per inch--and it
eliminates the flicker that makes laptop screens wearisome to read. But
the biggest advantage of the new LCDs is that they do not require the
intricate "active matrix" electronics that triple the price of
conventional panels in order to maintain high contrast and resolution.
Several manufacturers, including IBM, Sony and Toshiba, have reportedly
expressed interest in licensing the technology.

range from<BR>medical devices to machines.</CENTER>
<P>Many machines
can automate some of the functions of human muscles, but few can mimic
the form. Recent research into polymer-based artificial muscles may
soon yield devices that move more like biological organisms.
<P><A
HREF="http://www.nmjc.org/center/faculty/shahinpoor.html">Mo Shahinpoor</A>,
anengineering professor at the University of New Mexico, makes his out
of polyacrylonitrile (PAN), a polymer that in a slightly different form
is known by the trade name Orlon, or artificial silk. Researchers
discovered several years ago that PAN, a tough substance with physical
properties midway between gel and plastic, contracts dramatically when
its acidity (pH) ischanged.
<P>In less than 20 milliseconds, PAN fibers
start shrinking. They can decrease in length by 20 percent in
two-tenths of a second, about as fast a human muscle. Depending on the
acidity, PAN fibers can contract to anywhere from one-half to one-
tenth their original length, Shahinpoor reports. Laboratory tests show
that the fibers are strong, too, capable of holding four
kilograms per square centimeter. A human bicep maxes out at just over
half that.
<P>Don't go running out to the fabric store to create
Orlon muscles, however: the fibers must be chemically treated and
specially packaged to work. Shahinpoor wraps fiber bundles in latex
tubes, through which he then pumps the solution that makes them
twitch. Arranging bundles on opposite sides of a skeleton,
Shahinpoor hasbeen able to make it lift and lower its arm. "One of
ourambitions is to make the largest muscle ever," he beams,
"and the smallest as well." His group claims to have produced
working muscles that are just 200 microns in length; some day they
could be used to control the actions of micro machines.
<P>PAN muscles
are limited by their dependence on a chemical trigger. In everyday
applications, it may not be easy to repeatedly alter the environmental
acidity of the muscle. Aversion that runs on electricity instead and
that will not dry out when exposed to air would be more practical.
<P>At the Smart Structures conference,
<AHREF="http://www.nmjc.org/center/interns/mojarrad.html">Mehran Mojarrad</A>,
a graduate student working with Shahinpoor, reported just such
an invention. By coating a commercially available membrane with
platinum, Mojarrad created plastic sheets that curl when electrodes
are charged on either side. So far the researchers have constructed only
demonstration toys from the material: a boat propelled by a waving fin
of polymer and a flapping machine. But more practical uses for a cheap,
noiseless and highly efficient artificial muscle are probably not far
off.

<P>The sorry state of
America's bridges is an all-too-familiarstory. Most collapses occur on
shorter spans, but many largebridges, their maintenance long
underfunded, also are riddledwith cracks and weak spots. Concrete
bridges are at higher riskthan steel, because their flaws are often
less apparent. So itissomewhat surprising that technology is rarely
used to routinelymonitor the health of concrete bridges. All the more
soconsidering how cheaply and easily it could be done.
<P>In a paper
presented at the Smart Materials and Structures conference, D. D. Chung
of the State University of New York at Buffalo described her team's
experiments with "self- monitoring concrete." Her strategy was
deceptively simple. First, mix a tiny amount of carbon fibers in with
the concrete mix (Chung used just 0.05 percent by volume). Then place
electrodes at each end of the bridge and measure its resistance. As
cracks develop, they separate the fibers (which conduct electricity),
thereby increasing the electrical resistance. Taking just a few
basic measurements, Chung was able to deduce with surprising
accuracy the extent of fractures within a bridge, the
consequent reductionin its strength, and the probability that it had
suffered serious damage.
<P>A group of researchers at
<AHREF="http://www.ino.qc.ca/Externe/Doc/Anglais/Home/INO-NOI-Home.html">Canada'sNational
Optics Institute</A> applied a similar idea, albeit with much more
sophisticated technology, to measure the stress on an icebreaker's
propeller as it chopped through the frozen Arctic Ocean. The job
was especially tricky because the blades spin 160 times a minute and the
prop is huge: it stretches 16 feet in diameter and weighs four tons.
Stress varies wildly from one blade to the next and changes rapidly in
time, so the researchers needed a scheme that could measure strain at
54 points on the propeller and repeat the measurement several times a
second.
<P>Their ingenious solution was to dig gouges into the blades
and run hair-thin optical fibers in the tiny indentations.
Each fiber terminated in a strain sensor at one end and a computer
board (mounted directly onto the rotating prop shaft) at the other.
As the electronics spun with the blades, they radioed strain data back
to a workstation on board. "We were lucky to get the icebreaker into
some extremely heavy ice on our first test--actually so bad that it
almost damaged the propeller,"said Andre Marin of the National Optics
Institute, with a scientist's perverse appreciation of the rare
opportunity to get real-world data.
<P>Had it not been for the sensors,
Marin said, the ship's captain may well have pushed the prop beyond its
breaking point. Good thing the equipment worked on the first
try.

This NSCAT image shows ocean surface wind speeds and directions
over the Pacific Ocean on September 21, 1996. The white arrows
show the direction of the wind. Typhoons Violet and Tom are the
yellow-orange spiral features in the western Pacific (upper
left), near Japan. (Typhoon Tom is in the open ocean; typhoon
Violet is just south of Japan.) Strong winter storm activity
appears as orange patterns in the southern hemisphere.

<CENTER><H3>Typhoons Violet and Tom</H3></CENTER>


<BLOCKQUOTE>
These four images are a sequence of wind speed and wind
direction measurements collected by NSCAT every 12 hours during
September 20 and 21, 1996. Typhoons Violet and Tom appear as
yellow-orange spiral features; Violet is the one immediately
south of Japan. During the two days of observations, typhoon
Violet moved landward, causing death and severe property damage.
The background color indicates wind speed: blue for low winds,
red for moderate winds and yellow for high winds. The white
arrows show the direction of the wind. Data like these are being
used by the National Weather Service in its global forecast
models.

"Is it possible, as urban legend has it, for a tarantula to lay eggs inside a cactus?"
</A></B></FONT>

<P>--<I>Brendan O'Malley<BR>New York, NY</I><p>

Barbara H. Reger, president of the <a href="http://www.cowboy.net/~spider/ATS.html" TARGET="_top">American Tarantula Society</a>, responded in good humor:

<p>"I was amused by your inquiry, because this question is asked of me several times a year. 
No, it is quite improbable that this would ever occur. Tarantulas living in dry desert regions 
where cactus are found do often burrow at the base of the cactus, but not inside it. The sharp 
prickly spikes would harm them, and the conditions there are inappropriate for laying eggs. 

<p>"The following paragraphs are quoted from an article, 'Detonating Cactus Yields Tarantula 
Shrapnel,' I wrote in the FORUM of the American Tarantula Society, Vol. 2 No 2, 1993:

<p>"Have you heard the one about the lady whose neighbor bought a cactus at her local garden 
center? When she got it home and watered it, the thing swelled up and exploded, raining baby 
Tarantulas down all over the place. She called an exterminator, but he offered very little hope. 
The poor woman actually had to sell her home and move. 

<p>"Or, did you hear the one about the woman whose brother's best friend brought a cactus back 
from Arizona? He had it for a year. Every time he watered it the thing grew larger and larger. One 
day it suddenly exploded, and baby tarantulas went everywhere. They called an exterminator who 
told them that he received numerous calls weekly because this same thing has been happening all 
over the city. 

<p>"For the past three years, I have been running into people that have given me variations of this 
same story. They look me up because they know I study tarantulas. What's really amazing is how 
angry or offended they get when I explain to them that the story is not true. They feel like I am 
calling them a liar. I tell them to please get the name for me of the person that claimed this 
happened. They can never come up with a name. They always say that it wasn't their neighbor's 
friend, is was a friend of a friend, etc. I even try to explain to them that spiderlings could not be 
living in a cactus and still develop properly as the cactus was watered time and again. I even 
explain the way a tarantula constructs its burrow in the desert. They won't listen because they 
are too enamored with the idea of being offended.

<p>"The first time I encountered this story it involved the parent of one of my students. She said 
her neighbor had purchased the cactus at Frank's Nursery and Crafts. I called this local store, and 
they said they had already received numerous calls on it. They told me it wasn't their store, but the 
one on the north side of the city. I called this store and was sent on a wild goose chase all over 
Indianapolis and then throughout the state. Actually, Frank's buys their cacti from a nursery in 
Canada. We all know how many tarantulas live there! This rumor got so bad in Indianapolis that the <I>Indianapolis Star </I> printed an article about it and how rumors and tall tales tend to use 
pseudo-witnesses to add validation to their stories. 

<p>"I'm sure you all have variations of this story too. At least now, armed with my copy of the 
article from our local paper, I can prove to people that it is indeed a rumor. Well, actually, I 
should say I can show people that others have heard the same story. Scientific evidence of any 
sort doesn't seem to satisfy them, they still are offended by being demonstrated silly and will 
not have it any other way."

<p>Fred Sherberger of <a href="http://www.fernbank.edu/fsc2.html" TARGET="_top">Fernbank Science Center</a> in Atlanta, who is the associate editor for the American Tarantula Society, 
offered some further comments:

<p>"This one of those things that you hear all the time that simply is not true, like the 'fact' that grasshoppers make sounds by rubbing their legs together. But it isn't true--grasshoppers don't do 
that. Katydid males rub their wings together. In other cases, the insects may rub a wing and a leg together (which makes a musical sound) or they may snap open the back wings (which creates 
more of a snap-crackle-pop noise).

<p>"There's a basic logical flaw in the tarantula story. Once tarantulas lay their eggs, the baby 
tarantulas do not get any nutrient other than what is present in the egg; when the tarantula hatches, 
it cannot be any larger than the eggs it hatched from (just like a chick emerging from a hen's egg). 
So what would make the cactus explode? And I always hear of a cactus exploding--you never hear 
of an oak tree being torn asunder by hatching tarantulas.

<p>"It's hard to say why this story is so persistent. Perhaps people see the egg sack of a house 
spider and then later see big clump of spiders in the same place. You might wonder, gee, how did 
all those spiders come from that little sack? But in fact you are not looking just at the mass of the bodies; you are seeing them all spread out after they have hatched. I find it hard to believe that 
logical people believe the story is true. Mostly, people probably repeat the story because it is 
cute and funny. That's how I look at it--I laugh and say, oh no, not again!"

"What would be the effect on life if a supernova exploded close to the earth? 
If it were at the distance of the closest star, would a supernova be able to sterilize the planet?"
</A></B></FONT>

<P>--<I>P.K. Birkmeyer<BR>Hampton, Va.</I>

<p><a href="http://astro.princeton.edu/~richmond/" TARGET="_top">Michael Richmond</a> in the department of astrophysical sciences at Princeton University responds:

<p>"The primary danger to life on the earth from a <a href="http://www.ast.cam.ac.uk/pubinfo/leaflets/supernovae/supernovae.html" TARGET="_top">supernova</a> would be the high-energy radiation (x-rays and gamma rays) produced by the radioactive decay of elements synthesized in the explosion. There are two types of supernovae: massive stars that run out of fuel in their cores and collapse (called 'Type II' or 'Type Ib' supernovae), and white dwarf stars that accrete enough material from a close companion to undergo runaway thermonuclear fusion (called 'Type Ia' supernovae). Both kinds of supernovae create radioactive nickel 56, which decays into cobalt 56, emitting gamma rays as it changes; the cobalt 56 then decays into iron 56, releasing additional gamma rays. As the gamma rays fly through the debris ejected during the explosion, they collide with nuclei and electrons and transfer some of their energy to these particles. Nevertheless, a very large amount of high-energy radiation makes its ways through the ejecta and escapes into space.

<p>"Our sun emits high-energy radiation, too, most notably during a solar flare. A supernova puts even the largest solar flare to shame, however, producing more dangerous radiation in a single second than a year's worth of continuous solar flares. If a supernova were as close as Alpha Centauri, the nearest star system (4.3 light-years away), it would dump as many x-rays into the earth's atmosphere as 1,000 simultaneous solar flares, and it would continue doing so for several months. It is possible that the earth's atmosphere would not be able to absorb all this radiation and that some fraction might reach the ground, bombarding unprotected creatures with lethal doses of x-rays.

<p>"Fortunately, the stars that might become supernovae are extremely rare; there are no such stars within at least 10 parsecs (one parsec is 3.26 light-years) of the earth, and there are probably none within 100 parsecs. Because the intensity of radiation decreases in proportion to the square of the distance, we are in no danger from more distant explosions."

<p><a href="http://www.kingsu.ab.ca/~brian/brian.htm" TARGET="_top">Brian E. Martin</a>, an associate professor of mathematics, physics and astronomy at the King's University College in Alberta, Canada, offers another perspective:

<p>"It never fails: whenever I give a public talk or lecture to freshmen and the topic leads to supernovae, a hand shoots up and someone asks, "What would happen if our nearest stellar neighbor went supernova?" This is an excellent question and can be used to uncover a lot of basic physics. So let's consider the following scenario: We are situated one parsec away from a Type Ia supernova. Are we toast? Sad to say, yes! 

<p>"First, let's look at the optical effects. Supernovae come in two basic flavors: Type I are the result of the detonation of a mass-accreting white dwarf in a binary system; Type II supernovae are the end games of massive, single stars. Type I are the more energetic of the two and can, briefly, outshine their parent galaxy. Astronomers use absolute magnitude (M) as a measure of the intrinsic brightness of an object; absolute magnitude is defined as the brightness that the object would have at a distance of 10 parsecs. Type I supernovae have absolute magnitudes on the order of 19 (at the same distance, the sun would have a magnitude of 4.8; the difference of 24 magnitudes means that a Type I supernova is about three billion times brighter!). If such a supernova occurred only one parsec away, we can use the 'distance modulus formula' (m  M = 5 log[r/10]) to estimate the apparent visual magnitude (m) of the object. The supernova would not quite rival the sun (magnitude 24 for the supernova versus 26.7 for the sun) but would be clearly visible during the day as an intense point of blue-white light about one tenth as bright as the sun. Such a supernova would produce a marvelous sight--two suns in the sky--and would have significant effects on the climate. But as we shall next see, it is unlikely anyone would be around to marvel at the spectacle!

<p>"Gamma-ray-burst effects will be the big problem. The optical emission from the supernova comes from the rapidly expanding photosphere (equivalent to the visible surface of the sun) of the exploding star as it hurtles at thousands of kilometers per second into interstellar space. It will brighten for several weeks and then begin a more gradual denouement. Meanwhile, however, one of the most violent energy bursts known will have already taken place. As the star explodes, a shock wave wells up from the core and crashes through the photosphere with ferocious violence, triggering a burst of gamma radiation. Estimates put the energy emitted by this shock on the order of 5 x 10<sup>47</sup> ergs (which is about equal to the sun's entire output at all wavelengths for three million years!). The entire event will take a mere 10 microseconds or so. As the radiation floods into interstellar space, the earth will suffer a fatal blow. At a distance of one parsec, our upper atmosphere would be subjected to a gamma-ray intensity of about four billion ergs per square centimeter. The result would be intense ionization of the molecular nitrogen and oxygen in the air and the production of ozone-depleting nitrous oxide (NO) compounds. This chemical stew would almost certainly destroy the ozone layer (some researchers estimate that the 'lethal limit' for ozone-layer destruction is on the order of several million ergs per square centimeter). 

<p>"With our protective ozone layer gone, we would be in grave danger. First, harmful ultraviolet rays from the sun would begin to irradiate the planet. More significant, however, would be the steadily growing background of x-ray and gamma radiation from the supernova. As the supernova expands outward, radioactive heavy elements produced in the explosion would begin to decay, sending high-energy radiation into the surrounding space. Most significant is the nickel-cobalt-iron chain of radioactive decay, which would produce a steady supply of lethal radiation for at least the next year. The <a href="http://ledas-www.star.le.ac.uk/ginga/ginga.html" TARGET="_top">Ginga</a> x-ray satellite noted a flux of hard and soft x-rays from supernova 1987A; the observed intensity was about 4 x 10<sup>-11 </sup>ergs per square centimeter per second for a period of over a year. Supernova 1987A exploded in the Large Magellanic Cloud, about 50,000 parsecs away. At a distance of one parsec, the x-ray flux would climb to about 0.2 erg per square centimeter per second, which is on the order of magnitude of the x-ray emission from a large solar flare. But unlike a solar flare, which may last for a few seconds to a few minutes, the supernova emissions will persist for months to years--after the earth has lost the protective benefit of the ozone layer. If this happens, we are indeed toast!

<p>"I hope I have convinced you that a supernova explosion at one parsec is not a good idea. In fact , it is likely to be worse than I indicated, because I did not even mention the possible harmful effects that could be produced by the normally unnoticed neutrinos that are emitted in copious profusion during a supernova or by the x-rays from the newly forming supernova remnant. Even at a distance of 1,000 parsecs, a supernova could probably produce serious effects on the earth. In the 1970s astrophysicist Malvin Ruderman suggested (see the article by M. A. Ruderman in <I>Science</I>, Vol. 184, page 1079;1974) that the mean time between close encounters with supernovae--those at a distance less than 1,000 parsecs--is on the order of 60 million years. Interestingly, the dinosaurs went extinct 65 million years ago. Is this number a coincidence?  

<p>Juan I. Collar of CERN (the European Organization for Nuclear Research) near Geneva, Switzerland, offers yet another view, focusing on some recent research:

<p>"Prompted by the identification that the Geminga gamma-radiation source (located approximately 200 light-years away from the solar system) is a supernova remnant, astronomers John Ellis and <a href="http://rainbow.uchicago.edu/physics/t_astro.html#Schramm" TARGET="_top">David N. Schramm</a> revisited the possible effects on life of a nearby supernova explosion [see "Could a Nearby Supernova Explosion Have Caused a Mass Extinction?" J. Ellis and D. N. Schramm in <I>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA</I>, Vol. 92, No. 1, pages 235-238; January 3, 1995]. For a supernova roughly 10 parsecs away, the researchers estimated that the increase in the cosmic-ray-induced radiation dose would not by itself be catastrophic for most organisms. They did find, however, that the ionizing radiation would produce nitrous oxide (NO) in the atmosphere at a rate that guarantees the destruction of the ozone layer for 300 years or so, shutting down photosynthesis in marine plants and wreaking havoc on the global ecology. Fortunately, Ellis and Schramm estimated that this cataclysmic episode should take place only once every 100 million years or so. In principle, it should be possible to find evidence of such a nearby supernova explosion by looking for isotope anomalies in the geologic record [see "<a href="http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/astro-ph/9605128">Geological Isotope Anomalies as Signatures of Nearby Supernovae</a>." John Ellis, Brian D. Fields and David N. Schramm in <I>Astrophysical Journal</I>, Vol. 470, No. 2, pages 1227-1236; October 20, 1996].

<p>"Not every stellar collapse necessarily leads to a supernova. Some theorists have suggested that stellar collapses can also take place in a more 'silent' manner, in which case the resulting energy emission would be almost only in the form of neutrinos. These silent collapses would be less conspicuous than supernova explosions and could easily have been overlooked; it is possible that they occur more frequently in our galaxy than the usual 'loud' collapses. The prevalence of silent collapses will be elucidated in the coming years by current and upcoming neutrino experiments [see the page on <a href="http://snodaq.phy.queensu.ca/SNO/experiments.html" TARGET="_top">Neutrino Experiments</a> from Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario]. The large flux of neutrinos from a nearby silent stellar collapse might still be hazardous to life: the energetic neutrinos could cause so many mutations (by inducing nuclear recoils in genetic material) to cause grave damage to living things [see "<a href="http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/astro-ph/9505028" TARGET="_top">Biological Effects of Stellar Collapse Neutrinos</a>." J. I. Collar in <I>Physical Review Letters</I>, Vol. 76, No. 6, pages 999-1002; February 5, 1996].

<p>"The closest stars to the solar system are the three members of the Alpha Centauri system. They sit only 4.3 light-years (1.3 parsecs) from the earth, and if one of them were to explode as a supernova or undergo a silent collapse, the effects on the biosphere would be catastrophic. Luckily, none of them has nearly enough mass for this to happen!"

"What is known about the nature and diagnosis of Tourette's syndrome? Do we know what causes it, and can it ever be cured?"
</A></B></FONT>


<P>--<I>Debbie Eckardt<BR>Eugene, Ore.</I>

<P>We ran a <a href="http://www.sciam.com/askexpert/011397medicine.html#acs72">brief
response to this question</a> several weeks ago. Now <a
href="http://cbdb1.nimh.nih.gov/staff/weinberg/dan.htm"TARGET="_top">Daniel R. Weinberger</a>,
chief of the <a href="http://cbdb1.nimh.nih.gov/">clinical brain disorders
branch</a> at the National Institute of Mental Health, has written with
additional information and references:

<P>"Tourette's syndrome is a curious medical condition defined by a constellation of
involuntary behavioral manifestations involving abnormal movements and
utterances. The abnormal involuntary movements, called motor tics, are
repetitive, stereotyped movements, usually of the face and neck. In most cases,
they are simple and brief, such as eye blinking, neck jerking, lip smacking or
protruding of the tongue. Occasionally the movements are more complex and involve
motor routines, such as bending over and touching one's toes or sniffing one's
fingers. The utterances, called vocal tics, are also usually brief, stereotyped
and repetitive--for instance, throat clearing, snorting, sniffing or grunting. In
rare instances, the vocal tics can be complex and involve involuntary repetition
of whole phrases, such as parts of the speech of others (echolalia), and swearing
(coprolalia).

<P>"Although the tics of Tourette's syndrome are involuntary, they are under a
certain degree of conscious control and can be suppressed for varying degrees of
time. Interestingly, most affected individuals notice that the longer they
suppress their tics, the more they feel an urge to release them. This compulsive
quality to the manifestations led Gilles de la Tourette, the 19th-century French
neurologist who described the condition, to refer to it as 'tic compulsif.'

<P>"In virutally all cases, Tourette's syndrome begins in childhood, usually before
the age of 10. It is a fairly common disorder, occurring in approximately five
out of every 10,000 people. This prevalence rate probably underestimates the
frequency of milder forms of the disorder, which involve only motor or only vocal
tics. Common tic phenomena, such as nervous throat clearing or smacking of the
lips, probably represent in many instances milder forms of Tourette's syndrome.
In general, the degree and manner of tics tend to vary over time, often being
worse during stress or illness. The condition is usually lifelong, but many
individuals experience some reduction in the severity of their symptoms as they
grow into adulthood. Tourette's syndrome is almost never physically disabling.
Most individuals learn to compensate for their symptoms or to accept them as part
of their lives and require no or only occasional treatment. The psychological and
social aspects of the malady, which can be considerable, represent its main
burden.

<P>"The cause of Tourette's syndrome is unknown. Throughout much of this century, it
was regarded as a purely psychological condition, but it is now known to be
neurological in origin. Family studies and studies of twins have confirmed that
there is a genetic basis for the disorder, although the gene or genes have yet to
be identified. There is no diagnostic laboratory test for Tourette's syndrome,
nor are there unique features that show up in neural imaging techniques, although
there are subtle abnormalities in certain brain structures (for example, the
caudate nucleus) and neurochemical systems (dopamine, for instance) that have
been associated with the disorder. How these findings contribute to the clinical
manifestations of the condition is a matter of much speculation.

<P>"It has become increasingly clear that Tourette's syndrome is more than just
movements and noises. Many patients also experience the intrusion of involuntary
compulsive thoughts and feel the urge to perform repetitive, often illogical
acts, such as repetitive counting, checking and hand washing. These
obsessive-compulsive symptoms also run in the families of patients with
Tourette's syndrome and have led to the belief that the gene or genes underlying
the disorder are related to the gene or genes for obsessive-compulsive disorder.
The brain regions that have been implicated in Tourette's syndrome also overlap
with those that have been linked to obsessive-compulsive disorder. Hence, the two
syndromes appear to represent varying manifestations of a common neurobiological
spectrum.

<P>"The treatment of Tourette's syndrome is based on the degree of symptoms and
distress that individuals experience. Drugs that diminish dopamine activity in
the brain (such as haloperidol, pimozide and risperidone) are effective for
treating the tics. Serotonin reuptake inhibitors, which are used to treat
depression, are also effective in ameliorating the obsessive-compulsive
manifestations. Unfortunately, these drugs are not entirely free of side effects,
and some individuals find the side effects less tolerable than the tics.
Psychological counseling and support groups are often helpful in learning to cope
with the social and psychological ramifications of the disorder.

<P>"For most patients with Tourette's syndrome and related tic disorders, the course
of treatment is benign and the outcome is good. Future prospects for
understanding the basic causes of the disorder and for developing more effective
treatments are promising. One of the most important reasons for this optimism is
the public education effort and research support of the <a
href="http://neuro-www2.mgh.harvard.edu/TSA/tsamain.nclk">Tourette's Syndrome
Association</a> in Bayside, N.Y. The work of this lay organization has had an
enormous impact in reducing the stigma associated with Tourette's syndrome and in
making research about this disorder a priority of the biomedical research
community."

"How can the extremity of a whip travel faster than the speed of sound to produce the characteristic "crack"?"
</A></B></FONT>

<P>--<I>J. N. Rousseau<BR>Montreal, Quebec</I>

<P>Collier Smith of the <a href="http://www.bldrdoc.gov/">National Institute of
Standards and Technology</a> responds:

<P>"Looking at how the whip behaves gives a clue to this phenomenon (and it helps if
you have actually tried to crack a whip). The whip has to be moved so that a
U-shaped loop is formed near the handle, where the whip is thickest and stiffest.
As the whip is swung, the loop travels outward toward the thinner, lighter tip.
The loop travels progressively faster the closer it gets to the tip, because the
energy from the heavier part of the whip is carried along into the lighter,
thinner part. This amplification is analogous to way in which an ocean wave of
small height becomes a high breaker as it enters the shallow water near the shore
or over a reef.

<P>"When the loop reaches the end, it is going extremely fast and causes the very
tip to 'whip' around in a tight circle. It is at this point that the tip exceeds
the speed necessary to create a tiny shock wave in the air; it is this shock that
we hear as the 'crack.' "

"What is the function of the human appendix? Did it once have a purpose that has since been lost?"
</A></B></FONT>

<P>--<I>Ross Rowland<BR>Great Falls, Va.</I>

<P>Loren G. Martin, professor of physiology at Oklahoma State University, replies:

<P>"For years, the appendix was credited with very little physiological function. We
now know, however, that the appendix serves an important role in the fetus and in
young adults. Endocrine cells appear in the appendix of the human fetus at around
the 11th week of development. These endocrine cells of the fetal appendix have
been shown to produce various biogenic amines and peptide hormones, compounds
that assist with various biological control (homeostatic) mechanisms. There had
been little prior evidence of this or any other role of the appendix in animal
research, because the appendix does not exist in domestic mammals.

<P>"Among adult humans, the appendix is now thought to be involved primarily in
immune functions. Lymphoid tissue begins to accumulate in the appendix shortly
after birth and reaches a peak between the second and third decades of life,
decreasing rapidly thereafter and practically disappearing after the age of 60.
During the early years of development, however, the appendix has been shown to
function as a lymphoid organ, assisting with the maturation of B lymphocytes (one
variety of white blood cell) and in the production of the class of antibodies
known as immunoglobulin A (IgA) antibodies. Researchers have also shown that the
appendix is involved in the production of molecules that help to direct the
movement of lymphocytes to various other locations in the body.

<P>"In this context, the function of the appendix appears to be to expose white
blood cells to the wide variety of antigens, or foreign substances, present in
the gastrointestinal tract. Thus, the appendix probably helps to suppress
potentially destructive humoral (blood- and lymph-borne) antibody responses while
promoting local immunity. The appendix--like the tiny structures called Peyer's
patches in other areas of the gastrointestinal tract--takes up antigens from the
contents of the intestines and reacts to these contents. This local immune system
plays a vital role in the physiological immune response and in the control of
food, drug, microbial or viral antigens. The connection between these local
immune reactions and inflammatory bowel diseases, as well as autoimmune reactions
in which the individual's own tissues are attacked by the immune system, is
currently under investigation.

<P>"In the past, the appendix was often routinely removed and discarded during other
abdominal surgeries to prevent any possibility of a later attack of appendicitis;
the appendix is now spared in case it is needed later for reconstructive surgery
if the urinary bladder is removed. In such surgery, a section of the intestine is
formed into a replacement bladder, and the appendix is used to re-create a
'sphincter muscle' so that the patient remains continent (able to retain urine).
In addition, the appendix has been successfully fashioned into a makeshift
replacement for a diseased ureter, allowing urine to flow from the kidneys to the
bladder. As a result, the appendix, once regarded as a nonfunctional tissue, is
now regarded as an important 'back-up' that can be used in a variety of
reconstructive surgical techniques. It is no longer routinely removed and
discarded if it is healthy."

"How is caffeine is removed to produce decaffeinated
coffee?"
</A></B></FONT>

<P>--<I>Rick Woolley<BR> Everett, Wash.</I>

<P><a
href="http://www-unix.oit.umass.edu/~foodsci/Clydesdale.html"TARGET="_top">Fergus
Clydesdale</a>, head of the <a
href="http://www-unix.oit.umass.edu/~foodsci/"TARGET="_top">Food Science
Department</a> at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst,
provides this answer:

<P>"First, some background. Coffee is the second most popular
beverage in the world, after tea. Historians believed the use of
coffee as a stimulant originated in ancient Abyssinia
(Ethiopia). Caffeine is the component of coffee that is
responsible for its mild stimulatory effect on the central
nervous system. A six-ounce cup of coffee typically contains
approximately 50 to 75 milligrams of caffeine, although the
amount varies considerably depending on the method of
preparation and the type of coffee; Robusta coffee contains
nearly twice as much caffeine as Arabica, for instance. For
people who are sensitive to caffeine, even 10 milligrams can
cause discomfort. That is why nearly all decaffeinated coffees
contain less than 10 milligrams of caffeine (typically two to
five milligrams) per serving. Today decaffeinated coffee
accounts for approximately 12 percent of total worldwide coffee
consumption, or nearly 1 billion pounds per year.

<P>"The first process for decaffeinating coffee was invented by
Ludwig Roselius in 1905. Roselius's method used benzene, a
potentially toxic hydrocarbon, to remove caffeine from
premoistened, green coffee beans. Modern decaffeination
processes are much more gentle; many make that point by claiming
to be 'naturally decaffeinated.'

<P>"There are three main decaffeination processes currently in
use. They have some basic similarities. In all three approaches,
the green or roasted beans are first moistened, making the
caffeine soluble so that it can be drawn out. Also, they all
decaffeinate green coffee at moderate temperatures, typically
ranging from 70 to 100 degrees Celsius (160 to 210 degrees
Fahrenheit).

<P>"One method is water processing. As you might expect, this
process employs water as the solvent to remove caffeine from the
green coffee beans. Typically a battery extraction process using
eight to 12 vessels is employed; each vessel contains green
coffee at a different stage of decaffeination.

<P>"A mixture of water and green-coffee extract that has already
been reduced in caffeine is circulated around the coffee beans
within the extraction battery (oils in the coffee extract aid in
the decaffeination process). After a predetermined time, the
vessel that has been exposed to the low-caffeine extract is
isolated and emptied. The decaffeinated coffee beans are then
rinsed and dried, and a vessel containing fresh green coffee is
put on stream. The caffeine-rich extract that was drawn off from
the vessel containing the fresh, green coffee is passed through
a bed of activated charcoal, which absorbs the caffeine. This
charcoal has been pretreated with a carbohydrate, typically
sucrose, that helps it absorb caffeine without removing other
compounds that contribute to the flavor of the coffee. The
sucrose blocks carbon sites that would normally absorb sugars
from the liquid, green-coffee extract. The caffeine-reduced
extract can then be reused to begin the process anew. The water
process is natural (that is, it does not involve any chemicals),
but it is not very specific for caffeine; it removes 94 to 96
percent of the caffeine.

<P>"A second decaffeination method is the direct solvent method.
These days this technique usually employs methylene chloride
(used predominately in Europe), coffee oil or ethyl acetate to
dissolve the caffeine and extract it from the coffee. Ethyl
acetate is an ester that is found naturally in fruits and
vegetables such as bananas, apples and coffee. The liquid
solvent is circulated through a bed of moist, green coffee
beans, removing some of the caffeine; the solvent is then
recaptured in an evaporator, and the beans are washed with
water. Residues of the solvent are removed from the coffee to
trace levels by steaming the beans. Often this process utilizes
batch processing--that is, solvent is added to the vessel,
circulated and emptied several times until the coffee has been
decaffeinated to the desired level. Solvents are used because
they are generally more precisely targeted to caffeine than is
charcoal, leaving behind nearly all the noncaffeine solids. The
more caffeine-specific solvents, such as methylene chlorides,
can extract 96 to 97 percent of the caffeine.

<P>"The third approach, supercritical carbon dioxide
decaffeination, is very similar to the direct solvent methods,
except that in this case the solvent is carbon dioxide.
High-pressure vessels (operating at roughly 250 to 300 times
atmospheric pressure) are employed to circulate the carbon
dioxide through a bed of premoistened, green coffee beans. At
such pressures, carbon dioxide takes on unique, 'supercritical'
properties that enhance its usefulness as a solvent.
Supercritical carbon dioxide has a density like that of a
liquid, but its viscosity and diffusivity are similar to those
of a gas. These attributes significantly lower its pumping
costs. Carbon dioxide is a popular solvent because it has a
relatively low pressure critical point, and it is naturally
abundant. The caffeine-rich carbon dioxide exiting the
extraction vessel is either channeled through a bed of activated
charcoal or through a water 'bath' tower to absorb the caffeine.
The carbon dioxide is then recirculated back to the extraction
vessel. Supercritical carbon dioxide decaffeination is
capital-cost intensive, but it offers very good yields. It
typically can extract 96 to 98 percent of the caffeine
originally present in the beans."<P>

"Is it possible that a meteorite could strike a
commercial airliner and cause it to explode? Could this possibly
have caused the crash of TWA Flight 800?"
</A></B></FONT>

<P>--<I>Katherine Watson <BR>Address Withheld</I>

<P>We have already presented <a
href="http://www.sciam.com/askexpert/index2.html#acs86"TARGET="_top">two
responses</a> on this intriguing but controversial question. 
Here is another response from one of the leading experts on
impact phenomena, David Morrison of the <a
href="http://www.arc.nasa.gov/"TARGET="_top">NASA Ames Research Center</a>:

<P>"It is certainly possible for a meteorite to strike a
commercial airliner, although the probability is low. We can
make a very rough estimate by comparing the area of airliners
with the area of cars in the U.S. A typical car has an area on
the order of 10 square meters, and there are roughly 100 million
cars in the U.S., for a total cross-sectional area of about
1,000 square kilometers. The typical airliner has a
cross-sectional area of several hundred square meters, but the
number of planes is much smaller than the number of cars,
perhaps a few thousand. The total cross-sectional area of
airliners is therefore no more than 10 square kilometers, or a
factor of at least 100 less than that of cars. Three cars are
known to have been struck by meteorites in the U.S. during the
past century, so it would appear that the odds are against any
airplanes having been hit, but it is not impossible that one
might have been.

<P>"To my knowledge, there have been no reports of airplanes
being struck, however. If one were hit, it would be more likely
to occur on the ground than in the air, because airplanes spend
more time overall on the ground. And finally, even if one were
hit in flight by a meteorite, it would be unlikely to cause an
explosion of the sort that ended the flight of TWA Flight 800
last year."<P>

Smack in the middle of Paris, hugging the bank of the Seine, four enormous high-rises stand ready, with 395 kilometers of shelf space, to receive up to 22 million books. The French national library's <A HREF="http://www.bnf.fr/institution/anglais/plaogb.htm">new Tolbiac tower</A> complex may be both the last and the first of its kind. Last because most major cities can no longer afford to construct such ambitious public works. But first because the <A HREF="http://www.bnf.fr/institution/anglais/sommgb.htm">Biblioth&#232;que Nationale</A> de France will complete its move with a pi&#232;ce de r&#233;sistance: hundreds of computer workstations providing ready electronic access to the full text of 110,000 volumes covering much of French history and culture.
<P>
All over the world, libraries have begun the Herculean task of making faithful digital copies of the books, images and recordings that preserve the intellectual effort of humankind. For armchair scholars, the work promises to bring such a wealth of information to the desktop that the present Internet may seem amateurish in retrospect. But many technical, economic and legal obstacles still make that promise an uncertain one.
<P>
Librarians see three clear benefits to going digital. First, it helps them preserve rare and fragile objects without denying access to those who wish to study them. The <A HREF="http://portico.bl.uk/access/overview.html">British Library</A>, for example, holds the only medieval manuscript of Beowulf in London. Only qualified scholars were allowed to see it until Kevin S. Kiernan of the University of Kentucky <A HREF="http://www.uky.edu/%7Ekiernan/">scanned the manuscript</A> with three different light sources (revealing details not normally apparent to the naked eye) and put the images up on the Internet for anyone to peruse. Tokyo's <A HREF="http://www.ndl.go.jp/index-e.html">National Diet Library</A> is similarly creating highly detailed digital photographs of 1,236 woodblock prints, scrolls and other materials it considers national treasures so that researchers can scrutinize them without handling the originals.
<P>
A second benefit is convenience. Once books are converted to digital form, patrons can retrieve them in seconds rather than minutes. Several people can simultaneously read the same book or view the same picture. Clerks are spared the chore of reshelving. And libraries could conceivably use the Internet to lend their virtual collections to those who are unable to visit in person.
<P>
The third advantage of electronic copies is that they occupy millimeters of space on a magnetic disk rather than meters on a shelf. Expanding library buildings is increasingly costly. The University of California at Berkeley recently spent $46 million on an underground addition to house 1.5 million books--an average cost of $30 per volume. The price of disk storage, in contrast, has fallen to about $2 per 300-page publication and continues to drop.
<P>
<A NAME="1"><B>Technological Trade-offs</B></A>
<P>
Not all these benefits can be enjoyed at once. Each of the several technologies libraries can choose from to digitize their holdings imposes certain trade-offs between preservation, convenience and cost. Scanning pages into digital pictures, for example, is the cheapest. Anne Kenney of Cornell University found in 1992 that 19th-century books could be transformed into page images for $30 to $40 per volume, with most of that cost going to pay the wages of scanner operators. Kodak's PhotoCD technology, which automates the process of digitizing photographic negatives, can lower this cost considerably. Using PhotoCD, Harvard University was able to convert 80,000 posters from its Judaica holdings at a rate of 1,000 a day and a cost of just $2 each. Because libraries are perennially strapped for funds, most of the objects currently scheduled for conversion--including 91 percent of the French national library's electronic books and five million items that the Library of Congress intends to digitize by the year 2000--will be scanned.
<P>
Scanning is also a good choice for the purposes of preservation. It captures the look of a book and any notes scribbled in its margins. And highly detailed nontextual items can be converted into high-resolution images. To be sure, this can produce unwieldy files. Ensuring a legible image of a map 15 by 31 inches with printing only 0.05 inch high, for example, requires scanning it as a 4,500-by-9,300-pixel, 125-megabyte file--large enough to choke a desktop computer. But more powerful machines and new image formats that can be rendered at lower resolutions when desired should eventually remove this obstacle.
<P>
The main drawback of scanning is that it produces only digital images, which, like the typeset pages of books, are good only for viewing. There is as yet no easy way to find a particular quote or passage buried within a scanned book. Pictures of text cannot easily be e-mailed to a friend or pasted into a book report. And for visually impaired users, images of books are no more accessible than the books themselves [see <a href="http://www.sciam.com/prototype/0397issue/0397raman.html">"Netsurfing without a Monitor,"</a> by T. V. Raman].
<P>
For many purposes, electronic text--of the kind that can be manipulated and indexed by word processors--would be much more convenient than the scanned images. The least expensive way to convert printed matter into electronic text is to use optical character-recognition (OCR) software. These programs, which use pattern-matching techniques to extract words letter by letter from scanned images, have indeed grown considerably cheaper and slightly more accurate in recent years. The leading programs can now identify more than 99 percent of the characters in standard test images correctly--but this still means that they produce a dozen or more errors on every page. That many mistakes may be acceptable if the converted text will be used only for indexing and not for reading. Otherwise, the errors must be corrected by hand, a labor-intensive process that costs as much or more than scanning.
<P>
The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation has been using the latter approach in its <A HREF="http://www.jstor.org/">Journal Storage Project</A> to digitize 10 popular economics and history journals. Although the project pays 39 cents a page--the equivalent of $120 for a 300-page book--for scanning, OCR and correction, the foundation believes it will easily recoup this expense through reduced cataloging and storage costs. (As text files, books take up only one tenth the disk space they occupy as page image files.) Plus, the investment will allow readers to identify interesting articles much faster.
<P>
Of course, any archive that aspires to replace paper publications must include the drawings and photographs present in the original works. But illustrations confuse OCR programs. Fortunately, other software has recently been developed that can automatically identify illustrations so that they can be preserved as images and placed at appropriate points in the electronic text. The technique, used by the American Chemical Society to extract almost 400,000 figures and diagrams from 428,000 pages of chemistry journals, relies on the fact that text darkens the page in a regular, predictable way, whereas drawings tend to be lighter and irregular [see illustration on next page].
<P>
The slowest way to get a book into a computer is to type it in. It is also the most expensive method, even though there are now companies in Asia, employing thousands of low-wage typists, that can handle enormous jobs. Keying, especially when performed by those who do not understand the language they are copying, does generally capture misspellings and idiosyncrasies in the original that are often inadvertently "corrected" by OCR. And for formatted texts, such as the <A HREF="http://www.oed.com/public.html">Oxford English Dictionary</A>, with its many different fonts cueing subtle details of information, retyping is the only reliable way to convert the text to digital form. But keying is prohibitively expensive for all but the most important works: ordinary 300-page texts run $600; encoding the document's format in Hypertext Markup Language (HTML, the computer language used on the World Wide Web) or one of its many cousins can cost $900--30 times as much as simply scanning the pages.
<P>
Today nearly all the new material bought by libraries originates in a computer somewhere. Increasingly, libraries are able to license large quantities of material on CD-ROM or some other machine-readable form, thus avoiding the need for conversion altogether. The <A HREF="http://www.ieee.org/">Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)</A>, for example, encodes all the 62 journals it publishes in markup language for on-line viewing. Because patrons generally use the newer items at a library much more frequently than its older holdings, I expect that by 2000, half the material accessed in most major libraries will be digital. Yet it will probably take another decade beyond that before half the libraries' materials will be available in digital formats.
<P>
<B><A NAME="2">Hazards in the Road Ahead</A></B>
<P>
This transition poses some risks. In the 1980s, when many libraries computerized their catalogues, librarians found that after a third or so of the book records were on-line, users tended to ignore the rest. Similarly, as the books themselves move on-line, any library that does not provide on-line access to old material will find those books orphaned. For all its potential to improve scholarship, the electronic library may for a time have the opposite effect.
<P>
The uncertainty over copyright issues for digital works also raises thorny problems. When IBM prepared a CD-ROM for the 500th anniversary of Columbus's famous voyage, the company reportedly had to spend $1 million to obtain the necessary copyright permissions. So far most libraries have dodged the administrative headaches by converting only materials published before 1920 (and thus out of copyright). The <A HREF="http://www.loc.gov/">Library of Congress</A>, for instance, has digitized thousands of Civil War photographs, Continental Congress documents and speeches from World War I--but not Gone with the Wind. When Cornell University chose to convert key agricultural literature from 1850 to 1950 for the benefit of developing nations, it carefully avoided all copyrighted books. 
<P>
Unless libraries are allowed to share digital copies of works as easily as they share actual copies, visitors to a library 20 years hence may find everything on-line except a strange pile of books published from 1920 to 1990, a kind of Sargasso Sea of publishing relegated to the stacks. The restrictions may make it difficult to raise the millions of dollars needed for conversion projects. Gone with the Wind was checked out many more times last year than any World War I oration; digitizing the most popular holdings first is a good way to drum up popular support. 
<P>
Failing that, institutions could team up to share their virtual collections over the Internet, splitting the costs of creating them. But political and organizational questions--How much service should libraries provide to people who are far away? How can the burden of buying and storing material be shared fairly by different institutions?--have so far thwarted attempts at cooperation. Once these obstacles are cleared, and millions of books, pictures and recordings have been digitized, will our children be able to find, view, search and print them? Physically durable devices are not an answer; the problem is technological obsolescence [see "Ensuring the Longevity of Digital Documents," by Jeff Rothenberg; Scientific American, January 1995]. Every few years, librarians will have to move their collections to new formats on new devices. Copying files from one device to another should pose little difficulty--bits are bits. Software formats are more plentiful and changeable, however, so it is easier to fall behind. 
<P>
Moreover, some formats simply cannot be translated into others without losing information. The increasing acceptance of standard formats for images and formatted text helps. But some of the standards, such as SGML (Standardized General Markup Language) for text, are so loosely defined that no single program can easily display all the files that adhere to it.
<P>
Libraries are not the only information repositories going digital. The choices and issues they face also apply to government agencies such as the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the National Archives, to businesses scanning blueprints and health care records--even to the Mormons as they digitize birth and marriage records around the world. Conversion efforts will take decades and cost billions. But just as we now hear Bach fugues played on the piano as well as the harpsichord, read Shakespeare's plays on paper as well as recite them aloud, and watch Charlie Chaplin on videotape as well as film, in time we will use networked computers to enjoy the wealth of human creativity more easily, affordably and gently than ever before.

The program examines the density of black pixels in each vertical stripe down the page to identify column boundaries. Next, it measures the pixel density of horizontal scan lines (orange) and mathematically derives the regular spacing between lines of text. Then the software computes an autocorrelation function (blue) that yields high values for evenly spaced text and much lower values for illustrations. By selecting regions that fall below a certain threshold, the system reliably isolates images.

When I hook up to the Internet to check out the news on CNN, to peruse a colleague's latest paper or to see how Adobe's stock price is doing, I leave the display on my laptop turned off. The batteries last much longer that way. Besides, because I cannot see, a monitor is of no use to me.
<P>
That a blind person can navigate the Internet just as efficiently and effectively as any sighted person attests to the profound potential of digital documents to improve human communication. Printed documents are fixed snapshots of changing ideas; they limit the means of communication to the paper on which they are stored. But in electronic form, documents can become raw material for computers that can extract, catalogue and rearrange the ideas in them. Used properly, technology can separate the message from the medium so that we can access information wherever, whenever and in whatever form we want.
<P>
In my case--and in the case of someone who, while using a telephone or a tiny handheld computer, becomes functionally blind--it is much easier to hear material spoken out loud than to try to view it on a screen. But it is no good to have the computer simply recite the page from top to bottom, as conventional screen-reading programs do. Imagine trying to read a book using only a one-line, 40-character display through which text marches continuously.
<P>
Ideally, an <A HREF="http://www.research.digital.com/CRL/personal/raman/emacspeak/emacspeak.html">aural interface</A> would preserve the best features of its visual counterpart. Consider this special section of Scientific American. By reading the table of contents, skimming the introductory article and flipping through the section, you can quickly obtain a high-level overview and decide which parts you want to read in detail. This works because the information has structure: the contents are arranged in a list, titles are set in large type and so on. But the passive, linear nature of listening typically prohibits such multiple views--it is impossible to survey the whole first and then "zoom in" on portions of interest.
<P>
Computers can remove this roadblock, but they need help. The author scribbling on his virtual page must tag each block of text with a code indicating its function (title, footnote, summary, and so on) rather than its mere appearance (24-point boldface, six-point roman, indented italics, and so on). Programs can then interpret the structural tags to present documents as the reader, rather than the creator, wishes. Your software may render titles in large type, whereas mine could read them &#224; la James Earl Jones (below). Moreover, listeners can browse through a structured text selectively in the same way you skim this printed magazine.
<P>
Fortunately, Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)--the encoding system used to prepare text for the World Wide Web--was designed to capture the structure of documents. If it were used as originally intended, the same electronic source could be rendered in fine detail on a printer, at lower resolution on a screen, in spoken language for functionally blind users, and in myriad other ways to suit individual preferences.
<P>
Unfortunately, HTML is steadily evolving under commercial pressure to enable the design of purely visual Web pages that are completely unusable unless one can see the color graphics and can rapidly download large images. This current rush to design Web pages that can be viewed properly with only the most popular programs and standard displays, and that moreover lack important structural information, threatens to undermine the usefulness of the documents archived on the Internet.
<P>
For users with special needs, the only efficient way to obtain certain information is to get it on-line. In the end, unprocessable digital documents are not only useless to the blind but also represent a missed opportunity for everyone. Archiving texts in a structurally rich form ensures that this vast repository of knowledge can be reused, searched and displayed in ways that best suit individuals' needs and abilities, using software not yet invented or even imagined.

Manuscripts from the library of Alexandria in ancient Egypt disappeared in a fire. The early printed books decayed into unrecognizable shreds. Many of the oldest cinematic films were recycled for their silver content. Unfortunately, history may repeat itself in the evolution of the Internet--and its World Wide Web.
<P>
No one has tried to capture a comprehensive record of the text and images contained in the documents that appear on the Web. The history of print and film is a story of loss and partial reconstruction. But this scenario need not be repeated for the Web, which has increasingly evolved into a storehouse of valuable scientific, cultural and historical information.
<P>
The dropping costs of digital storage mean that a permanent record of the Web and the rest of the Internet can be preserved by a small group of technical professionals equipped with a modest complement of computer workstations and data storage devices. A year ago I and a few others set out to realize this vision as part of a venture known as the <A HREF="http://www.archive.org/">Internet Archive</A>.
<P>
By the time this article is published, we will have taken a snapshot of all parts of the Web freely and technically accessible to us. This collection of data will measure perhaps as much as two trillion bytes (two terabytes) of data, ranging from text to video to audio recording. In comparison, the <A HREF="http://www.loc.gov/">Library of Congress</A> contains about 20 terabytes of text information. In the coming months, our computers and storage media will make records of other areas of the Internet, including the Gopher information system and the Usenet bulletin boards. The material gathered so far has already proved a useful resource to historians. In the future, it may provide the raw material for a carefully indexed, searchable library.
<P>
The logistics of taking a snapshot of the Web are relatively simple. Our Internet Archive operates with a staff of 10 people from offices located in a converted military base--the Presidio--in downtown San Francisco; it also runs an information-gathering computer in the San Diego Supercomputer Center at the University of California at San Diego.
<P>
The software on our computers "crawls" the Net--downloading documents, called pages, from one site after another. Once a page is captured, the software looks for cross references, or links, to other pages. It uses the Web's hyperlinks--addresses embedded within a document page--to move to other pages. The software then makes copies again and seeks additional links contained in the new pages. The crawler avoids downloading duplicate copies of pages by checking the identification names, called uniform resource locators (URLs), against a database. Programs such as Digital Equipment Corporation's <A HREF="http://www.altavista.digital.com/">AltaVista</A> also employ crawler software for indexing Web sites.
<P>
What makes this experiment possible is the dropping cost of data storage. The price of a gigabyte (a billion bytes) of hard-disk space is $200, whereas tape storage using an automated mounting device costs $20 a gigabyte. We chose hard-disk storage for a small amount of data that users of the archive are likely to access frequently and a robotic device that mounts and reads tapes automatically for less used information. A disk drive accesses data in an average of 15 milliseconds, whereas tapes require four minutes. Frequently accessed information might be historical documents or a set of URLs no longer in use.
<P>
We plan to update the information gathered at least every few months. The first full record required nearly a year to compile. In future passes through the Web, we will be able to update only the information that has changed since our last perusal. 
<P>
The text, graphics, audio clips and other data collected from the Web will never be comprehensive, because the crawler software cannot gain access to many of the hundreds of thousands of sites. Publishers restrict access to data or store documents in a format inaccessible to simple crawler programs. Still, the archive gives a feel of what the Web looks like during a given period of time even though it does not constitute a full record.
<P>
After gathering and storing the public contents of the Internet, what services will the archive provide? We possess the capability of supplying documents that are no longer available from the original publisher, an important function if the Web's hypertext system is to become a medium for scholarly publishing. Such a service could also prove worthwhile for business research. And the archival data might serve as a "copy of record" for the government or other institutions with publicly available documents. So, over time, the archive would come to resemble a digital library.
<P>
<B><A NAME="1">Keeping Missing Links</A></B>
<P>
Historians have already found the material useful. David Allison of the Smithsonian Institution has tapped into the archive for a <A HREF="http://www.archive.org/presidents.html">presidential election Web site exhibit</A> at the museum, a project he compares to saving videotapes of early television campaign advertisements. Many of the links for these Web sites, such as those for Texas Senator Phil Gramm's campaign, have already disappeared from the Internet.
<P>
Creating an archive touches on an array of issues, from privacy to copyright. What if a college student created a Web page that had pictures of her then current boyfriend? What if she later wanted to "tear them up," so to speak, yet they lived on in the archive? Should she have the right to remove them? In contrast, should a public figure--a U.S. senator, for instance--be able to erase data posted from his or her college years? Does collecting information made available to the public violate the "fair use" provisions of the copyright law? The issues are not easily resolved.
<P>
To address these worries, we let authors exclude their works from the archive. We are also considering allowing researchers to obtain broad censuses of the archive data instead of individual documents--one could count the total number of references to pachyderms on the Web, for instance, but not look at a specific elephant home page. These measures, we hope, will suffice to allay immediate concerns about privacy and intellectual-property rights. Over time, the issues addressed in setting up the Internet Archive might help resolve the larger policy debates on intellectual property and privacy by testing concepts such as fair use on the Internet.
<P>
The Internet Archive complements other projects intended to ensure the longevity of information on the Internet. The <A HREF="http://palimpsest.stanford.edu/cpa/">Commission on Preservation and Access</A> in Washington, D.C., researches how to ensure that data are not lost as the standard formats for digital storage media change over the years. In another effort, the Internet Engineering Task Force and other groups have labored on technical standards that give a unique identification name to digital documents. These uniform resource names (URNs), as they are called, could supplement the URLs that currently access Web documents. Giving a document a URN attempts to ensure that it can be traced after a link disappears, because estimates put the average lifetime for a URL at 44 days. The URN would be able to locate other URLs that still provided access to the desired documents.
<P>
Other, more limited attempts to archive parts of the Internet have also begun. <A HREF="http://www.dejanews.com/">DejaNews</A> keeps a record of messages on the Usenet bulletin boards, and <A HREF="http://www.inreference.com/">InReference</A> archives Internet mailing lists. Both support themselves with revenue from advertisers, a possible funding source for the Internet Archive as well. Until now, I have funded the project with money I received from the sale of an Internet software and services company. Major computer companies have also donated equipment.
<P>
It will take many years before an infrastructure that assures Internet preservation becomes well established--and for questions involving intellectual-property issues to resolve themselves. For our part, we feel that it is important to proceed with the collection of the archival material because it can never be recovered in the future. And the opportunity to capture a record of the birth of a new medium will then be lost.

<BR>
In recent years, American culture has increased its worldwide influence through international trade and Hollywood productions. As the Internet reaches into ever more remote corners of the globe, an obvious question arises: Will it amplify this trend, so that English is used everywhere? Or will a diversity of languages enrich the on-line universe? Some observers predict that local languages will not survive on-line: English will rule.
<P>
Such a sweeping dominance will have drawbacks. Most people use English as a second language, and their grasp of it may be quite rudimentary--sufficient only for understanding basic information such as the weather report, and sometimes not even that. For more in-depth discussions, almost everyone tends to fall back on his or her native language. If the Internet does not allow multilingual conversations, its role as a facilitator of international communication will be severely limited. Mistakes and misunderstandings will become rampant, and many users will be cut out of the tremendous opportunities that international communication has to offer.
<P>
Several forces will affect the diversity of languages most likely to be found on the network in the future. At present, about 60 percent of the Internet's host computers are located in the U.S. Outside North America and some European countries, most of the world's connections to the Internet are very recent and limited. But computers everywhere are becoming increasingly linked. As the cost of installing communications networks continues to fall, the distribution of Internet users will come to resemble that of computers.
<P>
With its low cost and theoretically easy-to-use technology, the Internet allows some writers--particularly those using Latin alphabets--to publish or exchange messages in their own tongue. Some promoters of native languages have already used the medium to their advantage. For instance, roughly 30 percent of all World Wide Web pages published in French come from Quebec, even though French Canadians represent only 5 percent of all French speakers. But the worldwide reach of the Internet also favors a language that can be, at least superficially, understood by the largest number of people. As a result, I believe the Internet will support many languages for local communications and English for limited international discourse.
<P>
Of course, the technical difficulties of communicating in the majority of the world's languages are not trifling. Hardware and software were first designed to process English text. But difficulties linger even with standard Latin characters. In the early days of the Arpanet--the predecessor of the Internet--only electronic-mail messages coded with seven-bit ASCII text could be sent. (In this code, each of 128 characters is specified by a string of seven binary digits.) Nowadays the Extended <A HREF="http://cnswww.cns.cwru.edu/net/odds-ends/rfc/rfc821">Simple Mail Transport Protocol</A> permits the processing of the eight bits required for communicating in ISO-Latin, prescribed by the International Organization for Standardization. <A HREF="http://www.jhhw.com/iso_table.html">ISO-Latin</A> allows for 256 characters, so that the diacritical signs (such as acute and grave accent marks) of all western European languages can be displayed. But because many interlinked computers on the network have outdated software, the eighth bit sometimes gets dropped, rendering the message almost incomprehensible. Out of 12,000 users who received the daily French news that I sent out in 1995 via the Internet, 8,500 asked to receive a version coded in seven-bit ASCII rather than the crippled ISO-Latin version.
<P>
Although some recent programs can express their output in many different scripts, most are essentially bilingual: the software can deal with only one local language, such as <A HREF="http://www.yahoo.co.jp/">Japanese</A>, and English. One could argue that the technical obstacles to displaying other alphabets are temporary. Unicode (ISO 10646), a coding scheme for characters of most of the world's scripts, is being progressively implemented. The code allows a user to receive almost any language (although it may not always be properly displayed).
<P>
We nonetheless have a long way to go before we get to a truly multilingual Internet, in which an author can include a Greek quotation in a Russian text that will be properly displayed on the reader's computer in South America. Software standards with this kind of capability are emerging. But the primary software producers, in their race to dominate the market, keep producing new versions, giving little chance to the usually small enterprises that develop multilingual products to keep up.
<P>
In real life, interpreters help to overcome language barriers. Human translators can also be employed on the Internet, but given the volume and variety of exchanges, they will play a limited role. Only <A HREF="http://www.cse.ogi.edu/CSLU/HLTsurvey/HLTsurvey.html">machine-aided translation</A> can bring us closer to a world, perhaps a utopia, where all the attendees at a virtual conference of the United Nations can each use his or her native language, which will be simultaneously translated into all other languages.
<P>
Research on machine-aided translation has been pursued over the past 50 years with somewhat mixed results. The systems actually in use are small in number and located mostly in Japan, Canada and Europe--the last of which faces the largest multilingual translation load. Electronic interpreters are usually just bilingual and need to be heavily specialized if they are to produce raw translations good enough to be revisable by human editors.
<P>
The first system available for general public use was <A HREF="http://spitfire.systranmt.com/">Systran</A>, which could translate 14 pairs of languages and was accessible as early as 1983 on the French Minitel network. Used by the European Commission, Systran now converts hundreds of thousands of pages a year. Another success story is the <A HREF="http://www.meteo.fr/e_index.html">Meteo</A> system, which translates Canadian meteorological bulletins between English and French. It handles 80,000 words (about 400 bulletins) every day, with only three to five human editing operations for every 100 words.
<P>
Multilingual translation will benefit from a two-step process now being developed by several groups. The text is first thoroughly analyzed into component parts (title, paragraph, sentence), clarified when possible by a dialogue with the author, then translated into an intermediate, abstract representation--which is used to generate translations in different languages. The effort is worth the expense when the text needs to be translated into more than 10 languages. The <A HREF="http://www.unu.edu/">United Nations University</A> in Tokyo has recently announced a 10-year <A HREF="http://www.unu.edu/ias/research_prog/unl.htm">collaborative project</A> for implementing this two-stage scheme.
<P>
But a truly multilingual Internet will come to pass only with concerted international effort. Will we give it enough priority? The answer is not clear. It is so easy to let ourselves drift toward English as a unique common language.

<BR>
One sometimes hears the Internet characterized as the world's library for the digital age. This description does not stand up under even casual examination. The Internet--and particularly its collection of multimedia resources known as the World Wide Web--was not designed to support the organized publication and retrieval of information, as libraries are. It has evolved into what might be thought of as a chaotic repository for the collective output of the world's digital "printing presses." This storehouse of information contains not only books and papers but raw scientific data, menus, meeting minutes, advertisements, video and audio recordings, and transcripts of interactive conversations. The ephemeral mixes everywhere with works of lasting importance.
<P>
In short, the Net is not a digital library. But if it is to continue to <A HREF="http://www.mit.edu/people/mkgray/net/web-growth-summary.html">grow and thrive</A> as a new means of communication, something very much like traditional library services will be needed to organize, access and preserve networked information. Even then, the Net will not resemble a traditional library, because its contents are more widely dispersed than a standard collection. Consequently, the librarian's classification and selection skills must be complemented by the computer scientist's ability to automate the task of indexing and storing information. Only a synthesis of the differing perspectives brought by both professions will allow this new medium to remain viable.
<P>
At the moment, computer technology bears most of the responsibility for organizing information on the Internet. In theory, software that automatically classifies and indexes collections of digital data can address the glut of information on the Net--and the inability of human indexers and bibliographers to cope with it. Automating information access has the advantage of directly exploiting the rapidly dropping costs of computers and avoiding the high expense and delays of human indexing.
<P>
But, as anyone who has ever sought information on the Web knows, these automated tools categorize information differently than people do. In one sense, the job performed by the various indexing and cataloguing tools known as search engines is highly democratic. Machine-based approaches provide uniform and equal access to all the information on the Net. In practice, this electronic egalitarianism can prove a mixed blessing. Web "surfers" who type in a search request are often overwhelmed by thousands of responses. The search results frequently contain references to irrelevant Web sites while leaving out others that hold important material.
<P>
<B><A NAME="1">Crawling the Web</A></B>
<P>
The nature of electronic indexing can be understood by examining the way Web search engines, such as <A HREF="http://www.lycos.com/">Lycos</A> or Digital Equipment Corporation's <A HREF="http://www.altavista.digital.com/">AltaVista</A>, construct indexes and find information requested by a user. Periodically, they dispatch programs (sometimes referred to as Web crawlers, <A HREF="http://www.cnet.com/Resources/Info/Glossary/Terms/spider.html">spiders</A> or indexing robots) to every site they can identify on the Web--each site being a set of documents, called pages, that can be accessed over the network. The Web crawlers download and then examine these pages and extract indexing information that can be used to describe them. This process--details of which vary among search engines--may include simply locating most of the words that appear in Web pages or performing sophisticated analyses to identify key words and phrases. These data are then stored in the search engine's database, along with an address, termed a uniform resource locator (URL), that represents where the file resides. A user then deploys a browser, such as the familiar <A HREF="http://www.netscape.com/">Netscape</A>, to submit queries to the search engine's database. The query produces a list of Web resources, the URLs that can be clicked on to connect to the sites identified by the search.
<P>
Existing search engines service millions of queries a day. Yet it has become clear that they are less than ideal for retrieving an ever growing body of information on the Web. In contrast to human indexers, automated programs have difficulty identifying characteristics of a document such as its overall theme or its genre--whether it is a poem or a play, or even an advertisement.
<P>
The Web, moreover, still lacks standards that would facilitate automated indexing. As a result, documents on the Web are not structured so that programs can reliably extract the routine information that a human indexer might find through a cursory inspection: author, date of publication, length of text and subject matter. (This information is known as metadata.) A Web crawler might turn up the desired article authored by Jane Doe. But it might also find thousands of other articles in which such a common name is mentioned in the text or in a bibliographic reference.
<P>
Publishers sometimes abuse the indiscriminate character of automated indexing. A Web site can bias the selection process to attract attention to itself by repeating within a document a word, such as "sex," that is known to be queried often. The reason: a search engine will display first the URLs for the documents that mention a search term most frequently. In contrast, humans can easily see around simpleminded tricks. 
<P>
The professional indexer can describe the components of individual pages of all sorts (from text to video) and can clarify how those parts fit together into a database of information. Civil War photographs, for example, might form part of a collection that also includes period music and soldier diaries. A human indexer can describe a site's rules for the collection and retention of programs in, say, an archive that stores Macintosh software. Analyses of a site's purpose, history and policies are beyond the capabilities of a crawler program. 
<P>
Another drawback of automated indexing is that most search engines recognize text only. The intense interest in the Web, though, has come about because of the medium's ability to display images, whether graphics or video clips. Some research has moved forward toward finding colors or patterns within images. But no program can deduce the underlying meaning and cultural significance of an image (for example, that a group of men dining represents the <A HREF="http://sunsite.unc.edu/wm/paint/auth/vinci/lastsupp.jpg">Last Supper</A>).
<P>
At the same time, the way information is structured on the Web is changing so that it often cannot be examined by Web crawlers. Many Web pages are no longer static files that can be analyzed and indexed by such programs. In many cases, the information displayed in a document is computed by the Web site during a search in response to the user's request. The site might assemble a map, a table and a text document from different areas of its database, a disparate collection of information that conforms to the user's query. A newspaper's Web site, for instance, might allow a reader to specify that only stories on the oil-equipment business be displayed in a personalized version of the paper. The database of stories from which this document is put together could not be searched by a Web crawler that visits the site.
<P>
A growing body of research has attempted to address some of the problems involved with automated classification methods. One approach seeks to attach metadata to files so that indexing systems can collect this information. The most advanced effort is the <A HREF="http://www.oclc.org:5046/research/dublin_core/">Dublin Core Metadata</A> program and an affiliated endeavor, the <A HREF="http://cs-tr.cs.cornell.edu/Dienst/UI/2.0/Describe/ncstrl.cornell/TR96-1593">Warwick Framework</A>--the first named after a workshop in Dublin, Ohio, the other for a colloquy in Warwick, England. The workshops have defined a set of metadata elements that are simpler than those in traditional library cataloguing and have also created methods for incorporating them within pages on the Web. 
<P>
Categorization of metadata might range from title or author to type of document (text or video, for instance). Either automated indexing software or humans may derive the metadata, which can then be attached to a Web page for retrieval by a crawler. Precise and detailed human annotations can provide a more in-depth characterization of a page than can an automated indexing program alone.
<P>
Where costs can be justified, human indexers have begun the laborious task of compiling bibliographies of some Web sites. The <A HREF="http://www.yahoo.com/">Yahoo</A> database, a commercial venture, classifies sites by broad subject area. And a research project at the University of Michigan is one of several efforts to develop more formal descriptions of sites that contain material of scholarly interest.
<P>
<B><A NAME="2">Not Just a Library</A></B>
<P>
The extent to which either human classification skills or automated indexing and searching strategies are needed will depend on the people who use the Internet and on the business prospects for publishers. For many communities of scholars, the model of an organized collection--a digital library--still remains relevant. For other groups, an uncontrolled, democratic medium may provide the best vehicle for information dissemination. Some users, from financial analysts to spies, want comprehensive access to raw databases of information, free of any controls or editing. For them, standard search engines provide real benefits because they forgo any selective filtering of data.
<P>
The diversity of materials on the Net goes far beyond the scope of the traditional library. A library does not provide quality rankings of the works in a collection. Because of the greater volume of networked information, Net users want guidance about where to spend the limited amount of time they have to research a subject. They may need to know the three "best" documents for a given purpose. They want this information without paying the costs of employing humans to critique the myriad Web sites. One solution that again calls for human involvement is to share judgments about what is worthwhile. Software-based rating systems have begun to let users describe the quality of particular Web sites [see "<a href="http://www.sciam.com/prototype/0397issue/0397resnick.html">Filtering Information on the Internet</a>," by Paul Resnick].
<P>
Software tools search the Internet and also separate the good from the bad. New programs may be needed, though, to ease the burden of feeding the crawlers that repeatedly scan Web sites. Some Web site managers have reported that their computers are spending enormous amounts of time in providing crawlers with information to index, instead of servicing the people they hope to attract with their offerings.
<P>
To address this issue, <A HREF="http://www.cs.colorado.edu/%7Eschwartz/Home.html">Mike Schwartz</A> and his colleagues at the University of Colorado at Boulder developed software, called <A HREF="http://harvest.transarc.com/afs/transarc.com/public/trg/Harvest/pressrelease.html">Harvest</A>, that lets a Web site compile indexing data for the pages it holds and to ship the information on request to the Web sites for the various search engines. In so doing, Harvest's automated indexing program, or gatherer, can avoid having a Web crawler export the entire contents of a given site across the network. 
<P>
Crawler programs bring a copy of each page back to their home sites to extract the terms that make up an index, a process that consumes a great deal of network capacity (bandwidth). The gatherer, instead, sends only a file of indexing terms. Moreover, it exports only information about those pages that have been altered since they were last accessed, thus alleviating the load on the network and the computers tied to it.
<P>
Gatherers might also serve a different function. They may give publishers a framework to restrict the information that gets exported from their Web sites. This degree of control is needed because the Web has begun to evolve beyond a distribution medium for free information. Increasingly, it facilitates access to proprietary information that is furnished for a fee. This material may not be open for the perusal of Web crawlers. Gatherers, though, could distribute only the information that publishers wish to make available, such as links to summaries or samples of the information stored at a site. 
<P>
As the Net matures, the decision to opt for a given information collection method will depend mostly on users. For which users will it then come to resemble a library, with a structured approach to building collections? And for whom will it remain anarchic, with access supplied by automated systems?
<P>
Users willing to pay a fee to underwrite the work of authors, publishers, indexers and reviewers can sustain the tradition of the library. In cases where information is furnished without charge or is advertiser supported, low-cost computer-based indexing will most likely dominate--the same unstructured environment that characterizes much of the contemporary Internet. Thus, social and economic issues, rather than technological ones, will exert the greatest influence in shaping the future of information retrieval on the Internet.

<BR>
Everyday experience with computers has led many people to believe that anything digital is ripe for copying--computer programs, digital books, newspapers, music and video. Some digital-age pundits have gone so far as to proclaim that the ease of duplicating data heralds an end to copyright: information "wants to be free," they assert. It is impossible to thwart the spread of information, so the argument goes. Anything that can be reduced to bits can be copied.
<P>
This provocative notion undermines the dream behind the creation of the Internet: the possibility of universal access in a digital age--where any author's work could be available to anyone, anywhere, anytime. The experience of most people, however, is not that the Net contains great works and crucial research information. Instead most of what is there is perceived to be of low value.
<P>
The root of the problem is that authors and publishers cannot make a living giving away their work. It now takes only a few keystrokes to copy a paragraph, an entire magazine, a book or even a life's work. Uncontrolled copying has shifted the balance in the social contract between creators and consumers of digital works to the extent that most publishers and authors do not release their best work in digital form.
<P>
Behind the scenes, however, technology is altering the balance again. Over the past few years, several companies, including <A HREF="http://www.folio.com/">Folio</A>, <A HREF="http://www.infomkt.ibm.com/ht3/crypto.htm">IBM</A>, <A HREF="http://www.intertrust.com/">Intertrust</A>, <A HREF="http://www.netrights.com/">Net-Rights</A>, <A HREF="http://www.parc.xerox.com/parc-go.html">Xerox</A> and <A HREF="http://www.wavesys.com/">Wave Systems</A>, have developed software and hardware that enable a publisher to specify terms and conditions for digital works and to control how they can be used. Some legal scholars believe the change is so dramatic that publishers will be left with too much power, undercutting the rights and needs of consumers and librarians.
<P>
Yet consumers' needs can be served even as this transformation progresses. As technology brings more security, better-quality works will reach the Net. Noted authors might be willing to publish directly on the World Wide Web. Although information might not be free, it will most likely cost less because of lower expenses to publishers for billing, distribution and printing. These savings could be passed on to consumers.
<P>
The key to this technological shift is the development of what computer scientists know as trusted systems: hardware and software that can be relied on to follow certain rules. Those rules, called usage rights, specify the cost and a series of terms and conditions under which a digital work can be used. A trusted computer, for instance, would refuse to make unauthorized copies or to play audio or video selections for a user who has not paid for them.
<P>
Trusted systems can take different forms, such as trusted readers for viewing digital books, trusted players for playing audio and video recordings, trusted printers for making copies that contain labels ("watermarks") that denote copyright status, and trusted servers that sell digital works on the Internet. Although the techniques that render a system trustworthy are complex, the result is simple. Publishers can distribute their work--in encrypted form--in such a way that it can be displayed or printed only by trusted machines. At first, trusted security features would be bundled into a printer or handheld digital reader at some additional cost to the consumer, because they would provide the ability to access material of much higher value. Eventually the costs would fall as the technology became widely implemented. Of course, a publisher could still opt to make some works available for free--and a trusted server would still allow anyone to download them.
<P>
How does a trusted system know what the rules are? At Xerox and elsewhere, researchers have attempted to express the fees and conditions associated with any particular work in a formal language that can be precisely interpreted by trusted systems. Such a usage-rights language is essential to electronic commerce: the range of things that people can or cannot do must be made explicit so that buyers and sellers can negotiate and come to agreements. Digital rights fall into several natural categories. Transport rights include permission to copy, transfer or loan. Render rights allow for playing and printing. Derivative-work rights include extracting and editing information and embedding it in other publications. Other rights govern the making and restoring of backup copies.
<P>
<B><A NAME="1">How Trusted Systems Work</A></B>
<P>
Different intellectual works have different security requirements. But trusted systems allow publishers to specify the required security level to safeguard a document or video. The most valuable digital properties might be protected by systems that detect any tampering, set off alarms and erase the information inside. At an intermediate level, a trusted system would block a nonexpert attack with a simple password scheme. And at a lower security level, it would offer few obstacles to infringers but would mark digital works so that their source could be traced (such digital watermarking is now embedded in some image-manipulation software).
<P>
Most trusted computers have the capability to recognize another trusted system, to execute usage rights and to render works so that they either cannot be copied exactly or else carry with them a signature of their origin. For executing a highly secure transaction, two trusted systems exchange data over a communications channel, such as the Internet, providing assurances about their true identities. Managing communications over a secure channel can be accomplished with encryption and what are known as challenge-response protocols.
<P>
One example of the use of this protocol would be if computer A wishes to communicate with computer B. Computer A has to prove to B that it is a trusted system and that it is who it says it is. The interaction begins when A sends B a digital certificate confirming that it has entered its name with a registry of trusted systems. B decrypts the certificate. This action confirms that the certificate is genuine. But because a certificate can be copied, how does B know it is really in communication with A? To verify A's identity, B composes a random string of numbers called a nonce. It encrypts the nonce with a public software key that A has sent within the digital certificate. The public key allows B to send messages that only A will understand when it decrypts them with its own private key.
<P>
B sends the nonce to A, which decrypts it and returns an unencrypted message to B containing the numbers in the nonce. If the return message matches the one it first sent, B knows it is, in fact, communicating with A, because only A could have decrypted the message with its private key. In a few more steps, the two computers may be ready to transfer a book or carry out some other transaction.
<P>
Although not all trusted systems use a challenge-response protocol, most use encryption for exchanging digital works. They may also incorporate other security features. Some systems contain tamperproof clocks to prevent a user from exercising expired rights. Others have secure memories for recording billing transactions. Still others must be connected to an on-line financial clearinghouse during transactions.
<P>
Trusted systems can place identifying watermarks that make it possible to track down unauthorized duplications or alterations. Watermarks maintain a record of each work, the name of the purchaser and a code for the devices on which they are being played. This information can be hidden--in the white space and gray shades of a text image, for instance. As such, the identifying information would be essentially invisible to lawful consumers--and unremovable by would-be infringers.
<P>
Publishers would still need to be watchful for unlicensed distribution of their property. A computer user can always print a digital page and then photocopy it. A digital-movie pirate can sit in front of the screen with a camcorder. What trusted systems prevent, however, is the wholesale copying and distribution of perfect digital originals. With appropriate watermarks, for instance, even pirated copies should still be traceable.
<P>
In digital publishing, trusted systems would allow commerce to proceed in a manner not unlike the way it is carried out in the distribution of paper copies. Suppose that Morgan wishes to buy a digital book on the Web. Copying the book initiates a transaction between the seller's system and Morgan's computer. At the end of the transaction, Morgan has used a credit card or digital cash to buy a copy of a book that can be read with a personal computer or some other digital reader. The entire transaction, moreover, is preceded by an exchange of information in which the seller ensures that Morgan's machine is a trusted system.
<P>
<A NAME="2"><B>Exercising Usage Rights</B></A>
<P>
As with a paper book, Morgan can give away his digital opus. If Morgan's friend Andy asks for it, Morgan can exercise a free-transfer right. At the end of the transaction, the book resides on Andy's reader and not on Morgan's. Andy can then read the book, but Morgan cannot. The transfer preserves the number of copies. Their computers, reading and interpreting the rights attached to the file containing the book, perform the transfer in this way, and neither Morgan nor Andy can command otherwise.
<P>
Morgan can also lend a book to a friend. If Ryan wants to borrow a book for a week, Morgan can transfer it to his computer, but while the digital book is on loan, Morgan cannot use it. When the week runs out, Ryan's system deactivates its copy, and Morgan's system marks its copy as usable again. Without any action by either of them, the digital book has been "returned" to its lender. The right to lend is crucial in enabling the establishment of digital libraries. Usage rights can be tailored for reading a work, printing it or creating derivative works. Depending on the publisher, particular rights can carry a fee or not. For some works, copying is free, but viewing them costs a fee. Fees can be billed for each use or by the hour; they may be billed when the user obtains the work or whenever a right is exercised. There can be discounts, sales and free trials. Distribution can be limited to people who can certify that they are members of a book club, a certain age group or citizens of a particular country.
<P>
Trusted systems can also respect the type of fair-use provisions that currently apply to libraries and some other institutions, allowing a reasonable number of free copies or quotations to be used. Members of the public with special needs--librarians, researchers and teachers--could receive licenses from an organization representing publishers that let them make a certain number of free or discounted copies of a work, if the rights of an author are understood. To balance against the risks of illegal copying, an insurance fund could be set up to protect against losses. 
<P>
What's in all this for consumers? Why should they welcome an arrangement in which they have less than absolute control over the equipment and data in their possession? Why should they pay when they could get things for free? Because unless the intellectual-property rights of publishers are respected and enforced, many desirable items may never be made digitally available, free or at any price. Trusted systems address the lack of control in the digital free-for-all of the Internet. They make it possible not only for entire libraries to go on-line but also for bookstores, newsstands, movie theaters, record stores and other businesses that deal in wholly digital information to make their products available. They give incentives for 24-hour access to quality fiction, video and musical works, with immediate delivery anywhere in the world. In some cases, this technological approach to protecting authors and publishers may even avoid the need for heavy-handed regulations that could stifle digital publishing.
<P>
Fully realizing this vision will necessitate developments in both technology and the marketplace. Users will need routine access to more communications capacity. Publishers must institute measures to ensure the privacy of consumers who use trusted systems, although the same technology that guards the property rights of publishers could also protect personal details about consumers. Trusted systems also presume that direct sales, not advertising, will pay the costs of distributing digital works. Advertising will most likely prevail only for works with substantial mass-market appeal. By protecting authors' rights, trusted systems will enable specialized publishing to flourish: compare, for instance, the diverse collection of books in a library to the relative paucity of programs for television.
<P>
The dynamics of a competitive marketplace form the most imposing roadblock to fashioning protections for digital rights. Several companies have trusted systems and software in the early stages of testing. With some exceptions, though, the software is proprietary and incompatible. Whereas the technology could provide the infrastructure for digital commerce, the greatest benefits will accrue only if the various stakeholders, from buyers and sellers to librarians and lawmakers, work together.

How does anyone find anything among the millions of pages linked together in unpredictable tangles on the World Wide Web? Retrieving certain kinds of popular and crisply defined information, such as telephone numbers and stock prices, is not hard; many Web sites offer these services. What makes the Internet so exciting is its potential to transcend geography to bring information on myriad topics directly to the desktop. Yet without any consistent organization, cyberspace is growing increasingly muddled. Using the tools now available for searching the Web to locate the document in Oregon, the catalogue in Britain or the image in Japan that is most relevant for your purposes can be slow and frustrating.
<P>
More sophisticated algorithms for ranking the relevance of search results may help, but the answer is more likely to arrive in the form of new user interfaces. Today software designed to analyze text and to manipulate large hierarchies of data can provide better ways to look at the contents of the Internet or other large text collections. True, the page metaphor used by most Web sites is familiar and simple. From the perspective of user interface design, however, the page is unnecessarily restrictive. In the future, it will be superseded by more powerful alternatives that allow users to see information on the Web from several perspectives simultaneously.
<P>
Consider Aunt Alice in Arizona, who connects to the Net to find out what kind of edible bulbs, such as garlic or onions, she can plant in her garden this autumn. Somewhere in the vast panorama of the Web lie answers to her question. But how to find them?
<P>
Alice currently has several options, none of them particularly helpful. She can ask friends for recommended Web sites. Or she can turn to Web indexes, of which there are at present two kinds: manually constructed tables of contents that list Web sites by category and search engines that can rapidly scan an index of Web pages for certain key words.
<P>
Using dozens of employees who assign category labels to hundreds of Web sites a day, Yahoo compiles the best-known table of contents. To use Yahoo, one chooses from a menu [see illustration at far left] the category that seems most promising, then views either a more specialized submenu or a list of sites that Yahoo technicians thought belonged in that section. The interface can be awkward, however. The categories are not always mutually exclusive: Should Alice choose "Recreation," "Regional" or "Environment"? Whatever she selects, the previous menu will vanish from view, forcing her either to make a mental note of all the alternative paths she could have taken or to retrace her steps methodically and reread each menu. If Alice guesses wrong about which subcategory is most relevant (it is not "Environment"), she has to back up and try again. If the desired information is deep in the hierarchy, or is not available at all, this process can be time-consuming and aggravating.
<P>
<B><A NAME="1">The (Slow) Speed of Thought</A></B>
<P>
Research in the field of information visualization during the past decade has produced several useful techniques for transforming abstract data sets, such as Yahoo's categorized list, into displays that can be explored more intuitively. One strategy is to shift the user's mental load from slower, thought-intensive processes such as reading to faster, perceptual processes such as pattern recognition. It is easier, for example, to compare bars in a graph than numbers in a list. Color is very useful for helping people quickly select one particular word or object from a sea of others.
<P>
Another strategy is to exploit the illusion of depth that is possible on a computer screen if one departs from the page model. When three-dimensional displays are animated, the perceptual clues offered by perspective, occlusion and shadows can help clarify relations among large groups of objects that would simply clutter a flat page. Items of greater interest can be moved to the foreground, pushing less interesting objects toward the rear or the periphery. In this way, the display can help the user preserve a sense of context.
<P>
Such awareness of one's virtual surroundings can make information access a more exploratory process. Users may find partial results that they would like to reuse later, hit on better ways to express their queries, go down paths they didn't think relevant at first--perhaps even think about their topic from a whole new perspective. Aunt Alice could accomplish a lot of this by jotting down notes as she pokes around Yahoo, but a prototype interface developed by my colleagues at the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center aims to make such sense-making activities more efficient.
<P>
Called the <A HREF="http://www.xerox.com/XSoft/vis_prods.html">Information Visualizer</A>, the software draws an animated 3-D tree that links each category with all its subcategories. If Alice searches the Yahoo tree for "garden," all six areas of Yahoo in which "garden" or "gardening" is a subcategory will light up. She can then "spin" each of these categories to the front to explore where it leads. When one path hits a dead end, the roads not taken are just a click away.
<P>
When Alice finds useful documents, this interface allows her to store them, along with the search terms that took her to them, in a virtual book. She can place the book on a virtual bookshelf where it is readily visible and clearly labeled. Next weekend, Alice can pick up where she left off by reopening her book, tearing out a page and using it to resubmit her query.
<P>
Our interface does not offer much help to the Sisyphean attempt to organize the contents of the entire Web. Because new sites appear on the Web far faster than they can be indexed by hand, the fraction listed by Yahoo (or any other service) is shrinking rapidly. And sites, such as Time magazine's, that contain articles on many topics often appear under only a few of the many relevant categories.
<P>
Search engines such as Excite and <A HREF="http://www.parc.xerox.com/">AltaVista</A> are considerably more comprehensive--but this is their downfall. Poor Aunt Alice, entering the string of key words "garlic onion autumn fall garden grow" into Excite will, as of this writing, retrieve 583,430 Web pages, which (at two minutes per page) would take more than two years to browse through nonstop. Long lists littered with unwanted, irrelevant material are an unavoidable result of any search that strives to retrieve all relevant documents; conversely, a more discriminating search will almost certainly exclude many useful pages.
<P>
The short, necessarily vague queries that most Internet search services encourage with their cramped entry forms exacerbate this problem. One way to help users describe what they want more precisely is to let them use logical operators such as AND, OR and NOT to specify which words must (or must not) be present in retrieved pages. But many users find such Boolean notation intimidating, confusing or simply unhelpful. And even experts' queries are only as good as the terms they choose.
<P>
When thousands of documents match a query, giving more weight to those containing more search terms or uncommon key words (which tend to be more important) still does not guarantee that the most relevant pages will appear near the top of the list. Consequently, the user of a search engine often has no choice but to sift through the retrieved entries one by one.
<P>
<B><A NAME="2">Organizing Search Results</A></B>
<P>
A better solution is to design user interfaces that impose some order on the vast pools of information generated by Web searches. Algorithms exist that can automatically group pages into certain categories, as Yahoo technicians do. But that approach does not address the fact that most texts cannot be shoehorned into just one category. Real objects can often be assigned a single place in a taxonomy (an onion is a kind of vegetable), but it is a rare Web page indeed that is only about onions. Instead a typical text might discuss produce distributors, or soup recipes, or a debate over planting imported versus indigenous vegetables. The tendency in building hierarchies is to create ever more specific categories to handle such cases ("onion distributors," for example, or "soup recipes with onion," or "agricultural debates about onions," and so on). A more manageable solution is to describe documents by whole sets of categories that apply to them, along with another set of attributes (such as source, date, genre and author). Researchers in Stanford University's digital library project are developing an interface called <A HREF="http://oi.stanford.edu/">SenseMaker</A> along these lines.
<P>
At <A HREF="http://www.parc.xerox.com/">Xerox PARC</A>, we have developed an alternative scheme for grouping the list of pages retrieved by a search engine. Called <A HREF="http://www.soe.berkeley.edu/~schank/parc/pp_txt.htm">Scatter/Gather</A>, the technique creates a table of contents that changes along with a user's growing understanding of what kind of documents are available and which are most relevant.
<P>
Imagine that Aunt Alice runs her search using Excite and retrieves the first 500 Web pages it suggests. The Scatter/Gather system can then analyze those pages and divide them into groups based on their similarity to one another [see upper illustration on next page]. Alice can rapidly scan each cluster and select those groups that appear interesting. 
<P>
Although evaluation of user behavior is an inexact process that is difficult to evaluate, preliminary experiments suggest that clustering often helps users zero in on documents of interest. Once Alice has decided, for example, that she is particularly keen on the cluster of 293 texts summarized by "bulb," "soil" and "gardener," she can run them through Scatter/Gather once again, rescattering them into a new set of more specific clusters. Within several iterations, she can whittle 500 mostly irrelevant pages down to a few dozen useful ones.
<P>
By itself, document grouping does not solve another common problem with Web-based search engines such as Excite: 
ithe mystery of why they list the documents they do. But if the entry form encourages users to break up their 
query into several groups of related key words, then a graphical interface can indicate which search topics 
occurred where in the retrieved documents. If hits on all topics overlap within a single passage, the document is 
more likely to be relevant, so the program ranks it higher. Alice might have a hard time spelling out in advance 
which topics must occur in the document or how close together they must lie. But she is likely to recognize what 
she wants when she sees it and to be able to fine-tune her query in response. More important, the technique, 
which I call <A HREF="http://www.acm.org/sigchi/chi95/Electronic/documnts/papers/mah_bdy.htm">TileBars</A>, can help users decide which documents to view and can speed them directly to the most relevant passages.
<P>
The potential for innovative user interfaces and text analysis techniques has only begun to be tapped. Other techniques that combine statistical methods with rules of thumb can automatically summarize documents and place them within an existing category system. They can suggest synonyms for query words and answer simple questions. None of these advanced capabilities has yet been integrated into Web search engines, but they will be. In the future, user interfaces may well evolve even beyond two- and three-dimensional displays, drawing on such other senses as hearing to help Aunt Alices everywhere find their bearings and explore new vistas on the information frontier.

<P>
The Internet is often called a global village, suggesting a huge but close-knit community that shares common values and experiences. The metaphor is misleading. Many cultures coexist on the Internet and at times clash. In its public spaces, people interact commercially and socially with strangers as well as with acquaintances and friends. The city is a more apt metaphor, with its suggestion of unlimited opportunities and myriad dangers.
<P>
To steer clear of the most obviously offensive, dangerous or just boring neighborhoods, users can employ some mechanical filtering techniques that identify easily definable risks. One technique is to analyze the contents of on-line material. Thus, virus-detection software searches for code fragments that it knows are common in virus programs. Services such as <A HREF="http://www.altavista.digital.com/">AltaVista</A> and <A HREF="http://lycos.cs.cmu.edu/">Lycos</A> can either highlight or exclude World Wide Web documents containing particular words. My colleagues and I have been at work on another filtering technique based on electronic labels that can be added to Web sites to describe digital works. These labels can convey characteristics that require human judgment--whether the Web page is funny or offensive--as well as information not readily apparent from the words and graphics, such as the Web site's policies about the use or resale of personal data.
<P>
The Massachusetts Institute of Technology's <A HREF="http://www.w3.org">World Wide Web Consortium</A> has developed a set of technical standards called PICS (Platform for Internet Content Selection) so that people can electronically distribute descriptions of digital works in a simple, computer-readable form. Computers can process these labels in the background, automatically shielding users from undesirable material or directing their attention to sites of particular interest. The original impetus for <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/PICS">PICS</A> was to allow parents and teachers to screen materials they felt were inappropriate for children using the Net. Rather than censoring what is distributed, as the <A HREF="http://www.sciam.com/explorations/062496explorations.html">Communications Decency Act</A> and other legislative initiatives have tried to do, PICS enables users to control what they receive. 
<P>
<B><A NAME="1">What's in a Label?</A></B>
<P>
PICS labels can describe any aspect of a document or a Web site. The first labels identified items that might run afoul of local indecency laws. For example, the <A HREF="http://www.rsac.org/">Recreational Software Advisory Council (RSAC)</A> adapted its computer-game rating system for the Internet. Each RSACi (the "i" stands for "Internet") label has four numbers, indicating levels of violence, nudity, sex and potentially offensive language. Another organization, <A HREF="http://www.safesurf.com/index.html">SafeSurf</A>, has developed a vocabulary with nine separate scales. Labels can reflect other concerns beyond indecency, however. A privacy vocabulary, for example, could describe Web sites' information practices, such as what personal information they collect and whether they resell it. Similarly, an intellectual-property vocabulary could describe the conditions under which an item could be viewed or reproduced [see "<a href="http://www.sciam.com/prototype/0397issue/0397stefik.html">Trusted Systems</a>," by Mark Stefik]. And various Web-indexing organizations could develop labels that indicate the subject categories or the reliability of information from a site.
<P>
Labels could even help protect computers from exposure to viruses. It has become increasingly popular to download small fragments of computer code, bug fixes and even entire applications from Internet sites. People generally trust that the software they download will not introduce a virus; they could add a margin of safety by checking for labels that vouch for the software's safety. The vocabulary for such labels might indicate which virus checks have been run on the software or the level of confidence in the code's safety.
<P>
In the physical world, labels can be attached to the things they describe, or they can be distributed separately. For example, the new cars in an automobile showroom display stickers describing features and prices, but potential customers can also consult independent listings such as consumer-interest magazines. Similarly, PICS labels can be attached or detached. An information provider that wishes to offer descriptions of its own materials can directly embed labels in Web documents or send them along with items retrieved from the Web. Independent third parties can describe materials as well. For instance, the Simon Wiesenthal Center, which tracks the activities of neo-Nazi groups, could publish PICS labels that identify Web pages containing neo-Nazi propaganda. These labels would be stored on a separate server; not everyone who visits the neo-Nazi pages would see the Wiesenthal Center labels, but those who were interested could instruct their software to check automatically for the labels.
<P>
Software can be configured not merely to make its users aware of labels but to act on them directly. Several Web software packages, including <A HREF="http://www.cyberpatrol.com/">CyberPatrol</A> and <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/ie/">Microsoft's Internet Explorer</A>, already use the PICS standard to control users' access to sites. Such software can make its decisions based on any PICS-compatible vocabulary. A user who plugs in the RSACi vocabulary can set the maximum acceptable levels of language, nudity, sex and violence. A user who plugs in a software-safety vocabulary can decide precisely which virus checks are required. 
<P>
In addition to blocking unwanted materials, label processing can assist in finding desirable materials. If a user expresses a preference for works of high literary quality, a search engine might be able to suggest links to items labeled that way. Or if the user prefers that personal data not be collected or sold, a Web server can offer a version of its service that does not depend on collecting personal information.
<P>
<B><A NAME="2">Establishing Trust</A></B>
<P>
Not every label is trustworthy. The creator of a virus can easily distribute a misleading label claiming that the software is safe. Checking for labels merely converts the question of whether to trust a piece of software to one of trusting the labels. One solution is to use cryptographic techniques that can determine whether a document has been changed since its label was created and to ensure that the label really is the work of its purported author.
<P>
That solution, however, simply changes the question again, from one of trusting a label to one of trusting the label's author. Alice may trust Bill's labels if she has worked with him for years or if he runs a major software company whose reputation is at stake. Or she might trust an auditing organization of some kind to vouch for Bill.
<P>
Of course, some labels address matters of personal taste rather than points of fact. Users may find themselves not trusting certain labels, simply because they disagree with the opinions behind them. To get around this problem, systems such as <A HREF="http://www.cs.umn.edu/Research/GroupLens/">GroupLens</A> and <A HREF="http://www.agentsinc.com/">Firefly</A> recommend books, articles, videos or musical selections based on the ratings of like-minded people. People rate items with which they are familiar, and the software compares those ratings with opinions registered by other users. In making recommendations, the software assigns the highest priority to items approved by people who agreed with the user's evaluations of other materials. People need not know who agreed with them; they can participate anonymously, preserving the privacy of their evaluations and reading habits.
<P>
Widespread reliance on labeling raises a number of social concerns. The most obvious are the questions of who decides how to label sites and what labels are acceptable. Ideally, anyone could label a site, and everyone could establish individual filtering rules. But there is a concern that authorities could assign labels to sites or dictate criteria for sites to label themselves. In an example from a different medium, the television industry, under pressure from the U.S. government, has begun to rate its shows for age appropriateness. 
<P>
Mandatory self-labeling need not lead to censorship, so long as individuals can decide which labels to ignore. But people may not always have this power. Improved individual control removes one rationale for central control but does not prevent its imposition. Singapore and China, for instance, are experimenting with national "firewalls"--combinations of software and hardware that block their citizens' access to certain newsgroups and Web sites. 
<P>
Another concern is that even without central censorship, any widely adopted vocabulary will encourage people to make lazy decisions that do not reflect their values. Today many parents who may not agree with the criteria used to assign movie ratings still forbid their children to see movies rated PG-13 or R; it is too hard for them to weigh the merits of each movie by themselves. 
<P>
Labeling organizations must choose vocabularies carefully to match the criteria that most people care about, but even so, no single vocabulary can serve everyone's needs. Labels concerned only with rating the level of sexual content at a site will be of no use to someone concerned about hate speech. And no labeling system is a full substitute for a thorough and thoughtful evaluation: movie reviews in a newspaper can be far more enlightening than any set of predefined codes.
<P>
Perhaps most troubling is the suggestion that any labeling system, no matter how well conceived and executed, will tend to stifle noncommercial communication. Labeling requires human time and energy; many sites of limited interest will probably go unlabeled. Because of safety concerns, some people will block access to materials that are unlabeled or whose labels are untrusted. For such people, the Internet will function more like broadcasting, providing access only to sites with sufficient mass-market appeal to merit the cost of labeling. 
<P>
While lamentable, this problem is an inherent one that is not caused by labeling. In any medium, people tend to avoid the unknown when there are risks involved, and it is far easier to get information about material that is of wide interest than about items that appeal to a small audience.
<P>
Although the Net nearly eliminates the technical barriers to communication with strangers, it does not remove the social costs. Labels can reduce those costs, by letting us control when we extend trust to potentially boring or dangerous software or Web sites. The challenge will be to let labels guide our exploration of the global city of the Internet and not limit our travels.

<TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH=336><BR>

<P>During past centuries, most people who thought of smuggling at all considered
it a somewhat esoteric profession--a way of avoiding taxes and supplying
goods that could not be obtained through licit channels. Drugs added a
more insidious dimension to the problem during the 1970s and 1980s, but
trade in uranium and plutonium during the past five years has given smuggling
unprecedented relevance to international security.</P>

<P>Yet there is considerable controversy over the threat nuclear smuggling
poses. Some analysts dismiss it as a minor nuisance. Not only has very
little material apparently changed hands, they argue, but, with a few exceptions,
most of it has not even been close to weapons grade. None of the radioactive
contraband that has been confiscated by Western authorities has been traced
unequivocally to weapons stockpiles. Some of the plutonium that smugglers
try to peddle comes from smoke detectors.</P>

<P>In addition to these amateur smugglers, there are many scam artists
who sell stable elements that have been rendered temporarily radioactive
by exposing them to radiation or who obtain large advances based on minute
samples. Indeed, many of those who traffic in nuclear materials do so with
little or no idea of what they are stealing--one Pole died of radiation
poisoning after carrying cesium in his shirt pocket, and a butcher in St.
Petersburg kept uranium in a pickle jar in his refrigerator.</P>

<P><A NAME="1"></A><B>The Danger Is Real</B> </P>

<P>Based on the bumbling nature of most of the smuggling plots uncovered
so far, some well-informed observers have suggested that, in Germany at
least, the only buyers are journalists, undercover police and intelligence
agents. Some go even further and contend that pariah states such as Iraq,
Iran, Libya or North Korea may not be interested in acquiring illicit nuclear
arsenals at a time when they are in the process of trying to reestablish
normal relations with the West.</P>

<P>Nevertheless, nuclear smuggling presents a grave challenge. In almost
all illicit markets, only the tip of the iceberg is visible, and there
is no reason why the nuclear-materials black market should be an exception.
Police seize at most 40 percent of the drugs coming into the U.S. and probably
a smaller percentage of those entering western Europe. The supply of nuclear
materials is obviously much smaller, but law-enforcement agents are also
less experienced at stopping shipments of uranium than they are in seizing
marijuana or hashish. To believe that authorities are stopping more than
80 percent of the trade would be foolish.</P>

<P>Moreover, even a small leakage rate could have vast consequences. Although
secrecy rules make precise numbers impossible to get, Thomas B. Cochran
of the Natural Resources Defense Council in Washington, D.C., estimates
that a bomb requires between three and 25 kilograms of enriched uranium
or between one and eight kilograms of plutonium. A kilogram of plutonium
occupies about 50.4 cubic centimeters, or one seventh the volume of a standard
aluminum soft-drink can.</P>

<P>Although rigorous screening of all international shipments could catch
some radioactive transfers, several of the most dangerous isotopes, such
as uranium 235 and plutonium 239, are only weakly radioactive and so could
be easily shielded from detection by Geiger counters or similar equipment.
X-ray and neutron-scattering equipment, such as that in place at airports
to detect chemical explosives, could uncover illicit radionuclides as well,
but because it is not designed for the task its practical effectiveness
is limited.</P>

<P>If the amounts of material needed for nuclear weapons are small in absolute
terms, they are minuscule in comparison to the huge stockpiles of highly
enriched uranium and plutonium, especially in Russia, where both inventory
control and security remain quite problematic. World stocks of plutonium,
which totaled almost 1,100 tons in 1992, will reach between 1,600 and 1,700
tons by the year 2000, enough to make as many as 200,000 10-kiloton bombs.
As disarmament agreements are implemented, another 100 tons of refined
weapons-grade plutonium will become available in the U.S. and Russia--ironically,
in the post-cold war world, one of the safest places for plutonium may
well be on top of a missile.</P>

<P><A NAME="2"></A><B>Security Is Lax</B> </P>

<P>In addition, the U.S. and former Soviet states each hold about 650 tons
of highly enriched uranium. These large stockpiles are all the more disturbing
because control over them is fragile and incomplete. The Russian stores
in particular suffer from sloppy security, poor inventory management and
inadequate measurements. Equipment for determining the amount of plutonium
that has been produced is primitive--yet without a clear baseline, it is
impossible to know what may be missing.</P>

<P>Virtually nonexistent security at nuclear installations compounds the
problem. The collapse of the KGB took with it much of the nuclear-control
system. Ironically, under the Soviet regime security was tight but often
superfluous. Nuclear workers were loyal and well paid and enjoyed high
status. As pay and conditions worsen, however, disaffection has become
widespread. With an alienated workforce suffering from low and often late
wages, the incentives for nuclear theft have become far greater at the
very time that restrictions and controls have deteriorated.</P>

<P>In November 1993 a thief climbed through a hole in a fence and entered
a supposedly secure area in the Sevmorput shipyard near Murmansk. He used
a hacksaw to cut through a padlock on a storage compartment that held fuel
for nuclear submarines and stole parts of three fuel assemblies, each containing
4.5 kilograms of enriched uranium. Although the uranium was eventually
recovered, Mikhail Kulik, the official who conducted the investigation
of the theft, was scathing in his report: there were no alarm systems,
no lighting and few guards. Kulik noted: &quot;Even potatoes are probably
much better guarded today than radioactive materials.&quot; Improvements
in security at the base since the incident have been very modest.</P>

<P>The situation is not entirely gloomy. According to reports, some of
the nuclear cities--formerly secret sites where bombs were designed and
built--are well secured, and the controls on weapons-grade materials are
generally more stringent than those on lower-quality items. Although efforts
to enter the closed zone at Arzamas-16 (the Russian weapons-design laboratory
that is a rough counterpart to Los Alamos National Laboratory in the U.S.)
have reportedly doubled during the past year, the security system there
appears to remain effective. Moscow is also making efforts to reestablish
security throughout its nuclear industry--in some cases, such as the Kurchatov
Institute of Atomic Energy in Moscow, with direct assistance from the U.S.
Yet the task is formidable. Nearly 1,000 stores of enriched uranium and
plutonium are scattered throughout the former Soviet Union.</P>

<P><A NAME="3"></A><B>The Rise of Smuggling Networks</B> </P>

<P>Against this background, it is hardly surprising that the number of
nuclear-smuggling incidents--both real and fake--has increased during the
past few years. German authorities, for example, reported 41 in 1991, 158
in 1992, 241 in 1993 and 267 in 1994. Although the vast majority of cases
do not involve material suitable for bombs, as the number of incidents
increases so does the likelihood that at least a few will include weapons-grade
alloys.</P>

<P>In March 1993, according to a report from Istanbul, six kilograms of
enriched uranium entered Turkey through the Aralik border gate in Kars
Province. The material had apparently been brought from Tashkent to Grozniy,
where Chechen crime groups entered the picture, then to Nakhichevan via
Georgia, before arriving in Istanbul. Although confirmation of neither
the incident nor the degree of the uranium's enrichment was forthcoming,
it raised fears that Chechen &quot;Mafia&quot; groups had obtained access
to enriched uranium in Kazakhstan. Kazakhstan's agreement in 1994 to transfer
enriched uranium to the U.S. suggests that such speculation may have had
some basis.</P>

<P>In October 1993 police in Istanbul seized 2.5 kilograms of uranium 238
and detained four Turkish businessmen, along with four suspected agents
of Iran's secret service. A Munich magazine later reported that the uranium
may have gone to Turkey via Germany. According to one of the Turkish detainees
(a professor who had previously been involved in the smuggling of antiquities),
accomplices flew the uranium by Cessna to Istanbul from Hartenholm, a private
airfield near Hamburg owned by Iranian arms dealers.</P>

<P>Significantly, 1994 saw several incidents involving material that was
either weapons grade or very close to it. On May 10 police in Tengen, Germany,
found six grams of plutonium 239 while searching the home of businessman
Adolf Jaekle for other contraband. The plutonium, which was in a container
in the garage, was discovered only by accident. Jaekle had widespread connections,
including links with former officers of the KGB and the Stasi (the East
German secret police) and with Kintex, a Bulgarian arms company that has
long been suspected of a wide range of nefarious activities. Much of the
initial speculation has dissipated, but important questions about the Jaekle
case remain unanswered. It would be unwise to exclude the possibility that
the plutonium was simply a sample for a much larger delivery.</P>

<P>On August 10 authorities in Munich arrested a Colombian dentist and
two Spaniards in possession of 363.4 grams of high-grade plutonium and
201 grams of lithium 6 (a component of hydrogen bombs). They had brought
their contraband to Munich from Moscow on a Lufthansa flight and were captured
amid much fanfare. It later turned out that agents from the German federal
intelligence body, the BND, had induced the three men to bring in the material.</P>

<P>The operation caused great controversy in Germany; BND agents were accused
of helping to create rather than control the nuclear-smuggling problem.
The three men were connected neither with Colombian drug gangs nor Basque
terrorists; there was no evidence that they were experienced smugglers.
They simply had financial problems and had been trying to solve them by
selling the lithium and plutonium.</P>

<P>In all the controversy over the propriety of the BND's actions, however,
an important point was lost. Even as amateurs, the three men succeeded
in obtaining a significant amount of high-grade plutonium.</P>

<P>Then, on December 14, police in Prague arrested three men in a car with
2.7 kilograms of highly enriched (87.7 percent) uranium 235. Two were nuclear
workers who had come to the Czech Republic in 1994: a Russian from a town
near Obninsk and a Belarusian from Minsk. The third was a Czech nuclear
physicist, Jaroslav Vagner, who had not been officially employed in the
nuclear industry for several years. In mid-1994 a similarly enriched sample
of uranium had apparently turned up in Landshut, Bavaria, and on March
22, 1995, two more men, one of them a police officer, were arrested in
connection with the December incident.</P>

<P>The number of smuggling cases in Germany, at least, has declined since
these highly publicized arrests. Traffickers appear to be going elsewhere.
Some have gone through Switzerland and Austria and into Italy. More may
be taking the routes to the south through the Central Asian republics and
the Black Sea. As former International Atomic Energy Agency inspector David
Kay has pointed out, these paths in effect reverse those used by the KGB
to smuggle Western goods into the former Soviet Union. Border controls
in these areas are much weaker than those going into western Europe, and
the potential clients are closer.</P>

<P>Some of the seizures in Germany and Turkey make it fairly clear that
outlaw states such as Iran may in fact be looking for high-quality nuclear
material. It appears, indeed, that some of them have set up their own networks.
Both Libya and Iraq have experience with such methods, since each nation
set up front companies to facilitate the illicit diversion of precursor
chemicals and equipment to develop chemical weapons.</P>

<P>Furthermore, as the Jaekle case implies, smugglers are not all blundering
amateurs. Although there is no monolithic nuclear Mafia, ex-spies from
the former Soviet bloc countries appear to be taking a leading role in
the professional networks. They have apparently been joined by entrepreneurs,
often involved in the arms business, whose dealings span a continuum from
the licit, through the shady, to the illicit.</P>

<P>Not surprisingly, because nuclear smuggling is a potentially profitable
business, organized crime groups have also become involved. Some Turkish
gangs appear to be engaged in the trade--having graduated from clandestine
export of antiquities, they treat uranium as just another commodity.</P>

<P>In Italy, Romano Dolce, a magistrate investigating the nuclear trade,
was arrested for participation in the very crimes he was pursuing. This
scandal aroused considerable speculation that he had focused on some cases
in order to divert attention from other, more significant transactions.</P>

<P>Perhaps the most insistent question, however, concerns the involvement
of Russian organized crime. Although nuclear trafficking does not seem
to be a priority for these groups--other activities are both more immediately
lucrative and less risky--there is growing evidence that some Russian criminal
groups are diversifying into trade in radioactives.</P>

<P><A NAME="4"></A><B>Enforcement Efforts Lag</B> </P>

<P>Even though serious efforts are being made to attack the problem at
the source, the international community has been slow to respond to the
dangers that nuclear smuggling presents. The Russian nuclear regulatory
agency, GAN, now has 1,200 employees, but the degree of authority it can
actually wield over the old nuclear bureaucracy--both civilian and military--is
uncertain.</P>

<P>Furthermore, even if GAN is successful, it will take several years to
upgrade safeguards, and smugglers are not going to sit by idly in the meantime.
As a result, there will be a premium on good intelligence and law enforcement
during the remainder of the 1990s. Unfortunately, international agencies
with nuclear expertise are not yet cooperating effectively with those whose
responsibility is to stop illicit trade. The IAEA and the United Nations
Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Branch are both located in Vienna's
International Center, but the IAEA's mandate does not allow it to engage
in investigative activity. As a result, contacts between the two have been
little more than desultory.</P>

<P>In Washington, meanwhile, early responses to the smuggling problem have
been ill conceived and poorly coordinated. Since 1994, the Federal Bureau
of Investigations has taken the lead and has been working closely with
the Defense Nuclear Agency and the Defense Intelligence Agency, but the
U.S. remains some distance from a comprehensive policy.</P>

<P>We suggest that systematic multinational measures be taken as soon as
possible to inhibit theft at the source, to disrupt trafficking and to
deter buyers. The U.S., Germany, Russia and other nations with an interest
in the nuclear problem should set up a &quot;flying squad&quot; with an
investigative arm, facilities for counterterrorist and counterextortion
actions and a disaster management team.</P>

<P>Such an idea seems very far-fetched at the moment, at least in part
because of a continuing reluctance to recognize the severity of the threat.
It would be a tragedy if governments were to accept the need for a more
substantive program only after a nuclear catastrophe.</P>

<B>HARVEST,</B> a new search-engine architecture, would derive indexing terms using software called gatherers (brown structures) that reside at Web sites (boxes near globes) or operate in a central computer (hexagon). By so doing, the search engine can avoid downloading all the documents from a Web site, an activity that burdens network traffic. The search engine's server (suspended structure at center) would simply ask the gatherers (dark blue arrows) for a file of key words (red arrows) that could be processed into an index (white page) for querying by a user.

<H2>Finding Pictures on the Web</H2>
<I>by Gary Stix, staff writer</I>
</CENTER>
<P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="./IMG/lynch5b.gif" ALIGN=TOP WIDTH="373" HEIGHT="214" BORDER="0"></CENTER>
<BR CLEAR="all"><FONT SIZE="-1">Image: IBM Corporation/Romtech/Corel</FONT>

<P>
The Internet came into its own a few years ago, when the World Wide Web arrived with its dazzling array of photography, animation, graphics, sound and video that ranged in subject matter from high art to the patently lewd. Despite the multimedia barrage, finding things on the hundreds of thousands of Web sites still mostly requires searching indexes for words and numbers.
<P>
Someone who types the words "French flag" into the popular search engine AltaVista might retrieve the requested graphic, as long as it were captioned by those two identifying words. But what if someone could visualize a blue, white and red banner but did not know its country of origin?
<P>
Ideally, a search engine should allow the user to draw or scan in a rectangle with vertical thirds that are colored blue, white and red--and then find any matching images stored on myriad Web sites. In the past few years, techniques that combine key-word indexing with image analysis have begun to pave the way for the first image search engines.
<P>
Although these prototypes suggest possibilities for the indexing of visual information, they also demonstrate the crudeness of existing tools and the continuing reliance on text to track down imagery. One project, called <A HREF="http://disney.ctr.columbia.edu/WebSEEk/">WebSEEk</A>, based at Columbia University, illustrates the workings of an image search engine. WebSEEk begins by downloading files found by trolling the Web. It then attempts to locate file names containing acronyms, such as GIF or MPEG, that designate graphics or video content. It also looks for words in the names that might identify the subject of the files. When the software finds an image, it analyzes the prevalence of different colors and where they are located. Using this information, it can distinguish among photographs, graphics and black-and-white or gray images. The software also compresses each picture so that it can be represented as an icon, a miniature image for display alongside other icons. For a video, it will extract key frames from different scenes.
<P>
A user begins a search by selecting a category from a menu--"cats," for example. WebSEEk provides a sampling of icons for the "cats" category. To narrow the search, the user can click on any icons that show black cats. Using its previously generated color analysis, the search engine looks for matches of images that have a similar color profile. The presentation of the next set of icons may show black cats--but also some marmalade cats sitting on black cushions. A visitor to WebSEEk can refine a search by adding or excluding certain colors from an image when initiating subsequent queries. Leaving out yellows or oranges might get rid of the odd marmalade. More simply, when presented with a series of icons, the user can also specify those images that do not contain black cats in order to guide the program away from mistaken choices. So far WebSEEk has downloaded and indexed more than 650,000 pictures from tens of thousands of Web sites.
<P>
Other image-searching projects include efforts at the <A HREF="http://infolab.cs.uchicago.edu/webseer/">University of Chicago</A>, the <A HREF="http://vision.ucsd.edu/">University of California</A> at San Diego, <A HREF="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/scs/scs.html">Carnegie Mellon University</A>, the <A HREF="http://vismod.www.media.mit.edu/vismod/">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</A>'s Media Lab  and the <A HREF="http://elib.cs.berkeley.edu/">University of California at Berkeley</A>. A number of commercial companies, including <A HREF="http://www.ibm.com/">IBM</A> and <A HREF="Http://www.virage.com/">Virage</A>, have crafted software that can be used for searching corporate networks or databases. And two companies--<A HREF="http://www.excalib.com/rev2/demos/vrw/cstdemointro.html">Excalibur Technologies</A> and <A HREF="http://www.interpix.com/index.html">Interpix Software</A>--have collaborated to supply software to the Web-based indexing concerns Yahoo and Infoseek. One of the oldest image searchers, IBM's <A HREF="http://wwwqbic.almaden.ibm.com/">Query by Image Content (QBIC)</A>, produces more sophisticated matching of image features than, say, WebSEEk can. It is able not only to pick out the colors in an image but also to gauge texture by several measures--contrast (the black and white of zebra stripes), coarseness (stones versus pebbles) and directionality (linear fence posts versus omnidirectional flower petals). QBIC also has a limited ability to search for shapes within an image. Specifying a pink dot on a green background turns up flowers and other photographs with similar shapes and colors, as shown above. Possible applications range from the selection of wallpaper patterns to enabling police to identify gang members by clothing type.
<P>
All these programs do nothing more than match one visual feature with another. They still require a human observer--or accompanying text--to confirm whether an object is a cat or a cushion. For more than a decade, the artificial-intelligence community has labored, with mixed success, on nudging computers to ascertain directly the identity of objects within an image, whether they are cats or national flags. This approach correlates the shapes in a picture with geometric models of real-world objects. The program can then deduce that a pink or brown cylinder, say, is a human arm.
<P>
One example is software that looks for <A HREF="http://www.cs.uiowa.edu/%7Emfleck/vision-html/naked.html">naked people</A>, a program that is the work of <A HREF="http://HTTP.CS.Berkeley.EDU/%7Edaf/">David A. Forsyth</A> of Berkeley and <A HREF="http://www.cs.uiowa.edu/%7Emfleck/vision-html/naked.html">Margaret M. Fleck</A> of the University of Iowa. The software begins by analyzing the color and texture of a photograph. When it finds matches for flesh colors, it runs an algorithm that looks for cylindrical areas that might correspond to an arm or leg. It then seeks other flesh-colored cylinders, positioned at certain angles, which might confirm the presence of limbs. In a test last fall, the program picked out 43 percent of the 565 naked people among a group of 4,854 images, a high percentage for this type of complex image analysis. It registered, moreover, only a 4 percent false positive rate among the 4,289 images that did not contain naked bodies. The nudes were downloaded from the Web; the other photographs came primarily from commercial databases.
<P>
The challenges of computer vision will most likely remain for a decade or so to come. Searches capable of distinguishing clearly among nudes, marmalades and national flags are still an unrealized dream. As time goes on, though, researchers would like to give the programs that collect information from the Internet the ability to understand what they see.

"What is known about the nature and diagnosis of Tourette's
syndrome? Do we know what causes it, and can it ever be
cured?"</A></B></FONT>

<P>-<I>Debbie Eckardt, Eugene, Ore.</I>

<P>Jonathan W. Mink, an assistant professor of neurology and
anatomy and neurobiology at the <A
HREF="http://medicine.wustl.edu/" TARGET="_top">Washington
University School
of Medicine</A>, responds:

<P>"Tourette's syndrome is a neurologic disorder characterized
by
intermittent, brief involuntary movements or sounds that are
called tics. They can range from simple blinking, facial
twitches or sniffing sounds to more complex movements and
vocalizations. (The involuntary swearing that people commonly
associate with Tourette's is actually only one tiny example from
the wide variety of symptoms the disorder may produce.) Tics can
be quite mild and barely noticeable to an untrained observer or
even to the person who has them. They can also be severe enough
to interfere significantly with a person's daily activities. In
addition to tics, people who have Tourette's syndrome often
exhibit obsessions and compulsions, lack of impulse control or
attention-deficit disorder.

<P>"It is thought that Tourette's syndrome stems from an
abnormality in a part of the brain called the basal ganglia. The
exact cause of the abnormality is unknown but is thought to be
genetic because most people who show symptoms of Tourette's have
other family members who also display such symptoms. The
presumed genetic basis of Tourette's is not simple, however, and
the syndrome may involve more than one gene. Although Tourette's
most likely is a genetic disorder, the symptoms that define the
disorder vary considerably, even among members of a single
family. There is no 'test' for Tourette's; rather diagnosis is
based on the presence of several features that are generally
agreed to be essential aspects of the syndrome.

<P>"Just as the cause of Tourette's is unknown, there is also no
known cure. There are medications than can be quite effective in
reducing the symptoms, however. Different medications are
effective for different symptoms. For example, a medication that
reduces tics may not help with impulse control or compulsions.
Therefore, for each person with Tourette's the choice of
medication will depend on which symptoms are the most troubling
for that individual. In fact, many people afflicted Tourette's
syndrome are able to do well without ever taking any medication
at all."

"What causes the noise we hear when we crack our knuckles or pop
other joints? I've read that the sound comes from the release of
gas bubbles. If so, what sort of gas bubbles are they, and how
can releasing them possibly make so much noise?"</A></B></FONT>

<P>-<I>William Vai, San Francisco, Calif.</I>

<P>Raymond Brodeur in the <A
HREF="http://www.ergo.msu.edu/" TARGET="_top">Ergonomics
Research
Laboratory</A> at Michigan State University responds:

<P>"To understand what happens when you 'crack' your knuckles,
or
any other joint, first you need a little background about the
nature of the joints of the body. The type of joints that you
can most easily 'pop' or 'crack' are the diarthrodial joints.
These are your most typical
joints. They consist of two bones that contact each other at
their cartilage surfaces; the cartilage surfaces are surrounded
by a <A
HREF="http://www.duq.edu/PT/RA/EffectsOnJoints.html#Anatomy"
TARGET="_top">joint capsule</A>. Inside
the joint capsule is a lubricant, known as synovial fluid, which
also serves as a source of nutrients for the cells that maintain
the joint cartilage. In addition, the synovial fluid contains
dissolved gases, including oxygen, nitrogen and carbon dioxide.

<P>"The easiest joints to pop are the ones in your fingers (the
interphalangeal and the metacarpophalangeal joints). As the
joint capsule stretches, its expansion is limited by a number of
factors. When small forces are applied to the joint, one factor
that limits the motion is the volume of the joint. That volume
is set by the amount of synovial fluid contained in the joint.
The synovial fluid cannot expand unless the pressure inside the
capsule drops to a point at which the dissolved gases can escape
the solution; when the gases come out of solution, they increase
the volume and hence the mobility of the joint.

<P>"The cracking or popping sound is thought to be caused by the
gases rapidly coming out of solution, allowing the capsule to
stretch a little further. The stretching of the joint is soon
thereafter limited by the length of the capsule. If you take an
x-ray of the joint after cracking, you can see a gas bubble
inside the joint. This gas increases the joint volume by 15 to
20 percent; it consists mostly (about 80 percent) of carbon
dioxide. The joint cannot be cracked again until the gases have
dissolved back into the synovial fluid, which explains why you
cannot crack the same knuckle repeatedly.

<P>"But how can releasing such a small quantity of gas cause so
much noise? There is no good answer for this question.
Researchers have estimated the energy levels of the sound by
using accelerometers to measure the vibrations caused during
joint popping. The amounts of energy involved are very small, on
the order of 0.1 milli-joule per cubic millimeter. Studies have
also shown that there are two sound peaks during knuckle
cracking, but the causes of these peaks are unknown. It is
likely that the first sound is related to the gas dissolving out
of solution, whereas the second sound is caused by the capsule
reaching its length limit.

<P>"A common, related question is, Does popping a joint cause
any
damage? There are actually little scientific data available on
this topic. One study found no correlation between knuckle
cracking and osteoarthritis in the finger joints. Another study,
however, showed that repetitive knuckle cracking may affect the
soft tissue surrounding the joint. Also, the habit tends to
cause an increase in hand swelling and a decrease in the grip
strength of the hand.

<P>"Another source of popping and cracking sounds is the tendons
and ligaments near the joint. Tendons must cross at least one
joint in order to cause motion. But when a joint moves, the
tendon's position with respect to the joint is forced to change.
It is not uncommon for a tendon to shift to a slightly different
position, followed by a sudden snap as the tendon returns to its
original location with respect to the joint. These noises are
often heard in the knee and ankle joints when standing up from a
seated position or when walking up or down the stairs."

"Is it possible to engineer viruses to perform specific tasks within a
human host--that is, to create viruses that are beneficial rather than
detrimental to human health?"</A></B></FONT>

<P>-<I>Simon Stafford, Canberra, Australia</I>

<P><A HREF="http://www.miracosta.cc.ca.us/home/lsnider/" TARGET="_top">Leslie Snider</A>, a
biotechnology instructor at MiraCosta College in Oceanside, Calif.,
responds:

<P><P>"Not only is it possible to engineer viruses to be beneficial, it is
already being done. Viruses have primarily been engineered for use by
humans as so-called recombinant (or subunit) vaccines. In this technology,
the genetic material of a harmful virus is analyzed to identify the gene
or genes that encode the antigens (identifying proteins) that trigger the
body's immune response. These genes can then be isolated and inserted into
host cells, usually bacteria or yeast. The host cells in turn manufacture
the antigens in large quantities. The antigens are injected into humans
and result in the formation of 'memory' B cells, which are tailored to the
alien antigen, thereby protecting against the disease caused by the whole
virus. The first recombinant vaccine designed for human use immunizes
against hepatitis B; it was approved by the <A
HREF="http://www.fda.gov/" TARGET="_top">Food and Drug Administration</A> in 1986.

<P>"Viruses also have long been used as cloning vectors, tools for inserting
genetic material into a variety of host cells (including bacteria, yeast
and mammalian cells). These host cells are grown in the laboratory under
controlled conditions. There are many research projects that focus on the
use of viruses to insert normal, healthy human genes into human cells
grown in the lab. Some of these engineered cells may be suitable for
therapeutic use to alleviate the symptoms of disease or perhaps even
provide a kind of cure. Such treatments are currently being tested for the
treatment of emphysema and cystic fibrosis. These diseases affect lung
tissue, and it is relatively easy to deliver the engineered cells to the
lungs via aerosol sprays.

<P>"The use of viruses to inject genetic information into cells of living
organisms (for instance, to insert normal genes into the cells of a
patient whose disease is caused by a genetic flaw) is much more difficult
and will require a great deal of additional research. Nevertheless,
researchers are pursuing a number of promising possibilities toward this
goal. For example, some scientists are working on schemes to use viruses
to deliver normal genes directly into the cells in the lungs of people who
have cystic fibrosis or into the cells lining the walls of blood vessels
in order to prevent atherosclerosis."

"What do we know about the cause of Werner syndrome and progeria, the
disease that leads to premature aging in children?"</A></B></FONT>

<P>-<I>Tom Dilley, Makanda, Ill.</I>

<P><A HREF="http://www.pathology.washington.edu/faculty/martin.html" TARGET="_top">George
M. Martin</A>, professor of pathology and director of the Alzheimer's
Disease Research Center at the University of Washington, comments:

<P>"I appreciate this opportunity to communicate to your readers, as
journalists have often overstated the significance of the <A
HREF="http://science-mag.aaas.org/science/scripts/display/short/272/5259/193.html" TARGET="_top">genes
for Werner syndrome and Hutchinson-Gilford progeria</A> as keys to the
understanding of aging. These are actually two distinctly different
disorders; a major clinical difference is that the onset of the
Hutchinson-Gilford syndrome (sometimes called progeria of childhood)
occurs within the first decade of life, whereas the first evidence of
Werner syndrome (sometimes called progeria of the adult) appears in
adolescence, when the individual fails to undergo the usual growth spurt.
A good clinician can make the diagnosis of Hutchinson-Gilford in the first
two or three years of life.

<P>"It is an exaggeration to refer to these genetic disorders as 'diseases of
premature aging.' While patients do indeed have an external appearance of
premature aging and suffer from some of the common ailments of older
people, there are a number of clinical features that differ from that
which is observed in most individuals as they age. For example, Werner
syndrome patients develop neoplasms prematurely, but the neoplasms tend to
be those derived from mesenchymal rather than epithelial cells; the latter
are the main source of tumors of older people. Werner patients suffer from
osteoporosis, but the distribution is unusual in that it is very severe in
the long bones of the legs. They also develop unusual deposits of calcium
in the soft tissues and ulcers around their elbows and ankles. Patients
who have Hutchinson-Gilford syndrome experience arthritis of the hips, but
it is a result of having been born with dislocated hips. Their clavicles
also develop abnormally.

<P>"Nevertheless, both these diseases are important to study because
identifying the underlying mutations that cause them could enlarge our
understanding of such important disorders as diabetes, cancer, cataracts
and atherosclerosis. The autosomal recessive mutation responsible for
Werner syndrome has recently been identified by a group led by Chang-En Yu
of the University of Washington (see the April 12, 1996, issue of <A
HREF="http://science-mag.aaas.org/science/scripts/display/short/272/5259/258.html" TARGET="_top"><I>Science</I></A>,
Vol. 272, page 258). This mutation affects a member of a large family of
enzymes, called helicases, that act to unwind DNA (and sometimes RNA) in
order to facilitate such processes as the replication, repair,
transcription and recombination of DNA. Some helicases may also be
important in ensuring the accuracy of chromosomal segregation. Precisely
which subset of these functions is critical in producing the pathology of
progeria is not yet known.

<P>"The fact that a helicase mutation is responsible for the disorder lends
support to several lines of evidence indicating that the somatic cells of
Werner syndrome patients are especially prone to mutations. In this
respect, they are similar to individuals who have Bloom syndrome, a
recessive genetic disorder also caused by a defective helicase (Nathan A. Ellis
et al. in <I>Cell,</I> Vol. 83, No. 4, page 655;
November 17, 1995). The mutation underlying the
Hutchinson-Gilford syndrome is probably a sporadic, autosomal-dominant one
(W. T. Brown in <I>American Journal of Clinical Nutrition,</I>
Vol. 55, No. 6(Supplement), page 1222S; June 1992).
The responsible gene has not yet been identified, however, so
we remain ignorant of its pathogenesis."

<P><A
HREF="http://dauerdigs.biosci.missouri.edu/Dauer-World/People/David-Gems.html%25" TARGET="_top">David
Gems</A>, a professor in the division of biological sciences at the
University of Missouri at Columbia, offers a somewhat different view of
progeria:

<P>"Werner syndrome is the most common form of progeria. The first signs of
this disorder appear only after puberty, with the full symptoms becoming
manifest in individuals 20 to 30 years old. A much rarer progeria,
Hutchinson-Gilford syndrome, develops earlier: victims die, apparently of
old age, typically at around age 12. It is fortunate that this hereditary
disease occurs very infrequently.

<P>"The potential value of understanding the cause of diseases such as Werner
syndrome is hard to overstate. Nowadays those involved in aging research
increasingly view aging in terms of a genetic disease rather than as a
natural, evolution-driven process by which the old make way for the young.
Viewed in this new light, the condition of aged friends and relatives, and
of older people seen in the street, suddenly seems terrible to conceive:
they are afflicted with a ghastly wasting disease, a plague whose effects
are inescapably scripted by our own genes.

<P>"Werner syndrome results from mutation of a single gene. Is it possible
that by understanding the healthy version of the gene we can begin to
learn how genes control lifespan and so take the first step down the road
toward curing the disease of aging? Unfortunately, the answer is not yet
at all certain, for two major reasons. First, it remains unclear whether
the symptoms of Werner syndrome really correspond to an acceleration of
the aging process or whether the resemblance to aging is merely
superficial. Although Werner syndrome victims prematurely show some of the
signs of aging (such as graying of the hair and hair loss,
atherosclerosis, osteoporosis and type II diabetes mellitus), they fail to
show others. For example, they exhibit no premature cognitive decline or
Alzheimer's symptoms. And they experience many symptoms not associated
with normal aging (such as ulceration of the skin, particularly around the
ankles, alteration of the vocal chords resulting in a high-pitched voice,
and an absence of the growth spurt that normally occurs after puberty).

<P>"The second problem is the lack of an animal model for Werner syndrome
that could be employed to study the disease in detail. Progeria is
dreadful enough for those suffering from it without having gerontologists
hovering around wanting to do tests and snip off bits of you.

<P>"In April 1996 the study of Werner syndrome was greatly advanced by the
announcement of the cloning and sequencing of WRN, the gene which when
mutated gives rise to the disease. In some instances, the identity of a
gene provides immediate insight into the nature of the disease resulting
from defects in it. This was true, for example, when the gene for cystic
fibrosis was cloned. Unfortunately, as is more often the case, the WRN
gene is more enigmatic. It encodes a protein that most closely resembles a
DNA helicase. DNA helicases are enzymes involved in DNA repair and
recombination, suggesting that Werner syndrome results from failure in
these processes.

<P>"There are reasons to treat this hypothesis cautiously, however. The
capacity of the WRN protein to act as a helicase has yet to be
demonstrated, and there are other genetic diseases resulting from
mutations in genes encoding DNA helicases that do not resemble Werner
syndrome. <A
HREF="http://www3.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/htbin-post/Omim/dispmim?278700" TARGET="_top">Xeroderma
pigmentosum</A> and <A
HREF="http://www3.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/htbin-post/Omim/dispmim?216400" TARGET="_top">Cockayne
syndrome</A>, which also result from defective DNA helicases, result in
increased sensitivity of cells to ultraviolet radiation. This is thought
to happen because ultraviolet rays damage DNA, which cannot be properly
repaired by the mutant helicases. Yet Werner syndrome cells are not
abnormally sensitive to ultraviolet radiation. In short, it is known that
defects in a putative DNA helicase are the cause of Werner syndrome, but
it is not known how this defect results in the disease.

<P>"It is possible that the most valuable short-term consequence of knowing
the identity of the Werner syndrome gene is that it may allow the
development of an animal model for studying the disease. Researchers have
not yet determined whether it is possible to create a mouse whose genetic
equivalent of the WRN gene contains the same mutation that causes Werner
syndrome in humans and, if so, whether the mutation produces accelerated
aging in the mouse. The latter question is particularly difficult because
aging is still so poorly understood. The primary determinants of aging in
animals are unknown. It is not even clear whether aging is determined by
organism-wide processes, such as immunologic or hormonal changes, or by
events occurring independently in different cells, tissues or organs.
Arguably, only with the experimental flexibility provided by an animal
model will it be possible to establish whether accelerated aging actually
occurs in Werner syndrome and, if so, how this aging occurs."

<P>Gerard Schellenberg of the <A HREF="http://www.washington.edu/" TARGET="_top">University
of Washington</A>, who participated in the recent cloning of the WRN gene,
adds some additional information:

<P>"Werner syndrome is an inherited disease that is extremely rare, affecting
somewhere between one in 100,000 and one in 1,000,000 individuals. The
inheritance is autosomal recessive, meaning that someone will develop
Werner syndrome only if both copies of the disease gene are mutated.

<P>"The gene responsible for the syndrome was localized to chromosome 8 in
1992 by Dennis Dryna and his colleagues. In 1996 my group in Seattle,
along with a number of collaborators, cloned the gene responsible for the
disease. The responsible gene encodes a previously unknown protein that
has a strong homology to a class of enzymes called helicases. These
enzymes unwind DNA or RNA; in other words, they convert a double-stranded
molecule into two single-stranded molecules. Higher organisms, including
humans, have a number of different helicase genes. Each probably functions
in a different process requiring the unwinding of DNA or RNA. Examples of
processes in which helicases are required are DNA replication, repair and
transcription, to name just a few.

<P>"The function of Werner syndrome helicase is currently unknown. What is
clear is that subjects with the syndrome probably do not produce a
functional form of this protein. We do know that DNA in affected subjects
appears to contain a large number of damaged sites. This accumulation of
DNA damage is probably the cause of the symptoms we call Werner syndrome.
Cells from Werner syndrome subjects do not appear to be defective for any
known DNA repair process, so the primary defect probably involves a defect
in a process that causes DNA damage, rather than one that repairs damage
caused by other agents. Having the gene in hand gives a tool for beginning
to answer these questions."

"What is a prion? Specifically, what is known about the molecular structure
of prions and how they cause infections such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease?"</A></B></FONT>

<P>-<I>Anders Hedberg, Stockholm, Sweden</I>

<P><A HREF="http://www.hhmi.org/science/genetics/lindquis.htm">Susan
Lindquist</A> is a researcher at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute,
located in the department of molecular genetics and cell biology at the
University of Chicago. She responds:

<P>"'Prion' is a term first used to describe the mysterious infectious agent
responsible for several neurodegenerative diseases found in mammals,
including <A HREF="http://www.cjd.ed.ac.uk/intro.htm">Creutzfeldt-Jakob
disease</A> (CJD) in humans. The word itself derives from 'proteinaceous
infectious particle'; it refers to the initially heretical hypothesis that
the infectious agent causing those diseases consists only of protein, with
no nucleic acid genome. (All previously known pathogens, such as bacteria
and viruses, contain nucleic acids, which enable them to reproduce.) The
prion hypothesis explained why the mysterious infectious agent is resistant
to ultraviolet radiation, which breaks down nucleic acids, but is
susceptible to substances that disrupt proteins.

<P>"A major breakthrough occurred when researchers discovered that the
infectious agent consists primarily of a protein found in the membranes of
normal cells, but in this case the protein has an altered shape, or
conformation. Some scientists hypothesized that the distorted protein could
bind to other proteins of the same type and induce them to change their
conformation as well, producing a chain reaction that propagates the disease
and generates new infectious material. Since then, the gene for this protein
has been successfully cloned, and studies using transgenic mice have
bolstered the prion hypothesis. The evidence in support of the hypothesis is
now very strong, though not incontrovertible.

<P>"Research on prion diseases has recently accelerated for several reasons.
First, the mounting experimental evidence has generated great interest in
what appears to be a totally new kind of mechanism of disease. Second, the
demonstration that prions are responsible for 'mad cow' disease (bovine
spongiform encephalopathy), which has infected large numbers of cattle in
Great Britain and panicked the public, has lent new urgency to the quest for
a cure--especially since the discovery that infected cows might be
responsible for several new cases of CJD in humans. Finally, I and my
colleagues have recently determined that a <A
HREF="http://science-mag.aaas.org/science/scripts/display/short/273/5275/580.html">phenomenon
much like prion infection</A> exists in yeast.

<P>"In the case of yeast, the phenomenon involves the passing of a particular
genetic trait from mother cells to daughter cells, rather than the
transmission of an infectious agent from one individual to another. These
genetic traits had been known for many years, but their baffling patterns of
inheritance (for example, they can be passed along through a cell's
cytoplasm, rather than the nucleus where the DNA resides) had eluded explanation.
We now know that the genetic trait is transmitted by proteins that are
encoded in the nucleus but that can change their conformation in the
cytoplasm. Once this change has occurred, the reconfigured proteins induce
other newly made proteins of the same type to change their conformation,
too. Molecular genetic research on yeast should speed up the resolution of
fundamental questions about the workings of protein-folding chain reactions.
And more important, it suggests that the prion mechanism is ubiquitous among
living things and may be responsible for many phenomena other than
neurodegenerative diseases like CJD."

<P><A HREF="http://www.ucd.ie/~zoology/rogers.html">Mark Rogers</A> in the department of zoology and the
Biotechnology Centre at University College, Dublin, adds some further
information:

<P>"The term 'prion' was coined by Stanley B. Prusiner of the University of
California School of Medicine at San Francisco in 1982 to distinguish the
infectious agent that causes scrapie in sheep, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease
(CJD) in humans and bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in cattle from
other, more typical infectious agents. The prion hypothesis postulates that
these diseases are caused not by a conventional virus or bacterium but by a
protein that has adopted an abnormal form. 

<P>"The process by which this change occurs is not clear and there is a great
deal of work under way to establish the structure of the prion protein in
both its normal and aberrant forms. Recently scientists have developed a
molecular model of both variants and have published papers describing the
structure of prion proteins (as manufactured by <I>E. coli</I> bacteria that
were altered through recombinant DNA techniques). Further work using
magnetic resonance imaging and x-ray crystallography should help us
understand the key structural elements that allow the prion to co-opt the
normal cellular form into the disease-producing variant. It is likely that
other cellular components assist in this process, so work on understanding
the cell biology of both forms of the protein is also vital."

<P><A HREF="http://www.le.ac.uk/CWIS/AD/MI/ST/sh1.html">Shaun Heaphy</A> in the
department of microbiology and immunology at Leicester University provides
this overview:

<P>"A number of fatal neurodegenerative diseases in humans--such as
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), kuru and Gerstmann-Str&#228;ussler-Scheinker
(GSS) disease--are thought to be caused by an infectious agent known as a
prion. Prions also cause disease in a wide variety of other animals,
including scrapie in sheep and bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in
cows. Collectively these diseases are known as transmissible spongiform
encephalopathies.

<P>"The cause of CJD was unknown for many years; it occurred seemingly
randomly, at a very low incidence. In the 1950s an epidemic transmissible
disease called kuru, similar to CJD, was identified in the Fore tribe of
Papua New Guinea. Transmission of the disease occurred during a ritual
funeral process in which the brain of a dead tribe member was removed from
the skull, cooked and eaten. Scientific analysis of the brains of people who
had died from CJD or kuru showed that their brain tissue had a spongiform
appearance, that is, there were holes where cells ought to be, indicating an
encephalopathy, or reduction in the number of brain cells. 

<P>"<A HREF="http://www.nih.gov/ninds/neurosci/basic/lcnss/lcnss.htm">D.
Carleton Gajdusek</A>, working at the U.S. National Institutes of Health,
demonstrated that extracts of brain prepared from people who had died of CJD
or kuru could cause a similar disease when inoculated into the brain of
chimpanzees. These experiments obviously suggested the presence of an
infectious agent. That inference has been confirmed by the inadvertent
transmission of CJD to patients undergoing various medical treatments, such
as corneal transplants and human growth hormone therapy.

<P>"Confusingly, researchers also recognized that some prion diseases, such as
GSS, were inherited. The pattern of inheritance was recognized as being
autosomal and dominant, meaning that if a parent developed GSS, there was a
50 percent chance that a child of either sex would also develop the disease.
Any explanation for the cause of a prion disease therefore has to account
for random, inherited and transmitted variants of the disease.

<P>"Although there is not yet a universally accepted explanation of this
puzzle, progress is being made. We now know that a normal cellular protein,
called PrP ( for proteinaceous infectious particle) and which is found in
all of us, is centrally involved in the spread of prion diseases. This
protein consists of about 250 amino acids.

<P>"Some researchers believe that the prions are formed when PrP associates
with a foreign pathogenic nucleic acid. This is called the virino
hypothesis. (Viruses consist of proteins and nucleic acids that are
specified by the virus genome. A virino would also consist of proteins and
nucleic acids, but the protein component is specified by the host genome,
not the pathogen genome). In support of the virino hypothesis is the
existence of different strains of prions that cause differing patterns of
disease and breed true; the existence of strains in pathogens is usually the
result of changes in the nucleic acid sequence of the infectious agent.
Scientists have not found any nucleic acid associated with a prion, however,
despite intensive efforts in many laboratories. Furthermore, prions appear
to remain infectious even after being exposed to treatments that destroy
nucleic acids.

<P>"This evidence has led to the now widely accepted prion theory, which states
that the cellular protein PrP is the sole causative agent of prion diseases;
there is no nucleic acid involved. The theory holds that PrP is normally in
a stable shape (pN) that does not cause disease. The protein can be flipped,
however, into an abnormal shape (pD) that does cause disease. pD is
infectious because it can associate with pN and convert it to pD, in an
exponential process--each pD can convert more pN to pD.

<P>"Prions can be transmitted, possibly by eating and certainly by inoculation
either directly into the brain or into skin and muscle tissue. Exponential
amplification of the prion (converting pN into pD in the body) would then
result in disease. Occasional, sporadic cases of prion diseases arise in
middle or old age, presumably because there is a very small but real chance
that pN can spontaneously flip to pD; the cumulative likelihood of such a
flip grows over the years. Inherited cases of CJD and GSS may result from
mutations in the PrP gene, which gives rise to changes in the amino acid
sequence of the PrP protein. This change would increase the probability of
pN transforming into pD, so that the disease would almost certainly occur. 

<P>"Physical analysis of the structure of PrP provides some direct evidence for
the existence of two different (normal and aberrant) shapes. Recently the
structure of the core part of the PrP protein was determined by magnetic
resonance image analysis. Mutations that cause prion disease are clustered
within or adjacent to key structural elements in the protein, so it is easy
to imagine that mutations destabilize the structure of pN and cause it to
reconfigure into pD.

<P>"The prion theory has not been proved correct, but much evidence now
supports it. We do not yet know why the pD structure of a prion would result
in neurodegeneration, but we do know that prion protein accumulates in brain
tissue. One part of the prion protein can cause apoptosis, or programmed
cell death; perhaps this mechanism explains the pattern of the disease.

<P>"Prions have long intrigued scientists because of their unusual properties.
Recently the general public has become interested in them as well because of
the epidemic of BSE, more dramatically known as mad cow disease. Hundreds of
thousands of infected animals have been eaten by Europeans and particularly
the British over the past 10 years. The latest research suggests that the
infected meat may pose a threat to human health, but the significance of
that threat may not become apparent for years. Although it is generally considered
a British problem, BSE is almost certainly a natural disease of cattle, so
it is undoubtedly found in other countries as well. The normal incidence of
BSE is vanishingly small, however. The <A

Agriculture</A> claims that BSE has not been identified in any U.S. cattle."

<P>-<I>Alex Chernavsky, New York City</I>

<P><A HREF="http://www.nemc.org/refguide/provider/StuartBLevyMD.html">Stuart B.
Levy</A> is a professor of medicine at the Tufts University School of
Medicine in Boston and the author of <I>The Antibiotic Paradox: How Miracle
Drugs are Destroying the Miracle</I> (Plenum, 1992). He replies:

<P>"The problem of resistance actually has been discussed and raised probably
for at least the past 20 to 30 years. In 1981, as the result of a meeting in
Santa Domingo on resistance, an international organization was established:
the Alliance for the Prudent Use of Antibiotics (for those interested in
contacting this organization, their mailing address is P.O. Box 1372,
Boston, MA 02117). The Alliance, which has a presence in 93 countries, was
founded to combat the drug-resistant infectious diseases becoming prevalent
in developing countries. At the time, drug resistance already posed a
substantial threat in those countries, and people felt a tremendous need to
call attention to the danger. It may seem that concerns about drug
resistance have only surfaced recently, however, because it has taken longer
for the problem to reach the developed world, especially the U.S.

<P>"Years of misuse of antibiotics led to the emergence of infectious bacteria
that are resistant not just to one but to many antibiotics. As a result,
there are strains of bacteria today for which we have only one effective
drug treatment or, in some cases, none at all. For the first time since the
discovery of antibiotics, patients in the U.S. are dying of bacterial
infections that cannot be treated. The other half of the problem is that
medical researchers have not found any fundamentally new antibiotics in the
past decade, and we do not expect the discovery of any in the near
future--we must rely on the ones we currently have. That limitation is why
many of us consider this a true public health crisis. Resistance has been a
critical factor in the appearance of 'reemerging infections.' We can no
longer effectively treat some diseases that we were treating easily just
five to 10 years ago. 

<P>"Many of the people writing about the resistance problem now have firsthand
experience of the problem. Once they became aware that bacteria are no
longer succumbing to treatment, they asked why, and pretty soon there was a
media blitz about the risk of drug-resistant diseases. Another reason for
the growing awareness is that antibiotic-resistant bacteria have become an
everyday problem for people in the community; previously it was confined to
very sick people in the hospitals. 

<P>"Why are resistant strains more likely to appear if we do not complete a
course of treatment? Bacterial infections are caused by hundreds of millions
of bacteria, which are not all the same. Some are more susceptible to the
antibiotic than others, and the bacteria reside in different parts of the
body, some more sheltered than others. Each antibiotic treatment takes care
of the most susceptible and exposed bacteria. An incomplete course of
treatment will leave behind those that were in a safe place and those that,
by mutation, happened to have some level of resistance. 

<P>"When that population reestablishes itself, you will again have a large
number of bacteria throughout the body, but they are less susceptible to the
drug. Consequently, there is a greater likelihood that you will have a
population that possesses some resistance to the antibiotic. A full dose of
antibiotic keeps diminishing the bacterial population, which allows your
body to clean up the modest remnant population. If you stop taking the
medicine, the population can increase and re-create the infection, so that
the bacteria can then be passed along to others. Those bacteria then can go
on to become even more resistant."

<P><A HREF="http://www.creighton.edu/Microbio/Bittner.html">Marvin J. Bittner</A>, a staff physician at the
Omaha VA Medical Center and an associate professor at Creighton University
School of Medicine, adds some information and an alternative description of
the dangers of incomplete treatment:

<P>"During the 1940s, attempts to treat tuberculosis with only one drug failed;
the result was the emergence of resistance. During the 1950s, hospital
nurseries were swept by epidemics of penicillin-resistant <A
HREF="http://photon.phol.cwru.edu/som/academic/other/Staphhome.html">staphylococci</A>.
By the 1970s, penicillin-resistant <A
HREF="http://bugs.uah.ualberta.ca//webbug/bactbug/gcintro.htm">gonorrhea</A>
had spread around the world. 

<P>In the 1990s, we have special concern for two
problems: (1) Enterococci have emerged that are <A
HREF="http://www.uhl.uiowa.edu/pubs/hotline/9606/vancomycin.html">resistant
to the drug vancomycin</A>. There are no reliable alternative treatments,
and there is fear that the resistance gene in the enterococci could spread to
more common bacteria, such as staphylococci. (2) The appearance of <A
HREF="http://uhs.bsd.uchicago.edu/uhs/topics/resist.tb.bib.html">multidrug
resistant tuberculosis</A>. Tuberculosis can spread easily and it is deadly;
it was the number one cause of death in the U.S. in 1900, and it is still
the leading cause of death by infectious disease worldwide. Treatment
success drops from nearly 100 percent for the older strains to barely half
that for the drug-resistant ones.

<P>"Any population of bacteria may contain some resistant individuals. Taking a
partial treatment course will kill off the susceptible bacteria at first,
but it leaves behind the tougher ones. If you take a long course and kill
more bacteria, only a few will be left. The patient's own immune system can
mop them up. If you take a short course and do not kill many of the
bacteria, however, there will be a lot left--too many for the patient's
immune system to finish off--so the resistant ones have a chance to grow.
Also, a partial course leaves more bacteria alive at the end of therapy. As
the antibiotic levels in the body decline, they pass through a phase in
which the concentrations are high enough to kill some bacteria but not high
enough to stop the tougher ones. At this point, those remaining tougher
germs have an advantage because they do not have to compete with the weaker
(now dead) ones. This opening gives the resistant bacteria a chance to grow
and flourish."

<P>And <A HREF="http://www.life.uiuc.edu/biotech/people/Salyers.html">Abigail
Salyers</A> in the department of microbiology at the University of Illinois
has provided this extensive overview and a somewhat different perspective on
the problem:

<P>"One answer to the first part of this question is that the use of
antibiotics has not been constant over the period since antibiotics were
discovered, but it has increased drastically in recent years. Antibiotics
were first introduced into clinical use in the 1940s and 1950s. At first,
they were used mainly to treat existing infections. Clinicians soon learned,
however, that administering antibiotics before surgery (prophylactic use)
could prevent infections, and prophylactic use of antibiotics became
widespread. Even in cases where prophylactic use has been shown not to be
efficacious, the tendency has been to continue the practice 'just in case.'

<P>The uses of antibiotics continued to multiply. Dermatologists discovered
that long-term, low-dose administration of certain antibiotics was
beneficial in the treatment of acne and other skin conditions. Animal
scientists discovered that some antibiotics promoted growth of livestock
animals. They are also used extensively in aquaculture to prevent infections
that arise readily in crowded fish or crustacean populations. Because the
selective pressure for antibiotic-resistant strains increases as antibiotic
use increases, it is not surprising that the incidence of antibiotic strains
has increased more rapidly in recent years. 

<P>"The type of selection has also changed. Bacteria exposed to concentrations
of antibiotics too low to kill them, especially if exposure occurs over long
periods, are much more likely to develop and fix the mutations that make
them resistant than are bacteria exposed to high concentrations of
antibiotics, which kill them before they can mutate. As the use of
antibiotics has increased, opportunities for long-term, low-dose exposure
have also increased. In the early days of antibiotics, when antibiotics were
used primarily for therapy of existing infections, hospital staff members
and hospital patients who were not using antibiotics had very little
exposure to antibiotics. 

<P>Today, especially in intensive care wards, the
amount of antibiotics in the environment can become high enough that people
in the vicinity of patients receiving antibiotics are exposed continuously
to low levels of antibiotics. If these people are asymptomatic carriers of
bacterial pathogens (which is not uncommon in hospital settings), the
bacteria they carry experience the type of antibiotic exposure that is
conducive to development of resistant strains. This phenomenon may explain
why the most resistant strains are now arising in hospitals. A similar
situation probably occurs in agricultural settings in which antibiotics are
added daily to animal feed.

<P>"The drastically increased use of antibiotics has certainly accelerated the
appearance of resistant strains. Yet there is another aspect of this issue
that deserves mention. A reader of the popular press is likely to carry away
the impression that the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria is a
recent phenomenon. That is not the case. The first published report of a
penicillin-resistant strain appeared in the 1940s, shortly after penicillin
began to be used clinically. In the intervening years, there have been many
reports of resistant bacteria, and surveys have shown a steady increase in
the number of resistant strains. Even during the 1960s, reports of bacterial
strains resistant to multiple antibiotics were becoming commonplace. Yet
most physicians and medical policymakers dismissed such reports as
unimportant because new antibiotics were constantly appearing on the market,
and these new antibiotics allowed physicians to keep ahead of the resistant
strains.

<P>"A major contributor to the current crisis was the widespread attitude
during the 1970s that bacterial resistance to antibiotics was not a serious
medical problem, nor was it likely to become so, because new antibiotics
would continue to appear in time to replace those made obsolete by bacterial
resistance mechanisms. Unfortunately, there was a serious flaw in this rosy
projection. Already in the 1970s, it was becoming more and more difficult to
find new antibiotics. Development of a new one therefore has become
increasingly expensive for the pharmaceutical companies. 

<P>New requirements
for more and larger clinical trials prior to licensing of an antibiotic
further increased the cost of bringing a new drug to market. The result was
that the companies began to cut back on their antibiotic discovery programs
and to focus instead on more profitable drugs. It now takes at least 10
years to bring an antibiotic from the discovery stage to the market, so
decisions made during the 1970s and 1980s are having their most profound
effect on today's medical treatment. Few new antibiotics are now in the
pipeline, whereas antibiotic resistance among bacteria is increasing faster
than ever. So the current perception of a crisis in antibiotic resistance is
not just a matter of an increase in multiply resistant strains of bacteria
but also of the reduced availability of new antibiotics to take care of
resistant strains.

<P>"Overuse and abuse of antibiotics by physicians is the main cause of the
antibiotic resistance crisis. Understandably, however, physicians do not
wish to take all the blame for what could become a major public relations
disaster--if fears about the impending 'loss of antibiotics' prove to be
justified. This has led to the search for others to share the blame. A
popular candidate is the patient who demands antibiotics even when they are
inappropriate or the patient who does not take antibiotics as prescribed. 

<P>"It is true that failure of tuberculosis patients to take antibiotics as
prescribed has played a major role in the emergence of multiply resistant
strains of the bacterium that causes tuberculosis. In this case, patients
were taking the antibiotics sporadically over long periods, a practice that
led to chronic exposure of bacteria to doses of antibiotics too low to eradicate
them--a prime selective environment for resistant strains. Therapeutic
regimens of antibiotics are designed to expose the bacteria to high doses of
antibiotics that eradicate the bacteria from the body, either by killing
them directly or by helping the immune system to clear them. If a patient
stops taking an antibiotic prematurely and there are still bacteria in the
body, the period during which the concentration of antibiotic in circulation
falls gradually to zero allows bacteria to experience the sublethal
concentrations of antibiotic that tend to select for resistant strains. 

<P>"This type of patient misuse of an antibiotic is not, however, the one most
conducive to selection of resistant strains. It is the sporadic use of
antibiotics--for example, taking one pill a day instead of the prescribed
three or four--that provides the optimum setting for the development of
resistant strains. Most people agree that failure of patients to take
antibiotics as prescribed is probably a minor factor in the development of
resistant strains compared with the overuse of antibiotics in crowded
settings such as modern hospitals, where selective pressure for resistance
is constant and where transmission of resistant strains to staff members and
patients is most likely to occur."

Szczeklik</A>, chairman of the department of medicine at the
Jagiellonian University School of Medicine in Krakow, Poland,
adds his perspective:

<P>"Immunoglobulin E (IgE) plays a key role in allergy. As a
result, its other functions have received little attention. I
would like to point out two little-appreciated, IgE-related
phenomena that might be of benefit to humans:

<P>"1) Atopics--that is, persons who produce too much IgE--have a
mild hemostatic imbalance, meaning that their blood takes longer
than usual to clot (roughly one fifth of Europeans and North
Americans are atopics). Therefore, the bleeding time among
atopics is slightly, but significantly, prolonged; the imbalance
also reduces the stickiness of the blood platelets and delays
the generation of thrombin, the key enzyme for coagulation.
These phenomena might be relevant in the dangerous situations
triggered by blood clotting in the arteries: a sudden cardiac
arrest precipitated by coronary thrombosis (blockade of vessels
that provide blood to the heart muscle) is a good example. In a
recent study of 385 patients who had heart attacks, sudden
cardiac arrest was far less common among the patients who
entered the hospital with high serum IgE levels than among those
whose IgE was not elevated. It therefore seems possible that
high IgE, by depressing blood clotting, protect atopics against
sudden cardiac arrest.

<P>"2) Tissue injury characteristically results in a marked,
transient rise in IgE levels in the blood. This phenomenon has
been observed following heart attacks, surgery, burns, pulmonary
thromboembolism and major trauma. Hence, IgE seems to be a part
of the mechanism involved in acute-phase response. IgE might
modulate the response to tissue injury through its powerful
interaction with the cells of the immune system, such as mast
cells, macrophages and eosinophils. Such hypotheses need further
experimental verification, however."

<P>"To answer these questions, one has to divide cancers into two groups: solid
tumors that require the development of a blood supply to metastasize and enlarge,
and soft tumors that may have circulating cells, as in leukemias.

<P>"Almost half the deaths from cancers result from lung and breast cancer, both
of which are solid tumors. Gene therapy has found very little success in treating
these types of cancers. If you are going to try to change the genetic makeup of
the cancer cells by inserting genes, you must first get the genes to the cancer
cells. Currently direct injection of genes into the cancer mass is being
attempted, but it is unlikely that it will work because all the cells must be
hit, which is very unlikely.

<P>"Most cancers kill their victims by metastasis, wherein cancerous cells move
from the primary site to other places in the body. It would be almost impossible
to inject genes directly into all these sites. Furthermore, a cancer is not made
up of only one type of rapidly, uncontrolled growing cell but has many different
types of cells, some of which might not respond to the gene you wish to insert.
Gene therapy within the next decade or so is not  going to prove very effective
in eliminating solid cancers such as lung, breast, prostate, colon and so on.
There has been limited success with cancers where cells are circulating in the
bloodstream or even in the bone marrow; these cancers are relatively few in
number, although they do claim many lives every year. It is in these cases, I
think, that gene therapy has the best chance of working.

<P>"Are there other new therapies? Yes! At present, the majority are adjunct
therapies to existing chemotherapy treatments. Most cancers must develop a blood
supply to continue growth beyond a few millimeters in size. Nutrients and oxygen
carried in the blood must be delivered to the cancer, and wastes must be
removedQotherwise the cancer cells, like any other cells in a tissue, will die.
Without a blood supply, cancer cells do not effectively metastasize to other
organs and thereby kill the patient. Medical researchers are now testing many
therapeutic agents intended to prevent blood supply to tumors. Some of these
agents appear to halt cancer growth, which would then allow conventional
chemotherapy treatments to work more effectively.

<P>"Another approach being explored in my <A
HREF="http://klaatu.oit.umass.edu/pubaffs/science_news/press/bomb.html">lab</A>
and in a couple of others involves identifying molecules that are found only on
the surface of the blood vessels feeding the cancers (and not on the surface of
blood vessels in normal tissues). Once these molecules are identified, they can
be used as 'zip codes' to address various therapeutic agents only to the cancer
or to send agents to block the blood supply to the cancer without killing the
surrounding, normal cells. Furthermore, using the specific molecules on the
surface of the cancer blood vessels to target therapeutic agents raises the
possibility of using the same molecules to target agents to the cancer cells as
well. It may even be possible to modify the cancer blood vessel cells to secrete
factors that would inhibit cancer cell growth.

<P>"I have great hopes for the targeting approach. My colleagues and I recently
wrote a short review of the approach, published in the April 1996, issue of <A
HREF="http://medicine.nature.com/">Nature Medicine</A>.

Jim Mixson of the University of Maryland School of Medicine also provided a
two-part answer to the question:

<P>"Regarding the first part of the question, gene therapy is approaching
clinical realization for the treatment of neoplastic and metabolic diseases.
Although currently there are no FDA-approved gene therapy products, an effective
gene therapy will probably gain FDA approval within the next three to five years.
There are now more than 100 gene therapy clinical trials aimed toward cancer,
genetic diseases (such as ADA deficiency, cystic fibrosis and hemophilia A),
infectious diseases (including AIDS) and autoimmune diseases (such as rheumatoid
arthritis). Because of the urgent needs of a large number of cancer patients,
most of these gene therapy trials are directed against cancer.

<P>"Gene therapy approaches fall into two main categories: (1) the transfer of a
gene that stimulates the immune system and (2) the insertion of genes within the
tumor that sensitizes the tumor to a relatively nontoxic 'prodrug.' Both these
approaches show a great deal of promise."

<P>The second part of Mixson's answer echoes the research described by Jacobson:

<P>"Therapies that inhibit tumors' blood vessel development also seem to have
considerable merit. Blood vessel development is technically known as
angiogenesis, so the drugs that inhibit this process are called antiangiogenic.
These antiangiogenic drugs include antibiotic derivatives, peptides (small
protein fragments) and peptide derivatives. Many of the peptides being tested
have been isolated from proteins that are secreted by tumors. Blood vessel
development is critical for the growth of any solid tumor, such as breast, colon
or lung cancer. Thus, any therapy that can inhibit the tumors' blood supply
should be effective against multiple types of tumors. This area of research is
receiving a good deal of attention, and there are already clinical trials in this
field."

"If a diet of caloric
restriction can extend the life span of laboratory rats, then does the lifestyle
of an athlete, who burns calories at a rapid rate, hasten the aging process?"
</A></B></FONT>

<P>-<I>Terence Cross, Dublin, Ireland</I>

<P>Barbara C. Hansen, professor of physiology in the School of Medicine at the
University of Maryland and director of the university's Obesity and Diabetes
Research Center, responded as follows:

<P>"The effects of caloric restriction on life span in mammals have been
demonstrated only among rodents. At present, there are no studies that can
definitively say whether caloric restriction extends life span in any primate, so
it is premature to draw conclusions about the possibility of extending the
maximal human life span.

<P>"We are currently researching caloric restriction in nonhuman primates
(monkeys). Our monkey study has been going on for 13 years. We began the study on
young adult monkeys, equivalent to humans 20 to 25 years old. The animals were
placed on a weight-control regimen, designed so they could not put on middle-age
weight. We set a monkey's caloric intake for each week based on whether he has
gained or lost weight since the previous week.

<P>"There are two key issues under study here: Does the average monkey live
longer, and is the maximal life span of the monkeys extended? For rodents,
caloric restriction has been shown to extend both average and maximal life span.
For monkeys, we already know that the animals in our group are living longer than
average, if you judge by the 50 percent death point (the time at which half of
the animals in the group have died). We have also observed general improvements
in health and decreases in disease, which are likely to translate into longer
lives. For example, restricting the caloric intake of a monkey sufficiently to
prevent the onset of middle-age obesity completely prevents type II diabetes,
even though these animals are prone to diabetes.

<P>"What we do not know is the effect on maximal life span. Will the
longest-lived calorie-restricted monkey survive longer than any other monkey has
survived? The monkeys in the University of Maryland study are now at an age
equivalent to that of 50- to 60-year-old humans, so we won't know the answer to
that question for another 10 to 15 years; monkeys are thought to live well into
their thirties under laboratory conditions.

<P>"There are two other, related primate studies under way. Richard Weindruch
started a similar one at the University of Wisconsin about five year after our
own. George Roth and Mark Lane are running a slightly different program at the <A
HREF="http://www.senior.com/npo/nia.html">National Institute on Aging</A>. Roth
and Lane are working with several groups of monkeys; they started some of the
monkeys on a program of caloric restriction before the animals reached adulthood.
This study will produce the best data on the effects of early caloric
restriction. It is not yet clear whether early caloric restriction has a net
positive or negative influence on health.

<P>"We do know enough to say that caloric restriction to prevent obesity during
adulthood is likely to be very beneficial, to humans as well as to monkeys.
Nobody knows whether the health benefits are because of the positive effects of
not having excess adipose tissue or because of altered metabolic activity. My
colleagues and I just finished a paper showing that caloric restriction increases
the efficiency with which the body burns calories. The problem is, we do not know
how that change occurs--that is what we are studying right now.

<P>"Incidentally, there is no evidence that excessive leanness is healthy. In
fact, most evidence shows that there is an increased mortality associated with
excessive leanness. It seems that there is an increasing risk of disease and risk
at both ends of the weight range, though probably for different reasons.

<P>"Turning back to the original question, we must consider several issues
separate from caloric restriction. The lifestyle of an athlete would normally
extend life span because it would involve exercise, a healthy diet, absence of
obesity, absence of smoking and absence of alcohol and drug abuse (one would
hope!). Such behaviors reduce the risk of various diseases, including
cardiovascular disease. The athletic lifestyle won't necessarily cause you to
live to 100, but it might extend your life span from, say, 70 to 80.

<P>"The rapid rate at which an athlete burns calories is not associated with
either an increase or decrease in life span. There is, in fact, a theory that
animals have only a fixed number of calories to burn during their life, but it is
pure speculation, intended to explain why calorie-restricted rodents live longer.
There is no evidence that an enhanced turnover rate of calories hastens the aging
process. Based on our current level of knowledge, we would expect athletes to
have longer or at least healthier lives than they would if they were not
athletic.

<P>"Exercise, diet and genotype all interact in complicated ways. Despite all our
attempts to take our destinies into our own hands, genes seem to play a
significant role in determining life span, susceptibility to disease and probably
the effects of caloric restriction."

"Is there a biochemical
test that accurately diagnoses bipolar disorder? I heard on the radio today that
millions of people in the U.S. have bipolar disorder and that 75 per cent of them
are undiagnosed and untreated." </A></B></FONT>

<P>-<I>James R. Spradling, Oro Valley, Arizona</I>

<P>The following response comes from Fred Petty, the director of the Mental
Health Clinic at the Dallas Veterans Administration Medical Center and profesor
of psychiatry at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical School:

<P>"The current best estimate is that adult lifetime prevalence of bipolar
disorder in the U.S. is about 1 percent for severe cases and 2 to 3 percent if
milder cases are included--cases that would include <A
HREF="http://www.mentalhealth.com/dis/p20-md03.html">cyclothymia</A> and 'bipolar
2.' Given the population of the U.S. (about 250 million), those numbers translate
into about two to three million with severe bipolar disorder and some five to
seven million total, including those with mild symptoms. So the figures you heard
on the radio seem reasonable.

<P>"I have seen estimates that two thirds to three quarters of the people with
depression are undiagnosed and untreated. I haven't seen the corresponding
statistics for bipolar disorder, but I would say that, looking at mood disorders
overall, most patients are still undiagnosed and untreated.

<P>"Right now the diagnosis of bipolar disorder is a clinical diagnosis, which
means it is made by a physician based on information about the patient's
symptoms, mental status and medical history. It is important that people obtain a
medical evaluation, because there are some conditions, such as thyroid disease,
which can mimic the symptoms of bipolar disorder.

<P>"There is, at present, no routinely available biochemical diagnostic tests for
bipolar disorder. My laboratory has published some work looking at the blood
levels of an amino acid called GABA (gamma amino butyric acid), which functions
as a neurotransmitter in the brain. Bipolar patients often show low levels of
GABA in the bloodstream. The GABA test is currently used only for research
purposes; GABA levels appear abnormal only in about one third of the patients who
are bipolar. Also, this test is not specific for bipolar, because low GABA levels
are also found in people exhibiting non- bipolar depression.

<P>"One of the likely reasons that GABA is not a universal indicator is that
bipolar disorder is heterogeneous. In other words, the syndrome we call 'bipolar'
actually results from several different causal conditions (etiologies); it is
possible that in some cases the low GABA level is the predominant etiology, but
not in all. In this sense, bipolar is somewhat like diarrhea--we call it one
thing, but you can get it a variety of ways (through colitis, food poisoning, and
so on)--or like heart failure, which has a multiple etiology. But low GABA
readings look useful because the anomaly persists even after the person improves
clinically. If my group can get its grants renewed, we would like to look at GABA
levels in children whose parents have bipolar disorder.

<P>"There is also some very interesting work being done with PET scans, which can
show deficits of the neurotransmitter serotonin in the brain, associated with
depression. Serotonin deficits seem to persist even after the depression
lifts--suggesting that it is a real biological marker. PET scans of serotonin in
bipolar patients have not yet been done, to my knowledge. Brain imaging using
magnetic resonance has been applied to bipolar research; some bipolar patients
show brain lesions in these images.

<P>"Another very exciting area of investigation involves the search for a genetic
locus for bipolar illness. Bipolar is probably the most genetic of all
psychiatric illnesses, and psychiatric illnesses in general have a strong genetic
component. If you have one parent with the illness, you face a 25 percent risk;
if both parents are bipolar, you face a 50 percent risk. Among identical twins,
there is an 80 percent concordance for bipolar disorder. Ideally, we would like
to diagnose the illness in young people before they express any severe symptoms.
In this way, we could save a lot of human suffering; the earlier a patient gets
into treatment, the better the prognosis."

<BIG>
<STRONG>
OBSERVATION DE LA TERRE :  SIMULATEUR - TELEDETECTION - EXPLOITATION 
</STRONG>

<BR><BR>
L'activit&eacute; de notre soci&eacute;t&eacute; dans le domaine spatial est ax&eacute;e depuis ses d&eacute;buts sur la simulation de syst&egrave;mes complexes. Ces simulations font appel &agrave; des comp&eacute;tences dans les domaines math&eacute;matiques appliqu&eacute;es, informatique, physique, intelligence artificielle, traitement du signal et de l'image, etc. Les activit&eacute;s, initialement au niveau du segment bord, &eacute;voluent vers les applications au sol qui concernent l'architecture et le d&eacute;veloppement des cha&icirc;nes de traitement de la charge utile, suivis de l'exploitation op&eacute;rationnelle des donn&eacute;es.

<BR><BR>

<STRONG>SIMULATEURS</STRONG>
<P>
Les simulateurs de syst&egrave;mes de t&eacute;l&eacute;dection spatiale prennent en compte :
<ul>
<li> la m&eacute;canique orbitale
<li> le contr&ocirc;le et guidage
<li> le signal recueilli par les instruments d'observation de la terre (exemple : luminances marines observables par les instruments MERIS, POLDER)
<li> la cha&icirc;ne d'acquisition et de traitement du signal &agrave; bord, optique, d&eacute;tection,	traitements num&eacute;riques
<li> l'algorithmique du traitement des donn&eacute;es au sol : filtrages, rectification, &eacute;laboration de param&egrave;tres g&eacute;ophysiques.
</ul>
Ces calculs sont int&eacute;gr&eacute;s pour r&eacute;aliser des simulations de bout en bout permettant l'&eacute;valuation de la qualit&eacute; d'image de l'ensemble de la cha&icirc;ne : instrument, satellite, traitements au sol (MERIS) . La grande quantit&eacute; et la vari&eacute;t&eacute; des param&egrave;tres de simulation conduisent &agrave; l'utilisation d'outils sophistiqu&eacute;s de gestion de bases de donn&eacute;es  et d'interfaces utilisateurs graphiques.
</P>
<BR><BR>

<STRONG>SECTEUR TERRIEN</STRONG>
<P>
Un d&eacute;bouch&eacute; important pour les activit&eacute;s de simulation est la r&eacute;alisation des cha&icirc;nes  op&eacute;rationnelles de traitement au sol. Les simulateurs d&eacute;crits ci-dessus faisant office de prototype et d'outil d'aide &agrave; la mise au point, ces cha&icirc;nes de traitement sont ensuite sp&eacute;cifi&eacute;es et r&eacute;alis&eacute;es (instruments MERIS, MIMR pour le compte de  l'Agence Spatiale Europ&eacute;enne).

Une cha&icirc;ne de traitement au sol comporte :
<ul>
<li> l'exploitation automatis&eacute;e des donn&eacute;es provenant de l'instrument ; traitements op&eacute;rationnels, support &agrave; l'&eacute;talonnage et aux traitements exp&eacute;rimentaux ;
<li> Gestion de l'archivage : donn&eacute;es brutes, produits finis ;
<li> Gestion des services aux utilisateurs : catalogage, diffusion des produits
</ul>

La r&eacute;alisation de ces simulateurs et cha&icirc;nes de traitement sol est principalement ax&eacute;e sur l'oc&eacute;anographie spatiale :
<ul>
<li> Couleur de l'eau (MERIS, POLDER)
<li> Temp&eacute;rature de l'eau, interface atmosph&egrave;re-oc&eacute;an (MIMR).
</ul>
</P>
<BR><BR>
<STRONG>EXPLOITATION</STRONG>
<P>
Le troisi&egrave;me volet de l'activit&eacute; spatiale concerne la phase d'exploitation de donn&eacute;es de t&eacute;l&eacute;d&eacute;tection :
<ul>
<li> D&eacute;finition d'architecture logicielle pour l'interpr&eacute;tation d'images a&eacute;riennes
<li> D&eacute;tection automatique des contours sur cartographie
<li> D&eacute;veloppement de syst&egrave;mes experts en oc&eacute;anographie spatiale (incluant fusion de donn&eacute;es, param&eacute;trisation des formes, statistique du comportement, syst&egrave;me de classification) ; 
<li> Algorithmique et traitement du signal : outil d'aide &agrave; la reconnaissance de signatures ;
<li> Identification de param&egrave;tres physiques signifiants et s&eacute;lection des bases de donn&eacute;es y donnant acc&egrave;s.
</ul>

<p>
Presently there is considerable discussion both in scientific and industrial circles as  how best to limit anthropogenic emissions of carbon dioxide due to its role in global atmospheric greenhouse warming. A wide range of technologies are being investigated that increase the efficiency of electrical production, decrease the energy needed to power electrical components, limit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions etc. etc.
</p>
<p>
Under the aegis of National activites, as well as The International Energy Agency  (IEA) Greenhouse Gas Programme,  research  is also being conducted into a broad range of mitigation options and future R&D requirements, including policy and  market implications. A large number of political and industrial considerations  will have to be taken into account if a formulation of global priorities are eventually to be agreed. Whether events will lead to the need for such a formulation is clearly not possible to forecast at present,  it will probably depend on political, social and industrial conditions that might occur if global climatic change were to be demonstrated in an clear and unequivocal manner, and a serious attempt to decrease carbon dioxide emissions were considered necessary.
</p>
<p>
One series of options that have attracted considerable attention are those of separation and disposal of carbon dioxide. Among others these  range from the use of  aquifers, storage combined with enhanced oil recovery, pumping into empty gas reservoirs, and ocean disposal. In the recent IEA international Conference on Greenhouse Gases Mitigation Options (London, August 1995) this latter option was considered a scientifically elegant CO2 mitigation option for the deep ocean in that it accelerates the natural process of transfer of carbon dioxide to the ocean. It was clearly stated, however, that a full understanding of the complex chemical, biological and oceanographic factors has to be acquired before proposing such an option.
</p>
<p>
Under such conditions what is the potential role of industry, given that the lead times to develop new products is long and costly, and where funding for research is increasingly competitive?  One answer is to contribute to these scientific discussions with ideas that could be perhaps eventually implemented  industrially, and which help maintain and strengthen links between industry and science in the area of Global Change.
</p>
<p>
An example of this type of activity is the work that ACRI has been undertaking concerning the use of solid carbon dioxide penetrators for the disposal of this atmospheric gas in deep ocean sedimentary formations. This idea has been proposed as an industrial patent by the Joint Research Centre, Ispra, Italy. ACRI in collaboration with Ecole Nationale Superieure de Techniques Avancees, Paris, France, has developed a preliminary conceptual design of an industrial disposal system. Some of the more fundamental science considerations have been investigated by the Joint Research Centre, Commission of the European Communities and the Italian aero-space firm Aermacchi. The results of these studies were presented at the recent IEA Greenhouse Gas Conference in London, UK.
</p>
<p>
It needs to be clearly stated that under present international legislation (United Nation Convention on the Law Of the Sea UNCLOS, London Dumping Convention etc.) such a disposal option would not be presently permitted. Further, any proposed use of deep sub-seabed geological formations is one that would need a global social consensus which would be unlikely without unequivocal demonstration as to its long term safety and overall benefit to society.
</p>
<p>
However, it needs to be underlined that from a purely technical point of view the proposed solution should, if proven feasible and safe, effectively isolate the carbon dioxide from the overlying ocean waters using the natural barrier properties of the surrounding stable soft clay or carbonate rich sediments. Thus the risk of the eventual return of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere through upwelling of ocean waters can be effectively excluded. Disposal would thus be permanent. A further advantage could be the creation of a waste disposal industry using this type of technology and financed on the polluter-payer principle. The technology appears to be easily within present day carbon dioxide industrial engineering capabilities. Whether in view of the volumes of waste material potentially involved such a solution would be economically viable is clearly at present difficult to assess.
</p>
<p>
As an example of an industrial-scientific contribution to international considerations on possible  mitigation options, the present preliminary studies aim at focusing  discussions on the long-term storage capabilities of deep marine geological formations. Whether this or any other option is eventually considered acceptable or not depends on open discussion by all sectors of society of the advantages and weaknesses of all the alternatives. 
</p>
<p>
A detailed description of the penetrator option and a conceptual design of an industrial disposal system, as well as the justification for the industrial JRC patent application  are shown below.

<BOLD>ACRI</BOLD> functions under a unified management structure, with
operations located in Sophia Antipolis (France). It employs a matrix
organization, that is, a combination of functional or line sections,
and of a project team.

<P>

ACRI has a wide experience in remote sensing system requirements,
analysis and ground segment design, mission analysis and requirements.

<P>

ACRI has also a wide experience in a variety of space problems such as
overall mission performances, orbital properties generator, spacecraft
axes steering control, signal characteristics to be detected on top of
the atmosphere, geometrical and radiometric instrument features and
distortion, and on ground processing algorithms needed to retrieve
accurate Earth and environmental signal and geophysical parameters.

<P>

In particular, ACRI has been continuously involved in mission analysis
tasks such as identification of optimal and attitude parameters for
Earth observation; optimisation of instrument mission performance:
coverage, signal dynamics characterisation on top of the atmosphere,
sampling geometry and signal quality, pointing accuracy and on board
calibration procedure. For instance, ACRI has performed the mission
analysis and requirements for MERIS, MIMR, MIPAS,
GOMOS,... instruments during the POEM-1/ENVISAT-1 Pre-Phase-A, Phase-A
and Phase-B. All the scientific and technical reports have been issued
to the ESA Scientific Advisory Groups (SAGs) members.

<P>

Furthermore, ACRI is well acquainted with the Earth observation
science community. As such ACRI has co-operation agreements with
laboratories in France (such as Service d'A&eacute;ronomie: J-L. Bertaux,
Institut Laplace: G. Megie, Laboratoire de M&eacute;t&eacute;orologie
Dynamique:
N.A. Scott, P. Flament, Laboratoire de Physique et Chimie Marine:
A. Morel, Laboratoire d'Optique Atmosph&eacute;rique: 
D.Tanr&eacute;,....., Ecole
des Mines de Paris: L. Wald) and European laboratories such as Finnish
Meteorological Institute: G. Leppelmeier, Free University of Berlin:
J. Fischer, GKSS: H. Grassl, Plymouth Marine Laboratory: J. Aiken, UK
Meteorological Office: P.  Curtis, Institut d'A&eacute;ronomie Spatiale de
Bruxelles: P. Simon...

<P>

ACRI is leading the project "Integration of remote sensing, in-situ
observations and numerical modelling applied to the northeast
Atlantic" in the frame of the "Human capital and mobility" initiative
of the CEC. ACRI is participating in the OCEAN project of the CEC
Joint Research Centre.  ACRI experience can be summarised in six types
of activities:

<UL>
<LI>i. User requirements: ACRI is currently in charge for
the EUMETSAT Ground Segment support of the coordination with the users
community. ACRI is involved with JRC in pilot projects, part of the
Centre for Earth Observation (CEO) project, in charge of the
collection of user requirements from experimental community on coastal
zones;

<LI>ii. Mission Analysis: ACRI has been continuously involved in
mission analysis tasks such as identification of optimal orbit and
attitude parameters for Earth observation (yaw steering, ESA study);
optimisation of instrument mission and performance: coverage, signal
dynamics characterisation, sampling geometry and signal quality,
pointing accuracy,... for instruments studied during the POEM-1 phase
B: MERIS, MIMR, MIPAS;

<LI>iii. Ground processing: ACRI has performed the
definition study for engineering and scientific data products of MERIS
and MIMR instruments in the frame of POEM Ground Segment Phase B study
(ESA contract led by Logica, MDA). To satisfy the global requirements,
the MERIS and MIMR instrument operation will be permanent. All
corresponding data should be acquired, processed following various
levels, and disseminated in due time to user point of contact.


<P>

ACRI is currently in charge of the complete definition of the
data processing chain of the GOMOS and MERIS instruments; the
definition covers all necessary processing steps from the raw data to
the generation of the geophysical products. (e.g. the MERIS Ocean
Colour products such as chlorophyll concentration, chlorophyll
fluorescence, type and Optical depth of marine aerosols or the GOMOS
ozone or aerosols vertical profiles among others).

<P>

It includes the MERIS and GOMOS overall ground processing
architecture, detailed design, development plan, products and
algorithms definition specifications. The documentation follows ESA
Software Engineering Standards and Product Assurance Quality.
<P>

<LI>
iv. Guidance and Control:
<P>ACRI has performed studies on MIPAS
instrument pointing requirements in order to aim at a stable
tangential altitude. ACRI has also performed, with the Laboratoire
d'Automatique de Nantes, a study on Guidance Navigation and Control
for moderate lift/drag Re-entry, applied to aero-assisted orbit
transfer (ESA Contract March 1991).  v. Navigation: ACRI has modelised
6 D.O.F. trajectories applied to as various subjects as a spacecraft
attitude, ship precise positioning (French Navy contract), re-entry in
the atmosphere .  vi. System Software: ACRI has developed general
purpose software in the fluid dynamics and combustion (ANSWER), ground
water (PORFLOW), surface and marine waters (TIDAL), atmosphere (RADM),
guidance and control (ANACOM), and Earth Observation (EOSS)
fields. This activity includes software sells, users training and
maintenance.
<P>
	ACRI has specified the software requirements for the future
MIMR end to end system simulator during the Phase-B of the MIMR study
(ALENIA Contract, 1991-2);
	ACRI has performed under contract with DORNIER :
	MERIS mission performances and end to end system simulator
(including on ground processing until level 2) development .
	GOMOS mission performances and end to end system simulator
(including on ground processing until level 2) development.

</UL>

<ITALIC> A common concept is being developed for remote sensing
instrument simulators. The objectives generally recognised are to
assess end-to-end performance of the remote sensing process in order
to:
	verify instrument and ground processing performance against
the mission objectives
	provide feedback to the instrument design and tuning
	provide a reference and support tool for the validation of the
mission ground segment in development, delivery and in-orbit operation
phases The simulator includes mathematical models for 1) signal (raw
data) generated from various Earth, atmosphere, etc. targets emitting
signal including environmental conditions (sun illumination, satellite
orbit motion, satellite axes steering control, target environment,
signal propagation...).  2) instrument hardware and electronic chain
simulator (MTF) generating instrument outputs from given reference
inputs signal (incident flux at the top of the atmosphere).  3) ground
processing simulator generating from raw data the data product
processed and calibrated on ground. These processes require to inverse
the geometric, radiometric and instrument transfer function using
dedicated deconvolution methods.  The mathematical models are
supported by a common infrastructure of data management and user
interface, tools supporting simulation results analysis such as image
quality assessment.  </ITALIC>

The freeway traffic is simulated thanks to a set of discrete sources located all along the several lanes. In this study, 392 equivalent sources have been used.<P>

At each source, 0.32 g/s of pollutant is injected in the computational domain for the South and North lanes of the A86 freeway and 0.63 g/s is injected for the South and North lanes of the A4 freeway.<P>

The numerical simulations have been performed in a first step by taking into account the pollution induced by the freeway alone (see figures 1 and 3) and in a second step by adding the pollution due to the A4 freeway tunnels. The increase of NO2 concentration due to these tunnels is visible in the figure 2. Several wind speeds and direction and several atmospheric stabilities have been used to estimate their impact upon the NO2 concentration around the exits of the A4 tunnels.<P>

<H1> Seiche in PORT TUDY <P>
(GROIX ISLAND)
</H1>

<HR>
</CENTER>

<big>
The water surface of "PORT TUDY" (the Groix Island harbour situated few kilometers south of Britain in France) is sometimes subject to oscillations induced by a long period oscillation water wave, also called a seiche. The seiche is set between the continent and the island and has a period of five minutes. The wave amplitude may be greater than one meter, so that strong currents may be generated inside the harbour.<P>

Modulus of velocity (considered constant on the depth) inside the harbour are reported on the picture below. It is possible to follow the corresponding animation for a complete period of the seiche.

      <H1>Guidance and Control for Moderate Lift/Drag Reentry</H1>
      <img src="/gifs/bar_marbre_noir2.gif"><BR><BR>

      <BIG>
	The purpose of this study consists in analysing guidance and control
	methods for space vehicles during the atmospheric phases of change of
	orbit. The analysis will be based on the definition of a moderate
	Lift/Drag ratio vehicle carrying out AOTV (aero-assisted orbit
	transfer vehicle) type missions. An orbit change from a high circular
	geostationary orbit to a low circular orbit having an altitude of 400
	km and an inclination of 28.5 deg will be analysed.

      <P>

	The main objective of entry into the atmosphere during AOTV manoeuvre
	is to dissipate the substantial initial orbital energy. This energy
	loss is effected by reducing the speed of the spacecraft through the
	action of aerodynamic forces that will act on it during the
	atmospheric phase.

	In an orbital-change type mission, the global objective is to reach a
	low circular recovery orbit characterised by a given orbital
	energy. The atmospheric phase must therefore be adjusted so that the
	vehicle is in an energy state that corresponds to the final desired
	orbit.

      <P>

	Through the use of flexible guidance and control methods, this
	objective is reached by commanding to the spacecraft the attitude it
	must adopt when it meets the atmosphere, so as to control the
	aerodynamic forces that will reduce its energy.

      <P>

	The <B>transition</B> from a high circular geostationary orbit to a low
	circular orbit for vehicles of the AOTV type is divided into several
	phases:

      <OL>

	<LI>i) application of a de-orbiting pulse DVd 

	<LI>ii) atmospheric phase: the guidance and control laws make use of
	  the aerodynamic forces to reduce the energy of the spacecraft.

	<LI>iii) application of a pulse DV1 on exit from the atmosphere: a
	  boost of energy is applied to the spacecraft so that it may exactly
	  reach the desired apogee.

	<LI>iv) application of an impulse DV11 which circularises the
	  trajectory on the desired low orbit.

      </OL>

      </CENTER>

      <P>
	An algorithm of Near Optimal Guidance (NOG) has been studied, based on
	considerations of NLP (Non Linear Programming) and of cost
	function. This tool, which enables reference trajectories to be
	created. This law of NOG will be considered as a self-adaptable
	guidance technique, such as following guidance techniques : trajectory
	tracking, sliding modes, predictor corrector, and asymptotic
	expansions. Apart from the predictor corrector and the NOG, the other
	guidance laws require a reference trajectory, and can be applied in
	terms of energy, altitude, or other physical entity, such as, for
	example, density or drag.

      <P>

	The main objective of the guidance laws is to fulfil the mission in
	terms of the apogee by controlling the aerodynamic forces acting in
	the orbital plane: this mission will be quantified by the impulse DV1
	to be applied to the spacecraft at atmosphere exit. The mission is
	successful when DV1 = 0.

      <P>

	Disturbances occurring during flight, relating to uncertainties of
	modeling and to ambient conditions, such as winds, atmospheric density
	variations, and uncertainties on vehicle data, together with
	uncertainty on the state-vector of the spacecraft will impair success
	of the mission insofar as the guidance laws will no longer satisfy DV1
	=0.

      <P>

      <P>

	<B>Figure 2 :</B> The vertical guidance logic is based on the
	control of the aerodynamic forces in the orbital plane.
      </CENTER>

      <P>
	It is therefore imperative to define an interval [ -DV1 acc ; DV1 acc
	] acceptable in terms of the mission, such that the value of DV1 acc
	may be considered as being close to zero, knowing that the orders of
	magnitude for DVd (de-orbiting pulse) and DV11 (circularisation pulse)
	are 1500 and 100 m/s in the case of an orbit change from a high
	geostationary-type orbit towards a low circular orbit.

      <P>

	DV1 acc = 20 m/s is a criterion of mission-success compatible with the
	value of DVd, and represents only 1/5 of the value of the
	circularisation pulse DV11.

      <P>

	The second objective of the guidance laws is to make the final orbit
	coincide with the initial one, that is to say that the inclination of
	the orbit and the longitude of the ascending node of the final orbit
	are identical with those of the initial orbit. This double condition
	may be reduced to a single condition, that of making zero the value of
	the wedge angle h that represents the angle between the initial and
	final orbital planes. Lateral guidance must be capable of ensuring
	this by controlling the forces acting in a direction perpendicular to
	the orbital plane.

      <P>

	For h = 0.1 deg, the positional error at the end of the atmospheric
	phase is of the order of 11 km. This value is to be compared with the
	uncertainties of knowing the position, which on board navigation can
	only furnish at best with a 5 km margin.

      <P>

	Thus, for h less than 0.1 deg, the position error is of the same order
	of magnitude as the uncertainties on knowledge of the position, and,
	in this case, the final orbit will be considered identical with the
	initial orbit. The maximum heating rate HRmax along the trajectory
	does not involve closed-loop control by the algorithm during the
	atmospheric phase. It thus enables the heating induced by the guidance
	to be taken into account, but not used in the feedback loop.

      <P>

	The two criteria DV1 and h that permit evaluation of the guidance laws
	are linked with the trajectory of the mass-centre of the
	spacecraft. The evolution of the mass-centre depends on the
	aerodynamic attitude which is determined by the desired angle of
	attack a, sideslip angle b, and bank angle s. The angle of attack is
	kept constant for AFE, and determines the lift/drag ratio. The
	sideslip angle is kept at 0 so as not to create any lateral
	forces. The lift and drag aerodynamic forces are thus contained in the
	symmetry plane of the spacecraft.

      <P>

	The bank angle is derived from the guidance laws, it positions the
	space-craft's vertical axis with reference to the earth's vertical
	axis, and ensures the mission during the atmospheric phase : DV1 = 0
	and h = 0.

      <P>

	The objective of control laws is to ensure that the attitude of the
	spacecraft agrees with the attitude dictated by the guidance laws: a =
	a0, b = b0 and s = sguidance. A trade-off analysis will be performed
	between the different adaptive control techniques : gain scheduling
	(GS), self tuning regulators (STR), and model reference adaptive
	system (MRAS).

      <P>

	Control of the spacecraft attitude is obtained by the application of
	torques with respect to the axes of the spacecraft frame. These
	torques are supplied by the thrusters, whose mode of operation is of
	the ON or OFF type. A modulator transforms the continuous torque
	coming from control into a pulse train for each thruster. The fuel
	consumption linked to the activity of the thrusters is estimated and
	will be considered as a criterion allowing qualification of the
	control laws for a given guidance law.

      <P>

	As a main output of the study, a simulation software has been
	developed so as to assess the performances of various guidance and
	control laws.

      <big>
	The Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) belongs to a new
	generation of ocean colour sensors ; leading to an improved bio
	/geophysical characterisation of oceans and coastal zones, it also
	provides information in atmospheric and land applications.

      <P>

	MERIS is a push-broom instrument and measures the reflected radiation
	from the Earth's surface and from clouds through the atmosphere in the
	visible and near infrared range during daytime. The 1150 km wide swath
	is divided into 5 segments covered by 5 identical cameras having
	corresponding field of views with a slight overlap between adjacent
	cameras. The cameras view the Earth through 5 polarisation scrambling
	windows and five mirror elements. Each camera images the Earth on the
	entrance slit of a spectrometer. The area of the Earth seen
	instantaneously forms an across track stripe. This stripe is imaged on
	a CCD-line. The spectrum of each element in the Earth image is
	dispersed on a corresponding CCD column. The spatial resolution along
	track is determined by successive read-outs of the CCD-array. Full
	spatial resolution data, i.e. 300 m at nadir, will be transmitted over
	coastal zones and land surfaces. Reduced spatial resolution data
	i.e. 1200 m at nadir, will be transmitted continuously. These data
	will be processed in flight and on ground to provide spectral images
	of the Earth corrected for atmospheric influence. After correction,
	the main geo-physical parameters which can be derived from MERIS
	measurements are :

      <P>

      <UL>

	<LI>ocean colour parameters in open waters and coastal waters :
	  chlorophyll, gelbstoffe, other pigments, suspended solid matter ;

	<LI>simple qualitative parameters : presence of clouds, emerged land ;

	<LI>atmosphere parameters : Aerosol optical thickness, &Aring;ngstr&ouml;m
	  exponent ; Cloud albedo, optical thickness, top pressure ; Water
	  vapour column contents.

      </UL>


      To meet the very stringent specifications, atmospheric effects and
      radiometric and geometric distortions induced by the image acquisition
      process must be corrected for. While the atmospheric correction is
      carried out during data processing on ground, instrument
      characteristics are partly rectified in flight during calibration. In
      this mode correction parameters such as offset and gain are generated
      to improve the digitised signal values by computation on board.

      <P>

	A typical set of MERIS spectral bands, as reviewed by the ESA advisory
	group at the workshop of Villefranche in 1991, is given in table
	I, together with their envisaged application. The centre
	frequencies and the bandwidths are programmable in flight, by
	telecommand. The main performance parameters of MERIS are presented in
	table II.

      <H1>MERSS : The MERIS System Simulator</H1>

      The MERIS system simulator provides support for end-to-end performance
      evaluation of the MERIS instrument and on-ground processing.
      It does so by :
      <OL>

	<LI>managing a set of targets ;

	<LI>simulating the image formation process within the instrument ;

	<LI>performing the ground segment software functions which
	  contribute to image production.

      </OL>

      Performance evaluation is based on qualitative and quantitative
      evaluation of the difference between the original target parameters
      set, and the results of processing by instrument and ground segment
      sub-models, as shown the follozing figure.

      <CENTER>
	<B>Figure :</B> Performance Evaluation levels
      </CENTER>

      <P>

	The modular structure of the simulator allows to do such comparisons
	at several different stages of the image production process.
	This is intended to help evaluate the contribution of each stage :
	satellite, instrument, on-ground processing, to the overall system
	performance. 

      <P>

	Intermediate results, in particular internal parameters of the 
	instrument sub-model, are produced as intermediate results to
	help trouble-shooting.

      <P>
	
	The selected targets provide a sub-set of the possible scenes 
	viewed by MERIS, which is meaning fulfrom the point of view 
	of performance evaluation by referring to the evaluation conditions ;
	from the point of view of instrument calibration and testing
	on ground and in flight.

      <P>

	The complete imaging process is simulated and includes the flight 
	of the instrument above the Earth, the pointing perturbations due 
	to the Platform, the collection of light by the sensors and the 
	electrical processing on board, and the digital data processing 
	on board and on ground.

      <P>

	Several modes of simulation are provided in order to support :

      <OL>

	<LI>realistic simulation of the MERIS instrument operations : 
	  imaging, calibration ;

	<LI>investigation of local as well as global effects.

      </OL>

      <BIG>
	The GOMOS instrument has been designed to measure trace gas
	concentrations and other atmospheric parameters in the altitude range
	between 20 and 100 km. In addition to the main goal of monitoring
	ozone long term trends, the GOMOS near-IR spectrometers will measure
	O2 and H2O, from which density and temperature profiles can be
	obtained, which are of interest in atmospheric modelling, but will
	also improve the quality of the ozone retrieval. At the same time two
	fast photometer channels will produce information about atmospheric
	fluctuations, again of interest both for basic atmospheric modelling,
	but above all useful in the reduction of the ozone-related data.

      <p align=center>
	<img alt=GOMOS Satellit src="/gifs/GOMOS2.gif"><br><br>
	<b>Figure 1 </b>: GOMOS<BR>
      </P>
      <P>

	About 25 stars brighter than MV=2 can routinely be observed, at
	different longitudes from each orbit. With typically 14 orbits/day
	the GOMOS instrument will thus produce as much data as a global
	network of 360 ground stations. Depending on the mode and goals
	of observation, some 100-200 stars are candidates for GOMOS
	occultation observation.  

      <P>

	Because of interference from scattered sunlight, fewer stars can be
	observed in bright limb occultation than in dark limb.  In dark limb
	occultation the limiting considerations are quality of spectral
	information and the ability of the tracking system to maintain lock.
	Hotter stars give better spectral signal-to-noise ratio, and thus are
	better for ozone measurements.  At the same time, for a fixed
	brightness, such stars have fewer photons in the range used by the
	star tracker. Given the starting time of an occultation and the time
	required to move the input mirror from the end point of one
	occultation to the beginning of the next, it is not possible in
	practice to observe all possible stars in one occultation.  Therefore,
	selection is necessary.

      <P>

	This is accomplished by establishing selection criteria, such as 
	brightness, next available star, maximum intensity in a particular
	wavelength region, etc., which allow a list generator to create
	scenario of observations for one orbit. The instrument optical
	design is based on a single telescope concept : the telescope
	simultaneously feeds a Ultra violet-Visible medium resolution
	spectrometer, a near-infrared high resolution spectrometer,
	a fast photometer equipped with two spectral channels, and a
	CCD-based star tracker. The latter provides the tracking accuracy
	required to maintain the star image at the centre of the
	spectrometers entrance slit during the occultation observation.

      <P>

	The steering front assembly is made of one flat mirror mounted
	on a 2-stage mechanism. The first stage is an open loop orientator, 
	used to move the instrument line of sight from one star for which 
	the occultation is completed to the next star to be occulted. 
	The orientator is then blocked for the duration of the occultation. 
	The second phase is the tracking device, based on a closed control 
	loop using the star tracker data. It is operated during the 
	occultation phase, in a reduced window (7  in azimuth and 4 
	in elevation), and provides the fine centring of the star image
	within the spectrometers entrance slit. 

      <P>

	The thermally controlled optical bench and the telescope are mounted 
	on a fixed part on the instrument interface plate, used also to 
	support several electronic units for data handling, command and 
	control, and power distribution. An opto-mechanical cover is put 
	around both optical and steering front assemblies to provide the 
	adequate straylight and thermal baffling.

      <P>

	The scientific data are suitably filtered, digitised and multiplexed 
	into a single data stream of constant rate at the platform interface.
	The instrument operates largely autonomously and only requires once
	every 36 hours uploading of the instrument pointing and observation
	program.

      <P>

	The instrument measurement characteristics are listed in tables I.

	Finally, two features characterise the GOMOS instrument allowing to 
	reach its expected performance :

      <UL>
	<LI>The instrument is self-calibrating by measuring the star spectrum
	  outside and through the atmosphere.
	<LI>The stellar and background spectra are simultaneously recorded, 
	  allowing to correct for background or straylight as well as dark
	  current contributions.

      The GOMOS system simulator provides support for end-to-end performance
      evaluation of the GOMOS instrument and on-ground processing.
      It does so by :
      <OL>

	<LI>managing a set of targets ;

	<LI>simulating the star and background spectrum formation process, as
	  well as the scintillation and depointing of the star image, within
	  the instrument ;

	<LI>performing the ground segment software functions which contribute
	  to product generation.

      </OL>

      Performance evaluation is based on qualitative and quantitative
      evaluation of the difference between the original target parameters
      set, and the results of processing by instrument and ground segment
      sub-models, as shown in following figure.
      

      Figure Performance Evaluation levels

      The modular structure of the simulator allows to perform such
      comparisons at several different stages of the data processing. This
      is intended to help evaluate the contribution of each stage :
      satellite, instrument, on-ground processing, to the overall system
      performance.

      <P>

	Intermediate results, in particular internal parameters of the
	instrument sub-model, are available as intermediate results to help
	trouble-shooting.

      <P>

	The selected targets provide a wide choice of stars and atmosphere
	configuration which may be observed by GOMOS, which is meaningful 
      <UL>

	<LI>from the point of view of performance evaluation ;

	<LI>from the point of view of instrument calibration and testing on
	  ground and in flight.

      </UL>

      The complete imaging process is simulated and includes the apparent
      movement of the star, the limb conditions where the star is viewed,
      the pointing perturbations resulting from the GOMOS pointing
      sub-system interaction with the external world, the collection of
      light by the sensors and the electrical processing on board, and the
      digital data processing on board and on ground.

      <P>

	Several modes of simulation are provided in order to support :
      <OL>

	<LI>realistic simulation of the various GOMOS instrument operations :
	  occultation, calibration

	<LI>investigation of local as well as global effects

	<LI>investigation of mission strategies by allowing to build and test
	  observation scenarios

      </OL>

      The GOMOS System Simulator is a software application capable of
      running in stand-alone mode and to manage interfaces to the external
      world. It runs and manages its data on a single host computer. Its
      user interface allows to prepare, operate simulations of the GOMOS
      system in various configurations, and to process and analyse the
      simulation results. Its data management allows to exchange data and
      results with other components of the GOMOS system environment
      (e.g. ground processing).

      <P>

	The GOMOS simulator does not operate in real time. Instead, the
	continuous processes which it models are broken into discrete,
	elementary operations. The simulation time is modelled by a set of
	counters, each linked to a pre-set time scale : spacecraft orbital
	movement, star image formation, CCD sensor cycle, etc.

      <big>
	The main function of the simulator is to compute images, representing
	the Earth scene scanned by the remote sensing instrument, as well as
	the image acquired by the instrument.

      <P>

	The system simulated includes: the Earth target, the satellite motion,
	the instrument, and the on-ground data processing. This
	process figures a chain of signal processing, where each step
	corresponds to a type of image. In the simulator, there are in general
	two images of each type. One corresponds to the simulated "truth", one
	to the remotely sensed image.

      <P>

	The ocean colour remote sensing simulator will include all steps up to
	and including geometrical corrections. Level 2 processing is not
	included in the simulator, which nevertheless provides all facilities
	to run an atmosphere correction and geo-physical processing on its
	outputs.

      <P>

	A complete image simulation requires a large amount of processing
	resources. The simulator shall be organised so that a user can fully
	prepare a simulation execution by setting the simulation parameters,
	then run the simulation with very little interaction (including
	"batch" modes). At the end of the computations several images and data
	are available for analysis. So the input "truth" image can be compared
	to the output image of the same level.

      <P>

	By running several simulations with variations of a sub-set of input
	parameters, one can directly investigate the impact of a parameter on
	the global system performance.

      <P>

	Input parameters allow to control the behaviour of all the numerical
	models included in the simulator. Some parameters are organised in
	bi-dimensional images, fed at the input of the simulation process,
	such as for instance the water constituents concentrations
	(chlorophyll, yellow substance...).

      <P>

	Other parameters are scalar, vectors or matrices and represent a
	physical or logical value, constant for a given simulation. Every
	simulation will allow the modification of all input parameters.

<BIG>

SIMAC (which stands for SIMulateur d'Am&eacute;nagements C&ocirc;tiers) is a simulator for wave propagation from the open sea to the coastal structures (natural or artificial). It is based on the coupling of two algorithms that allow to take into account all the physical phenomena affecting the wave propagation in shallow water and near the coastal structures.<P>

First, the wave propagation from the open sea to the neighbouring of the area to study (typically an harbour and/or a beach)) is simulated. This first computation gives the characteristics of the incident wave at the entrance of the second simulated area. A fine calculation is then performed in this second domain which takes into account the partiel reflexion on physical boundaries, the diffraction and the refraction.<P>

The first algorithm may use the classical ray tracing computation (refraction only). If it is necessary to include diffraction in the simulation, the combined refraction-diffraction problem may be solved by two manners: <P>

The resolution of the parabolic form of the Berkhoff's equation by using a finite difference approach.<P>

The setting-up of finite element method and a splitting of the domain by submodels. This last method is more accurate especially for complicated bathymetry.<P>

In the port or near the shore, the Berkhoff's equation is also solved with finite elements. The final result is the wave field at any point at the domain.

	PORFLOW is a comprehensive computer program for simulation of transient or steady state flow, heat, salinity and mass transport in multi-phase, variably saturated, porous or fractured media with dynamic phase change.<P>

	The geometry may be 2D or 3D, Cartesian or cylindrical, the porous/fractured media may be anisotropic and heterogeneous, arbitrary sources of sinks (injection or pumping wells) may be present and, chemical reactions or radioactive decay may take place. It accommodates alternate fluid and media property relations and boundary conditions.<P>

	It is a highly modular program which has been applied to a wide range of practical problems in petrochemical, hydrological, geological, nuclear and chemical industry applications. Typical petrochemical industry application include ground water pollution and resource management, disposal and management of hazardous wastes, environmental impact of hot or cold pipes buried in geologic media, thawing/freezing of permafrost in terrestrial or marine environment, flow in porous beds, formation of geologic basins, and a range of reservoir engineering problems.<P>

	The user interface is through the conversational FREEFORM language which provides for simple English-like command syntax. The result can be graphically displayed by the acrPLOT, post-processor, which can generate charts for flow vectors, contours, grids, 3D surface plots and X-Y plots at any cross section.<P>

	heat transfer and chemical reactions. Flooding and draining may also
	be considered. The computation is made for stationnary or

	islands). Modelisation of inlets and/or outlets is performed when
	introducing one or several fluid and/or pollutant sources.<P>

	The output of the model are, for any points of the site, the intensity
	and direction of the current velocity, the concentration of one or
	several chemical species, the local water level and the
	temperature.<P>

	The basic equations discretisation is obtained by the use of a finite
	volume method and an ADI scheme. Depending on the study, it is
	possible to perform the resolution of the final matrical problem by
	different methods : Gauss, Cholesky, conjugated gradient, modified
	ADI.<P>

RADM is a Random-Walk model for simulation of dispersion processes in turbulent fluids. In particular it has been successfully used for air pollution studies.<P>

It employs a stochastic approach to solve the governing transport equations for motion of an inert or reactive species. It allows for arbitrary fluid and particle velocity to be surimposed on a random (or turbulent) motion of particles. The particles may undergo chemical reaction, radioactive decay, settling and drag. Arbitrary complex terrain, arbitrary wind fields and inversion conditions are accommodated. Single or multiple fixed, mobile or area sources may be present.<P>

Its primary applications are in the pollution air though any dispersion process may be simulated. Typical petrochemical applications include those of air pollution from refinery stacks and effluents discharges.<P>

The user interface is through the conversational FREEFORM language which provides for simple English-like command syntax. The result can be graphically displayed by the acrPLOT post-processor, which can generate charts for flow vectors, contours, isovalue rasters, grids, 3D surface plots and X-Y plots at any cross section.<P><P>

<B>ACRI</B> has developed several Earth Observation System
Simulators. These software are used during all phases of space and
ground segment design, implementation and exploitation for an Earth
observation mission. They allow characterisation and quantification of
the detailed specifications, and validation of the different modules
of the system.

<P>

The simulation software describes the different modules or components
of a space system from the signal emission to the ground receiving and
processing facility including the sensor and data acquisition on board
the space platforms.


<P>

The application is Earth Observation from space but also applicable to
airbone systems and ground based or underwater systems to monitor
environment.

<H2>Why a satellite data acquisition System ?</H2>

<BIG>

METEOSAT, NOAA, etc... are extremely satisfying satellites as far as following up the European and African continents and the ocans are concerned.
<P>


Knowing the weather and the climate (cloud movement, weather forecast, rain index, rising forecast, sea surface temperature, cloud analysis...), accessing good quality images, especially those from METEOSAT, represent a tremendous tool for a great number of laboratories and industries, as well as for agriculture. 

<P>

A large identified users community has expressed the need for information 
tools operating on environment. Applications are numerous, for example :

<UL>
<LI> Coastal protection
<LI> Climate and meteorology
<LI> Observation, security
<LI> Tourism and leisure
<LI> Fishing and aquaculture
<LI> Sea traffic
<LI> Agriculture and stock breeding
</UL>		

<P>

Earth observation datas are directly usable, in real time, by the <b>WEFAXSAT</b> system.	

<H2>FONCTIONNALITIES </H2>

All datas go through several stages so as to be usable. 

<b>WEFAXSAT</b> : the acquisition and processing system developed and commercialised by GM-IMAGES, changes a computer into a satellite reception station.
<P>


The system includes a 1 meter diameter dish, an analogic reception station a digitisation and image processing board and of course,  WEFAXSAT software.

<P>


This reception set allows the picking-up of WEFAX format METEOSAT, GOES, 
GMS type geostationary satellites as well as APT format for polar satellites 
like NOAA and METEOR. 


<H2> WEFAXSAT SOFTWARE PACKAGE </H2>


WEFAXSAT software package offers advanced WEFAX image processing 
functions together with a WEFAX reception station providing meteorological 
satellite digital images, which are received, stored, processed or even 
animated.
<p>
You can see below two METEOSAT animations.
<br> ( You need a mpeg viewer on your system to run animations )
<ul>
<li> <a href="/mpeg/meteo.mpg"> METEOSAT 1</a> (150K)
<li> <a href="/mpeg/meteo2.mpg"> METEOSAT 2</a> (70K)
</ul>

<p>
<b>WEFAWSAT system description </b>

<UL>

<LI> Pull down menu type user interface, entirely manageable with the mouse

<LI> Geographical zone and spectral band of acquisition controlled by the user. Self-automatic controlled entirely, with a possibility of manual control


<LI> Dissemination hours of METEOSAT  channels 1 and 2 recorded in a text file form (interactive updating)

<LI>  Last 75 images may be stored on the hard disk, that is to say 15 for each of the following zones : COX (CO2 et CO3), CXD (de C1D  C9D), DX (de D1  D9), TOTAL (CTOT, DTOT) and WEFAX

<LI> Management and maintenance of the recorded images and a possibility of compacting them through various methods

<LI> Possibility of acquiring without storing, and of displaying continuously the images

<LI> Interactive creation of color (or shads of grey) animation loops with image choice, speed variator.

<LI> 256 color display with graphic resolution choice (480x640, 600 x800 and 768x1024)

<LI> 3 levels of zoom directly accessible through mouse interaction 

<LI> Interactive contrast arrangement controlled by the user

<LI> Oscilloscope function allowing a detailed analysis of the signal on a recorded image

<LI> Color output on various types of printers

<LI> Possible interface  with other types of image formats such as TITUS, ARTIST, PCX, BMP.

</UL>


<H2>WEFAXSAT SYSTEM CONFIGURATION </H2>

In  order to use WEFAXSAT system you should have an IBM-PC compatible 
with 4 Mo mem. computer.
<P>

WEFAXSAT also accepts a Microsoft - or compatible - mouse. GM-IMAGES 
declines any responsability as to the use of non compatible hardware with 
WEFAXSAT software.

<P>


The various WEFAXSAT modules will operate more or less quickly 
depending on the processor and on the access specifications of the hard 
disk.

<B>EUROPEAN EARTH OBSERVATION SYSTEM</B>
<P>

<B>CENTRE FOR EARTH OBSERVATION</B>
<P>

<P>
<big>
Description of the CEO Concept<P>
<P>

Pathfinder Study on Coastal Zone
<P>
<HR>
<P>

The European Commission and the European Space Agency (ESA), together with
member states, have decided to unite their expertise in order to set up a
project for the observation of the Earth called EEOS (European Earth
Observation System). This project, started in November 1992, consists
essentially of :
<P>
<DL>
<DT><DD>  <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="/gifs/rec_rouge.gif"> The identification of the multiple sources of earth observation data in
Europe ;

<DT><DD>  <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="/gifs/rec_rouge.gif"> The assessment of the requirements of users of earth observation products and services ;

<DT><DD>  <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="/gifs/rec_rouge.gif"> The promotion of these sources of information and services ;

<DT><DD>  <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="/gifs/rec_rouge.gif"> The improvement of access and exchange.

</DL>
<P>

More precisely, the programme's missions are related to <B>earth observation
data, products and services</B> as follows :
<P>

To promote their knowledge and distribution from different origins (on-site
measurements, remote sensing, models, ...) ;
<P>

To facilitate their use and to ensure their accessibility and availability
;
<P>

To provide a European interface with other international systems of Earth
Observation such as the American system EOSDIS (Earth Observation System Data
and Information System) and the Japanese EOIS (Earth Observation Information
System).
<P>
<P>

The European Union's contribution to this project consists in the setting up of
a structure called CEO (Centre for Earth Observation) which will ensure an
interface between the users and the data, the subsequent products and
associated services.
<P>

<P>

<IMG ALIGN=TOP ALT=" " SRC="gifs/youdale1.gif">

<P>
<P>

The principal objective of the CEO is to provide services oriented towards (and
by) the user. This action should be in conjunction with the existing
infrastructures (such as networks) and existing initiatives (such as other
programmes) so as to promote the observation of the Earth in Europe.
<P>

The CEO's success will depend on the association of four key elements :
potential users, the provision of services, an electronic network and an
exchange service called EWSE (European Wide Service Exchange).
<P>
<P>

In order to obtain these objectives the CEO's principal actions will be :
<DL>
<DT><DD>  <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="/gifs/rec_rouge.gif">
To encourage a better communication between the users ;

<DT><DD>  <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="/gifs/rec_rouge.gif">
To stimulate the creation of high level products ;

<DT><DD>  <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="/gifs/rec_rouge.gif">
To contribute to a better standardisation of data and related products
so as to promote and ensure quality ;

<DT><DD>  <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="/gifs/rec_rouge.gif">
To promote the concept and utilisation of decentralised archives,
data banks and associated services for the observation of the earth
whatever their origins ;

<DT><DD>  <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="/gifs/rec_rouge.gif">
To improve the visibility of Earth observation services and expertise.

</DL><P>

The essential idea is that the CEO will in time be managed by people concerned
by Earth observation activities. The Commission will encourage the setting up
and the operation of the system (until the end of 1998).
<P>
<P>

At the moment the CEO is a concept and it is necessary that people concerned by
Earth observation make their wishes and suggestions known in order to define
and make optimal use of this system.
<P>
<P>

The project of the CEO consists of four phases. The first made possible the
actual concept of the CEO. We are, at the moment, in the second phase
(pathfinder study) whose principal objective is to identify what exists at
present for finding out the needs of the users. Its goal is to produce enough
information to enable the next phase to be undertaken, that is to say the
conception of the final system and its take-off (until 1998). The operational
phase will start in 1999 and will be run by the users of the system.
<P>
<P>

In order to limit the size of this work of identification, the Commission
thought it preferable to address user requirements in two ways :
<P>

<DL>
<DT> <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="/gifs/rec_rouge.gif">
to look at a sample of application areas in some detail (i.e. marine
altimetry, agriculture and forestry, global change, urban development and
lastly coastal zones)
<DD>

<DT> <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="/gifs/rec_rouge.gif">
to look at an overview of the requirements of Institutes in Europe. This was
divided into four geographical groups based on the status and scope of existing
industry and programmes as follows :
<DD>

<DL>
<DT> <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="/gifs/yellowball.gif">group 1 :

<DD> Germany, France, Italy
and United Kingdom ;
<DT> <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="/gifs/yellowball.gif">group 2 :
<DD> Belgium, Denmark, Luxembourg and The
Netherlands ;
<DT> <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="/gifs/yellowball.gif">group 3 :
<DD> Spain, Greece, Ireland and Portugal ;
<DT> <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="/gifs/yellowball.gif">group 4 :
<DD> Austria, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden.

</DL>
</DL>
<P>

The international network Eurocoast, the
<A HREF="contacts/MEDIAS.html">MEDIAS-FRANCE</A> corporation,
<A HREF="contacts/GKSS.html">GKSS</A> (Germany),
and <A HREF="contacts/MARNET.html">MARNET</A> (Greece)
represent the consortium led by
<A HREF="contacts/ACRI.html">ACRI</A> (France)
which has been selected by the European Commission for the part related to the
identification of users requirements in the coastal zone.
<P>
<P>

In order to do this we are, at the moment, having an information campaign and
conducting enquiries of users and suppliers. These enquiries are carried out by
direct discussions with those involved with coastal zones, and by the sending
out of a questionnaire to a representative sample of the community.
<P>
<P>

The choice of this representative sample is bound to be limited, and it is
possible that certain organisations who would like to have said something about
this subject have not been consulted. If you know anybody in this case or if
you need further information concerning the CEO : do not please hesitate to
contact us (you will find the list of person to contact at the beginning of the
questionnaire).
<P>
<P>

We hope that the attached questionnaire will give to numerous users the
opportunity to clearly expose their needs and wishes in order to contribute
directly with a maximum of efficiency to the planned coastal zone part of the
CEO and to make it as adapted to the requirements of the community as
possible.
<P>
<P>

We are aware that our community is often solicited by questionnaires and
enquiries, and we are most grateful for the reception you would be prepared to
give to this one.
<P>

<H1>Help Page</H1>

This page gives you the most important information of the way to
use the server. It comports mainly 3 parts:

<DL>
<DT> <DD> <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="/gifs/redball.gif">
an introduction to <A HREF="#INTROWEB">WWW concept</A> and definition.

some requests about all you want and dream about.

<DT> <DD> <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="/gifs/redball.gif">

<H2><A NAME="INTROWEB">Introduction to WWW</H2>

Introducing the WWW in few lines is too difficult. So, as in the rest of
the server, we will just make a brief description and then give links to
various documents and servers describing perfectly this notion.
<P>
The main characteristic is the possibility to inter-connect thousands of
servers with different protocols like <I>ftp</I>, <I>gopher</I> or
<I>wais</I>. The other
important characteristic is the hypertext notion. Every element of the
display could be a link to an other document elsewhere in the world.
<P>
This kind of architecture gives lot of flexibility and allows to obtain
information for lots of domains. Meanwhile, this same thing makes sometimes
the search difficult to find a particular information on the network and
on the multiplicity of servers available thru Internet.

<BIG>
The proposed scientific and technical network aims to integrate the scientific
activities of the different participating institutes in the field of remote 
sensing, oceanography and numerical modelling. The proposed activities 
are built upon the expertise and competence already available within the 
institutes and should contribute to the following generic aims :
<UL>
<LI>
develop ant to expend where possible, algorithms that relate variable 
available from remote sensing, ocean platforms and other observations 
to processes occurring in the water column as for example heat flux, primary 
productivity and trace gas fluxes.
<LI>
to generate, archive and analyse multiannual time series of remote sensing,
 in-situ and meteorological data for a basic evaluation of time scales, 
variability and trends. 
<LI>
to select and develop models of the upper layer of the ocean to assimilate 
remote sensing and other data for process studies and for future contributions
to global models.
</UL>
More specifically, the proposed scientific network has been created on the 
existing expertise and ongoing activities of the involved institutes.
This includes the following main topics :remote sensing,experimental studies,
modelling.

<b><u>Rationale of the meeting</u></b>
<br>
<br>
<u>This progress meeting was an initiative of the network coordinator.  It
aimed at:</u>
<br><br>
<ol>
<li>Introducing the new members of the network (PECO programme);
<br>	
<li>Gathering for the first time all post-doc involved in the network (some of
them joined the network only recntly);
<br>	
<li>Establishing concrete exchanges and delays.
</ol>
<br>
After an oral presentation given by each participants of their activity in the frame of the network, and of expectations from the network, detailed discussions were conducted on the way to partition intra-network contributions. It led to fruitful discussions and concrete agreements.  To set clearly the output of these discussions, each participant wrote a short text describing:
<br>
<ol>
<li>The main activity they will conduct within the network;
<br>	
<li>The contribution they expect from other partners;
<br>	
<li>The contribution they can provide to other network projects.
</ol>

</ol><br><br>

<b><i>Dr. Angelo Rubino</i></b>
<br><br>

<b>Main activity:</b>
<br><br>
In the frame of the northeastern Atlantic upwelling system, an often observed phenomenon (CTD measurement) provides the bases for the contribution in the project.  In semi-enclosed coastal areas, anomalous T-S characteristics were observed: from the surface to the bottom both salinity and temperature show in fact a considerable increase.  The explanation for such a behaviour is that abrupt, very intense evaporation events homogenize the water column at the coast, leading to the formation of a bottom to surface layer, which is subject to geostrophic adjustment.  It evolves in a bottom arrested current which mixes with the ambient water and tranfers to the bottom the acquired properties.
<br><br>
In order to simulate such a phenomenon, a two layer, nonlinear, hydrostatic shallow water numerical model was developed, which can describe the evolution of localized layers and the outcropping of a deep layer.  To achieve this, a set of movable boundary conditions has been applied, so that the bottom arrested current can find its way on the ocean floor.  The layers allow for material mixing by means of an entrainment parametrization.  The first results show the capability of the model to reproduce geostrophical ajustment
processes.
<br><br>

<b>Possible contributions from the other participants:</b>
<br><br>
The proof of the existence of the quoted phenomenon lies in the measurements conducted by Institut f&uuml;r Ostseeforschung.  In this context, the availability of the <i>in situ</i> data set is a fundamental requisite.  It will provide at first a model verification and validation, and moreover these data could be used by the National Institute of Meteorology and Hydrology (Romania) to detect significant statistical time and space variability.  On the other hand, it is probable that such surface to bottom density anomalies have been detected by remote sensing means, both in SAR and in surface temperature, and in color imagery (in fact, for the last point, the presence of a bottom arrested current should lead to a decrease in the phytoplankton content in the water column).  ACRI and Bulgarian Space Research Institute could carry a inspection of the available remote sensing imageries to detect the phenomenon. A quantification of the forcing playing a role in the phenomenon (wind and heat fluxes) could represent another aspect of the collaboration with the partners which are more involved in data acquisition and analysis.

<br><br>
<b>Contribution to other network projects:</b>
<br><br>
We can provide to the other partners the quoted numerical model.
<br><br>

<b><i>Dr. Roxana BOJARIU</i></b>
<br>
<ol>
<li>The original contribution of our team to the network is the study of the short term climate variability over Atlantic-European region, due to the air-sea interactions.  The predictive potential of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) will be assessed by means of Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) and Principal Oscillation Pattern (POP) applied to sea surface temperature, surface winds and outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) data.  The effect of air-sea interaction on European temperature and precipitation
anomalies will be also analyzed.
<br>	
<li>From the other members of the network, I need some remote sensing data for the SST and OLR.  From the team of Shirshov Institute of Oceanology, we hope to get the response of their ocean model to the surface wind anomalies characteristics for the NAO models.  The composites of the sea wind characteristic for the NAO phases will be provided by us.
<br>	
<li>For the project proposed by ACRI, we could use the statistical methods for the validation tasks an for estimating statistically some parameters of the model.  For projects proposed by Clima Maritimo and University of Hamburg, we could make statistical analyses of the <i>in situ</i> and remote sensing observations in order to reveal characteristic patterns of the phenomena described by their models.  We could also statistically analyze the ouput of their models.
</ol>
<br>

<b><i>Dr. Gennady A. KIVMAN</i></b>
<br><br>
<b>Work planned to be done:</b>
<br>
<ol>
<li>Reproducing climatic circulation in the North Atlantic ans seasonal evolution of the upper mixed layer (UML) by means of a quasi-geostrophic circulation model with interactive upper mixed layer.
<br>	
<li>Development of a robust 4-component (phytoplankton-zooplankton-detritus-nitrogen) ecosystem model and coupling it with the circulation model.
<br>	
<li>Developing a data assimilation technique directed to fit the ecosystem model to satellite chlorophyll <i>a</i> concentration data.
</ol>
<br>
<b>What we will be able to distribute:</b>
<br>
<ol>
<li>Depths of the UML for the North Atlantic as a function of time for different geographical regions.  It may be used as an input for other ecosystem models (for example, that presented by ACRI).
<br>	
<li>Volume transport to be used in fine-resolution models for a concrete region (for example, that studied by Clima Maritimo).
<br>	
<li>The data assimilation technique to be developed for utilization in other ecosystem models.
</ol><br>

<b>What we would like to get from other partners of the network:</b>
<br>
<ol>
<li>Satellite data on chlorophyll <i>a</i> concentration.
<br>	
<li>Temporal data on solar radiation measured at some stations (it would be fine
if they are accompanied by temperature and salinity data).
<br>	
<li>Data on surface temperature, cloudiness, wind velocity as well as fields of temperature, salinity and nutrients in the seasonal and main thermoclines to be utilized in our circulation model.
</ol>
<br>
<b><i>Dr. Marcel BABIN</i></b>
<br><br>
<b>Activity conducted in the frame of the network subject to collaborations:</b>
<br><br>
One of the most important component in models describing the flux of carbon from atmosphere to ocean sediments is phytoplankton primary production, i.e. the rate of net  carbon fixation.   Primary production represents the input way of inorganic carbon into the ocean organic carbon pool.  During the last 7 years, efforts have been deployed by oceanographers, in the frame of the Joint Ocean Global Flux Study (JGOFS), to develop primary production models applicable at global  scale using remotely sensed variables, namely sea suface chlorophyll <i>a</i> concentration.  Such a model has been developed by Morel (1991), and validated and applied at global  scale (e.g. Berthon and Morel 1992, Antoine and Morel <i>in press</i>).  Although this model proved to perform well (measured and prediction values agree within a factor of  3 while primary production varies over 4 orders of magnitude), improvements are still needed.
<br><br>
The examination of the different ways allowing significant improvements of this model led us  to identify the depth of the upper mixed layer (Zml) as the most important source of original information to be added to the model.  Combined with the depth of the euphotic zone  (depth at  which irradiance is 1% that  at surface; Ze), it should provide a better parameterization of depth variations in chlorophyll <i>a</i> concentration.  Morevover, predictions of photosynthetic parameters may be for the first time possible.
<br><br>
To be used in the primary production model of Morel (1991), Zml  must be available at a spatial and temporal resolution similar to that of ocean color data.  A technique based on remotely sensed sea surface temperature and wind speed allowing estimation of Zml has recently been proposed by Yan et al. (1991).  Alternatively, Zml could be provided by a large-scale circulation model.
<br>
<br>
<b>Possible contribution from the other partners:</b>
<br>
<ol>
<li>In providing SST and wind speed images (Bulgarian Space Research Institute).
<br>	
<li>In providing a comparison between Zml predictions from Yan's and Shirshov Institute large-scale circulation models.
</ol>
<br>
<b>Contribution to other projects:</b>
<br>
<ol>
<li>In providing ocean color images (CZCS) for the Northeast Atlantic ocean.
<br>	
<li>In providing in situ data for validation of small- and large-scale circulation models.
</ol>
<br>
<b><u>Actions</u></b>
<br>
<br>

<b>Next progress meeting:</b>
<br>
It was agreed to hold the next HCM/PECO progress meeting at Clima Maritimo (Madrid) begining of June.  To facilitate programming of flight schedules, the meeting must be held close a weekend.  Invitations must be quickly sent by Clima Maritimo to PECO partners for visa formalities.  Finally, it was proposed to hold a 2-day meeting.
<br>
<br>

<b>Progress in collaborations:</b>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Concerning PECO partners, the delay before the next meeting should allow them to study more deeply the different projects conducted by the network.  Thereby, they should be in a better position to propose more concrete contributions during the next progress meeting.  This meeting will also allow to gather all network members and, therfore, to organize visits in the different laboratories to facilitate completion of specific tasks (e.g. a possible long stay of Vera DJEPA-PETROVA at JRC to process remote sensing data should be discussed).
<br>	
<li>In order to obtain useful remote sensing and in situ data from the other partners, Dr. Angelo RUBINO will provide to the other partners the exact location and time period over which data should be provided.
<br>	
<li>An inventory of CZCS scenes covering the Northeast Atlantic, already obtainable by ACRI, will be provided by Dr. Marcel BABIN.
</ul>
<br>

<b>Administration of funds:</b>
<br><br>
Thorough discussions took place on how to manage in the most efficient way PECO funds.  From these discussions, it appeared to be a delicate task and that it would be the best to manage funds through ACRI.  To succeed in this way, official documents should be provided by institutions participating in the PECO programme.  These documents should indicate clearly that they allow ACRI to manage these funds.  Also,  the institutions will have to provide every year a status of expences covered by PECO and laid out by ACRI, in local currency.

<H1>RESULTS OVERVIEW</H1>

<img src="/gifs/bar_marbre_noir2.gif"><br><br>
<P> <H1>Introduction</H1>
<big>

The overall objectives stated in the initial proposal are: <P>

<UL>

<LI>to generate, archive and analyse multiannual time series of remote
sensing, in situ and meteorological data for a basic evaluation of
time scales, variability and trends;

<LI>to develop algorithms that relate variables available from remote
sensing, ocean platforms and other observations to processes occurring
in the water column as for example heat flux, primary productivity and
trace gaz fluxes;

<LI>to select and develop models of the upper layer of the ocean to
assimilate remote sensing and other data for process studies and for
future contributions to global models.

</UL>

<P>

The following is a short description of the progress of the work to
date within each of these objectives, where the network activity is
emphasised.

<P>

<H1>1- Archives and time series analyses</H1>

In order to provide a general access to a common database, ACRI-Sophia
Antipolis proposed a technical solution based on the World-Wide Web
(WWW) concept. A major advantage with the WWW is that it allows to
share data distributed in different computers (at different
locations).  The user can access the different data without knowledge
about location of softwares used to manage the data base.  In the
frame of the current project, three WWW servers were installed; at
ARMINES - Sophia Antipolis, ACRI and Intitut f&uuml;r Meereskunde (IM)
- Hamburg .  These servers are connected to already existing servers
at JRC - Ispra and Clima Maritimo (CM) - Madrid.  To facilitate
exchanges between the different servers, the ACRI server has the
specific role of co-ordination to provide information of general
interest.  <P>

This experimental system can be connected via WWW client at
<A HREF="http://www.acri.fr/">http://www.acri.fr/</A>.

<P> To allow the set up of data archives, the first task undertaken
during 1994 concerned the determination of a common frame for data
file storage, which accounts for the various temporal and spatial
scales typical of the data sources involved in this project,
i. e. various satellite sensors, in situ techniques and computational
products.  This task was essentially undertaken by ARMINES who
proposed a common bathymetry digital map including shorelines.  They
also installed a data server with softwares for satellite data
processing and a GIS package (Geographical Information System),
accessible to other members of the network by electronic links.  The
<A HREF="select_ref.html">bathymetry digital map was created
for the area under study in this network, i.e. between 18 and 26&iexcl;N,
and 8 and 20&iexcl;W</A>.

<P>

Up to now this data frame has been fed (1) by CM who provided the
bathymetry and coastline information, (2) by Institut f&uuml;r
Ostseeforschung (IO) -Warnem&uuml;nde who provided in situ
oceanographic data and (3) by JRC who provided <A
HREF="select_avhrr.html">remotely sensed temperature data</A>
(AVHRR).  Finally, the WWW server operated at CM makes fully available
long term series obtained from wave buoys and tidal gauges deployed in
the vicinity of Canary Islands.

<P>

Consistently with the initial proposal, in 1994, two oceanographic
cruises (R. V. Hudson and Humbolt) were conducted by IO off
Mauritania, during which a large amount of physical, chemical and
biological data were obtained.  These are available for the network.

<P> <H1>2- Algorithm development</H1>

During 1994, algorithm development within the network has followed
essentially two lines.  Firstly, JRC processed
<A HREF="select_czcs.html">satellite data for estimation of
phytoplankton biomass</A>, in order to assess the impact of primary
production on <A HREF="dms.html">DMS</A> production and generation of clouds in the Northwest
African upwelling.  This study was also based on meteorological and in
situ data, as well as on multi-annual time series of satellite
observations to investigate long-term regional and temporal variations
of selected surface parameters.  The resulting DMS model can be used
directly on JRC WWW server.  ARMINES, which is involved in long-term
projects on the detection of clouds in satellite imagery and retrieval
of their characteristics, obtained more accurate and efficient
processing of the Meteosat satellite data using the data provided by
IO (in situ) and JRC (AVHRR).  Maps of shortwave radiation have been
produced and made available to the network in October 1994.  Maps of
longwave radiation are being produced.  They will also be available to
the network.  A study is planned in which a comparison between results
obtained by JRC and ARMINES will be performed.

<P> Secondly, the first results from the "two layer, nonlinear,
hydrostatic shallow water equation model" have been obtained at IM for
an idealistic scenario: on flat bottom and smooth slopes.  The model
seems to reproduce in a quite satisfactory way the geostrophic
adjustment processes.  These results will be validated over the shelf
area of the Northwest African coasts from
<A HREF="select_bathy.html">remote sensing measurements
(JRC) and in situ observations (IO), and using the bathymetry fields
provided by ARMINES</A>.

	
<H1>3- Global models development</H1>

<P>

The third objective of current project concerns the development of
global models.  Its achievement represents the main goal for 1995.

<H2>Main activity:</H2>

<P> In the frame of the north-eastern Atlantic upwelling system, an
often observed phenomenon (CTD measurement) provides the bases for the
contribution in the project.  In semi-enclosed coastal areas,
anomalous T-S characteristics were observed: from the surface to the
bottom both salinity and temperature show in fact a considerable
increase.  The explanation for such a behaviour is that abrupt, very
intense evaporation events homogenise the water column at the coast,
leading to the formation of a bottom to surface layer, which is
subject to geostrophic adjustment.  It evolves in a bottom arrested
current which mixes with the ambient water and transfers to the bottom
the acquired properties.

<P>

In order to simulate such a phenomenon, a two layer, nonlinear,
hydrostatic shallow water numerical model was developed, which can
describe the evolution of localised layers and the outcropping of a
deep layer.  To achieve this, a set of movable boundary conditions has
been applied, so that the bottom arrested current can find its way on
the ocean floor.  The layers allow for material mixing by means of an
driving parametrization.  The first results show the capability of the
model to reproduce geostrophical ajustment processes.

<P>

<H2>Possible contributions from the other participants:</H2>


The proof of the existence of the quoted phenomenon lies in the
measurements conducted by Institut fuer Ostseeforschung.  In this
context, the availability of the in situ data set is a fundamental
requisite.  It will provide at first a model verification and
validation, and moreover these data could be used by the National
Institute of Meteorology and Hydrology (Romania) to detect significant
statistical time and space variability.  On the other hand, it is
probable that such surface to bottom density anomalies have been
detected by remote sensing means, both in SAR and in surface
temperature, and in colour imagery (in fact, for the last point, the
presence of a bottom arrested current should lead to a decrease in the
phytoplankton content in the water column).  ACRI and Bulgarian Space
Research Institute could carry a inspection of the available remote
sensing imageries to detect the phenomenon.  A quantification of the
forcing playing a role in the phenomenon (wind and heat fluxes) could
represent another aspect of the collaboration with the partners which
are more involved in data acquisition and analysis.

<OL> <LI>The original contribution of our team to the network is the
study of the short term climate variability over Atlantic-European
region, due to the air-sea interactions.  The predictive potential of
the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) will be assessed by means of
Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) and Principal Oscillation Pattern
(POP) applied to sea surface temperature, surface winds and outgoing
longwave radiation (OLR) data.  The effect of air-sea interaction on
European temperature and precipitation anomalies will be also
analysed.

<LI>From the other members of the network, I need some remote sensing
data for the SST and OLR.  From the team of Shirshov Institute of

composites of the sea wind characteristic for the NAO phases will be
provided by us.

<LI>For the project proposed by ACRI, we could use the statistical
methods for the validation tasks an for estimating statistically some
parameters of the model.  For projects proposed by Clima Maritimo and

patterns of the phenomena described by their models.  We could also
statistically analyse the output of their models.

<H2>Activity conducted in the frame of the network subject to
collaborations:</H2>

One of the most important component in models describing the flux of
carbon from atmosphere to ocean sediments is phytoplankton primary
production, i.e. the rate of net carbon fixation. Primary production
represents the input way of inorganic carbon into the ocean organic
carbon pool.  During the last 7 years, efforts have been deployed by
oceanographers, in the frame of the Joint Ocean Global Flux Study
(JGOFS), to develop primary production models applicable at global
scale using remotely sensed variables, namely sea surface chlorophyll
a concentration.  <P> Such a model has been developed by Morel (1991),
and validated and applied at global scale (e.g. Berthon and Morel
1992, Antoine and Morel in press).  Although this model proved to
perform well (measured and prediction values agree within a factor of
3 while primary production varies over 4 orders of magnitude),
improvements are still needed.

<P>

The examination of the different ways allowing significant
improvements of this model led us to identify the depth of the upper
mixed layer (Z<SUB>ml</SUB>) as the most important source of original
information to be added to the model.  Combined with the depth of the
euphotic zone (depth at which irradiance is 1% that at surface;
Z<SUB>e</SUB>), it should provide a better parameterization of depth
variations in chlorophyll a concentration.  Moreover, predictions of
photosynthetic parameters may be for the first time possible.  This
hypothesis can be better <A HREF="select_insitu.html">illustrated
by looking at in situ data recently obtained within the region being
under study by this network</A>.  To test this hypothesis, a huge in
situ data set is being constructed.  It gathers data currently
available within the frame of the Joint Ocean Global Flux Study
(JGOFS).  Up to no, data were gathered from the following JGOFS
programme:



<UL> <LI> ATALANTIS II (US)

<LI>ANTARES (FRANCE)

<LI>BOFS (UK)

<LI>EUMELI (FRANCE)

<LI>OLIPAC/FLUPAC (FRANCE)

<LI>ALMOFRONT (FRANCE)

<LI>DYFAMED (FRANCE)

</UL>


Some of the sites documented by this data set are shown on a
<A HREF="select_map.html">global
map</A>.

<P> To be used in the primary production model of Morel (1991),
Z<SUB>ml</SUB> must be available at a spatial and temporal resolution
similar to that of ocean colour data.  A technique based on remotely
sensed sea surface temperature and wind speed allowing estimation of
Z<SUB>ml</SUB> has recently been proposed by Yan et al. (1991).
Alternatively, Z<SUB>ml</SUB> could be provided by a large-scale
circulation model.  In situ data collected in the area under study
here were also used to feed a model that predicts the

<font size=+1><strong>1. Problem to be resolved,</font></strong>
<p>
<ul><ul>
To alleviate the increasing atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide, the principle greenhouse gas contributing to possible global warming, Marchetti  (Climate Change 1, 59-68, 1977) proposed that carbon dioxide might be separated from flue gases of coal fired power stations, which presently account for some 30% of global anthropogenic emissions, and injected into the oceans.</p>
<p>
The work of Marchetti and subsequent studies suggested the need to inject the gas at great depths or in sinking currents to avoid rapid outgassing to the atmosphere. More recent investigations by Haugen and Drange (Nature, Vol 357, 318-320, 1992) have indicated that even shallow injection could be envisaged by relying on the increase in water density that would result from carbon dioxide dissolution in seawater to transport the dissolved gas to greater depths. These authors propose that if carbon dioxide is injected near the shore (at depths in the range of 200-400m), gravity currents will carry the dense carbon dioxide waters along the bottom slope towards deep water.</p>
<p>
Both the disposal scenarios proposed depend on the injection of carbon dioxide at the required depth, either directly into the sea as a liquid-gas mixture,  or by pumping artificially enriched seawater containing the carbon dioxide at elevated pressures. The use of such techniques would clearly depend on the development of a highly efficient means of separating the gas on the industrial scale and demonstrating the economics of such a disposal method. Haugen and Drange argue that shallow injection in coastal regions will be less expensive in terms of energy and capital costs than deep-ocean disposal.</p>
<p>
The choice of the marine environment as a disposal medium is based on the observation that the ocean waters and sediments play an important role in the global carbon cycle and are known to be  major sink and source of natural carbon. The role of sedimentation ensures that  the marine environment is an overall sink through carbonate sequestration. However, although seawater itself contains large quantities of carbon dioxide as carbonate and bicarbonate ions and as dissolved carbon dioxide gas, the system is in dynamic exchange with  atmospheric carbon dioxide and depending on temperature and salinity can act as a sink or a source for this gas. 
<p>
It is exactly this point that makes the disposal of carbon dioxide by dissolution in either shallow or deep waters uncertain from a technical point of view, irrespective of any question of potential biological impacts, economics or social acceptability of such a disposal method. Although the capacity of  ocean waters is very large to dilute and dissolve carbon dioxide and natural processes (biological and chemical) will tend to sequester  it as sedimentary material over long time (geological) scales, short term physical and biological oceanographic processes (decades to hundreds of years) such as changes in deep water formation or primary production  may be capable of returning it to the atmosphere very rapidly. 
<p>
</ul></ul><strong><font size=+1>2. Prior solutions</font></center></strong><ul><ul>
<p>
A number of chemical scrubbing processes are used to remove major contaminants produced from coal combustion such as fly ash solids, sulphur compounds and other materials, which are then either treated or dumped at waste disposal sites on land. At present atmospheric dilution is the only method used for the waste gaseous carbon dioxide. International research, under the aegis of the <a href="http://www.ieagreen.org.uk/">IEA Greenhouse Gas Programme</a>, is being directed to assess the environmental feasibility of using the oceans (as well as a certain number of terrestrial options) as a disposal medium directly, as described above.
<p>
</ul></ul><strong><font size=+1>3. Solution proposed</font></center></strong><ul><ul>
<p>
Solid carbon dioxide free fall penetrator. In order to get round  waste disposal based, as at present, on atmospheric dilution  or  the uncertainty related to ocean dispersion by dilution as discussed above, the use of a solid carbon dioxide free fall penetrator is proposed to permanently dispose of separated anthropogenic carbon dioxide.
<p>
A solution for permanently sequestering carbon dioxide may be proposed on the basis of the observation of the occurrence of carbonate and silicate rich sediments which are ubiquitous in the sedimentary formations of the  ocean, and which form a natural stable sink of carbon once they have been laid down. Deep ocean areas such as trenches (depths > 6-8km) and abyssal plains (depths > 3-4km) are among the most inaccessible areas on Earth and unlikely to be disrupted even by rapid climatic changes.
<p>
The technique makes use of the fact that carbon dioxide can be obtained as a solid at atmospheric pressure by cooling to  -78.5 degrees centigrade. The overall specific gravity is approximately one and a half times (1.56) that of seawater and would thus fall through the water column if produced as a solid (Nakashiki et al. CRIEPI report EU91003, pp 19, 1991). Such pieces would not enter into any underlying sediments and would slowly dissolve on the sea floor with the risk of the waters eventually returning to the surface. However, if the solid was shaped as a torpedo and then left to fall through the water column it would penetrate  soft sediments. In selected deep ocean carbonate rich sediments (at depths ranging from 1-4 km) pore water movement can be shown to be negligible thus effectively permanently isolating the carbon dioxide from the overlying ocean waters. At the in-situ pressures and temperatures (approx. 100-400 atmospheres, 2C) the carbon dioxide would eventually form a stable clathrate type compound with the pore water of clay or carbonate sediments and be permanently sequestered by the surrounding geological media.
<p>
A number of detailed studies have been undertaken investigating penetrometer design (Freeman et al, Nature, Vol 310, 130-133, 1984, Murray and Visintini, IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering, Vol OE-10, 38-49, 1985). The reference cited above shows the large range of parameters that need to be considered. A prototype submarine vehicle intended to measure data at the deep ocean sea- bottom was constructed by Murray and Jamet using a slow penetrator technique. A European patent was granted on the 24.4.1990 (Definitive Number 0362991) and has further demonstrated the extent of possible applications of this technology.
<p>
It needs to be clearly stated that under present International leglislation (United Nations Convention on the Law of The Sea[UNCLOS], London Dumping Convention) such a disposal option would not be permited. Furthur, any proposed use of deep sub-seabed geological formations is one that would need a global social consensus which would be unlikely without unequivical demonstration as to its long term safety. Whether in view of the volumes of waste material potentially involved such a solution would be economically viable is clearly at present difficult to assess. It will depend on political and industrial conditions that might occur if global climatic change were to be demonstrated in an clear and unequivocal manner and serious attempts to decrease carbon dioxide emissions were considered necessary.
<p>
</ul></ul><font size=+1><strong>4. What are the advantages of these solutions?</font></strong><ul><ul>
<p>
From a purely technical point of view the proposed solution should, if proven feasible and safe, effectively isolate the carbon dioxide from the overlying ocean waters using the natural barrier properties of the surrounding stable soft clay or carbonate rich sediments. Thus the risk of the eventual return of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere through upwelling of ocean waters can be effectively excluded. Disposal would thus be permanent. A further advantage could be the creation of a waste disposal industry using this type of technology and financed on the polluter-payer principle. The technology appears to be easily within present day engineering capabilities.

<strong><font size=+1>ABSTRACT</strong></font> <p>
<ul><ul>
To circumvent  the uncertainty related to presently studied ocean disposal options based on  pumping of liquid carbon dioxide or hydrate slurry injection at depth, with the associated risk of short  term physical and biological oceanographic processes returning an important fraction of it to the atmosphere, a disposal technique using the natural geochemical storage properties of deep marine (carbonate or alumino-silicate rich) sedimentary formations is suggested.
<p>
The technique proposed would depend on the fact that carbon dioxide can be obtained as a solid by cooling to  -78.50 C . The overall density is approximately one and a half times ~ 1.56 kg.dm-3 that of seawater. If the solid was shaped as a torpedo and then left to fall through the water column it would penetrate quite deeply into soft underlying sediments. This conclusion is based on  in-situ investigations using penetrators that were studied as a disposal option for other solid wastes.
<p>
This concept should, therefore, provide permanent storage as the emplaced carbon dioxide will be chemically sequestered by the sediments (via the formation of an intermediate clathrate).  Other than secure segregation of the emplaced CO<font size=-2>2</font>, the penetrator option has a further major advantage in that there should be no long-term effects to biological systems: penetrator disposal is deep within sedimentary formations which have zero or very low biological activity.
<p>
</ul></ul><font size=+1><strong>1. INTRODUCTION</strong></font><ul><ul>
<p>
The use of the deep oceans had been proposed as early as 1977 <a href="#ref1">[1]</a>, as a possible disposal medium for carbon dioxide.  Subsequent investigations [2-3] underlined the need to dispose of the gas at great depths and to use sinking currents to avoid rapid outgassing to the atmosphere. More recent studies <a href="#ref4">[4]</a> have indicated that even shallow injection could be envisaged, by relying on the increase in water density that would result from carbon dioxide dissolution in seawater, to transport the dissolved gas to greater depths. However, although seawater itself contains large quantities of carbon dioxide as carbonate and bicarbonate ions and as dissolved carbon dioxide gas, the system is in dynamic exchange with  atmospheric carbon dioxide and depending on temperature and salinity can act as a sink or a source for this gas. Thus ocean techniques proposed so far will only tend to displace the problem into the relatively near future <a href="#ref5">[5]</a> without ensuring  permanent disposal.
<p>
A solution for permanently sequestering anthropogenic carbon dioxide may, however, be proposed on the basis of the observation of the occurrence of carbonate rich sediments which are ubiquitous in sedimentary formations of the  ocean at depths above the carbonate compensation depth  at around 4 km. They form a natural stable repository and are a result of environmental processes which have affected oceanic and thus atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations over geological time. Alternatively use could be made of the soft alumino-silicate clay type sediments at the same or greater depths which would also act as an effective barrier to carbon release. 
<p>
The technique proposed would depend on the fact that carbon dioxide can be obtained as a solid by cooling to  -78.50 C. The overall specific gravity is approximately one and a half times ~ 1.56 that of seawater. Tests have shown <a href="#ref6">[6]</a> that if produced as a solid,  carbon dioxide blocks would  fall through the water column, although, such pieces would not enter into the underlying sediments and would slowly dissolve on the sea floor. However, if the solid was shaped as a torpedo and then left to fall through the water column it would penetrate  soft sediments. This conclusion is based on studies using penetrator technology that were investigated as a disposal option <a href="#ref7">[7]</a>. A conceptual engineering design for an industrial disposal system has been described for this option  <a href="#ref8">[8]</a>.
<p>
</ul></ul><font size=+1><strong>2. DESIGN CHARACTERISTICS OF PENETRATORS</strong></font><ul><ul>

<p>
Preliminary design characteristics of  penetrators, free-fall velocity, embedment depth, and hole closure, have been described in some detail [9-10]. The results will be only briefly summarised here and the reader is referred to the above sources for fuller information. The attainable free-fall velocity or  terminal velocity of a penetrator is determined by equilibrium of buoyant and hydrodynamic drag. A large range of parameters  including overall weight, density, engineering form, sediment shear strength etc. need to be considered <a href="#ref11">[11]</a>. <a href=diox1-figure01.html> Figure 1 </a> shows predicted free-fall velocities attainable by a series of penetrators having a length to diameter ratio of 10:1 and weights from 5-1000 tons, and for a range of  densities for solid carbon dioxide when produced industrially, 1.1 - 1.5 kg.dm-3 <a href="#ref9">[9]</a>. Clearly tests would be necessary to determine the optimum quantities. However, experiments have been undertaken in the abyssal Atlantic Ocean using similarly designed streamlined projectiles <a href="#ref12">[12]</a> and have shown firstly, that sediment penetration depths greater than 30m can be obtained for torpedoes made out of steel, weighing as little as 2000 kg, and secondly that the in-situ results validated the simple hydrodynamic model used.

<img src="space80.gif">
[ <a href=diox1-figure02.html> FIGURE 2 </a> ]
</center>
<p>
A number of investigations have also been carried out to estimate the behaviour and attainable embedment depth of penetrators [13-15], as well the question of subsequent hole closure. <a href=diox1-figure02.html> Figure 2 </a>  shows the effects of penetrator weight and density on emplacement depth. It is clear from these results that an increase in density is a more efficient way to increase penetration than by augmenting overall weight. It also appears that there is a lower limiting weight to this penetrator technique to ensure complete tail embedment. It can be seen that pure CO<font size=-2>2</font> penetrators (having a specific gravity of 1.56 km.dm-3) of around 100 tons can (tail) embed themselves to significant depths  (~ 10m) in soft deep ocean sediment formations. Clearly the parameters "penetrator density and sediment shear strength" are critical factors for the final emplacement depth attained.
<p>
Theoretical investigations on hole closure <a href="#ref16">[16]</a> suggest that an open pathway to the sediment surface is unlikely, and  that during the embedment process the penetrator creates large sediment deformations in its passage leading to an inflow of surface sediments due to the suction forces generated by the water that is drawn into the entry path. This causes the sediments to close behind the penetrator. No cavitation can occur due to the high ambient pressures at the depths being considered. 
<p>
These studies are supported by the results of in-situ experiments which have been  carried out in the Mediterranean Sea using small steel penetrators weighing between 2-3 tons. The data obtained from geotechnical testing and overcoring of a number of penetrator impact points provided  evidence that the entry paths created by penetrators were indeed closed and filled with remoulded sediments with about the same density as the surrounding undisturbed sediments <a href="#ref17">[17]</a>.
<p>
</ul></ul><font size=+1><strong>3. PHYSICO-CHEMICAL BEHAVIOUR OF SOLID CARBON DIOXIDE</strong></font><ul><ul>
<p>
If one considers the phase diagram of carbon dioxide and water system (<a href=diox1-figure03.html> Fig 3 </a>), the physico-chemical behaviour of the solid carbon dioxide during its rapid descent through the water column and subsequent deep emplacement and sequestration in the underlying sedimentary formation can be assessed. 
<p>
<center>
<a href="diox1-figure03.html"><img src="figure03.gif.tn" ALT="Fig3"></a><br>
[ <a href=diox1-figure03.html> FIGURE 3 </a> ]
</center>
<p>
Assuming that reaction times are fast, it can be postulated that equilibrium states are more or less reached instantaneously for the water column, but will depend on kinetic and thermodynamic properties in the sediments where chemical interactions with the surrounding environment will be the critical parameter in determining its fate. Two major processes can be identified that will depend upon the physico-chemical properties of carbon dioxide, these are thermal dissolution during penetrator free-fall through the water column, and subsequent clathrate formation after burial in the underlying  geological formation.
<p>
<u>Thermal dissolution in the water column.</u> The penetrator is assumed to be industrially produced at a temperature between -800C to -100C and is travelling in  relatively warmer water (~ 50C), the temperature difference will produce a heat flux from the water to the penetrator inducing a possible loss of penetrator mass <a href="#ref18">[18]</a>. The mechanism involved is forced convection across a turbulent boundary layer and conventional procedures can be used for an approximate prediction. From the diagram it can be seen that the behaviour of the solid carbon dioxide, after launch, will be as follows:
<br>
	a)<i> Sublimation regime</i>:from the sea surface to a pressure of 5.2 bars (triple point) corresponding to a depth of 52m, the CO<font size=-2>2</font> will sublimate and the boundary layer on the penetrator surface will be a two-phase flow (gas, liquid). Such conditions will only occur for a few seconds after penetrator launch.
<br>	
	b)<i> Liquefaction-evaporation (mixed) regime</i>: from 5.2 to approximately 40 bars (critical point), corresponding to depths ranging from 52-400m, CO<font size=-2>2</font> at the surface of the penetrator will initially melt at a rate depending on the actual ocean temperature profile. The liquid carbon dioxide will then evaporate (if the local temperature near the penetrator surface is high enough), or later on while being mixed with seawater and progressively warmed up. Evaporation may occur during flow along the penetrator length or later in its wake; the boundary layer on the surface of the penetrator will progressively change from a two-phase flow to a single phase, two-species flow (liquid CO<font size=-2>2</font> and dissolved aqueous CO<font size=-2>2</font>). At present any subsequent ion species formation within the water column have not been taken into account.
<br>
            c)<i> Pure melting regime</i>: at pressures greater than the critical point (~ 40 bars, 400m) carbon dioxide will simply melt and cold liquid CO<font size=-2>2</font> will progressively mix with seawater during its further descent through the water column and subsequently with pore water after embedment in the underlying sedimentary formation. 
<br>
            d)<i> Chemical sedimentary interaction</i>: the behaviour of the carbon dioxide once it has been successfully emplaced in a deep ocean geological formation will clearly depend on its interaction with the host formation under the prevailing in-situ conditions of temperature, pressure and geochemical environment.
<p>
Preliminary calculations have been carried out on thermal dissolution in the water column <a href="#ref18">[18]</a> taking into account the different regimes described above. For penetrators initially weighing 10, 100 and 1000 tons (vol. ~ 6.41, 64.1, 641 m3, dimensions ~ 9. 5m x 0.95m, 20.0m x 2.0m and 43m x 4.3m) <a href=diox1-figure04.html> figure 4 </a> shows  estimates of the loss of CO<font size=-2>2</font> during free-fall, for various storage sites at depths down to 4000 m.  It can immediately be seen that for small penetrators (10 t) the loss, as a percentage of the initial mass, even at disposal sites of only 1 km. depth are high, in the region of 40%. However, for a 100 t penetrator the loss is considerably less and estimated to be in the range of 17%. In the case of a 1000 t penetrator the loss is around 7%; for these large penetrators even for sites as deep as 3-4 km losses are only in the region of 25%. 
<p>
The results show that mass loss is roughly proportional to velocity, and as time to depth is inversely proportional to velocity, the mass loss per unit of surface to a given depth is roughly independent of penetrator size. The increase of mass loss with penetrator size is thus only proportional to the increase of surface area, and independent of free-fall velocity.
<p>
<center>
<a href="diox1-figure04.html"><img src="figure04.gif.tn" ALT="Fig4"></a>
<a href="diox1-figure05.html"><img src="figure05.gif.tn" ALT="Fig5"></a><br>

<img src="space80.gif">
[ <a href=diox1-figure05.html> FIGURE 5 </a> ]
</center>
<p>
It is believed, however, that these losses could be  reduced close to zero by using frozen seawater as an insulating material. The option proposed is to coat the penetrator by a shell of solid ice. Such a coating would effectively shield the penetrator from the surrounding water, since water-ice has a surface temperature around 0 C and thus would markedly reduce heat flux from the seawater. <a href=diox1-figure05.html> Figure 5 </a> shows the predicted minimum ice coating required to shield the carbon dioxide from the water for disposal sites from 1-4 km. Ice thickness vary from 4-12 cm for this range of depths. Any ice remaining at the end of the sediment penetration phase could also provide a further source of water for the subsequent transformation of carbon dioxide into clathrate. 
<p>
Clearly other material (plastic foam etc.) could also be investigated for insolation if this were to be required for the industrial production of large penetrators. 
<p>
<u>Carbon dioxide sequestration within deep ocean sediments</u>. Two generic types of pelagic environments could be particularly suitable for permanent storage, calcareous rich oozes and soft alumino-silicate  clays. In both types of environment the initial sequence of events will be probably similar. After emplacement (say at 4000m), a strong thermal gradient will be establish between the solid CO<font size=-2>2</font> penetrator (-80 to -100C) and the surrounding environment (2C). Initially the penetrator will freeze the pore water in the surrounding sediments, and its temperature will increase because of latent heat of ice freezing. As the temperature of the penetrator reaches ~ -50oC (phase change temperature at the in-situ pressure of 400 atm) the solid CO<font size=-2>2</font> will go to a liquid state as:
<p>
CO<font size=-2>2</font> (s) = CO<font size=-2>2</font>(l)
<p>
After completion of this phase change the temperature will start to increase again. During this thermal transient, diffusion transport will mobilise aqueous components towards the cold zone. This will counteract the movement of reactive solutes away from the carbon dioxide along the chemical gradient. Reaction with surrounding pore water will start to take place with the formation of a carbon dioxide clathrate. This compound is a solid under conditions of temperature and pressure at such a site (<a href=diox1-figure03.html> fig. 3 </a>):
<p>
CO<font size=-2>2</font> (l) + 5.75 H<font size=-2>2</font>O (l) = CO<font size=-2>2</font>-Clathrate (s) 
<p>
	a) <i>Calcareous rich oozes</i>: after the formation of a clathrate, in the case of soft carbonate sediments, there will be an ensuing  formation of carbonate ions (however over very long time periods) due to the interaction between the clathrate and the surrounding calcium carbonate: 
<p>
CO<font size=-2>2</font>-Clathrate (s) + CaCO<font size=-2>3</font> (s) = Ca2+(aq) + 2CO<font size=-2>3</font>2- + 2H+ + 4.75 H<font size=-2>2</font>O(l) 
<p>
The formation of dissolved carbonate ions will subsequently (again over very long time periods) be neutralised by excess anions in the sedimentary environment and re-precipitation of calcium carbonate will follow. These reactions will occur in carbonate rich sedimentary formations that have been set down above the carbonate compensation layer at around 4000 m. 
<p>
In the sea of Japan geothermally heated fluids containing very high concentrations of carbon dioxide at depths greater than 1500 m <a href="#ref19">[19]</a> have been discovered. These have been observed to precipitate on cooling once the temperature is less than 10C, thus confirming solid clathrate as the equilibrium state of carbon dioxide in the NaCl-CO<font size=-2>2</font>-H<font size=-2>2</font>O ternary system. 
<p>
	b) <i>Alumino-silicate soft clays</i>: an alternative storage environment is that of a sediment rich in calcium and magnesium silicates <a href="#ref20">[20]</a>, such sediments exist at both lesser and greater depths than the carbonate compensation layer. In this case sequestration will occur through precipitation as solid carbonate following a  reaction of the type:
<p>
3MgCa(SiO<font size=-2>3</font>)<font size=-2>2</font> + 3CO<font size=-2>2</font> +H<font size=-2>2</font>O = H<font size=-2>4</font>Mg<font size=-2>3</font>SiO<font size=-2>9</font> + 3CaCO<font size=-2>3</font> + 4SiO<font size=-2>2</font>
<p>
In this case there may be competition for the carbon dioxide between the silicates and water for the formation of calcium carbonate or clathrates. Although the limited data available tend to indicate a favourably stable environment for both types of sediment,  much more work clearly needs to be undertaken on the physico-chemical and kinetic interaction and evolution between hydrates and the different geochemical environments.
<p>
</ul></ul><font size=+1><strong>4. CONCLUSIONS</strong></font><ul><ul>
<p>
Preliminary theoretical studies appear to show that permanent storage of CO<font size=-2>2</font> is possible using the natural geochemical properties of selected deep ocean sediments. Such a storage option would circumvent the problem of the eventual return of this gas to the atmosphere. Further evidence for the stable nature of clathrates can be drawn from existence of a natural analogue of CO<font size=-2>2</font> hydrate, methane hydrate<a href="#ref21">[21]</a>. This hydrate is believed to be responsible for the bottom-following (or bottom simulating) reflector observed in many ocean areas from marine seismic reflection investigations. This reflector is thought to represent the lower face of sediment stiffened by interstitial methane clathrates <a href="#ref22">[22]</a>. By analogy, it appears reasonable to postulate that a zone of sediment indurated and stifferened by CO<font size=-2>2</font>-hydrate would form above the final resting point of the penetrator. This would supress both advection and diffusion, leading to the effective isolation of the CO<font size=-2>2</font> for periods of millions of years.
<p>
A final point to consider is that such a disposal option should have negligible biological impact on pelagic fauna as there is no acidic dissolution of CO<font size=-2>2</font> at the sediment-water interface, thus inducing no alteration to local levels of seawater pH which could cause damage to local populations. Microbial activity at the foreseen burial depths (>10-15m) is expected to be very low and will probably only be linked to residual organic carbon deposition <a href="#ref23">[23]</a>.

<strong>ABSTRACT</strong><p>
<ul><ul>
A disposal technique for carbon dioxide, consisting of burying solid CO<font size=-2>2</font> penetrators into the deep seabed has been proposed. The expected weight of these penetrators can be as large as 1000 tons with lengths between 20 to 40m and  diameters of 4-5m. In order to produce and dispose of such large penetrators, an engineering approach has to be developed to investigate the feasibility of the process from the sources (industrial and thermal electrical production sites) to the sink (deep marine geological formation). A 5 Mt/year  CO<font size=-2>2</font> disposal capacity, has been selected for the study. This corresponds to a 500 MW(e) coal fired power plant assumed to be in the vicinity of a coastal port. The selected penetrators are 540 tons weight, approximately 30m high and 4m diameter. Two concepts have been investigated. The first consists in producing  penetrators at a land based factory and then shipping them to a disposal site in specially designed ships having the capacity of carrying 148 penetrators. The second assumes that liquid CO<font size=-2>2</font>  can be collected from a port facility, transported by a liquid CO<font size=-2>2</font> container ship to a mobile marine penetrator production and launching platform. The cost of these solutions have not been evaluated in the present work.

<p>
Disposal of CO<font size=-2>2</font> in  deep ocean geological formations potentially appears to be an attractive alternative to a number of disposal concepts recently investigated . Among the options <a href="#ref1">[1]</a> which have been studied are a) transport of gaseous or liquid CO<font size=-2>2</font> by pipeline (GLP) from a land producing plant for ocean disposal at  depth  b) dumping  of non streamlined solid (NSS) CO<font size=-2>2</font> blocks from a ship. In the case of the GLP option, a rapid return of an important fraction of the the injected volumes to the ocean surface will occur because of the density difference between the liquid CO<font size=-2>2</font> and ocean water. The NSS disposal option will be hindered by: i) the fact that a large portion of the solid CO<font size=-2>2</font> will return to the liquid or vapour phase during the slow free-fall of the solid blocks to the sea bottom, ii) the blocks will not penetrate the seabed sediments, and iii) the solid CO<font size=-2>2</font> will dissolve in the deep bottom waters.
<p>
In a possible solution to these problems, <a href="#ref2">[2-3]</a> it has been  proposed to further develop the solid disposal option by streamlining the solid CO<font size=-2>2</font> blocks in order to  shorten the free fall flight time and to reach a much higher terminal velocity before impact with the sea floor [4-5]. As a consequence, depending on their terminal velocity and the mechanical properties of the sediments, the hydrodynamically shaped blocks (called penetrators from here on) will embed themselves within the underlying geological formation. This has been shown using penetrators that were studied as a disposal option for other solid wastes <a href="#ref6">[6]</a>. For the present analysis a depth of 10-15m is considered sufficient to constitute an effective barrier between the solid and the deep ocean water. It has been demonstrated, both theoretically and experimentally <a href="#ref7">[7-8]</a>, that because of the high impact velocities of penetrators, the sediment deformation created by the passage of the device will self-seal and the remoulded sediment column retain similar characteristics to its original properties. This is due to the fact that the low pressure environment acting  in the penetrators wake will cause surface material to collapse behind the incoming vehicle. Thus, an open pathway ( potential by-pass) between the buried penetrator and the deep ocean water is unlikely. Under these circumstances the solid CO<font size=-2>2</font> will physically and chemically  interact with the sediments before reacting with the ocean water. The retention times will, therefore, be significantly increased as compared to the GPL and the NSS solutions.
<p>
It is speculated that the added cost required for producing hydrodynamically shaped penetrators is probably small as compared to the costs of  producing  solid CO<font size=-2>2</font> from the exhaust stack of power generating or other industrial plants, and subsequent fabrication and disposal of NSS blocks. In order to better assess the impact of the streamlined versus the non streamlined solutions, a conceptual engineering design of two alternative disposal options has been undertaken. The first consists in producing the penetrators in a land based factory and shipping them to the disposal site in a specially designed ship  having the capacity of carrying 148 penetrators (~ 80,000 t). The other option assumes a land-based source of liquid CO<font size=-2>2</font>, and subsequent transport of the liquid CO<font size=-2>2</font> by container ship to a mobile production platform containing penetrator fabrication and launching facilities etc.
<p>
</ul></ul><strong><font size=+1>2. CONCEPTUAL DESIGN OF SYSTEM: THE PENETRATORS</font></strong><ul><ul>
<p>
Penetrators will need to be constructed rather rapidly in order to comply with the CO<font size=-2>2</font> disposal requirements of a 500 MW(e) coal fired power plant producing about 540 ton carbon dioxide per hour. Thus on an hourly basis the disposal of such a quantity can be satisfied by a single penetrator or several smaller ones. For a 540 tons penetrator, a tail penetration of >10-15 m can be achieved in soft sediments <a href="#ref3">[3]</a> if the industrially produced CO<font size=-2>2</font> density is of at least 1400 kg/m3, after a free fall of about 1500 m. For the purposes of  discussion such a penetration depth is considered satisfactory for the present disposal scenario. Thus the lower weight limit for a penetrator satisfying a minimum tail emplacement of say ~5m will be about 100t. Solid CO<font size=-2>2</font> penetrators of such a large size can be fabricated either from compacting expanded snow produced from gas or from directly freezing liquid CO<font size=-2>2</font>. The second solution is thermodynamically more efficient [1] and technologically easier and has been selected for the purpose of the present evaluation. Penetrators of 540 t will have an estimated diameter and length of ~ 4m and ~30 m respectively.
<p>
It is assumed that a source of liquid CO<font size=-2>2</font> at atmospheric pressure and a temperature of -78.50C is available at the penetrators production site. Thus in order to fabricate a penetrator a mould is used  consisting of a double wall reinforced metal structure (Fig.1). The unit is designed to withstand  loads developed by both the weight and  thermal stresses of the production process. The outside wall of the mould is isolated in order to diminish heat losses and is reinforced by concentric steel ribs. Incorporated into the inner wall of the mould is a heat exchanger in which cooling fluid circulates. However, since the diameter of the penetrator is so large, the time required to completely transform the liquid into solid by the advancing ice front will be excessively long, thus requiring  too many on-going penetrator production units. In order to accelerate the process, a non recoverable (throw away) aluminium tubular heat exchanger is introduced into the mould at a relatively short distance from the inside wall. The void volume of the mould is then filled with liquid CO<font size=-2>2</font> and cooled by the main and auxiliary heat exchangers.
<p>

<a href="diox2-figure01.html">Figure 1. Refrigerated mould for penetrator fabrication (land or platform based production)</a>
</center>
<p>
The function of the auxiliary heat exchanger is not only to accelerate the formation of a thick ice wall but also to serve as a mechanical reinforcement. The auxiliary heat exchanger tubes will be, prior to launch, filled with pressurised liquid CO<font size=-2>2</font> in order to increase their contribution to the structural rigidity of the penetrators. Because production time has to be minimised, only 0,8 m of the outside penetrator diameter will be frozen; the inside core of 2.4 m diameter (representing about 36% of the total volume) will remain in the liquid state. Thus, in order to reach the appropriate density for adequate emplacement, the penetrators have to be ballasted. This is achieved by the addition of an iron nose cone (density 7700 kg/m3) whose weight will be less than 5% of the total penetrator mass. 
<p>
In order to handle the completed penetrators, the solid iron nose cone will be connected by a steel cable to a top plate and clamp. Because the cable is in the liquid CO<font size=-2>2</font> it will be possible to post-stress the penetrator by an appropriate bolt system in order to increase its strength. The tail section (metallic) is made up of fins attached to a thin conic after-structure shaped hydrodynamically to provide flight stability. 
<p>
The mould is fabricated in two halves and can be open by separating them laterally. The  nose cone,  auxiliary spiral internal heat exchanger,  handling cable and conic tail piece and fins are inserted into the open mould. The lower extremity of the collapsed spiral heat exchanger and handling cable are fixed to the nose cone, the top end being attached to an independent winch situated on the top structure of the penetrators fabrication area. 
<p>
Once the mould is closed the internal spiral heat exchanger is drawn to the top of the penetrator by pulling the internal cable and clamped tight. Filling with CO<font size=-2>2</font> will be carried out through ports along the penetrator mould wall. Because of volume shrinkage, as a result of increasing density during freezing, additional liquid CO<font size=-2>2</font> will have to be added through the top of the mould during the freezing process.
<p>
</ul></ul><strong><font size=+1>3. PENETRATOR PRODUCTION PLANT</font></strong><ul><ul>
<p>
The penetrator production plant design will be somewhat different depending whether it is  land based or incorporated in a marine platform. It is assumed in both cases that the coal fired power plant is near the shore and has port facilities either to load  liquid CO<font size=-2>2</font> (in the case of a sea platform) or the finished penetrators (in the case of a land based production plant).The penetrator production plant will, in both cases, consist of a number of dedicated areas: 
<p>
* Power generation plant, liquid CO<font size=-2>2</font> delivery and storage, liquid-to-solid CO<font size=-2>2</font> production unit, fuel delivery and storage,  fabrication area containing  penetrator moulds, penetrator storage (for land based production only), penetrator transfer system to ship (for land based production only), <br>    
* Central control area, communication and logistics (helicopters, ships, etc.), maintenance etc., <br>
* Storage areas for penetrator parts:  nose cones, spiral heat exchangers, cables, tail sections, <br>
* Assembly zone:  nose, heat exchanger, cable and tail section construction. <br>
<p>
</ul></ul><strong><font size=+1>4. DEDICATED PENETRATOR DISPOSAL SHIP</font></strong><ul><ul>
<p>
In the case of the land based production plant, the delivery of the penetrators to the deep disposal sea area is performed by a dedicated ship incorporating the following features: loading, storage and refrigeration facilities, and launch handling system. In order to dispose of carbon dioxide at the same rate as its production from a 500 MW(e) power generating unit (i.e. ~540 tons per hour) a penetrator transport and disposal ship should have a rotation schedule of six days. The total number of penetrators to be transported will be one hundred and forty-eight. The penetrators will be stored in individual reusable refrigerated containers. 
<p>
It is possible to imagine different arrangement for the storage in the ship :
* Horizontally, parallel to the length on three decks ; <br>
* Horizontally, perpendicular to the symmetrical plane of the ship, and also on three decks ; <br>
*Vertically, by introducing reusable refrigerated penetrator containers into individual compartments which themselves contribute to the ship structure.
<p>
Solutions using horizontal arrangement, however, appear to have a number difficulties (mainly technological ones) related to :
i.  Complex handling of very heavy packages during both loading and launching phases, <br>
ii. Recovery and storage of empty containers after launching.
<p>

<a href="diox2-figure02.html">Figure 2  Design features of dedicated penetrator disposal ship</a>
</center>
<p>
Thus, concentrating on vertical storage and launching  solutions (which seem to present fewer difficulties), the design of the ship would be as follows (Fig. 2). The central storage area of the ship is partitioned in 148 refrigerated elements (1) of square section (5,5x5,5 meters) and 30 meters high. The ship displacement is estimated to be about 120,000 tons and will be provided with a double hull (4,5 and 6). The penetrators packed in individual insulated refrigerated containers in the production plant, are loaded by crane into each of the compartments in the ship's hold for storage during transport to the disposal site. 
<p>
The disposal of penetrators will be carried out by the means of two moon-pools (2 and 4) served by two cranes (7), respectively moving at the aft and the fore of the ship in order to maintain the initial trim and heel of the vessel during the launching phase. During readiness for launching a penetrators is extracted from its  refrigeration container  by one of the overhead cranes (Fig.2). The penetrator  will be supported and guided by a fixed transverse sliding channel (8) and  a longitudinal frame (9) moving together with the crane, in order to assure stability of the vehicle. The crane will position the penetrator over the moon pool, lower it to is launch depth and release it.
<p>
</ul></ul><strong><font size=+1>5. SEA PLATFORM</font></strong><ul><ul>
<p>
The sea platform architecture (Fig.3) will be structured around a central circular moon pool for the disposal of the penetrators. The central pool is surrounded by an annular production area provided with sliding doors and roofs. There is a rotating gantry crane astride the central pool and annular production area, supported on a circular external track. The crane will : i) pick up the completed penetrators, ii) bring them to the centre of the moon pool, iii) lower them rapidly below the water level and iv) release them. 
<p>

<a href="diox2-figure03.html"><img src="figure06.gif.tn" ALT="Fig3"></a><br>
<a href="diox2-figure03.html">Figure 3  Plan view of penetrator production and disposal platform</a>
</center>
<p>
The outside wall of the annular production area communicates with a lower annular circulation area necessary to bring the assembled nose cone, spiral heat exchanger and cable, as well as the tail section for each penetrator into the fabrication area. Around the lower circulation area there are  storage zones for the nose cones, spiral heat exchangers, cables and tail sections. Also the assembly and  refrigeration-production areas occupy part of this outer annulus. Satellite structures for energy production, maintenance, control, and housing of personnel will be connected by covered walkways to the central production and launching area. A helicopter pad is incorporated in the platform.
The main platform will be connected to four logistic-service platforms devoted to the docking of  transport ships for liquid CO<font size=-2>2</font>, fuel, penetrator components and personnel. Liquid CO<font size=-2>2</font> and fuel will be stored into the platform buoyancy structures (Fig.4). Those for the liquid CO<font size=-2>2</font> must be pressurised to about 5MPa assuming the water temperature at about 100 m depth is  160C or less. The platform is manoeuvrable using underwater thrusters and employs a Global Positioning System (GPS) for penetrator disposal emplacement. The overall weight of the structure is estimated to be ~ 450,000 tons.

<p>
</ul></ul><strong><font size=+1>6. ENERGY REQUIREMENTS</font></strong><ul><ul>
<p>
The power consumption for producing solid CO<font size=-2>2</font> from liquid CO<font size=-2>2</font> is 86 kW/t (which corresponds to 317 kW/t C described in ref. [1])  In order to produce one 540t penetrator per hour, comprising 64% of solid CO<font size=-2>2</font> and 36% of liquid CO<font size=-2>2</font>,  the installed power should be ~ 30 MW. This is the largest single energy requirement for the production system.  In the case of an off-shore platform  power is also needed for the thruster units for the self positioning of the platform and is estimated to be some 10 MW.  Power will also be required for pumping the fluids into the platform reservoirs (200 kW), for pumping the liquid CO<font size=-2>2</font> from the storage buoyancy reservoirs and distributing it throughout the production plant (50 kW). Power  for the auxiliary equipment and living quarters (200 kW) must also be considered although adding only a very limited amount of energy.
<p>
The on-board power plant should be thus designed to provide about 50 MW. Thus energy production for penetrator fabrication will itself be responsible for the emission of about 54 ton CO<font size=-2>2</font> per hour, that is to say approximately two and a half penetrators per day to be disposed as a results of local energy requirements. The effective treatment capacity of the site will be thus reduced to the equivalent of 4.5 Mt CO<font size=-2>2</font>/year.
<p>
</ul></ul><strong><font size=+1>7. CARBON DIOXIDE TRANSPORT</font></strong><ul><ul>
<p>
This preliminary  study has considered for the moment only two options for the transport of carbon dioxide from a coastal site to a disposal area. The first, as liquid carbon dioxide transported in a refrigerated pressurised ship to serve an off-shore penetrator production platform. The second, as solid penetrators individually cooled at atmospheric pressure in a specially designed container-disposal vessel. A further option that has been investigated <a href="#ref9">[9]</a> is that of pumping through pipelines. In this case the CO<font size=-2>2</font> must be compressed to a pressure at which it is either a liquid or a dense phase fluid. Although marine pipelines at 500m depth have been studied <a href="#ref10">[10]</a> the ability to lay them at depths of 1000m or more is still to be demonstrated. However, as deep water technology develops, as it has done over the last two decades, such a option may become operationally and economically viable. 
<p>
For transport over ocean distances shipping remains the only method. One possible long-term alternative to specially designed pressurised low temperature ships could be to consider a dual cycle system combining hydrogen (clean energy) and carbon dioxide. On the basis of a generic formation reaction shown below,  methanol can be formed (Giacomazzi personal communication) and used as hydrogen transport vector. 
<p>
3 H<font size=-2>2</font>  +  CO<font size=-2>2</font>   =  CH<font size=-2>3</font>OH  +  H<font size=-2>2</font>O	
<p>
Exporting methanol from the site of production (large hydro-electric resources for the production of hydrogen), say from Canada, to Europe or Japan, could be carried out in normal bulk-liquid transport ships at atmospheric temperature and pressure.
<p>
On arrival in Europe and Japan the methanol could be pumped from the ship to the penetrator production platform (on the edge of the continental shelf) and catalytically reformed <a href="#ref11">[11]</a> to produce hydrogen and carbon dioxide (using further catalytic oxidation). Once separated hydrogen could be pumped as a gas by pipeline to an on-shore storage facility and the carbon dioxide solidified (the energy being provided by using a fraction of the transported hydrogen) and transformed into penetrators for disposal as described earlier.
Such an option appears interesting as it could perhaps contribute to resolving the problem of inter-continental transport of liquid hydrogen (~ -2530C, 13 atmospheres) as an energy source and at the same time contribute to carbon dioxide elimination. Clearly much more analysis is required to quantify the constraints of such an option.
<p>
</ul></ul><strong><font size=+1>8. CONCLUSIONS</font></strong><ul><ul>
<p>
As compared to the disposal from a ship of non streamlined solid (NSS) CO<font size=-2>2</font> blocks produced at an inland plant, the penetrator option offers major advantages without introducing un-resolvable difficulties for production, handling and disposal and without increasing significantly the power requirements either for land or sea production. Among the advantages of the penetrator option are :
<p>
       i)   losses of CO<font size=-2>2</font>  via thermal dissolution during free fall are sharply reduced, <br>
      ii) large tail embedments (>10m) can be achieved with streamlined bodies produced by moulding, <br>
      iii) very long retention times can be achieved by natural sedimentary geochemical sequestration, <br>
      iv)  core of the penetrators can remain as liquid CO<font size=-2>2</font> (lower energy consumption). <br>
<p>
Production and disposal of the penetrators require :
<p>
       a)  a sophisticated production facility (on land or at sea), <br>
       b) a specialised transport and disposal ship (for the option of  on-land production of penetrators), <br>
       c) a custom designed production and disposal platform, including  important shipping logistics support for CO<font size=-2>2</font> and fuel delivery (for the at-sea penetrator production option). <br>
<p>
Further development of the proposed conceptual designs are necessary to evaluate the fixed and operating costs of the penetrator fabrication plants (on land and at sea) and to optimise the system operation. Alternative CO<font size=-2>2</font> transport methods (pipelines, methanol) should also be considered as they could have implications on overall costs if the technology would be proven to be viable.
<p>
Finally, the complexity and shear size of the operations required to permanently dispose of a significant part of CO<font size=-2>2</font>  emissions from industrial production processes on a planetary scale, for any of the solutions proposed (sea or land production), are clearly considerable. However, the technical difficulties involved do not seem insurmountable compared to the classical problems faced by the offshore gas and petroleum industry. 
<p>
It is nevertheless, clearly necessary to confirm the various assumptions made on the physical, chemical and thermodynamic processes taking  place from the moment of launch of the penetrators to their final emplacement, as well as  their long-term behaviour in  deep marine sedimentary formations. It is thus important to develop theoretical and experimental research (including the investigation of prototype penetrators launched from disused ships) activities to validate (or otherwise) the feasibility of the concept. In this way one would not be caught unprepared if, in the future, the problem of atmospheric pollution by carbon dioxide became critical.

<BOLD>ACRI</BOLD> functions under a unified management structure, with
operations located in Sophia Antipolis (France). It employs a matrix
organization, that is, a combination of functional or line sections,
and of a project team.

<P>

ACRI has a wide experience in remote sensing system requirements,
analysis and ground segment design, mission analysis and requirements.

<P>

ACRI has also a wide experience in a variety of space problems such as
overall mission performances, orbital properties generator, spacecraft
axes steering control, signal characteristics to be detected on top of
the atmosphere, geometrical and radiometric instrument features and
distortion, and on ground processing algorithms needed to retrieve
accurate Earth and environmental signal and geophysical parameters.

<P>

In particular, ACRI has been continuously involved in mission analysis
tasks such as identification of optimal and attitude parameters for
Earth observation; optimisation of instrument mission performance:
coverage, signal dynamics characterisation on top of the atmosphere,
sampling geometry and signal quality, pointing accuracy and on board
calibration procedure. For instance, ACRI has performed the mission
analysis and requirements for MERIS, MIMR, MIPAS,
GOMOS,... instruments during the POEM-1/ENVISAT-1 Pre-Phase-A, Phase-A
and Phase-B. All the scientific and technical reports have been issued
to the ESA Scientific Advisory Groups (SAGs) members.

<P>

Furthermore, ACRI is well acquainted with the Earth observation
science community. As such ACRI has co-operation agreements with
laboratories in France (such as Service d'A&eacute;ronomie: J-L. Bertaux,
Institut Laplace: G. Megie, Laboratoire de M&eacute;t&eacute;orologie
Dynamique:
N.A. Scott, P. Flament, Laboratoire de Physique et Chimie Marine:
A. Morel, Laboratoire d'Optique Atmosph&eacute;rique: 
D.Tanr&eacute;,....., Ecole
des Mines de Paris: L. Wald) and European laboratories such as Finnish
Meteorological Institute: G. Leppelmeier, Free University of Berlin:
J. Fischer, GKSS: H. Grassl, Plymouth Marine Laboratory: J. Aiken, UK
Meteorological Office: P.  Curtis, Institut d'A&eacute;ronomie Spatiale de
Bruxelles: P. Simon...

<P>

ACRI is leading the project "Integration of remote sensing, in-situ
observations and numerical modelling applied to the northeast
Atlantic" in the frame of the "Human capital and mobility" initiative
of the CEC. ACRI is participating in the OCEAN project of the CEC
Joint Research Centre.  ACRI experience can be summarised in six types
of activities:

<UL>
<LI>i. User requirements: ACRI is currently in charge for
the EUMETSAT Ground Segment support of the coordination with the users
community. ACRI is involved with JRC in pilot projects, part of the
Centre for Earth Observation (CEO) project, in charge of the
collection of user requirements from experimental community on coastal
zones;

<LI>ii. Mission Analysis: ACRI has been continuously involved in
mission analysis tasks such as identification of optimal orbit and
attitude parameters for Earth observation (yaw steering, ESA study);
optimisation of instrument mission and performance: coverage, signal
dynamics characterisation, sampling geometry and signal quality,
pointing accuracy,... for instruments studied during the POEM-1 phase
B: MERIS, MIMR, MIPAS;

<LI>iii. Ground processing: ACRI has performed the
definition study for engineering and scientific data products of MERIS
and MIMR instruments in the frame of POEM Ground Segment Phase B study
(ESA contract led by Logica, MDA). To satisfy the global requirements,
the MERIS and MIMR instrument operation will be permanent. All
corresponding data should be acquired, processed following various
levels, and disseminated in due time to user point of contact.


<P>

ACRI is currently in charge of the complete definition of the
data processing chain of the GOMOS and MERIS instruments; the
definition covers all necessary processing steps from the raw data to
the generation of the geophysical products. (e.g. the MERIS Ocean
Colour products such as chlorophyll concentration, chlorophyll
fluorescence, type and Optical depth of marine aerosols or the GOMOS
ozone or aerosols vertical profiles among others).

<P>

It includes the MERIS and GOMOS overall ground processing
architecture, detailed design, development plan, products and
algorithms definition specifications. The documentation follows ESA
Software Engineering Standards and Product Assurance Quality.
<P>

<LI>
iv. Guidance and Control:
<P>ACRI has performed studies on MIPAS
instrument pointing requirements in order to aim at a stable
tangential altitude. ACRI has also performed, with the Laboratoire
d'Automatique de Nantes, a study on Guidance Navigation and Control
for moderate lift/drag Re-entry, applied to aero-assisted orbit
transfer (ESA Contract March 1991).  v. Navigation: ACRI has modelised
6 D.O.F. trajectories applied to as various subjects as a spacecraft
attitude, ship precise positioning (French Navy contract), re-entry in
the atmosphere .  vi. System Software: ACRI has developed general
purpose software in the fluid dynamics and combustion (ANSWER), ground
water (PORFLOW), surface and marine waters (TIDAL), atmosphere (RADM),
guidance and control (ANACOM), and Earth Observation (EOSS)
fields. This activity includes software sells, users training and
maintenance.
<P>
	ACRI has specified the software requirements for the future
MIMR end to end system simulator during the Phase-B of the MIMR study
(ALENIA Contract, 1991-2);
	ACRI has performed under contract with DORNIER :
	MERIS mission performances and end to end system simulator
(including on ground processing until level 2) development .
	GOMOS mission performances and end to end system simulator
(including on ground processing until level 2) development.

</UL>

<ITALIC> A common concept is being developed for remote sensing
instrument simulators. The objectives generally recognised are to
assess end-to-end performance of the remote sensing process in order
to:
	verify instrument and ground processing performance against
the mission objectives
	provide feedback to the instrument design and tuning
	provide a reference and support tool for the validation of the
mission ground segment in development, delivery and in-orbit operation
phases The simulator includes mathematical models for 1) signal (raw
data) generated from various Earth, atmosphere, etc. targets emitting
signal including environmental conditions (sun illumination, satellite
orbit motion, satellite axes steering control, target environment,
signal propagation...).  2) instrument hardware and electronic chain
simulator (MTF) generating instrument outputs from given reference
inputs signal (incident flux at the top of the atmosphere).  3) ground
processing simulator generating from raw data the data product
processed and calibrated on ground. These processes require to inverse
the geometric, radiometric and instrument transfer function using
dedicated deconvolution methods.  The mathematical models are
supported by a common infrastructure of data management and user
interface, tools supporting simulation results analysis such as image
quality assessment.  </ITALIC>

<H2>Justification de l'installation d'un syst&egrave;me d'acquisition
de donn&eacute;es satellitaires </H2>

<BIG>
Les satellites METEOSAT, NOAA, etc... sont particuli&egrave;rement
int&eacute;ressant pour le suivi qu'ils offrent sur les continents
europ&eacute;en et africain et sur les oc&eacute;ans.

<P>

L'importance de la connaissance du temps et du climat
(d&eacute;placements des nuages, pr&eacute;vision
m&eacute;t&eacute;orologique, indice de pr&eacute;cipitation,
pr&eacute;vision des crues, temp&eacute;rature de la surface de la
mer, analyse des nuages), la qualit&eacute; et l'accessibilit&eacute;
des images, notamment celles du satellite M&eacute;t&eacute;osat,
repr&eacute;sente aujourd'hui un formidable outil pour un grand nombre
de laboratoires et d'industries, ainsi que pour l'agriculture.

<P>

Une large communaut&eacute; d'acteurs, identifi&eacute;e, exprime un
besoin d'outils d'information op&eacute;rationnels sur
l'environnement. Les applications sont nombreuses, par exemple :

<UL>
<LI>Protection des c&ocirc;tes
<LI>Climatologie, m&eacute;t&eacute;orologie
<LI>Surveillance, s&eacute;curit&eacute;
<LI>Tourisme et loisirs
<LI>P&ecircumflex;cheries et aquaculture
<LI>Trafic maritime
<LI>Exploitations agricoles et &eacute;levage
</UL>		

<P>

L'exploitation des donn&eacute;es fournies par les satellites
d'observation de la terre sont utilisables directement et en temps
r&eacute;el par le syst&egrave;me WEFAXSAT.

<H2>FONCTIONNALITES </H2>

Pour &ecircumflex;tre exploitables, toutes les donn&eacute;es passent
par plusieurs &eacute;tapes. Le syst&egrave;me d'acquisition et de
traitement d&eacute;velopp&eacute; et commercialis&eacute; par la
soci&eacute;t&eacute; GM-IMAGES , WEFAXSAT, permet de transformer un
micro-ordinateur en une station de r&eacute;ception de satellites.

<P>

Il comprend, une antenne parabolique de 1 m&egrave;tre de
diam&egrave;tre, une station de r&eacute;ception analogique, une carte
de num&eacute;risation et traitement des images, le logiciel WEFAXSAT.

<P>

Cette station de r&eacute;ception permet de capter les satellites
g&eacute;ostationnaires de type M&eacute;t&eacute;osat, GOES, GMS au
format WEFAX et les satellites polaires &agrave; d&eacute;filement
comme NOAA et M&eacute;t&eacute;or, au format APT.



<H2>PROGICIEL WEFAXSAT</H2>

WEFAXSAT est un progiciel offrant des fonctions &eacute;volu&eacute;es
de traitement dimages WEFAX, coupl&eacute; &agrave; une station de
r&eacute;ception WEFAX fournissant des images num&eacute;riques de
satellites m&eacute;t&eacute;orologiques. Il permet de recevoir,
stocker, traiter, animer ces images.
<p>
Vous pouvez visualisez ci-dessous deux animations METEOSAT :<br>
( Attention, votre syst&egrave;me doit poss&eacute;der un visualisateur de mpeg pour visionner les animations )
<ul>
<li> <a href="/mpeg/meteo.mpg"> Meteosat 1</A> (150K)
<li> <a href="/mpeg/meteo2.mpg">Meteosat 2</a>  (70K)
</ul>

Transient Infiltration of Water in Heterogeneous Soil

PORFLOW has the capability to calculate fluid transport in 3-D heterogeneous
media and the flexibility to use arbitrary user-specified
soil moisture characteristics.

</CENTER>
<P>
Here we present an example of a 2-D calculation of transient moisture
content in heterogeneous soil. 
The 800 by 650 cm test area comprises three layers of soil which vary in material and hydrological
properties. A small zone of high conductivity soil is contained within the lowermost
soil near the left boundary. Uniform infiltration of water at 2 cm/day occurs at the top left boundary.
<P>
The effect of the embedded high-conductivity zone of soil is clearly seen in the manner 
in which the moisture contours deflect towards this zone.

The <A HREF="WWF_WM_Map.GIF"><B>Wadden Sea</B></A> is one of the rarest relatively undisturbed nature systems in Europe. Its unique character, enormous importance for keeping intact habitats of vast amounts of biological species, fascinating landscape has led to considerable research and management efforts on national, as well as international levels, in order to prevent the development of irreversable environmental changes as a result of human impact. <P>

The Wadden sea information system <A HREF="CEOWADABA.html"><B>WATiS</B></A> serves as a tool to facilitate concerted action of the environmental research community and public officials, involved in the nature conservation activities in the Wadden Sea region.<P>

An integration of the <B>WATiS</B> into the CEO experimental server at ACRI is presently under development. An access to the WATiS database WADABA is currently possible only for certified user by a telnet connection to the database. Details can be found <A HREF="CEOLotse.html">here</A>. Future unrestricted access to selected datasets using a direct WWW interface is envisaged.

<H1>Annual progress Report</H1>
<img src="/gifs/bar_marbre_noir2.gif"><br><br>

<h1><a name="RTFToC1">Introduction</a></h1>
<big>
 <p>
 The overall objectives stated in the initial proposal are:<p>
 <p>
 -	to generate, archive and analyse multiannual time series of remote sensing,
<i>in situ</i> and meteorological data for a basic evaluation of time scales,
variability and trends;<p>
 <p>
 -	to develop algorithms that relate variables available from remote sensing,
ocean platforms and other observations to processes occuring in the water
column as for example heat flux, primary productivity and trace gaz fluxes;<p>
 <p>
 -	to select and develop models of the upper layer of the ocean to assimilate
remote sensing and other data for process studies and for future contributions
to global models.<p>
 <p>
 	The following is a short description of the progress of the work to date
within each of these objectives, where the network activity is emphasized.<p>
 
<h2>
<a name="RTFToC2">
 1- Archives and time series analyses
</a></h2>
 <p>
 	In order to provide a general access to a common database, <i>ACRI-Sophia
Antipolis</i> proposed a technical solution based on the World-Wide Web (WWW)
concept. As officially defined, WWW is a "wide-area hypermedia information
retrieval initiative aiming to give universal access to a large universe of
documents". The WWW network works under the client-server model. A WWW server
is defined as a program running on a computer whose only purpose is to deliver
documents to other computers when asked to. A WWW client is an hypermedia tool
that interfaces with the user and documents requested from a server. A major
advantage with the WWW is that it allows to share data distributed in different
computers (at different locations).  The user can access the different data
without knowledge about location or softwares used to manage the data base.  In
the frame of the current project, three WWW servers were installed; at
<i>ARMINES - Sophia Antipolis</i>, <i>ACRI</i> and <i>Intit&uuml;t f&uuml;r
Meereskunde</i> (<i>IM</i>) - <i>Hamburg</i> . These servers are connected to
already existing servers at <i>JRC - Ispra</i> and <i>Clima Maritimo
</i>(<i>CM</i>)<i>  -Madrid</i>. To facilitate exchanges between the different
servers, the <i>ACRI</i> server has the specific role of co-ordination to
provide information of general interest.  This experimental system can be
connected via WWW client at "<b><A HREF="http://acri.cica.fr/">http://acri.cica.fr/</A></b>".<p>
 <p>
 	To allow the set up of data archives, the first task undertaken during1994
concerned the determination of a common frame for data file storage, which
accounts for the various temporal and spatial scales typical of the data
sources involved in this project, i. e. various satellite sensors, <i>in
situ</i> techniques and computational products. This task was essentially
undertaken by <i>ARMINES </i>who proposed a common bathymetry digital map
including shorelines. They also installed a data server with softwares for
satellite data processing and a GIS package (Geographical Information System),
accessible to other members of the network by electronic links.<p>
 <p>
 	Up to now this data frame has been fed (1) by <i>CM</i> who provided the
bathymetry and coastline informations, (2) by <i>Institut
f&uuml;rOstseeforschung </i>(<i>IO</i>)<i> -Warnem&uuml;nde</i> who provided
<i>in situ </i>oceanographic data and (3) by <i>JRC </i> who provided remotely
sensed temperature data (AVHRR).  The set up of a global marine optics data set
has been undertaken.  It includes downward and upward irradiance spectra
measured in the upper water column by several laboratories, at different
locations of the World Ocean.  This data set is intended to remote sensing
algorithm validation.  It will be incorporated into WWW server operated at
<i>ACRI</i>.  Finally, the WWW server operated at <i>CM</i> makes fully
available long term series obtained from wave buoys and tidal gauges deployed
in the vicinity of Canary Islands.  <p>
 <p>
 	Consistently with the initial proposal, in 1994, two oceanographic cruises
(<i>R. V.</i> Hudson and Humbolt) were conducted by <i>IO</i> off Mauritania,
during which a large amount of physical, chemical and biological data were
obtained.  These are available for the network.<p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC3">
 2- Algorithm development
</a></h2>
 <p>
 	During the meeting held in Hamburg last November 3-4, the study region for
algorithm development has been precised relative to the one stated in the
initial proposal (Northeast Atlantic).  All studies will concentrate on the
region delimited by 8deg. and 20deg.W, and 18deg. and 32deg.N.<p>
 <p>
 	During 1994, algorithm development within the network has followe
dessentially two lines.  <b>Firstly</b>, <i>JRC</i> processed satellite data
for estimation of biomass, in order to assess the impact of primary production
on DMS production and generation of clouds in the Northwest African upwelling.
This study was also based on meteorological and <i>in situ</i> data, as well as
on multi-annual time series of satellite observations to investigate long-term
regional and temporal variations of selected surface parameters.
<i>ARMINES</i>, which is involved in long-term projects on the detection of
clouds in satellite imagery and retrieval of their characteristics, obtained
more accurate and efficient processing of the Meteosat satellite data using the
data provided by <i>IO</i> (<i> insitu</i>) and <i>JRC</i> (AVHRR).  Maps of
shortwave radiation have been produced and made available to the network in
October 1994.  Maps of longwave radiation are being produced. They will also be
available to the network.  A study is planned in which comparison between
results obtained by <i>JRC</i> and <i>ARMINES</i> will be performed.  <p>
 <p>
 	<b>Secondly</b>, the first results from the "<i>two layer,
nonlinear,hydrostatic shallow water equation model</i>" have been obtained at
<i>IM</i> for an idealistic scenario: on flat bottom and smooth slopes.  The
model seems to reproduce in a quite satisfactory way the geostrophic adjustment
processes.  These results will be validated over the shelf area of the
Northwest African coasts from remote sensing measurements (<i>JRC</i>) and in
situ observations (<i>IO</i>).<p>
<p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC4">
3- Global models development
</a></h2>
 <p>
 	The third objective of current project has not been yet taken up.  Its
achievement represents the main goal for 1995.<p>
 <p>
 	In order for the network to initiate original contributions to global models
development, a study defined by ACRI has been submitted to all members during
the last meeting held in Hamburg (November 3-4, 1994).  The realization of this
study, which is highly multidisciplinary, will be partitioned into specific
tasks to be achieved by each of the network members.  By this way, the network
will derive a maximum benefit from respective expertises and it should lead to
at least one common paper in a reputed scientific journal.  A short description
of the proposed study is presented in appendix.<p>
 
<h1>
<a name="RTFToC5">
 Concluding remarks
</a></h1>
 <p>
 	In brief, during 1994, the main activity has been devoted to the setting up
of a structure allowing the network to be fully operational.  Frames for data
archiving and processing have been built.  Feeding of these frames is in
progress.  Studies involving different members of the network have been
undertaken.  The third objective of the initial proposal represents the main
task for 1995.  Its achievement will be facilitated by the activity of post-doc
scientists now present in all laboratories of the network (except at
<i>IO</i>).  Through a close collaboration, the post-doc scientists will
acquire experience in interdisciplinary studies.  A meeting gathering all of
them is planned for February 1994 at <i>ACRI</i>.<p>

chlorophyll content (g m<sup>-2</sup>) and [[psi]] [gC (gChl)<sup>-1</sup> (mol
quanta m<sup>-2</sup>)<sup>-1</sup>] is an efficiency factor essentially
reflecting physiological characteristics of phytoplankton.<p>
 	To produce large-scale maps of PP, the key variables provided by remote
sensing are &lt;Chl&gt;sat, <i>i. e.</i> thechlorophyll <i>a</i> concentration
at sea-surface, and the cloudiness which is necessary to compute from<b>
</b>astronomical parameters (e.g. Tanr&eacute; et al. 1990).  Accessorily,
sea-surface temperature (SST) can be used to account for some of the variations
in [[psi]] (Berthon and Morel 1992). To obtain <b> </b>from &lt;Chl&gt;sat, it
is necessary to estimate the vertical profile of chlorophyll <i>a</i>
concentration [&lt;Chl&gt;(z)].  The shape of this profile is determined by the
depth of the euphotic zone<sup>1</sup> (Z= eu)relative to the one of the
sea-surface mixed layer (Zml).<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
___________________________<p>
<sup>1</sup> Zone within which net photosynthesis is achievable. It is
generally assumed to extend down to 1% of surface irradiance.<p>
	In general, when Zeu &lt; Zml, the &lt;Chl&gt;(z) profile is uniform and it
can be assumed= that&lt;Chl&gt;(z) =3D &lt;Chl&gt;sat.  When Zeu &gt; Z= ml, a
deep chlorophyll maximum develops with variable amplitude.  In the PP model
proposed by Morel (1991), the two situations can be distinguishedbased on the
"Climatological atlas of the world ocean" published = by Levitus(1982).  For
waters where Zeu &lt; Zml, an algorithm relying on &lt;Chl&gt;sat (Morel and
Berthon 1989) can be applied.  In both situations, PP is calculated only down
to Zeu (or accessorily 1.5 Zeu).<p>
 	Models predicting the mixed-layer depth from remotely sensed data currently
exist.  Such models could be incorporated into a PP models such as the one of
Morel (1991).  At least, it could allow a better (not static)discrimination
between the Zeu &gt; Zml and Zeu &lt; Z ml situations.  At best, it could allow
a better parameterization of the &lt;Chl&gt;(z) profile, based on the actual
values of Zml andZeu, which can be fairly well estimated, for oceanic waters,
from&lt;Chl&gt;sat (Morel 1988).<p>
 	As stated above, models generally calculated PP only down toZeu (or
accessorily 1.5 Zeu). However, thephytoplanktonic population often extends much
below Zeu<sup>2</sup>.  While phytoplankton lying under Zeu does not contribute
to net photosynthetic, it consumes a fraction of fixed carbon
throughrespiration. Although respiration generally represents only 15 to= 25%
ofnet photosynthesis, in cases where Zeu is much smaller than Zml, respiration
could decrease significantly the column-integrated net photosynthesis. In this
context, estimations of the mixed-layer depth from remotely sensed data could
be used to account in a more realistic way for respiration in primary
production models.<p>
 	<p>
<p>
<b><i> Objectives</i></b><p>
<p>
 <b>1)</b>	To adopt and operate a model predicting the mixed-layer depth from
remotely sensed data.  If possible,improvements could be realized on some
aspects of the model.<p>
 <p>
 <b>2)</b>	To incorporate a mixed-layer depth model into a primaryproduction
model.<p>

Technical aspects
</a></h2>
<p>
<b> <i>Choice of a mixed-layer depth (MLD) model</i></b><p>
<p>
The MLD model proposed here is the one developed by Yan et al.
(1991a, b). This model is based on the determination of the surface thermal
inertiafrom remote sensing estimations of SST and wind stress (microwave).  In
this model, the computation of the heat flux does not consider the influence of
phytoplankton on the water heating rate.  The heating rate model recently
proposed by Morel and Antoine (1994), which is based on ocean color remote
sensing, could be used to improve the MLD model mentioned above.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b><i> Choice of a primary production (PP) model</i></b><p>
<p>
 	The PP model chosen here is the one of Morel (1991) which has been proven in
several recent applications (Andr&eacute; and Morel 1991, Berthon and Morel
1992, Antoine and Morel a, b <i>submitted</i>, Antoine <i>et
al.submitted</i>).<p>
 <p>
 
<h2><a name="RTFToC9">Tasks</a></h2>
 <p>
 1)	To attempt an improvement of the mixed-layer model of Yan et al. (1991) by
integrating the heating rate model of Morel and Antoine (1994).<p>
 <p>
 2)	To elaborate a parametrization of the &lt;Chl&gt; vertical profile based on
Zeu and Zml.<p>
 <p>
 3)	To include the latter parametrization into the primary production model of
Morel (1991).<p>
 <p>
 4)	To produce large scale primary production maps for the NorthAtlantic.<p>

<img src="http://me-www.jrc.it/dms/dms.gif" align=top> DMS Model; Introduction
<hr>
</h1>
<big>
Dimethylsulphide (DMS) is an important sulphur-containing trace gas of marine biogenic origin. 
The revised conceptual  model of a marine pelagic food web gives a central role to planktonic bacteria. 
Recent experiments have shown that consumption of dissolved DMS by microbial metabolism may be 
more important than atmospheric exchange in controlling its concentration in surface watwers and 
hence its ventilation to the atmoshere.<P>

In order to analyze the dynamics of DMS production in the upper ocean, a flow network approach 
has been chosen and adapted from the plankton community model of <i>Moloney at al. (1986).</i> 
The present edition (level 1) of the model can be used to investigate the the effect of selected parameters 
on the production of DMSP,DMS in the water column.
<P>
<dl><dl><pre>
             <a href="http://me-www.jrc.it/dms/model.gif"><img src="http://me-www.jrc.it/dms/model.S.gif"></a>        <a href="http://me-www.jrc.it/dms/dms.atmos.gif"><img src="http://me-www.jrc.it/dms/dms.atmos.S.gif"></a>
</pre></dl></dl> 
<p>

The model consists of eight compartments, three of which are abiotic: dissolved inorganic nitrogen, 
DMSP and DMS (see figure 1). The biotic compartments comprise the primary producers 
(generic phytoplankton) and four consumer groups (bacteria, zooflagelates, nonphotosynthetic protozoa 
and micro and mesozooplankton). 
<P>
The model is under on-going development, principally by linking it to satellite ocean colour images 
(CZCS) which are available in the Marine Environment Unit of the Institute 
for Remote Sensing Applications.
<p>
The activity has close links with the Human Capital and Mobility Network <i><a href="http://me-www.jrc.it/dms///www.acri.fr/HCM/index.html">"Integration of remote sensing, in-situ observations and numerical modeling applied to the Northeast Atlantic"</a></i>.

<p>
Presently there is considerable discussion both in scientific and industrial circles as  how best to limit anthropogenic emissions of carbon dioxide due to its role in global atmospheric greenhouse warming. A wide range of technologies are being investigated that increase the efficiency of electrical production, decrease the energy needed to power electrical components, limit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions etc. etc.
</p>
<p>
Under the aegis of National activites, as well as The International Energy Agency  (IEA) Greenhouse Gas Programme,  research  is also being conducted into a broad range of mitigation options and future R&D requirements, including policy and  market implications. A large number of political and industrial considerations  will have to be taken into account if a formulation of global priorities are eventually to be agreed. Whether events will lead to the need for such a formulation is clearly not possible to forecast at present,  it will probably depend on political, social and industrial conditions that might occur if global climatic change were to be demonstrated in an clear and unequivocal manner, and a serious attempt to decrease carbon dioxide emissions were considered necessary.
</p>
<p>
One series of options that have attracted considerable attention are those of separation and disposal of carbon dioxide. Among others these  range from the use of  aquifers, storage combined with enhanced oil recovery, pumping into empty gas reservoirs, and ocean disposal. In the recent IEA international Conference on Greenhouse Gases Mitigation Options (London, August 1995) this latter option was considered a scientifically elegant CO2 mitigation option for the deep ocean in that it accelerates the natural process of transfer of carbon dioxide to the ocean. It was clearly stated, however, that a full understanding of the complex chemical, biological and oceanographic factors has to be acquired before proposing such an option.

Under such conditions what is the potential role of industry, given that the lead times to develop new products is long and costly, and where funding for research is increasingly competitive?  One answer is to contribute to these scientific discussions with ideas that could be perhaps eventually implemented  industrially, and which help maintain and strengthen links between industry and science in the area of Global Change.
</p>
<p>
An example of this type of activity is the work that ACRI has been undertaking concerning the use of solid carbon dioxide penetrators for the disposal of this atmospheric gas in deep ocean sedimentary formations. This idea has been proposed as an industrial patent by the Joint Research Centre, Ispra, Italy. ACRI in collaboration with Ecole Nationale Superieure de Techniques Avancees, Paris, France, has developed a preliminary conceptual design of an industrial disposal system. Some of the more fundamental science considerations have been investigated by the Joint Research Centre, Commission of the European Communities and the Italian aero-space firm Aermacchi. The results of these studies were presented at the recent IEA Greenhouse Gas Conference in London, UK.

<p>
It needs to be clearly stated that under present international legislation (United Nation Convention on the Law Of the Sea UNCLOS, London Dumping Convention etc.) such a disposal option would not be presently permitted. Further, any proposed use of deep sub-seabed geological formations is one that would need a global social consensus which would be unlikely without unequivocal demonstration as to its long term safety and overall benefit to society.
</p>
<p>
However, it needs to be underlined that from a purely technical point of view the proposed solution should, if proven feasible and safe, effectively isolate the carbon dioxide from the overlying ocean waters using the natural barrier properties of the surrounding stable soft clay or carbonate rich sediments. Thus the risk of the eventual return of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere through upwelling of ocean waters can be effectively excluded. Disposal would thus be permanent. A further advantage could be the creation of a waste disposal industry using this type of technology and financed on the polluter-payer principle. The technology appears to be easily within present day carbon dioxide industrial engineering capabilities. Whether in view of the volumes of waste material potentially involved such a solution would be economically viable is clearly at present difficult to assess.
</p>
<p>
As an example of an industrial-scientific contribution to international considerations on possible  mitigation options, the present preliminary studies aim at focusing  discussions on the long-term storage capabilities of deep marine geological formations. Whether this or any other option is eventually considered acceptable or not depends on open discussion by all sectors of society of the advantages and weaknesses of all the alternatives.
